(Episode 8)

3
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,840
The whiteboard.

4
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,950
Is there an exam?

5
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,460
What is this?

6
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,360
Is he not going to teach?

7
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,030
Yeah.

8
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,720
-Hello, Mr. Shen.
-Hello, Mr. Shen.

9
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,830
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello, Mr. Shen.

10
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,950
What does this mean?

11
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,690
Yeah, what does this mean?

12
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
Is this the content for today's exam?

13
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,410
Why is he using a knife?

14
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,470
What is the teacher doing?

15
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,270
Mr. Shen,

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,590
this...

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
is also a painting?

18
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,230
Yes,

19
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,950
this is my imitation of

20
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,829
one of Lúcio Fontana

21
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:39,710
knife-split works.

22
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,020
It's exactly what you guys see,

23
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,530
there is only one split on the canvas.

24
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,230
But later on,

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,760
it was sold at an astronomical price.

26
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,260
-Astronomical price?
-Astronomical price?

27
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,660
Astronomical price...

28
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,430
How much is it?

29
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,520
Do you want to buy it?

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,320
That's not important.

31
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,740
What's important is

32
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,470
how do you guys feel

33
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,570
when you look at this painting?

34
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,420
Tell me.

35
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,360
I think this is

36
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,150
a type of behavior art.

37
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,150
The artist wants to express

38
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,270
negative dissatisfaction.

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,910
What else?

40
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,740
I think Fontana wants to show how

41
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,170
the moment he cuts it,

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,550
the artwork is complete

43
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,440
within a second

44
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,790
which could be

45
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,760
a way of mocking other drawing techniques.

46
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,730
Go on.

47
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,800
Or,

48
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,190
he simply wants the audience

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,050
to pay attention to the black crack.

50
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,570
He's quite funny.

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,740
We all know,

52
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,280
in traditional western painting

53
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,360
it is on this

54
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,660
two-dimensional plane of the canvas

55
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,550
where perspective, light, and shadow

56
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,230
are used to simulate

57
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,900
the depth and relief

58
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,850
of a three-dimensional space.

59
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,870
It can be said that

60
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,470
from the Renaissance

61
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,990
to modern classics,

62
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,140
paintings

63
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,130
have always been an imitation of sculptures.

64
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,870
The cut

65
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,970
on this canvas

66
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,360
transformed this artwork

67
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,360
from being two-dimensional

68
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,000
to three-dimensional.

69
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,350
He opened a new,

70
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,550
unknown world

71
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,140
and in this world,

72
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,850
point, line, plane,

73
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,870
and color

74
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,630
are no longer the only languages used for expression.

75
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,150
The behavior itself,

76
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,500
cracks,

77
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,230
and the audiences' thoughts

78
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,260
are all a part of art.

79
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,500
Then what do you think

80
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,730
this piece is trying to express?

81
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,250
The moment he ripped the canvas,

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,200
Fontana went into

83
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,159
an unknown realm.

84
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,270
He revealed the underlying

85
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,909
truth hidden beneath the surface.

86
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,750
Every crack

87
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,800
and every incision

88
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,670
may be the key

89
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,820
to the truth.

90
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,510
What's wrong?

91
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you sick?

92
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,920
Maybe I caught a cold.

93
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,270
This is my go-to medicine.

94
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,450
Remember to take it on time.

95
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,430
Thank you.

96
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,190
By the way,

97
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,920
Ms. He told me that

98
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,460
you wanted to go to Xuanxuan Restaurant for dinner.

99
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,470
Yes, why?

100
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,750
Why didn't you tell me?

101
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,540
What's the use of telling you?

102
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,830
It's not like you will line up for me.

103
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,409
As long as I'm there,

104
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,950
there's no need to line up.

105
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,770
Why?

106
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,500
Xuanxuan Restaurant

107
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,470
is run by my family.

108
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,230
Really?

109
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,890
You never told me.

110
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,410
What's there to say?

111
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,310
My mom

112
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,100
and some of her best friends

113
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,160
opened it together.

114
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,370
How about

115
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,910
I take you there tonight?

116
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,750
I don't want to trouble you.

117
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,990
How will this trouble me?

118
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,740
The timings perfect,

119
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,230
my mom is there tonight

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,550
so she'll prepare us some

121
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,330
hidden menus

122
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,740
that can't be ordered by others.

123
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,510
Besides,

124
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,110
she always wanted to treat

125
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,460
our police department to a meal.

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,340
Coincidentally,

127
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,510
you want to eat it

128
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,590
and she wants to treat us to dinner,

129
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,240
that's killing two birds with one stone,

130
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,870
right?

131
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,920
Your mom is there too?

132
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,660
It's a deal.

133
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,870
I'll see you tonight at 8PM.

134
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,580
You have to come.

135
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,550

I'm summarizing the Chang Feng case,

140
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,310
and I noticed that you gave Chang Feng

141
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,470
a test using the sand board.

142
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,130
I find it so interesting

143
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,820
and I want to know how to do it.

144
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,690
Do you have time later?

Why don't you come to my office

146

is a psychological projection technology.

154
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,460
If you make abstract things concrete,

155
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,590
it can often express

156
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,510
some psychological information

157
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,050

on the paper

161
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,560
you need to draw out

162
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,460
the three elements:

163
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,320
house, tree and person.

164
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,670

I'll tell you after you're done.

What do these three elements mean?

171
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,480
The house

172
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,540
represents

173
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,000
your relationship with your family

174
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,530
and your attitude towards others.

175
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,490
The tree

176
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,430
represents

177
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,720
your growth,

178
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,490

181
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,990
represents

182

Captain Cheng's house, tree and person

184
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,960
are square and upright.

185
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,480
It gives people a sense of grandeur

186
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,610
and dignity.

187
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,630
I can tell that

188
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,590
Captain Cheng

189
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,190
is a very righteous,

190
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,550
upright,

191
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,330
and proper person.

192
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,700
There should be a plaque here:

193
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,490
'fair and just'.

194
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,400

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,380
I don't think a pencil

197
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,510
can express

198
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,070
my colorful passion.

199
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,640
Mr. Shen,

200
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,600
I did art for three years when I was a kid.

201
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,160
I draw well, right?

202
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,410
Praise me.

203
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,590
It is pretty good.

204
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,350
Your drawing

205
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,740
has a full structure,

206
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,830
and is colorful.

207
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,510
I can tell

208
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,670
that inside,

209
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,700
you are full of emotions,

210
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,830
passionate and sincere,

211
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,400
and a little childlike.

212
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,420
Let me see.

213
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,630
This is like

214
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,110
the drawing level of a kindergartener.

215
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,510
Oh well,

216
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,610
a man is childish till the day he dies.

217
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,110
This is called being a child at heart.

218
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,350
Here, look at mine.

219
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,150
Here.

220
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,050
You...

221
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,320
can I publicly reveal

222
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,110
the meaning behind your drawing?

223
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,910
Of course,

224
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,390
say it.

225
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,070
You...

226
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,140
seem to be heartbroken.

227
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,930
Heartbroken?

228
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,250
You...

229
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,640
broke up?

230
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,870
Yeah,

231
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,880
I broke up.

232
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,010
Can't I?

233
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,890
What's wrong with breaking up? Is it weird?

234
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,250
Should I not break up

235
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,330
or should I not be in a relationship?

236
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,660
You should...

237
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,650
No, I don't mean you deserve it.

238
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,120
I mean... I mean I deserve it.

239
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,870
No, I... I... I...

240
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,670
What's the use of me deserving it?

241
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,910
No, I... I...

242
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,500
He...

243
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,720
Who... who is he?

244
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,320
An online friend.

245
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,370
I met him in person because of love.

246
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,380
You know, every day

247
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,990
in this office,

248
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,160
I either look at corpses

249
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,150
or you guys.

250
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,840
I can only watch short videos of

251
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,230
the process of repairing donkey hoofs

252
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,080
to relieve some stress.

253
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,800
We met

254
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,080
in the comment section.

255
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,280
Then why did you guys break up?

256
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,080
Happy breakup.

257
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,230
I'm talking about my hands.

258
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,460
He said that

259
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,170
me touching dead bodies at work

260
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,760
and then holding his hands after work

261
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,740
creeps him out.

262
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,970
These are such holy hands.

263
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,150
He doesn't know how to cherish them.

264
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,230
He has eyes but he's blind.

265
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,250
I often watch

266
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,760
videos repairing donkey hoofs, too.

267
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,960
It's relaxing.

268
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,810
But I never leave comments.

269
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,670
I need someone

270
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,590
who can understand

271
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,310
my job,

272
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,720
be proud of me,

273
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,190
and motivate me.

274
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,860
So it's okay.

275
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,710
He's not that kind of person.

276
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,910
Okay.

277
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,350
Your house, tree and people

278
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,670
are quite constructive.

279
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,620
You drew a building,

280
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,470
this means you have a high IQ.

281
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,860
The trees are rich

282
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,910
and full of vitality

283
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,710
meaning

284
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,580
you subconsciously pursue development

285
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,960
and career growth.

286
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,760
Do you see that, boss?

287
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,270
I'm very ambitious.

288
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,870
Captain Cheng,

289
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,440
I have something to do later

290
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,520
can I leave first?

291
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,380
Sure.

292
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,530
What did you draw?

293
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,980
Why didn't you draw anything?

294
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,100
It's blank.

295
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,670
Melt the butter using indirect heat...

296
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,230
It's melted.

297
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,550
Add two eggs...

298
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,540
200 grams of flour...

299
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,670
The fire seems too strong.

300
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,390
Make it smaller...

301
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,820
Flour...

302
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,090
There's a fire!

303
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,210
There's a lot of smoke!

304
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,150
Call the police!

305
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,800
Hurry, hurry!

306
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,350
Hello?

307
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,480
Is this 119?

308
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,540
Yes, yes, yes.

309
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,650
The fire in Xincheng Community in Beijiang

310
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,720
was caused by the dust explosion.

311
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,770
When we arrived,

312
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,430
the owner had already put out the fire

313
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,170
and the source has been removed.

314
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,200
We are ready

315
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,980
to wrap up

316
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,790
and leave the scene.

317
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,700
What caused the fire?

318
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,470
I was

319
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,580
baking cookies

320
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
and then...

321
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,940
Didn't you notice when we evacuated?

322
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,430
Why is there someone live streaming?

323
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,240
This is Beijiang's Xincheng Community.

324
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,720
One of our neighbor's house caught on fire

325
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:43,950
(Live)
One of our neighbor's house caught on fire

326
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,030
(Live)

327
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,990
and the firefighters are here.
(Live)

328
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,110
Let me show you guys.

329
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,990
How did such a house

330
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,600
become a garbage station?

331
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,630
Why did this girl

332
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,550
pile up so much junk?

333
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,870
How does she live?

334
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,210
I didn't even know we had such a dangerous neighbor.

335
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,350
I can't believe we live next door to her.

336
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,080
Stop filming.

337
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,840
We are clearing the place.

338
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,940
Stop filming the scene.

339
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,220
I have to,

340
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,310
look at this house.

341
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,450
We are not done cleaning up yet,

342
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,310
please cooperate with us.

343
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,190
It's so dangerous to live above or below her.

344
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,510
Stop filming! Stop filming!

345
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,580
Don't you know this is an invasion of privacy?

346
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,350
Girls nowadays

347
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,350
look proper and clean on the outside,

348
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,370
yet their houses

349
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,320
are such a mess.

350
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,590
Everyone, don't block the way,

351
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,740
please cooperate with us, okay?

352
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,790
Don't block the passage,

353
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,340
okay?

354
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,720
Excuse me, stop filming.

355
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,730
Excuse me.

356
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,410
Move aside, move aside.

357
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,340
Step back, step back.

358
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,580
Please stop filming, stop filming!

359
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,950
That's enough!

360
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,960
Stop talking.

361
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,550
It's too messy.

362
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,110
Let's head down.

363
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,660
It's not safe.

364
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,270
Go down.

365
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,690
Let's go downstairs, okay?

366
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,760
Are you okay?

367
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm fine.

368
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,380
I heard that Beijiang's Xincheng is on fire

369
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,910
and I couldn't reach you

370
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,940
so I was worried.

371
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,860
I didn't expect it to really be your house.

372
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,970
Are you sure you're okay?

373
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,100
Don't lie to me.

374
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,320
If you feel unwell,

375
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,030
tell me.

376
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm fine.

377
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,820
But

378
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,870
I won't be able to go have dinner tonight.

379
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,420
Please let your mom know for me,

380
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,500
I'm really sorry.

381
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,980
This is nothing.

382
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,430
But with your current situation,

383
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,790
can you still live in this community?

384
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,550
These aunts...

385
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,230
For the next few days

386
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,970
the neighbors will definitely talk about it.

387
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,770
You can't live in your house at the moment either.

388
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,030
How about I find you a place

389
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,910
to stay for a while?

390
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,570
But...

391
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,960
what if the firefighters come looking for me?

392
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,020
How about this?

393
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,910
Tell me

394
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,990
the password to your house

395
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,430
and if the firefighters come looking for you,

396
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,440
let me know.

397
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,620
I'll take care of it for you

398
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,950
and help you clean up.

399
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,950
You don't need to help me clean,

400
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,480
I can do it myself.

401
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,220
You don't need to worry.

402
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:44,910
Okay.

403
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,270
Thank you.

404
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,790
It's so late, why are you still here?

405
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,100
I still have some things to do.

406
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,510
Why did you give us

407
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,100
that test today?

408
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,400
You can express a lot of things through drawing.

409
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,320
Air,

410
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,860
sound,

411
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,280
scent,

412
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,700
emotions.

413
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,940
These can all be expressed through colors.

414
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,520
People's hearts can be expressed, too.

415
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,090
Behavior is the expression of one's mind.

416
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,099
In criminal psychology, the process of internalization and externalization,

417
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,790
quantity change,

418
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,589
and self-defense mechanisms

419
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,550
can all be traced

420
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,430
back to the criminal's

421
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,349
upbringing

422
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,349
and social behaviors.

423
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,349
It is also projected onto

424
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,270
their entire lives.

425
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,450
Are you not sleeping well again?

426
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,510
Did the red dress

427
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,290
come find you again?

428
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,960
That's why I've been thinking,

429
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,890
if

430
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,710
I can use drawing and colors

431
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,670
to express

432
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,170
and control the criminal personality,

433
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,160
then maybe in the future

434
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,910
I can predict

435
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,820
an unprecedented case.

436
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,850
Shen Yi,

437
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,890
it's all in the past,

438
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,650
don't push yourself too hard.

439
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,350
Sometimes pain

440
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,200
is created by ourselves.

441
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,170
You should go home and rest.

442
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,270
What's wrong?

443
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,290
Li Han's house is on fire?

444
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,340
Is she okay?

445
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,470
Okay.

446
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,830
Hurry and go have a look.

447
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,890
Listen,

448
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,790
the case I was working on...

449
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,690
Aren't you going to go help Li Han clean up?

450
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,230
No need.

451
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,620
You even made a decision for her.

452
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,830
What are you talking about?

453
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,070
It's good for her

454
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,840
to live in the dormitory for a while.

455
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,190
She’s quite busy recently.

475

Morning!

476
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,430
Everyone's here early.

477
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,370
Am I late?

478
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,990
Li Han,

479
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,550
how's the investigation on the suicide website going?

480
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,070
Almost done.

481
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,760
Let me report it to you all.

482
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,030
In the Tian Keng case,

483
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,790
we found

484
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,150
a Suicide Valley

485
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,210
and through that

486
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,430
we discovered

487
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,610
a suicide website called Butterfly.

488
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,380
According to the feedback of the family members,

489
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,390
they suspect that through this website,

490
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,030
someone is deliberately leading the suicide.

491
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,030
Therefore, I applied

492
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,290
a weeks time

493
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,430
to enter

494
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,910
the Butterfly's group chat.

495
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,600
After seven days,

496
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,370
I noticed that the group is mostly

497
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,000
made up of disheartened people seeking comfort.

498
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,790
I didn't find

499
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,290
anyone suspicious who might be leading the suicide.

500
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,820
Among them there was an underage individual

501
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,790
who's guardians

502
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,920
I already contacted separately.

503
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,070
The website

504
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,140
should be shut down by today.

506
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,450
Someone added me.
(Da Vinci requests to be friends)

507
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,530
Not someone from the suicide group,

508
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,950
but an unknown account.

509
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,230
But I made this QQ account

510
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,980
specifically to undercover for this case.

511
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,430
Logically speaking,

512
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,990
it can only be found through the Butterfly website.

513
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:53,980
Not necessarily.

514
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,070
There are people

515
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,150
who just add friends randomly.

516
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,580
Since he already added you,

517
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,870
try talking to him first.

518
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,060
Li Han?

519
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,720
Okay.

520
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,310

00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,590
I saw the post

529

You...

542
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,030
feel helpless, right?

543
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,030
Why do you say that?

544
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,990
From the house, tree and people drawing you uploaded,

545
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,710
your house is big

546
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,820

floating alone in the air

548
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,950
like both a fortress

549
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,290
and a prison.

550
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,140
Yet the person is busy

551
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,380
and watching from the side.

552
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,030
What about the tree?

553
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,930
Have you heard of the saying that

554
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,950
some parents' love

555
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,390
are always given at a moderate amount.

556
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,310
It's not so much that

557
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,710
the child is able to grow up happy and healthy,

558
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,830
and not so little that

559
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,870
the child grows up to be unfilial

560
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,470
and abandons his parents.

561
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,020
Not too much and not too little.

562
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,710
Enough to make the child

563
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,170
suffer.

No I wasn't.

569
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,580
What are you doing sitting here?

570
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,270

It's nothing.

574
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,190
I'll go to the bathroom then.

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,150
-Good morning.
-Morning.

578
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,780
You...

579
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,300
don't just focus on work.

580
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,260
Thank you for your concern, Director Zhang.

581
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,870
I'm not concerned about you,

582
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,950
I just want you to care more for

583
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,030
your subordinate.

584
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,060
Do I not care about you?

585
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,150
She's talking about Li Han.

586
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,260
Look at her,

587
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,670
she clearly has something on her mind,

588
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,750
can't you ask her?

589
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,060
With your brain,

590
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,380
how can I promote you?

591
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,190
I also think Li Han

592
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,550
hasn't been in a good state lately.

593
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,740
Why do you all feel this way?

594
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,040
Something like this happened at home,

595
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,270
it's normal

596
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:13,990
for her to be emotional.

597
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,170
Maybe it's more than that.

598
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,190
I'm worried that

599
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,270
maybe she was exposed to too much

600
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,830
negativity

601
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,950
while doing under cover in the suicide group.

602
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:22,910
Director Zhang–

603
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,550
Captain Cheng!

604
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,490
Mr. Shen...

605
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,570
Something is wrong with that Da Vinci.

606
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,270
It's alright,

607
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,300
sit down and tell me.

608
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,200
Yesterday, I noticed that

609
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,430
in the group chat

610
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,160
on the butterfly website

611
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,430
someone

612
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,640
uploaded

613
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,990
a picture of the house, tree, man.

614
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,310
He said

615
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,750
his psychiatrist asked him to draw it.

616
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,220
Then, someone in the group said

617
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,270
psychologists are liars.

618
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,430
I felt something was wrong

619
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,400
so I uploaded my own

620
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,430
drawing.

621
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,670
This is our chat history.

622
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,960
I went to see the doctor

623
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,420
and he asked me to draw a house, tree and man.

624
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,870
Then he told me that in my heart

625
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,160
I drew myself too big.

626
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,950
That I was paying too much attention to my feelings

627
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,110
and that's why I get depressed easily.

628
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,780
Yes, psychologists are liars.

629
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,240
I drew the house, tree, man today as well.

630
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,990
The starry sky...

631
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,630
is you.

632
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,240
Not long after,

633
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,100
Da Vinci

634
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,330
added me as a friend.

635
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,560
He said he's a psychologist

636
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,810
but I found out that he only

637
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,920
persuades people to be positive on the surface,

638
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,590
and has been

639
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,160
pushing negative psychological hints onto me.

640
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,280
He would bring up

641
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,890
topics like suicide

642
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,310
from time to time.

643
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,680
Sometimes,

644
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,580
I can't communicate with my family.

645
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,300
I'm really frustrated.

646
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,100
Many parents

647
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,640
force their idea of achievements

648
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,710
and success

649
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,790
onto their children

650
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,390
and teach them

651
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,390
to repay them

652
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,430
for everything.

653
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,910
This causes the child

654
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,510
to feel a deep sense of guilt,

655
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,970
in which the parents use to suppress

656
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,500
and control them.

657
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,250
Then how can I change them?

658
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,250
Aside from disappearing,

659
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,690
and making the parents regret,

660
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,270
nothing can change them.

661
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,390
(Da Vinci)
nothing can change them.

662
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,900
(Da Vinci)

663
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:17,950
You...

664
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,890
talked so much with him?

665
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,830
Were you telling the truth?

666
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,340
It's for work.

667
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,680
He's controlling you mentally.

668
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,670
I also think there's something wrong with him

669
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,370
so I found a way

670
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,120
to check his friends list

671
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
and chat histories.

672
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,900
He has a dozen of friends

673
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,380
but the ones he contacted recently

674
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,430
apart from me

675
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,910
are the four people up there.

676
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,570
His conversations he had with these four people

677
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,440
contain a lot of

678
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,920
topic on death.

679
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,430
They even went through

680
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,190
suicide methods.

681
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,550
So I want to apply

682
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,790
to do a psychological intervention

683
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,710
on these four people.

684
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,310
Okay.

685
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,780
Inform their family

686
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,630
and the local police station.

687
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,430
Okay.

688
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,240
Li Han,

689
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,220
are you okay?

690
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,260
I'm fine.

691
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,420
Da Vinci created a separate group chat

692
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,230
with two people.

693
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,680
He's persuading them

694
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,230
to commit suicide together.

695
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,480
When?

696
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,020
Today.

697
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,230
Can you find

698
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,110
more information on those two people?

699
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,950
One is called Spring Light Music.

700
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,110
His real name is Luo Yuchen.

701
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,760
The address is not far from here.

702
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,990
The other one is called

703
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,490
Setting Sun.

704
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,360
He's in Jiangnan District.

705
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,310
Send me

706
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:04,980
Luo Yuchen's address.

707
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,860
I'll go take a look.

708
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,820
Send Sunset Sun to Jiang Feng,

709
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,510
let him go.

710
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,490
Okay.

711
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,510
Mr. Shen,

712
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,460
I'll get back to work.

713
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,380
Luo Yuchen.

714
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,800
Li Han,

715
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,920
I've arrived

716
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,140
at the address you mentioned.

717
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,350
(The camera is on) (Hang up)

718
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,310
Let me show you the environment.
(The camera is on) (Hang up)

719
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,710
(The camera is on) (Hang up)

720
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:20,280
(The camera is on.) (Hang up.)

721
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,290
(Tae Jaechi)

722
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,570
I have a dream.
(Tae Jaechi)

723
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,310
(Tae Jaechi)

724
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,290
You're there,
(Tae Jaechi)

725
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,430
and so am I.

726
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,910
There is also our death.

727
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,940
My life is very simple.

728
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,210
I hunt and kill chicken.

729
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,680
(The camera is on) (Hang up)

730
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,850
People hunt me.
(The camera is on) (Hang up)

731
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,700
(The camera is on) (Hang up)

732
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,730
All chickens are the same.

733
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,270
Every person is the same.

734
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,410
Yet why do I have to live?

735
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,010
This question is like a shadow.

736
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,980
I can't get rid of it.

737
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,430
(The camera is on) (Hang up)

738
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,910
I want darkness.
(The camera is on) (Hang up)

739
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,150
Not the kind

740
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,330
that gets stabbed by light.

741
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,470
(The camera is on.) (Hang up.)

742
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,710
How is it?

743
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,120
Did you save her?

744
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,590
We saved her.

745
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,990
She's still in the ICU.

746
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,950
The way she committed suicide

747
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,710
is different from other people.

748
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,350
The wound is V-shape.

749
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,510
This type of wound is deep,

750
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,630
and bleeds fast

751
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,380
making it hard to suture.

752
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,240
Usually people

753
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,430
wouldn't use this method for suicide.

754
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,670
Someone must be guiding her.

755
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,380
No one's here.

756
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,150
I've already contacted

757
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,060
his family members.

758
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,010
His family is trying to find him.

759
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,110
If there is any news,

760
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,150
I'll let you know immediately.

761
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,550
Okay.

762
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,340
Why do I have to live?

763
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,850
This question is like a shadow.

764
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,430
Existence

765
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,670
is humanism.

766
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,920
Life is ridiculous and painful.

767
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,150
(Beijiang Branch, Beijiang City Public Security Bureau)

768
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,190
I asked the technical team to track

769
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,150
Da Vinci's IP address

770
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,750
and found out it's a virtual number

771
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,990
that acts as a substitute

772
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,540
jumping around various countries.

773
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,050
He might be an expert.

774
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,350
It's easy to register

775
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,300
this type of number.

776
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,150
Once it's blocked,

777
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,630
a new one can be registered immediately.

778
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,790
How is Li Han?

779
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,910
She's got frightened

780
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,040
and her excessive breathing

781
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,050
caused her respiratory alkaline poisoning.

782
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,270
Ms. He is in the hospital

783
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,450
with her.

784
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,830
The doctor said she's fine.

785
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,230
That's good.

786
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,510
No,

787
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,570
it's not that simple.

788
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,590
I've been thinking about

789
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,510
Li Han's state

790
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,830
and her drawing.

791
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,070
She must have

792
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,060
something going on.

793
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,000
Something that didn't just happen recently.

794
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,240
Then why did it explode suddenly?

795
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,670
So I was thinking

796
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,840
what happened

797
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,350
after her house was set on fire?

798
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,640
Something must have happened.

799
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,949
If Li Han asks,

800
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,489
don't tell her that I said it.

801
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,179
See for yourselves.

802
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,190
What a nice house.

803
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,820
How did it become a garbage station?

804
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,909
Why did this girl

805
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:19,989
pile up so much junk?

806
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:20,780
What happened?

807
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,360
I can't believe I'm living next door

808
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,590
to such a dangerous neighbor.

809
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,420
Stop filming.

810
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,170
Clear the space.

811
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,190
Don't film the scene.

812
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,440
What happened?

813
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,260
I think I know what's bothering her.

814
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,090
How is it?

815
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,980
I drew Li Han.

816
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,350
Why are there two Li Han?

817
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,830
In the videos online,

818
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,990
I saw a lot of

819
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,270
things that should've been thrown away

820
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,500
or sold.

821
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,660
It is opposite to

822
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,870
how she looks

823
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,710
on the outside.

824
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,660
This behavior

825
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,680
is like an old man.

826
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,740
Old people in that era

827
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,460
had difficult living conditions

828
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,150
so they would try to save up as much as possible.

829
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,400
Speaking of which,

830
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,480
Li Han seems to have grown up

831
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,950
with her grandmother.

832
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,790
No wonder,

833
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,990
on her sofa,

834
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,140
there is a hand-sewn

835
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,000
panda.

836
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,390
Pandas, you know?

837
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,070
I know.

838
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,550
Just...

839
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,930
a panda

840
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,910
dressed up as a swordsman?

841
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,510
Or is it a hero

842
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,630
dressed up as a panda?

843
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,620
Forget it.

844
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,830
I forgot that you and Li Han

845
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,120
are not from the same era.

846
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,320
It's okay.

847
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,550
It's just a

848
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,270
toy panda

849
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,150
that can be bought anywhere.

850
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,880
Yet Li Han's panda

851
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,830
was made out of

852
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,250
old clothes sewn together.

853
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,350
Her grandma

854
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,160
probably made it for her.

855
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,270
So her grandmother loved her very much.

856
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,810
She wanted to

857
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,040
make one for her personally.

858
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,790
That's normal.

859
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,330
There's another possibility.

860
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,820
While other kids

861
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,910
showed off

862
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,270
their authentic pandas,

863
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,530
this knock-off Panda

864
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,640
probably caused her inferiority complex.

865
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,350
So I made a assumption.

866
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,450
Li Han

867
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,410
may have secretly sworn that

868
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,010
one day when she is capable,

869
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,550
she must give herself

870
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,700
a bad life.

871
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,180
I'm so tired.

872
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,990
Let's order some coffee.

873
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,030
I'm so tired today,

874
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,010
I bought a cup of raw coconut latte.

875
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,170
It tastes pretty good.

876
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,160
Why don't you just make one yourself?

877
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,790
I refuse low-quality life.

878
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,350
This bag is pretty nice.

879
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,280
But childhood habits like this

880
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,650
where things can't be thrown away

881
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,590
as long as it's not worn out

882
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,460
has been deeply implanted.

883
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,060
In the end,

884
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,840
the less she wants,

885
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,960
the more she makes the same mistake.

886
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,490
Gradually,

887
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,150
she started to hoard

888
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,310
like her grandma.

889
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,270
Li Han's love of hoarding

890
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,880
seems to have been stemmed

891
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,070
from her

892
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,110
childhood trauma.

893
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,950
In Li Han's heart,

894
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,030
this became a thorn.

895
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,560
And this thorn

896
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,430
was suddenly

897
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,830
exposed in front of everyone.

898
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,700
The comments

899
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,310
filled with sarcasm and criticism

900
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,660
once again revealed

901
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,910
the scar in her heart.

902
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,750
Right at this time,

903
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,060
Da Vinci took advantage of it.

904
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,910
Here's the salmon you ordered.

905
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,540
Enjoy.

906
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,250
Thank you.

907
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,190
Xuanxuan Restaurant has lived up to its reputation.

908
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,390
You should have told me

909
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,780
you liked this restaurant.

910
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,110
Well now you know.

911
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,620
This is our family's restaurant.

912
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,050
You can come

913
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,040
whenever you want.

914
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,710
No need to line up.

915
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,780
Don't just take photos,

916
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,760
hurry and try it.

917
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:09,990
Here.

918
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,030
How is it?

919
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,880
Delicious!

920
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,660
Eat more.

921
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:20,790
By the way,

922
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,500
I have good news.

923
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,780
Do you remember the one who cut her wrist?

924
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,470
Luo Yuchen, right?

925
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,230
The hospital contacted me

926
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,830
and told me she's no longer in danger

927
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,130
and was transferred to a general ward.

928
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,430
Really?

929
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,980
That's great.

930
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,310
I hope

931
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,820
she can pull herself together

932
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,560
and forget what those bad guys said.

933
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,020
You too.

934
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,070
Grilled pigeon.

935
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,710
Enjoy.

936
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,180
Mom.

937
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,590
My eldest son!

938
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,740
Auntie.

939
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,920
My name is Li Han,

940
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,550
I'm Jiang Feng's colleague.

941
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,360
I heard a lot about you from my son.

942
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,490
Have a seat!

943
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,830
How is it?

944
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,430
Is it good?

945
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,110
I hope I didn't ruin

946
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:04,910
your expectation towards Xuanxuan Restaurant.

947
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,080
Of course not.

948
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,220
By the way auntie,

949
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,580
this is a small gift for you.

950
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,730
There are cookies inside.

951
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,110
I wanted to

952
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,350
make them for you myself

953
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,760
but it failed.

954
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,670
But this shop is also very famous.

955
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,410
Please try it.

956
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,390
Look at you,

957
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,180
you even brought me a gift.

958
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,270
I heard

959
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,670
your house caught on fire

960
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,140
because you were making cookies for me.

961
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,030
I feel really bad

962
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,350
about it.

963
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,200
I only told her it caught on fire.

964
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,190
I didn't say anything else.

965
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,070
Did you see the video

966
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,830
I just sent you?

967
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,120
I think I saw your son

968
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,820
at the end of it.

969
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,910
What a nice house.

970
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,580
How did it become a garbage station?

971
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,750
Why did this girl

972
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,780
pile up so much junk?

973
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,840
How does she live?

974
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,390
Mom,

975
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,190
can you turn your phone

976
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,310
to silent mode?

977
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,470
Why are you playing it so loudly?

978
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,950
Sorry... something came up...

979
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,900
I have to go...

980
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,730
Li Han.

981
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,450
Don't take it to heart,

982
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,100
I don't even care about it,

983
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,040
really.

984
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,190
A girl

985
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,630
just needs to look clean and proper when outside.

986
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,390
It's not that big of a deal,

987
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,840
if you don't want that place anymore

988
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,630
you can stay at my place.

989
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,750
I care a lot about hygiene

990
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,910
I'll clean your room every day.

991
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,000
You will definitely be able to get rid of

992
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,910
those bad habits.

993
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,620
Mom!

994
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,190
Can you stop talking?

995
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,630
I...

996
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,330
I'm sorry.

997
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,910
Haven't you said enough?

998
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,380
It's my own problem.

999
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,530
I'm sorry.

1000
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,710
I didn't expect the neighbors

1001
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,960
to take pictures of you.

1002
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,860
I'll go find her

1003
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,470
and ask her to delete the video.

1004
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,830
It's already been taken

1005
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,260
and it's not like I'm afraid they'll see it.

1006
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,510
We just like to save things.

1007
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,070
So what if everyone knows?

1008
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,390
It's not embarrassing.

1009
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:45,950
Yes...

1010
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,260
Aunt,

1011
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,590
I really have something to do. I have to go.

1012
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,370
Xuan Xuan.

1013
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,930
Who is it?

1014
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,080
Shen Yi.

1015
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,510
Excuse me.

1016
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,760
I...

1017
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,030
Can I come in?

1018
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,210
Do I need to change my shoes?

1019
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,470
Come on in.

1020
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,030
Now you all know

1021
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,150
my secret.

1022
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,510
I'm pathetic, right?

1023
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,710
You're too nervous, Li Han.

1024
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,550
I don't think so.

1025
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,510
What's pathetic about this?

1026
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,230
Everyone has secrets.

1027
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,030
I do, too.

1028
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,150
It's not a big deal.

1029
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,190
But some secrets

1030
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,540
are meant to be kept a secret.

1031
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:32,750
Is it...

1032
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,910
a secret about your grandma?
