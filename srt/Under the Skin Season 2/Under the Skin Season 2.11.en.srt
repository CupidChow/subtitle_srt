00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,830

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,790
arson case files.

7
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,830
Okay.

8
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,640
Hold on.

9
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,690
I almost forgot.

10
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,010
The branch office set new rules.

11
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,590
Captain Cheng needs to sign for you

12
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,790
before I give you the files.

13
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,350

You left it empty.

29
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,829
Just…

30
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,220
for research.

31
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,470
What's there to research?

32
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:00,950
The three of them

33
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,030
have been cleared of suspicion.

34
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,670
I just want to know

35
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,070
more specific details

36
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,730
about the arson case.

37
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,190
You can have your speculations

38
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,649
and conduct your research.

39
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,570
I support that.

40
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,040
But we're investigating

41
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,950
the Dong Yidan case now,

42
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,079
not the arson case.

(Signature of the Head of the Application Filing Department: Zhang Xiaoping)

48
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,330
Thank you, Director Zhang.

49
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,150
I think this case

50
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,870
is a great choice.

51
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,290
Which one of the three

52
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,090
was the mastermind behind the arson case?

53
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,790
Why did this tragedy occur?

54
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,400
The public discussion at that time

55
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,640
was quite intense.

56
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,030
Crime experts from the Public Security University

57
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,400
also made comments about it.

58
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,270
But no one has ever proposed

59
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,410
approaching the analysis of criminals

60
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
from the perspective of art and psychotherapy.

61
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,070
I believe in your sensitivity to people,

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,560
and your

63
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,670
exploration of the Human Nature Atlas

64
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,370
is also very pioneering.

65
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,710
If you could further

66
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,060
develop it into

67
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,870
a set of sample models,

68
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,170
it might open up

69
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,510
a new approach

70
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,810
to our criminal investigation work.

71
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,590
I'll try my best,

72
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,930
but I'm not sure

73
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,270
if it'll work out.

74
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,210
Keep up the good work.

75
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,310
You can make it.

76
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,790
Later, I'll apply for

77
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,950
some funding for you

78
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,690
specifically for this project.

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,370
What do you think?

80
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,070
That's great!

81
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you, Director Zhang.

82
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,430
Shen Yi…

83
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,870
He has a good reason.

84
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,720
He needs those case files

85
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,920
to explore

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,750
the Human Nature Atlas.

87
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,060
That's good.

88
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,940
We should support him.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,720
How could you

90
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,670
reject him because of a form?

91
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,740
I didn't reject him.

92
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,910
He needs a reason for requesting case files.

93
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,230
That's the rule.

94
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,920
He didn't give me any reason.

95
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,780
When I asked him, he didn't say anything.

96
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,240
How could I sign for him?

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,830
When he came here

98
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,270
to present his research,

99
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,610
he spoke for half an hour.

100
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,430
Impatient as you are,

101
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,070
I doubt you could sit through his speech.

102
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,550
My patience could last as long as his speech!

103
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,310
Fine.

104
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,060
I'll assume you were just being responsible

105
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,130
and let it slide.

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,470
But next time,

107
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,870
when Shen Yi turns to you again,

108
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,250
can you not be so petty?

109
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,580
I'm not pe…

110
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,330
Fine.

111

(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

112
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,270
Director Zhang just called me

113
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,310
to her office.

114
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,530
She praised me

115
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,070
for being responsible

116
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,110
with case files.

117
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,670
I know.

118
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,510
You're afraid if I dig

119
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,390
too deep into the case,

120
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,010
my judgment will be clouded,

121
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,200
and I'll be affected.

122
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,750
I didn't mean to give you a hard time

123
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,240
by not signing for you.

124
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,230
And I certainly won't stop you

125
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,890
from doing the research you want to do.

126
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,310
But can't you explain to me

127
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,040
what exactly you want to do?

128
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,100
Don't go over my head to Director Zhang, okay?

129
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,409
If I told you,

130
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,600
would you understand?

131
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,630
I…

132
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,580
would try to understand.

133
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,900
Wait.

134
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,950
How did Director Zhang praise you?

135
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,510
She…

136
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,290
She said I have a big heart!

137
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,720
She also said I'm...

138
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,050
What was it again?

139
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,710
She praised me for so long.

140
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,940
I can't even remember it all.

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,080
A lot of compliments.

147

The taxi driver has also confirmed

148
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,220
that Dong Yidan put her in a taxi,

149
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,780
and the taxi took her straight home.

150
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,039
One of them must be lying.

151
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,720
Song Minjie was the one

who brought the fire victims' families together,

153
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,080

didn't find anything.

189
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,690
You're taking revenge on me.

190
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,840
You might as well kill me too.

191
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,120
It's all in the past.

192
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,220
Today,

193
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,520
I've thought a lot.

194
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,540
I've been

195
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,720
punishing myself…

196
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,870
and wouldn't let you go.

197
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,150
If only

198
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,590
I had

199
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,300
listened to you.

200
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,220
Go now.

201
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,560
Do as I say.

202
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,450
Go now.

203
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,600
Do as I say!

204
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,890
I'm tired.

205
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,780
We slept in each other's arms.

206
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,770
It had been eight years.

207
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,150
For the first time, I had a peaceful sleep.

208
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,430
What happened next?

209
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,620
When I woke up,

210
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
he was already gone.

211
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,950
He left me a note.

212
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,650
He said,

213
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,150
"There has been too much pain in this life.

214
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,810
I hope in the next life,

215
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,520
God

216
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,990
will be kinder to us."

217
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,030
Where is Wang Hao now?

218
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,280
Wang Hao!

219
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,710
Wang Hao.

220
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,130
Don't do anything rash.

221
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,710
Why did you kill Dong Yidan?

222
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,020
That day,

223
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,200
I overheard

224
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,070
her planning to meet Dong Yidan again,

225
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,270
so I followed her.

226
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,790
I brought a knife with me.

227
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,340
Aren't you afraid Wang Hao

228
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,830
will come after you for revenge?

229
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,730
Not for a second.

230
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,010
At that moment, I decided

231
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,570
to drag him to hell with me.

232
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,750
Dong Yidan!

233
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,620
Bastard!

234
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,820
Wang Hao.

235
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,760
Kill me if you dare.

236
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,890
Otherwise,

237
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,020
you're finished.

238
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,900
You think I don't dare…

239
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,190
to kill you, huh?

240
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,190
Bring it on.

241
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,520
Here, stab me here.

242
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,210
Do it.

243
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,060
Right here.

244
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,650
If you really wanted to kill me,

245
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,350
would you have waited until now?

246
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,140
You coward!

247
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,390
It's all just because

248
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,490
I know the fatal secrets of you

249
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,260
and your wife.

250
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,880
I also know about your dead son.

251
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm calling the police to arrest you.

252
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,120
Don't call the police.

253
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,860
Don't call the police!

254
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,860
Don't call the police.

255
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,700
Wang Hao!

256
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,470
You...

257
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,340
Wang Hao.

258
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,100
You can't call the police.

259
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,870
Wang Hao.

260
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,880
You... you bastard.

261
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,010
Wang Hao.

262
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,410
Good.

263
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,230
Wang Hao, you know what?

264
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,570
Your wife

265
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,820
felt pretty good.

266
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,680
You coward!

267
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,870
You wimp!

268
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,390
Dong Yidan!

269
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,080
When I calmed down,

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,350
Dong Yidan was already dead.

271
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,150
I knew

272
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,700
my life was about to end too.

273
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,880
But what about my wife?

274
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,860
What would happen to her?

275
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,060
I couldn't let anyone know

276
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,830
about her affair with that scumbag.

277
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,960
So I

278
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,070
wiped away all the fingerprints,

279
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,370
dumped all the bedsheets,

280
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,810
and cleaned the floor.

281
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,630
But…

282
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,260
I didn't expect there was a hidden voice recorder,

283
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,120
and you found it.

284
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,950
At a moment like that,

285
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,400
you still tried to protect your wife.

286
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,400
It shows you care for her.

287
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,550
Then why did you

288
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,430
torment her for so many years?

289
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,160
I tormented her?

290
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,950
What about those who tormented me?

291
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,589
Who tormented you?

292
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,400
Those three kids.

293
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,790
They burned my son to death,

294
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,869
yet they were released

295
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,420
to go on with their lives.

296
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,090
I can't understand it.

297
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,590
It's unfair.

298
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,710
Unfair

299
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,750
Was it worth it?

300
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,880
Because you couldn't let go of your obsession,

301
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,950
you led yourself

302
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,270
down a path of no return.

303
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,650
The moment Dong Yidan died,

304
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,270
I woke up.

305
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,080
All the resentment

306
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,570
and grudges

307
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,170
were gone.

308
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,520
I had no strength left too.

309
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,310
I know…

310
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,230
I ruined everything.

311
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,470
I wouldn't

312
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,590
let them go…

313
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,350
but in the end, I didn't let myself go either.

314
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,980
(Criminal Investigation Dossier; Litigation Document Volume)

315
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,750
The internet cafe in the arson case

316
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,010
was operating illegally

317
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,490
and didn't meet fire safety standards.

318
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,110
The owner often closed it down

319
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,170
to avoid inspections.

320
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,400
Everyone around knew about it.

321
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,880
Given the circumstances back then,

322
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,180
it seems the owner tried to open the door,

323
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,760
but it was too late.

324
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,050
The fire was too big.

325
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,610
So…

326
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,160
Did anyone see the owner lock the door?

327
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,670
No.

328
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,120
It's written here.

329
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,950
Here.

330
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,690
The fire occurred around midnight.

331
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,510
The shops nearby had already closed.

332
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,270
By the time firefighters arrived,

333
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,400
it was too late.

334
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,910
The people inside died from suffocation

335
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,150
resulting from smoke inhalation.

336
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,430
As for the cause of the fire,

337
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,330
it was determined that

338
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,430
the three suspects deliberately poured gasoline

339
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,950
at the entrance

340
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,730
and ignited flammable materials.

341
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,310
This set fire to the carpet and decorative materials,

342
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,910
causing the fire to spread from the hallway

343
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,430
into the internet cafe.

The owner's wife left before the fire?

347
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,670
She should be quite familiar

348
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,310
with the situation.

349
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,690
Can you contact her?

350
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,550
Yes.

351
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,060
What's the problem?

352
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,310
Mr. Shen,

353
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,390
if you want to talk to her,

354
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,880
you'd better

355
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,980
get approval first.

356
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,670
Alright.

357
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,230
I'll be going then.

358
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,830
Okay, thank you.

359
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,820
Only a tangle of chains.

Why was the padlock

362
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,990
wrapped inside the chains?

363
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,190
Come in.

364
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,280
I…

365
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,750
I asked Li Han to help me contact

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,850
I want to ask her something.

She said…

369
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,880
I need to get your approval first.

370
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,600
That case has been closed for so long.

371
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,880
Why are you still investigating it?

372
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,640
I've noticed something wrong,

373
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,600
but I'm not sure

374
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,830
if there's really something wrong

375
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,090
about it.

376
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,770
So,

377
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,310
I need to investigate and confirm it.

378
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,880
Alright.

379
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,340
Go ahead.

00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,230
But remember,

381
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,460
if you meet any difficulties during the investigation,

382
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,740
don't face them alone.

383
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,030
You've noticed something wrong

384
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,230
but aren't sure if there's really

385
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,560
something wrong about it.

386
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,970
Are you playing with words?

387
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,830
Hello?

388
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,750
Hello.

389
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,940
Do you have time now?

390
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,350
I'd like to talk to you.

391
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,700
(Jiangcheng Kailai Biotechnology)

392
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,950
Mr. Shen,

393
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,890
please have a seat for a moment.

394
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,000
Mr. Fang will be here soon.

395
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,780
Thank you.

396
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,290
You just changed a life.

397
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,470
I don't know.

398
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,710
It looks like what I know as

399
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,670
a mandala painting.

400
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,400
Filling colors within a circle.

401
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,890
Countless possibilities

402
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,360
become one when the brush

403
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,980
touches the canvas.

404
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,900
It symbolizes eternal time

405
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,180
and connection.

406
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,210
Is this where you work?

407
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,360
Yes.

408
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,470
It's completely different from what I imagined.

409
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,550
Those fruits,

410
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,940
do you eat them?

411
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,630
A16 should be ripe.

412
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,830
I'll make some juice for you.

413
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,550
Never mind.

414
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,750
They're all numbered.

415
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,780
Too much pressure.

416
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,610
Monotropa uniflora?

417
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,810
They're very rare.

418
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,630
You know about them?

419
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,120
Also known as ghost plants.

420
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,870
They can't photosynthesize

421
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,230
and have weak roots.

422
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,030
That's right.

423
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,230
So they kidnap fungi,

424
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,230
using their hyphae to absorb nutrients.

425
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,070
You call it

426
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,750
kidnapping?

427
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,030
In biological terms,

428
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,550
this is a symbiotic relationship.

429
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,110
Monotropa uniflora obtains most of its nutrients

430
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,510
by parasitizing fungi.

431
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,030
It deceives fungi,

432
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,270
cunningly stealing food.

433
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,190
It's driven

434
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,480
by instinct.

435
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,870
Deceive?

436
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,720
Parasitize.

437
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,100
A dangerous relationship.

438
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,300
What's wrong?

439
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,310
I'm

440
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,430
thinking about

441
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,750
a girl I've been in contact with recently.

442
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,670
She gives me a special feeling.

443
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,140
On the surface, she's pretty and delicate.

444
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,110
Sorry.

445
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,470
Sorry.

446
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,510
But she always makes me

447
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,430
feel a sense of danger

448
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,220
and uncertainty.

449
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,900
I even have a strong premonition

450
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,100
that she's manipulating something.

451
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,620
There's no escape.

452
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,900
If you push too hard,

453
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,530
all your efforts will be in vain.

454
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,830
Control

455
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,650
is the key.

456
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,430
It's as if she's desperately trying to cover up

457
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,470
some kind of truth.

458
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,410
So I'm really torn.

459
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,750
Should I

460
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,210
hold onto this feeling

461
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,250
and continue looking for the truth?

462
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,870
Feelings

463
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,670
can be illusory.

464
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,120
But they appear for a reason.

465
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,680
The urge to get to the bottom of it

466
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,950
is both your nature

467
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,690
and your destiny.

468
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,840
My destiny?

469
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,240
Why so?

470
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,460
It's decided by genes.

471
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,910
Instead of feeling torn,

472
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:29,790
you should

473
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,860
embrace it.

474
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,380
I'll try your A16 next time.

475
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,270
Where's Shen Yi?

476
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,340
He went out.

477
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,390
Mr. Shen asked me

478
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,470
to get these books for him.

479
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,640
You're looking for him?

480
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,080
Hello?

481
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,240
Alright, I got it.

482
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,720
At Huahan Residential Complex,

483
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,870
suspected human remains have been found.

484
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,330
Let's go.

485
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,340
Okay.

486
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,730
Sorry.

487
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,020
When I discovered it,

488
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,560
it gave me quite a fright.

489
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,710
That bag is full of blood.

490
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,350
I thought it was…

491
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:54,870
Well…

492
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,900
It's alright, ma'am. Take your time.

493
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,750
Captain Cheng.

494
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,310
I checked the surveillance footage.

495
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,430
It's from a nearby hospital,

496
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,470
fallen out of a medical

497
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,210
waste disposal truck.

498
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,390
Someone picked it up

499
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,510
and threw it in the trash bin.

500
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,270
So,

501
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,420
we can go now, right?

502
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,440
I'm really sorry

503
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,190
for causing you so much trouble.

504
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,750
Wait a moment.

505
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,430
Not at all.

506
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,390
Don't worry about it.

507
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:13,870
Ma'am.

508
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,630
Captain Cheng.

509
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,630
You don't need to apologize.

510
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,040
If you see something like this again,

511
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,520
you still need to call the police immediately.

512
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,920
Yes, yes.

513
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,160
Alright, I'll leave it to you.

514
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,550
Yes.

515
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:22,990
Let's go.

516
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,520
(Interrogation Room)

517
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,430
We've called you over

518
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,310
to inquire about

519
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,990
the arson case

520
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,220
at Haispeed Internet Cafe.

521
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,120
What do you want to ask about?

522
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,350
The sentence was handed down.

523
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,420
I've served three years in prison.

524
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,750
Don't be afraid.

525
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,400
We're not reconsidering your sentence.

526
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,300
You remember this door, right?

527
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,560
Yes.

528
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,390
Back then, when you

529
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,750
avoided inspections,

530
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,170
would you lock the door like this?

531
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,590
Come to think of it,

532
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,630
if there were people inside,

533
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,570
we wouldn't wrap the chain around the padlock.

534
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,590
We'd leave the padlock on the outside

535
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,370
so it could be unlocked from either side.

536
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,470
Does it mean those three kids

537
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,880
did this on purpose?

538
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,150
That would make them monsters.

539
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,810
This painting can't prove anything.

540
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,570
We called you over

541
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,910
to ask

542
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,080
if there was anything off

543
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,830
about that girl

544
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,710
back then.

545
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,270
That girl

546
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,760
was the worst.

547
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,160
She looked pretty

548
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,780
and was quite likable.

549
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,070
When I had spare time,

550
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,640
I often chatted with her.

551
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,180
But later,

552
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,440
she took advantage of my trust

553
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,760
to steal my money.

554
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,370
She ordered that slow-witted boy

555
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,700
to cover for her.

556
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,170
One day, I saw

557
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,380
that simple, honest boy

558
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,360
just let her beat him up.

559
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,980
Sorry.

560
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,030
I-I'm really sorry.

561
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,940
I told you what to do!

562
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,520
Just take it!

563
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,470
How can we go out and have fun without money?

564
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,110
I was wondering why the accounts

565
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,230
didn't add up.

566
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,770
So you did it!

567
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,950
How much money is missing in total?

568
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,590
Over 2,200 yuan.

569
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,450
You have two options.

570
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,400
Either you pay back the money,

571
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:52,950
or

572
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,070
we call the police!

573
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,070
You...

574
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,380
Why are you crying?

575
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:06,950
You...

576
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,030
What are you doing?

577
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,600
What are you doing?

578
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,250
They accused me of stealing their money.

579
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,860
They even searched me.

580
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,320
He…

581
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,800
He molested me.

582
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,810
No, that's not true.

583
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,260
How could you?

584
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,210
What did you accuse her of stealing?

585
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,110
That's nonsense!

586
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,989
I didn't molest you!

587
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,150
We didn't even touch her!

588
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,590
I caught her stealing money

589
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,670
red-handed!

590
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,949
Stop acting.

591
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,110
We're not falling for this.

592
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,560
Pay back the money.

593
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,310
Otherwise,

594
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,340
we'll notify your school.

595
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,280
to expel you!

596
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,010
Call the police!

597
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,900
Call the police.

598
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,030
You…

599
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,970
You'll pay the price.

600
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,350
The way that girl suddenly changed her expression

601
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,070
is still vivid.

602
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,200
I never expected

603
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,160
that she would

604
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,840
seek revenge because we caught her

605
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,770
doing something wrong.

606
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,090
She burned my husband

607
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,380
and so many others

608
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,650
to death.
