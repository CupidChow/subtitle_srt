(Episode 6)

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,630
(Police)

4
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,190
Come.
(Police)

5
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,229
(Police)

6
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,009
Have a cup of hot water.
(Police)

7
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:54,070
(Police)

8
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,780
Warm yourself up.
(Police)

9
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,700
How did the conversation go?

10
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,810
I think there's something off about Chang Feng.

11
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,040
What's wrong?

12
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,550
I guided him

13
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,039
to complete a sandplay test.

14
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,310
Sandplay test?

15
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,470
The sandplay test

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
is similar to the Rorschach inkblot test.

17
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a psychological testing method

18
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,710
based on

19
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,390
psychoanalysis and projection.

20
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,520
We accompany the subject

21
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,860
as they create a sand tray scene

22
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,360
to obtain projections from their subconscious.

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,890
Look.

24
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,340
This

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,079
is the sand tray Chang Feng created.

26
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,510
What does this tell us?

27
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,260
This area is particularly large.

28
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,690
The area you're pointing to

29
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,510
represents Chang Feng's sister.

30
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,780
Clearly,

31
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,470
she occupies

32
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,270
an unreasonably large space.

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,730
in this family.

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,510
She has almost become

35
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,440
the absolute emotional pillar of the entire family.

36
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,030
But his sister

37
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,230
passed away many years ago.

38
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,490
However, his sister's death

39
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,790
has become something he can't move past

40
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,280
in his heart.

41
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,560
That's why he keeps staying in this house,

42
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,070
as if he's forever

43
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,830
living with his sister.

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,680
This has almost reached

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,590
a pathological level.

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,380
Now look at this.

47
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,180
This is the position of his sister's remains.

48
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,900
I changed the perspective

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,660
from eye-level to a bird's-eye view

50
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,090
and drew this diagram.

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,070
This

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,690
looks like a…

53
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,900
It's an altar.

54
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,090
With Chang Feng's sister at the center,

55
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,010
the surrounding remains

56
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,150
seem to be sacrificed for her.

57
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,510
Of course,

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,980
this is just my intuition

59
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,930
and speculation.

60
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,370
Captain Du,

61
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:16,959
you two want breakfast,

62

69
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,750
Can I come in and take another look?

70
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,690
Sure, sure.

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,290
Come.

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
Please come in.

(2014)

80
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,630
Why are you still using

81
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,080
such an old calendar?

82
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,300
Time passes slowly on the mountain.

83
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,490
After a long time,

84
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,990
people tend to get confused.

85
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,300
What do these markings mean?

86
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,240
They're the times when those people fell off the cliff.

87
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,500
What about this one?

88
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,450
Why is it crossed out?

89
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,420
(September 3)

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,890
This...

91
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,060
It's been too long.

92
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,070
I've forgotten.

93
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,190
Captain Du,

94
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,850
it's getting late.

95
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,360
I must go up the mountain to chop wood.

96
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,240
There's plenty of tea in the house.

97
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,210
Make yourself at home.

98
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,190
Can I go with you?

99
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,630
Sure.

100
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,860
Captain Du,

101
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,850
there are many poisonous snakes in these mountains.

102
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,150
If you get bitten,

103
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,290
it'll be unbearable.

104
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,020
Come on,

105
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,680
let's go.

106
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,450
Can't send it out. There's no signal.

107
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,340
Stop filming.

108
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,669
There's no signal. Let's try to find some.

109
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,659
What are you doing here?

110
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,669
Someone's there.

111
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,110
Sir,

112
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,270
we want to see the Auroral Mist.

113
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,669
Which way should we go?

114
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,570
We want to film a video.

115
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,020
If we're late, we'll miss it.

116
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,350
Go up about three li,

117
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,660
and there'll be a fork in the road.

118
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,150
Take the path on the right.

119
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,430
Alright, thank you, sir.

120
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,840
Thanks.

121
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,270
Let's go.

122
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,120
Wait a minute.

123
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,770
How did you get up the mountain?

124
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,950
Didn't the police put up tape

125
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,290
and block all the entrances?

126
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,040
We were just asking for directions.

127
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,140
Why are you being so mean?

128
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,910
Who are you anyway?

129
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,290
Do you own this mountain?

130
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,630
I'm a police officer.

131
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,410
-The mountain is in danger.
-Police?

132
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,140
I'm ordering you to go back down immediately.

133
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,460
But we came all this way.

134
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,480
If we miss this chance,

135
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,270
when will we get another one?

136
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,920
You'll have to wait until next year.

137
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,590
Come back next year.

138
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,420
Next year?

139
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,150
Go back.

140
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,110
So I hiked all this way for nothing?

141
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,870
Did you hear me?

142
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,650
Go back.

143
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,510
Let's go, let's go.

144
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,410
Let's go down first.

145
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,900
No, but...

146
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,190
It's okay, we just...

147
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:27,880
Jiang Feng,

148
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,670
I just sent back

149
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,860
two girls who were hiking.

150
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,310
Get someone to meet them on the north slope.

151
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,750
Let's go.

152
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,700
Still no news about Jing?

153
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,330
Not yet.

154
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,480
But not finding her is actually a good thing.

155
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,190
Right.

156
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,800
Shen Yi.

157
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,940
Look at this.

158
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,720
You knit so well.

159
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,490
At that time,

160
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,350
Aya and I

161
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,720
reached a fork in the road.

162
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,870
Suddenly, I tripped

163
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,020
on something.

164
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,840
Right after that,

165
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,470
I heard

166
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,760
from the other side of the fork

167
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,490
the sound of a distress whistle.

168
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,990
I said to Aya,

169
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,170
"I hear a distress whistle.

170
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,940
Someone must be in trouble.

171
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,870
We should hurry over and check it out."

172
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,610
But Aya disagreed.

173
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,010
She continued walking upwards.

174
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,310
When I reached the area where the whistle's sound came from,

175
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,220
I found there was no one there.

176
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,030
Then I heard

177
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,310
Aya's scream.

178
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,440
Why didn't she go with you

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,770
to where the distress whistle was?

180
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,010
Because the Auroral Mist

181
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,230
can only be seen

182
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,200
at specific times.

183
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,590
If we were late, we'd miss it.

184
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,150
And that person today also said

185
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,870
that if we missed it today,

186
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,890
we'd have to wait until next year.

187
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,550
Aya and I

188
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,270
made it here

189
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,240
after so much difficulty.

190
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,290
Aya didn't want to wait until next year.

191
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,590
Actually, at that time,

192
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,680
I hesitated for a moment.

193
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,620
But after thinking about it,

194
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,790
I still felt that saving lives was more important.

195
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,110
So, I went first

196
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,760
to where the distress whistle was sounding.

197
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,120
Aya went up by herself.

198
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,040
This is all my fault.

199
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,960
You reached the area where the distress whistle was sounding,

200
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,210
but there was no one there,

201
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:30,970
right?

202
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,010
Yes,

203
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,190
there was no one.

204
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,850
Take a moment to calm down and rest.

205
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,030
The preliminary autopsy can now confirm

206
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,080
that the deceased was conscious before falling off the cliff.

207
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,960
There was no sign of intoxication

208
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,340
or drug abuse.

209
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,710
There was also no history of mental illness.

210
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,690
Apart from the fall,

211
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,830
there were no other external injuries.

212
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,090
Was it suicide or an accident?

213
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,680
If the deceased had intentionally jumped off the cliff,

214
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,760
the location of the wounds and scratches

215
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,550
would most likely not be here.

216
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,170
It's more likely they'd be on

217
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,080
the back of the hands, arms,

218
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,110
or even the back.

219
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,920
However, the wounds

220
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,980
are mostly concentrated on the palms

221
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,210
and wrists.

222
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,190
This indicates

223
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,800
that when the deceased was falling,

224
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,470
she desperately tried to grab

225
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,240
anything she could hold onto.

226
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,030
This is an instinctive survival response.

227
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,680
Therefore, I believe

228
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,820
this was an unintentional fall from the cliff.

229
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,470
The possibility of an accident is indeed very high.

230
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,730
I've been to the mountaintop.

231
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,390
The tree up there

232
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,290
can easily cause an optical illusion.

233
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,060
Additionally,

234
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,070
the mesmerizing spectacle of the Auroral Mist

235
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,670
could have led to the actions

236
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,570
and reactions we're speculating about.

237
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,050
What's wrong?

238
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,970
Do you have any other questions?

239
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,420
Yesterday, when Chang Feng

240
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,910
took me up the mountain,

241
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,940
I didn't see any fork in the path.

242
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,350
The distress whistle's sounded, but there was no one there.

243
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,110
Then why did the whistle's sound?

244
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,950
I want to investigate the path

245
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,930
they took up the mountain again.

246
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,400
I'll go too.

247
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,470
Jiang Feng,

248
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,330
keep an eye on Chang Feng.

249
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,460
Okay.

250
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,380
What's up?

251
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,650
Nothing.

252
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,270
It's just that earlier,

253
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,450
you helped cook for the guys.

254
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,550
Thank you.

255
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,400
I happen to be free,

256
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,120
so I came over to help you with some work.

257
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,700
These logs haven't been split yet.

258
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,760
I'll help you.

259
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,450
I'll try again.

260
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,860
Officer,

261
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,440
that's not the right way.

262
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,840
You need to use a bit of technique.

263
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,190
When you bring the axe down,

264
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,170
use the momentum

265
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,380
to twist the blade slightly to the side.

266
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,790
I see.

267
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,340
Technique.

268
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,310
That's right.

269
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,710
Right here.

270
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,890
This is the spot.

271
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,760
So this is where you

272
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,900
heard the distress whistle?

273
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,240
Yes.

274
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,170
There's a fork in the road.

275
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,740
It's easy to recognize. I won't be wrong.

276
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,370
Where did the whistle's sound come from?

277
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,230
The whistle?

278
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,720
From over there.

279
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,900
I thought someone was in danger.

280
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,870
I followed the sound of the whistle

281
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,090
and ran here.

282
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,120
I was about to go up and check some more

283
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,070
when I heard

284
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,340
Aya's scream.

285
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,630
So I went to rescue Aya.

286
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,650
You take her down first.

287
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,210
Aya.

288
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,300
Aya.

289
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,310
(This path is safe to view the Auroral Mist)

290
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,430
Why would someone put

291
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,430
a distress whistle

292
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,750
on a path that's supposed to be safe?

293
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,690
(This path is safe to view the Auroral Mist)

294
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,940
I've seen this handwriting before.
(This path is safe to view the Auroral Mist)

295
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,240
This was written by Chang Feng.

296
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,910
Let's go to where the incident

297
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,670
happened.

298
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,490
Are you okay?

299
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,320
I'm fine.

300
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,980
So this is the Auroral Mist they talk about.

301
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,040
I got it.

302
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,350
Caught a cold?

303
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,910
I chopped wood and was exposed to the wind during the day.

304
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,180
I might've caught a chill.

305
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,030
Take this.

306
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,310
Are you ready?

307
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,340
Ready.

308
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,820
Let's begin.

309
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,480
This fork in the road

310
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,800
splits into two paths.

311
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,990
Both paths lead to

312
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,130
the cliff platform.

313
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,740
The one on the right is relatively steep,

314
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,350
while the one on the left is flatter.

315
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,630
This is the cliff platform

316
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,950
shown from two different angles.

317
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,080
Now,

318
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,750
let's try to imagine.

319
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,170
You're slowly climbing up

320
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,370
the path on the left.

321
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,430
You see

322
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,070
a magical landscape that you'd

323
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,660
only see in fantasy movies.

324
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,870
The visual scene changes instantly,

325
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,260
filling you with joy.

326
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,400
You're deeply attracted by

327
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,040
the beauty of the Auroral Mist.

328
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,990
In the distance,

329
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,530
there's a sea of flowers shimmering with golden light.

330
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,250
So,

331
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,870
Jiang Feng, what would you do?

332
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,210
I would move closer

333
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,130
to get a better view.

334
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,670
The thick fog

335
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,980
has already slowly

336
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,070
obscured the path beneath your feet.

337
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,070
You think the exposed rocks in the distance

338
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,800
mark the edge of the path.

339
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,460
So you naturally

340
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,520
follow the direction indicated by the rocks,

341
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,730
slowly moving forward.

342
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,230
You're already dead.

343
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,870
Yes,

344
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,970
completely dead.

345
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,060
Why?

346
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,790
Your attention

347
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,630
was completely drawn to the Auroral Mist.

348
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,830
You wouldn't have known

349
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,950
if there was still a path ahead or not.

350
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,080
So did the deceased at the bottom of the pit,

351
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:13,950
all fall

352
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,170
from here?

353
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,030
What if we take the other path?

354
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,830
This path

355
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,270
is relatively steep,

356
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,920
with no obstructions to the view.

357
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,960
Therefore,

358
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,430
the cliff

359
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,530
is clearly visible.

360
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,270
So the choice between these two paths

361
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,150
is actually

362
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,990
a choice between life and death.

363
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,300
That's correct.

364
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,550
If we miss this chance,

365
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,280
when will we get another one?

366
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,900
You'll have to wait until next year.

367
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,270
Come back next year.

368
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,560
Chang Feng told them

369
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,450
if they missed this chance, they'd have to wait until next year.

370
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,250
Thinking back now,

371
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,270
he was enticing them to take risks.

372
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,700
Chang Feng is likely

373
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,750
the one who set up the distress whistle.

374
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,030
He wants people

375
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,670
to choose between life and death.

376
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,280
That female influencer said

377
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,710
they arrived at

378
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,830
this fork in the road

379
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,850
when they heard a distress whistle from the right.

380
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,700
I found

381
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,060
a broken

382
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,830
fishing line in the bushes

383
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,110
at the fork.

384
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,990
This must be a trap

385
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,110
set by Chang Feng.

386
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:14,910
As long as people

387
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,230
walked to this fork,

388
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,800
they would kick the fishing line

389
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,610
and trigger the mechanism.

390
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,550
The distress whistle

391
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,280
is not just for guidance,

392
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,880
but also for selection.

393
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,880
S-Select what?

394
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:32,870
People.

395
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,980
Those with good intentions

396
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,760
will hear the distress whistle

397
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,290
and choose to save others.

398
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,730
Then they will see

399
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,170
(This path is safe to view the Auroral Mist)

400
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,880
a sign indicating
(This path is safe to view the Auroral Mist)

401
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,010
(This path is safe to view the Auroral Mist)

402
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,660
this path is safe to view the Auroral Mist,
(This path is safe to view the Auroral Mist)

403
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,440
and walk towards that safe path.

404
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,580
On the contrary,

405
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,860
those who don't will follow the left path

406
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,030
straight to their deaths.

407
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
Chang Feng is playing the role of a judge.

408
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,500
He wants to guide those with good intentions

409
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,800
who want to save others towards life,

410
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,870
while leading those who are indifferent

411
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,230
to others' life and death

412
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,950
towards their own deaths.

413
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,410
He uses the special environment,

414
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,110
unique natural scenery,

415
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,200
and the limitations of human vision

416
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,310
to kill the people

417
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,630
he believes should die.

418
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,200
But why does he do this?

419
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,550
The altar.

420
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,980
That sinkhole

421
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,570
is the altar he prepared

422
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,910
for his sister.

423
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,300
Li Han,

424
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,150
check which mountaineering team

425
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,260
Chang Feng hed

426
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,610
when his sister had the accident ten years ago.

427
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,310
Feng!

428
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,740
He was injured by a sharp weapon.

429
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,840
What's the situation?

430
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,230
This deceased is different.

431
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,900
It's a male around 60 years old.

432
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,390
He has a severe

433
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,750
weapon wound on his body,

434
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,670
deep to the bone,

435
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,830
located on his left collarbone.

436
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:27,990
I suspect

437
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,440
he was first attacked

438
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,950
before falling off the cliff.

439
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,350
Do we have a time of death?

440
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,870
Approximately ten years ago.

441
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,100
Based on the wound morphology,

442
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,110
the blade length of the murder weapon is estimated to be

443
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,670
between 30

444
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,750
to 40 centimeters,

445
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,430
weighing about 700

446
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,430
to 800 grams.

447
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,510
It's likely

448
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,630
a cleaver-like

449
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,790
curved blade.

450
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,020
The victim's wound

451
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,150
has another characteristic.

452
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,970
One side of the cut bone

453
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,500
shows signs of being pried.

454
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,710
This is likely

455
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,290
the killer's personal habit when using a cleaver.

456
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,130
Officer,

457
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,350
that's not the right way.

458
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,700
You need to use a bit of technique.

459
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,400
When you bring the axe down,

460
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,470
use the momentum

461
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,840
to twist the blade slightly to the side.

462
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,280
This characteristic is very similar to Chang Feng's.

463
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,100
Has the facial reconstruction been completed?

464
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,800
Shen Yi.

465
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,710
Li Han.

466
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,640
I just sent you a sketch.

467
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,590
Please confirm the identity

468
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,920
of the person in the sketch as soon as possible.

469
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,860
Also,

470
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,480
search social media

471
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,870
for any articles or accounts

472
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,110
with keywords like Mt. Fengdu

473
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,310
or Suicide Valley.

474
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,810
See if there are any new findings.

475
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,510
Understood.

476
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,730
Based on the sketches of the deceased

477
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,020
that Mr. Shen sent earlier,

478
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,360
I've confirmed with the families that

479
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,610
they were indeed all suicides.

480
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,390
They all left suicide notes

481
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,670
or showed strong signs

482
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,770
of suicidal intentions before their deaths.

483
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,800
Alright, I got it.

484
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,470
Bring Chang Feng back.

485
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,080
Let's head back.

486
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,810
Captain Cheng,

487
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,050
the victim's identity has been confirmed.

488
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,000
His name was Ma Huainan.

489
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,260
In 2014,

490
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,260
he and his wife, Ke Ling,

491
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,880
went missing after climbing Mt. Fengdu.

492
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,610
(Li Han)
went missing after climbing Mt. Fengdu.

493
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:37,650
(Li Han)

494
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,850
Ke Ling was the one who reported the case.
(Li Han)

495
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,420
Considering the newly discovered

496
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,900
evidence related to Ma Huainan's body,

497
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,330
I believe

498
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,980
there are many suspicious points about her.

499
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,730
Summon Ke Ling immediately.

500
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,640
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

501
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,570
Do you know why we brought you back?

502
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,150
I don't know.

503
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,140
Do you recognize him?

504
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,590
Yes, I do.

505
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,770
His name was Ma Huainan.

506
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,030
That day, he and his wife came to me.

507
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,390
They said they wanted to see the Auroral Mist.

508
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,530
They asked me to be their guide,

509
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,430
so I took them there.

510
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,510
Murder?

511
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,390
Impossible.

512
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,430
How could my husband possibly

513
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,590
be murdered?

514
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,670
It can't be.

515
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,810
How long have you

516
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,190
been married to your husband?

517
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,130
By this May,

518
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,650
we would've been

519
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,470
married for exactly 24 years.

520
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,860
Ma

521
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,930
was my senior in college.

522
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,150
In my sophomore year,

523
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,160
we started dating.

524
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,560
A year after graduation,

525
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,120
he proposed to me.

526
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,860
My health isn't good,

527
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,470
so it's risky

528
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,730
for me to give birth.

529
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,830
Ma willingly agreed not to have children.

530
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,910
He stayed by my side like this,

531
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,090
taking care of me.

532
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,270
Over these 24 years,

533
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,210
apart from work,

534
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,510
we spent at least

535
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,510
76.4 percent

536
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,450
of our time

537
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,940
together.

538
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,170
76.4 percent?

539
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,820
That's quite precise.

540
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,450
It is that precise.

541
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,740
I'm a teacher at Beijiang University.

542
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,440
I teach mathematics.

543
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,720
So at that time,

544
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,040
why did you choose

545
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,700
to climb the unregulated mountain of Mt. Fengdu?

546
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,020
When we were in university,

547
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,440
we enjoyed climbing unregulated mountains together.

548
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,730
I guess this could be considered

549
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,520
one of our

550
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,820
shared hobbies.

551
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,950
As we grew older,

552
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,640
we stopped doing

553
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,860
those old hobbies.

554
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,140
Ma suggested going to Mt. Fengdu

555
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,650
just to reminisce about

556
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,460
the good old days

557
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,920
and to rekindle our relationship.

558
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,620
From their conversation,

559
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,060
I learned they were university schoolmates.

560
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,170
They said they wanted to climb again

561
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,180
to recapture the feeling of being in love.

562
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,350
They were a married couple,

563
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,490
looking to be in their forties or fifties,

564
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,440
still wanting to find that feeling of being in love.

565
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,780
I grew up in these mountains.

566
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,770
I don't get it.

567
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,000
But from what you just said,

568
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,950
you and your husband

569
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,770
have always had a good relationship, haven't you?

570
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,260
Why would you need to rekindle it?

571
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,190
You must not be married.

572
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,690
Actually, when it comes to marriage,

573
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,870
in the end,

574
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,440
it all settles into routine.

575
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,800
He was good to me.

576
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,450
He truly took care of me.

577
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,350
But it's also true that our feelings

578
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,560
had faded.

579
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,390
Moreover, we didn't have

580
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,080
children to spice things up,

581
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,230
so as time went by,

582
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,870
it became

583
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,770
completely devoid of any novelty.

584
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,070
A marital relationship

585
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,480
requires effort from both parties.

586
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,040
We both felt that

587
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,300
life shouldn't be like this,

588
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,630
so

589
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,250
we agreed

590
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,130
to try and recapture some of

591
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,170
the beautiful memories from our university days

592
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,750
and see

593
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,100
if we could rekindle

594
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,780
our love from back then.

595
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,010
When exactly did they come?

596
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,050
Do you remember?

597
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,540
2014.

598
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,420
September 3, 2014.

599
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,800
September 3rd.

600
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,270
11:05 AM

601
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,270
in the morning.

602
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,469
11:05

603
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,659
(2014)

604
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:41,830
What about this?
(2014)

605
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,540
What about this?

606
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,520
(September 3)

607
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,469
Why is it marked with an X?
(September 3)

608
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,420
(September 3)

609
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,150
How do you remember it so clearly?

610
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,310
I checked the time then.

611
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,510
I've said before,

612
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,800
I teach mathematics.

613
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,710
My sensitivity to numbers

614
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,100
is my professional instinct.

615
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,670
You could say it's

616
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,150
photographic memory.

617
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,460
Because at the fork in the road,

618
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,630
that female teacher checked her watch once.

619
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,630
She always mentioned numbers when she spoke.

620
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,670
It was quite novel.

621
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,400
That's why I remember this time.

622
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,070
You mentioned earlier

623
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,270
the wife got injured halfway.

624
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,070
What exactly happened?

625
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,190
When we reached the top of the cliff,

626
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,330
it suddenly started raining.

627
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,100
I hurried to climb up first,

628
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,360
so I could pull them up after.

629
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,190
Come on.

630
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,550
After I pulled up the man…

631
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,220
Come on.

632
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,100
He insisted on pulling his wife up himself.

633
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,120
So I stepped aside.

634
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,700
That man actually couldn't hold on to her.

635
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,180
He couldn't hold onto me.

636
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,240
I fell straight down.

637
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,830
Luckily, there were plants below,

638
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,750
so I didn't fall to my death.

639
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,660
My leg at that time

640
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,260
hurt too much to move.

641
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,540
Chang Feng was terrified.

642
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,400
He jumped down from a very high place

643
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,470
to save me.

644
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,000
He carried me on his back

645
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,120
to go to the hospital.

646
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,930
He was also worried about Ma on the cliff,

647
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,290
so he called out to him

648
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,110
to come down

649
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,700
from another safer place.

650
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,120
He carried me on his back

651
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,540
and ran towards the hospital.

652
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,550
But for some reason,

653
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,150
Ma

654
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,230
didn't keep up with us.

655
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,580
That's the worst thing that can happen in the mountains.

656
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,550
I decided to rescue her first.

657
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,210
That man also said

658
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,540
rescuing her was more urgent.

659
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,220
He asked me to carry his wife down the mountain

660
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,720
and not to worry about him for now.

661
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,960
So, I

662
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,820
carried his wife all the way down.

663
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,290
I went back to the village to call an ambulance

664
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,150
and had her taken away.

665
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,360
I saved her.

666
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,640
Did Ma Huainan eventually come down from the mountain?

667
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,780
As a guide,

668
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,750
didn't you try to search for him again?

669
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,340
At that time, I also led the police

670
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,070
to search the mountain.

671
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,260
But I couldn't find him.

672
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,700
How's it going over there?

673
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,140
They encountered rain while climbing the mountain.

674
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,430
Ke Ling had an accident.

675
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,350
Chang Feng, in order to save her,

676
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,340
took her away first.

677
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,710
Ma Huainan went missing after that.

678
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,620
The testimonies are too consistent.

679
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,100
It's likely they colluded.

680
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,520
The mountaineers from back then have arrived.

681
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,000
Let's go.

682
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,380
(Interrogation Room)

683
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,190
(Four Mountaineers Stranded on Mt. Fengdu)
(Local Police and Rescue Team Rescue Them)

684
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,590
Do you four remember this incident?

685
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,200
As far as I know,

686
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,360
we haven't broken any laws.

687
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,590
Every citizen has the duty

688
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,710
to cooperate with police investigations.

689
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,740
Back when you four went mountain climbing,

690
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,150
was there someone

691
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,510
named Chang Feng who served as your guide?

692
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,580
Yes.

693
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,970
During that climbing expedition,

694
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,560
Chang Feng's sister

695
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,380
accidentally fell off the cliff and went missing.

696
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,140
We found

697
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,070
her remains in a sinkhole

698
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,100
on Mt. Fengdu.

699
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,250
In this news article,

700
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,940
you thanked the police

701
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,400
and the rescue team

702
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,290
but didn't mention Chang Feng.

703
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,290
Why?

704
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,360
We want to know

705
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,010
what exactly happened back then.

706
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,460
Back then,

707
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,700
it was indeed Chang Feng

708
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,750
who served as our guide.

709
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,910
His sister also came along.

710
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,340
Yes.

711
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,320
We all liked her.

712
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,750
I remember

713
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,150
I even gave her some fruit to eat.

714
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,870
At first,

715
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,670
everything went quite smoothly.

716
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,030
His sister also followed us,

717
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,100
lending a hand and such.

718
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,560
Then the weather suddenly changed.

719
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,790
It started raining heavily.

720
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,570
The path up the mountain was already steep

721
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,320
and it became even more difficult with rain.

722
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,150
I was actually quite hesitant.

723
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,390
We should have retreated at that time.

724
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,760
Chang Feng also told us to go back.

725
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,250
His sister

726
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:19,910
didn't even...

727
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,260
Didn't even have a raincoat.

728
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,550
We all had

729
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,600
mountaineering experience.

730
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,640
For us four,

731
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,380
if it rained,

732
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,590
climbing to higher, flatter ground

733
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,630
was the safest option.

734
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,370
Going to Mist Cliff

735
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,460
was our only choice at that time.

736
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,630
I-It was me.

737
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,450
I almost fell.

738
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,150
Fortunately, Chang Feng

739
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,120
supported me from below.

740
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,950
His sister was pushed a bit

741
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,620
and then...

742
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,220
She went missing.

743
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,990
For this,

744
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,700
I'm very grateful to Chang Feng.

745
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,830
If it weren't for him,

746
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,190
I might

747
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,560
not have made it back.

748
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,540
Given the weather conditions at that time,

749
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,160
his sister's accident

750
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,110
was indeed an unexpected situation.

751
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,150
We couldn't possibly

752
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,510
have risked our own lives.

753
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,410
Right?

754
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,660
His sister went missing.

755
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,220
We were deeply saddened as well.

756
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,940
But ultimately,

757
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,970
we had

758
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,780
no direct responsibility.

759
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,660
Therefore,

760
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,620
we didn't inform the media about this incident.

761
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,130
We felt it unnecessary

762
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,480
to blow things out of proportion.

763
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,350
Afterwards,

764
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,240
out of ethical reasons, we still

765
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,930
wanted to offer Chang Feng a compensation.

766
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,030
But he refused to accept it no matter what.

767
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,860
To be honest, we felt quite guilty too.

768
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,230
So for all these years,

769
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,540
we have been

770
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,720
using the Hikers' Club's name

771
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,590
to do various charitable and philanthropic activities.

772
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,290
That's about it.

773
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,170
Thank you all for your cooperation.
