(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,070
(Episode 23)

3
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,729
Your love energy is diminishing.

4
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,620
Wait.

5
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,740
I see another woman.

6
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,780
Petite and quiet.

7
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,560
Fair-skinned.

8
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,250
That girl

9
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,150
should be the new intern

10
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,010
at his workplace.

11
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,420
I knew it.

12
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,820
He's been so happy

13
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,310
going to work these days.

14
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,910
What should I do?

15
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,810
Black.

16
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,050
Wear some black obsidian.

17
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,510
It can help you gather energy.

18
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,160
Thank you.

19
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,470
What do you two want to know about?

20
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,180
Career

21
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,190
or relationship?

22
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,470
(Public Security)

23
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,410
We're from the Criminal Investigation Team of the Beijiang Branch.
(Public Security)

24
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,110
We'd like to ask you about

25
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,980
Su Youliang.

26
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,750
You're willing to reinvestigate

27
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,830
Youliang's death?

28
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,190
Have a seat.

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,630
I'll look around a bit.

30
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,620
That's great.

31
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,450
How long were you

32
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,790
and Su Youliang together?

33
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,560
Many years.

34
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,260
Youliang and I

35
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,110
started cosplaying together

36
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,190
back in middle school.

37
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,300
He was very handsome

38
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,020
and had many fans back then.

39
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,110
When did you find out about

40
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,710
Su Youliang and An Luran's relationship?

41
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,430
I knew it from the very beginning.

42
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,510
In the second year of graduate school,

43
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,680
he went to a campus recruitment event.

44
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,710
An Luran took notice of him then.

45
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,430
Later, our senior,

46
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,550
Tang Keying, helped make him

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,990
her intern.

48
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,790
So…

49
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,030
you knew about their relationship

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,230
from the very beginning?

51
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,590
Yes.

52
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,790
Then why didn't you

53
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,580
break up with him?

54
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,800
Because I needed to save him.

55
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,590
I'd been with Youliang

56
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,740
for a long time.

57
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,590
I knew him well.

58
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,550
He was very naive.

59
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,510
But that woman…

60
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,110
She's a devil!

61
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,750
Youliang was bewitched by her.

62
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,770
After Su Youliang's death,

63
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,659
why did you try to prevent the cremation?

64
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,760
Because he was murdered!

65
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,659
If he was cremated,

66
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,270
there would be no evidence left!

67
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,970
You know what?

68
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,020
His brother signed for the cremation.

69
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,270
His brother had previously

70
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,710
received favors from An Luran

71
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,590
and kept speaking ill of me.

72
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,080
Youliang is dead now.

73
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,909
No evidence is left.

74
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,600
He didn't tell his parents

75
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,360
and went to sign himself.

76
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,130
Did that make sense?

77
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,910
He must have been

78
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,190
bought off by An Luran.

79
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,800
An Luran knew

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,350
she couldn't break us apart,

81
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,380
so she killed Youliang

82
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,210
and had his brother help cover it up.

83
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,340
How do you know

84
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,300
An Luran killed Su Youliang?

85
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,670
I have psychic powers.

86
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,700
Psychic powers?

87
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,180
I read Youliang's birth chart.

88
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,170
I also did tarot readings and used crystal balls.

89
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,430
All of them

90
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,280
indicated that there would be

91
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,350
a greedy woman

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,280
who would kill Youliang.

93
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,659
So,

94
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,870
you don't have any

95
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,090
solid evidence

96
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,750
to prove that An Luran

97
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,630
killed Su Youliang.

98
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,310
Limiting the world

99
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,790
to one's own knowledge

100
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,540
is the most arrogant thing humans have ever done.

101
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,720
That's a line from Count D.

102
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,510
Did you ever notice

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
any signs of Su Youliang's health

104
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,710
deteriorating?

105
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,670
With An Luran tormenting him like that,

106
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,860
his health was naturally

107
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,110
getting worse and worse.

108
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,840
Officers,

109
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,510
please trust me.

110
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,750
Investigate An Luran thoroughly.

111
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,140
Thank you for talking with us.

112
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,490
An Luran has returned.

113
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,250
The tattoo on Su Youliang's chest,

114
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,790
do you know about it?

115
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,700
Yes.

116
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,190
What about the tattoo?

117
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,420
Nothing.

118
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,510
Love, hate, and obsession

119
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,030
inevitably leave

120
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,430
marks on the body,

121
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,150
reflecting human nature

122
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,150
and aesthetics.

123
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,030
Let's go.

124
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,330
If there's any progress,

125
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,310
we'll contact you.

126
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,240
I really like

127
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,190
the Bohemian style here.

128
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,940
You are?

129
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,730
We're from the Criminal Investigation Team of the Beijiang Branch.

130
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,110
(Public Security)
We're from the Criminal Investigation Team of the Beijiang Branch.

131
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,290
(Public Security)

132
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,870
An!

133
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,280
We'd like to speak with An Luran

134
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:48,990
to learn more about

135
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,990
Su Youliang.

136
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,870
Come in.

137
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,180
What was your relationship with Su Youliang?

138
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,350
I guess we were boyfriend and girlfriend.

139
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,950
How did you meet?

140
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,230
My medical center

141
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,990
was recruiting at his school.

142
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,390
His major matched,

143
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,640
and someone referred him internally,

144
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,090
so we met.

145
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,110
Do you know

146
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,270
he had another girlfriend?

147
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,710
Yes.

148
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,140
Lin Xiaoyin, right?

149
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,020
What's wrong?

150
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,350
I was not planning to get married anyway.

151
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,460
On the night Su Youliang died,

152
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,990
what exactly happened?

153
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,390
I only remember that night,

154
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,900
we had a wild time in bed.

155
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,190
When I woke up in the early morning,

156
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,290
he wasn't breathing.

157
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,350
So I called the hospital.

158
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,030
Is that all?

159
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,150
I don't know

160
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,430
what Lin Xiaoyin told you.

161
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,390
She believes

162
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,590
I'm responsible for Su Youliang's death,

163
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,810
which I find quite ridiculous.

164
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,910
You like Caravaggio's paintings?

165
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,590
He loved painting hot, handsome men.

166
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,340
Of course I like his paintings.

167
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,490
You have that painting

168
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,960
hanging in such a prominent place.

169
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,720
It must be for more than just that reason, right?

170
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,570
The painting on your wall

171
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,230
is called "David with the Head of Goliath."

172
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,740
Caravaggio painted it

173
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,250
after he fled Rome.

174
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,540
It's also one of the works

175
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,210
from the last year of his life.

176
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,730
Interestingly,

177
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
the severed head in the painting

178
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,270
was modeled after

179
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,720
Caravaggio's own face.

180
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,750
The reason he did this

181
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,410
was to present it to the Pope in Rome

182
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,540
to express his repentance after committing murder,

183
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,700
in hopes of obtaining forgiveness.

184
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,660
You know a lot about paintings.

185
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,300
And then?

186
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,300
Then,

187
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,420
I made a

188
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,350
bold guess.

189
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,990
You like this painting

190
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,630
because you imagine yourself

191
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,490
as the Pope who controls everyone's fate.

192
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,910
What are you trying to imply?

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,120
That I controlled Su Youliang's life,

194
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,960
so

195
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,360
I killed him?

196
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,040
I've just sensed that

197
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,430
in your relationships,

198
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,910
you like to be in control.

199
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,450
You're right.

200
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,560
I like men

201
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,950
who are obedient to me.

202
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,300
If I'm not mistaken,

203
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,910
this painting by Caravaggio

204
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,150
also hints at a master-servant,

205
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,310
life-death contract

206
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,620
between you and Su Youliang.

207
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,670
However,

208
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,190
the servant in the contract

209
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,340
is really dead now.

210
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,540
So I'm curious.

211
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,380
Did Su Youliang

212
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,720
do something wrong

213
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,570
to be punished like this?

214
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,230
Why would I punish him?

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,510
I should thank him.

216
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,450
For what?

217
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,220
He helped me get pregnant.

218
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,130
I was quite surprised myself,

219
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,390
but I'm already one month pregnant.

220
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,980
When I had a medical checkup before,

221
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,050
the doctor said

222
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,390
for a woman in her forties like me,

223
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,510
the chances of getting pregnant

224
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,550
were only about five percent.

225
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,930
It should've been hard for me to conceive,

226
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,310
but…

227
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,190
perhaps it's a miracle.

228
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,490
Alright, officers,

229
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,170
Su Youliang is dead.

230
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,510
If you have any questions

231
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,410
about his death,

232
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,640
investigate all you want.

233
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,390
I just want to make sure nothing goes wrong

234
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,000
before I give birth.

235
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,890
For anything else,

236
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,220
contact my lawyer.

237
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,830

238
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,940
Show them out.

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,380
Have you found the source of the thallium?

243
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,710
I contacted Su Youliang's mentor.
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

244
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,550
He made it clear

245
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,470
that their research

246
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,860
didn't involve thallium.

247
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,640
I also checked Hua'an Medical Center.

248
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,810
Everything's by the book.

249
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,090
No record of purchasing thallium.

250
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:28,440
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)
No record of purchasing thallium.

(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

252
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:30,910
However,

253
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,710
there's someone you should find familiar.

254
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,040
Fang Kaiyi's assistant?

255
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,530
Yes, her name is Tang Keying.

256
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,070
She's from Kailai Biotechnology.

257
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,230
She's the senior Lin Xiaoyin mentioned,

258
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,300
who introduced

259
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,170
Su Youliang to An Luran.

260
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,190
So I further investigated

261
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,070
Kailai Biotechnology

262
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,300
and found records of them purchasing thallium.

263
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,910
I

264
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,350
found this

265
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,470
in Su Youliang's gym locker.

266
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,750
After analysis,

267
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,470
traces of thallium

268
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,430
were detected inside.

269
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,630
I confirmed the source of this water bottle.

270
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,750
It's a luxury item.

271
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,790
This bottle costs several thousand yuan.

272
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,550
I found An Luran's name

273
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,460
in the brand's

274
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,740
sales records.

275
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,710
Several thousand.

276
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,390
Jiang Feng,

277
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,460
An Luran is the prime suspect in this case.

278
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,480
Have someone keep a close eye on her,

279
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,540
ready to arrest at any time.

280
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,390
Okay.

281
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,400

282
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,670
contact Kailai Biotechnology.

283
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,230
Have them ready to cooperate with the investigation at any time.

284
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,630
Okay.

Want to come over?

291
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,780
I have something to show you.

292

I promise it'll be worth your while.

293
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,190
Alright.

(Jiangcheng Kailai Biotechnology)

295
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,440
Look.
(Jiangcheng Kailai Biotechnology)

296
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,030
The protein monomer model

297
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,190
of Cao Jian's MAOA gene.

298
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,190
It looks much more consistent, right?

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,990
You've adjusted it?

300
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,870
Yes.

301
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,790
Last time I showed you

302
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,670
his gene sample,

303
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,270
you spotted

304
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,110
its inconsistency at a glance.

305
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,310
So I

306
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,320
re-edited it.

307
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,110
The human MAOA gene's

308
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,940
low-activity variant

309
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,150
can lead to violent behavior

310
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,190
and emotional issues.

311
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,150
My lab has been studying this,

312
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,990
and I've been looking for

313
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,150
new research directions.

314
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,710
In simple terms, this time

315
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,670
I tried removing

316
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,030
the aggression-inducing gene in Cao Jian's cells

317
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,710
and found that the activity

318
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,670
of his MAOA gene

319
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,790
increased,

320
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,790
which means

321
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,100
less violent behavior

322
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,550
and more controllable

323
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,070
emotional issues.

324
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,460
This is an accidental success.

325
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,230
In scientific research,

326
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,420
failures are more common than successes.

327
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,830
Look.

328
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,870
I don't even know

329
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,950
how many times I've failed.

330
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,760
It's rare to see you so happy.

331
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,100
Over these years,

332
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,990
I've been dedicated to

333
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,910
treating and intervening in

334
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,860
human violent behavior,

335
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,160
addictive behavior,

336
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,480
and emotional issues.

337
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,390
If research in this direction

338
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,670
continues to be successful,

339
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,750
it'll provide new targets

340
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,740
for those treatments

341
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,230
and generate

342
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,910
new gene therapy methods and drugs.

343
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,320
This is just the beginning of success.

344
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,830
Although there's a long journey ahead,

345
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,110
I have confidence.

346
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,230
These are the purchase

347
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,310
and usage records

348
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,310
for our experimental materials.

349
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,870
We have detailed logs for all hazardous materials,

350
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,150
like heavy metals and radioactive substances,

351
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,600
showing how much was acquired and used

352
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,900
and where they were used.

353
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,910
And this.

354
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,230
This is our company's

355
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,700
surveillance footage for the past year.

356
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,510
In the past year,

357
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,500
how many people visited,

358
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,790
where they went, and when they left,

359
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,830
you can see them all.

360
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,780
Thank you for your cooperation.

361
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,770
Wait.

362
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,300
These materials

363
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,400
involve our company's

Mr. Fang

366
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,030
is willing

367
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,190
to assist with

368
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,270
your investigation,

369
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,610
so he asked us to offer them to you.

370
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,530
To prevent information leakage,

371
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,320
please read them here and now.

372
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,140
After you're done, we'll need to retrieve them immediately.

373
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,020
Here and now?

374
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,810
If you please.

375
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,230
Genes are selfish.

376
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,750
Extremely selfish.

377
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,490
They constantly seek immortality,

378
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,420
and we humans

379
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,710
are merely tools

380
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,440
for them to achieve that.

381
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,470
Thus, we've become selfish too.

382
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,760
Gene mutations are the same.

383
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,079
They continue to survive,

384
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,390
which is why humans develop

385
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,670
various diseases.

386
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,810
Our research

387
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,230
uses science to combat

388
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,220
this selfishness,

389
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,230
to suppress

390
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,270
or even alter their expression.

391
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,670
It's similar to your work.

392
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,000
You guys

393
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,750
use laws to suppress human desires.

394
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,540
From my understanding, this selfishness

395
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,190
isn't all bad.

396
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,320
Many good genes

397
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,430
have also been preserved because of this.

398
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,510
Isn't that right?

399
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,960
Of course.

400
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,950
For instance, your extraordinary

401
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,450
artistic sensitivity and insight

402
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,740
must be rooted in a certain gene.

403
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,930
Once that gene is awakened,

404
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,800
your feelings will become increasingly powerful.

405
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,820
It's like those super smart people

406
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,700
we've seen.

407
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,190
Their brilliance stems from

408
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,750
some genetic specificity.

409
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,380
So, Shen Yi,

410
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,610
do you know how lucky you are?

411
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,200
You're the same.

412
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,550
Of course.

413
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,240
We

414
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,780
might be the kind of people

415
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,030
who can change the world.

416
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,520
(List of Flammable and Hazardous Items)

417
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,440
(List of Flammable and Hazardous Items)

418
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,270
Based on the information and footage

419
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,380
you've provided,

420
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,170
we haven't found any issues.

421
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,790
However,

422
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,970
I'd like to meet with Mr. Fang.

423
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,960
No problem.

424
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,740
I'll arrange it.

425
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,490
Experiments are just like this, time-consuming

426
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,900
but quite magical.

427
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,110
Sometimes they're really interesting.

428
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,780
You'll discover many unexpected things.

429
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,170
Officer Du.

430
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,980
What is it this time

431
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,030
that you need my cooperation with?

432
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,030
I called Shen Yi over to share

433
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,060
my research progress.

434
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,110
We need your cooperation

435
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,100
with a case

436
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,450
about An Luran.

437
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,840
We'll do everything we can

438
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,180
to help them.

439
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,310
Okay.

440
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,220
Jiang Feng,

441
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,930
check the lab and the warehouse.

442
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,120
This way, please.

443
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,840
Officer Du, you barely came here.

444
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,200
Come to my studio for some tea.

445
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,550
To be honest,

446
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,060
although I'm not close to An Luran,

447
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,030
I'm not surprised at all

448
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,330
by what happened to her.

449
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,410
How's your personal relationship with An Luran?

450
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,180
Personal relationship?

451
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,660
Although we've known each other for many years,

452
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,480
I don't like her.

453
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,340
We're two different types of people.

454
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,680
She's very ambitious

455
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,100
and sees everyone as a rival.

456
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,580
She needs money and power

457
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,990
to satisfy her desire for control.

458
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,790
Moreover,

459
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,430
her worldly desires are also very strong,

460
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,600
including that Su...

461
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,550
Su Youliang.

462
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,210
Yes.

463
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,750
Su Youliang.

464
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,630
I don't want to make moral judgments.

465
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,030
Everyone has the right

466
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,310
to choose their own lifestyle.

467
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,080
We suspect

468
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,220
that An Luran used trace amounts of thallium.

469
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,140
I don't know about that,

470
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,170
but it definitely wasn't from me.

471
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,150
But we found out

472
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,600
that your gene therapy and targeted drugs

473
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,870
were all tested in her medical center.

474
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,630
Yes,

475
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,430
I do research and development.

476
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,060
She does clinical trials.

477
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,060
Officer Du,

478
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,200
I have no reason to cover for her.

479
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,750
I've been to the warehouse

480
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,510
and the lab.

481
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,230
Based on the inventory list,

482
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,820
nothing suspicious has been found.

483
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,740
The surveillance footage here

484
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,440
is automatically overwritten every month.

485
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,870
But the estimated time of Su Youliang's poisoning

486
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,220
was about six months ago.

487
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,430
The footage from that time

488
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,670
should be gone by now.

489
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,340
What about this month's footage?

490
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,270
The entries and exits

491
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,490
all match the records.

492
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,560
Shen Yi.

493
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,080
Let's go.

494
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,730
Jiang Feng.

495
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,430
Go check the security personnel.

496
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,630
You often meet with him?

497
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,150
His research

498
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,430
is related to genes linked with violent crime.

499
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,890
It's indeed

500
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,040
very helpful for my research

501
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,200
on criminal personalities.

502
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,350
You should maintain boundaries

503
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,310
in your interactions with him.

504
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,060
Don't worry.

505
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,550
We just have

506
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,750
a lot of common ground

507
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,710
in our respective research areas,

508
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,350
and our work provides

509
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,900
support and encouragement to each other.

510
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,400
We don't discuss topics beyond that.

511
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,490
Let me ask you.

512
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,590
If one day,

513
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,960
your work

514
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,200
and your passion didn't line up,

515
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,420
how would you choose?

516
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,800
I believe

517
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,790
they're different paths to the same destination.

518
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,650
Sir,

519
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,560
the painting on the back of the seat

520
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,390
is quite unique.

521
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,870
Did you paint it yourself?

522
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,750
A passenger before

523
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,550
smoked in the car

524
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,760
and accidentally burned a hole in it.

525
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,350
I didn't want

526
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,330
to replace the whole thing.

527
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,870
My son happened to see it

528
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,120
and drew something

529
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,050
around that hole.

530
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,820
I have to say, it looks pretty good.

531
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,830
Sir, could you please go faster?

532
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,550
I'm in a hurry.

533
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,260
Okay.

534
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,140
Poisoned?

535
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,780
During your time together,

536
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,090
didn't you notice that?

537
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,670
No, I didn't.

538
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,540
About six months ago,

539
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,450
he wasn't feeling well for a while.

540
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,410
He got tired easily and didn't look as good as before,

541
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,940
which annoyed me a lot.

542
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,980
I even thought about breaking up.

543
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,430
But he recovered not long after.

544
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
How long exactly?

545
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,600
Less than a month, I guess.

546
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,900
Thallium is slowly metabolized

547
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,040
in the human body,

548
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,610
making it difficult

549
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,710
to recover quickly.

550
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,830
Am I right?

551
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,930
Are you saying Su Youliang

552
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,170
was poisoned with thallium?

553
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,440
How is that possible?

554
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,610
You rushed here

555
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,780
just for this tattoo?

556
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,320
Yes.

557
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,980
In ancient times,

558
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,250
when soldiers died on the battlefield,

559
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,790
other soldiers would

560
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,100
cut off their tattoos

561
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,440
and bring them back to their loved ones,

562
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,830
because their tattoos were the only things

563
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,190
that could prove who they were.

564
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,960
It's the same now.

565
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,850
IDs and dog tags

566
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,250
can all be faked.

567
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,150
Only tattoos are difficult to forge.

568
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,590
But don't you think

569
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,100
the composition of this tattoo is strange?

570
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,270
I always feel that

571
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,850
there are unnecessary strokes.

572
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,990
So?

573
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,710
I think this tattoo

574
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,590
might have two layers.

575
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,480
Although it's well-covered,

576
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,520
some things

577
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,940
cannot be changed.

578
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,080
I want to know what the other layer of the tattoo

579
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,020
looks like.

580
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,060
Su Youliang's sudden death

581
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,940
was mainly due to

582
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,800
earlier thallium poisoning

583
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,700
that had already harmed his body,

584
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,990
and afterward, he took

585
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,150
too many aphrodisiacs.

586
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,500
This bottle was a gift from you, wasn't it?

587
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,210
Yes.

588
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,030
We found

589
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,070
traces of thallium inside.

590
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,470
So you suspect

591
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,470
that I poisoned him?

592
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,210
Why would I poison him?

593
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,620
I have no motive.

594
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,010
Because he deceived you.

595
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,050
About what?

596
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,550
Give it to her.

597
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,350
These are Su Youliang's

598
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,030
chat records with Lin Xiaoyin.

599
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,960
At first, Su Youliang

600
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,980
only wanted to make money from you.

601
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,230
But he told everything you did together

602
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,620
to Lin Xiaoyin.

603
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,990
Then they wanted to settle things once and for all,

604
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,320
so they tampered with the condoms

605
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,310
to get you pregnant.

606
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,640
They planned

607
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,270
to use the child as leverage

608
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,680
to ask you for money in the future.

609
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,560
You thought

610
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,750
you were controlling Su Youliang,

611
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,790
but in fact, from the very beginning,

612
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,830
your every move

613
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,990
was calculated by him.

614
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,310
Look at me.

615
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,240
Give me 500,000 yuan,

616
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,140
and I'll give you something more exciting.

617
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,020
Su Youliang was nothing!

618
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,790
He was just a plaything to me.

619
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,110
I was the one in control!

620
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,670
Who was he to deceive me?

621
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,240
He deserved to die.

622
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,040
It's the price he paid for deceiving me.

623
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,220
Serves him right!

624
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,020
Give me my medicine.

625
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,720
Medicine.

626
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,430
Medicine.

627
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,890
Medicine.

628
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,670
How is she?

629
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,940
An asthma attack.

630
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,480
I gave her the inhaler. She's fine now.

631
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,620
I think

632
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,200
her reaction

633
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,710
when she learned she was deceived

634
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,300
didn't seem fake.

635
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,980
And to put it bluntly,

636
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,510
she just wanted to use money

637
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,070
to control Su Youliang to meet her needs.

638
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,830
Poisoning Su Youliang

639
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,110
and ruining his health

640
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,950
wouldn't do her

641
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,070
any good.

642
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,350
She just said

643
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,940
Su Youliang's health

644
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,230
was bad for a while,

645
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,080
but then he recovered?

646
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,500
Yes.

647
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,700
Logically, with continuous thallium poisoning,

648
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,670
his health should only get worse.

649
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,630
How could he have recovered?

650
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,760
I'll take a look.

651
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,490
Any new findings?

652
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,520
Those were the clothes

653
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,630
Su Youliang wore before he died.

654
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,230
Since his cause of death

655
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,070
was a sudden heart attack,

656
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,530
not a violent attack,

657
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,220
and the poisoning was old,

658
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,950
we didn't examine the clothes

659
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,630
he was wearing when he died.

660
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,830
I just examined them

661
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,050
and found this.

662
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,600
Whose blood is it?

663
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,430
It's not human blood.

664
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,010
It's cow blood.

665
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,740
Cow blood?

666
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,220
(Blood Test Report)

667
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:12,630
I'm not sure what it means.

668
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,500
(Test Result)
I'm not sure what it means.

669
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,570
(Test Result)

670
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,570
Shen Yi just came by.

671
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,960
He thinks Su Youliang's tattoo

672
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,900
has two layers.

673
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,380
The skull tattoo on top

674
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,880
covered his original tattoo.

675
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,310
This is the original tattoo

676
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,310
he drew.

677
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,990
Did he say

678
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,710
what it represents?

679
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,650
No.

680
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,980
He just gave me this

681
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,060
and said he needed to confirm something

682
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,730
before he left.

683
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,570
It's you?

684
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,180
We meet again.

685
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,310
Is there any progress on the case?

686
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,430
When will you

687
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,820
arrest An Luran?

688
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,790
Not yet.

689
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,940
Then why are you here today?

690
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,150
I want to learn more

691
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,620
about Su Youliang.

692
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,570
Alright.

693
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,260
Go ahead and ask.

694
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,190
Can you tell me

695
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,940
how you and he

696
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,720
got together?

697
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,570
We were classmates.

698
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,660
Many girls liked him at the time.

699
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,310
He was always surrounded by them.

700
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,560
But I was not

701
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,370
one of them.

702
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,680
After all, back then,

703
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,120
there were many boys around me too.

704
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,590
But I never expected

705
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,900
that he would pursue me

706
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,890
and put in so much effort.

707
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
Then,

708
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,020
you agreed?

709
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,380
Of course not!

710
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,510
To be precise,

711
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,570
I didn't at first.

712
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,070
But what surprised me even more was that

713
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,820
in order to pursue me, he actually

714
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,469
publicly burned the love letters

715
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,630
from other girls.

716
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,380
That…

717
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,679
seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?

718
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,610
It was very romantic to me.

719
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,010
I was deeply moved.

720
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,110
No man had ever

721
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,190
treated me like that before.

722
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,020
He

723
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,320
made me feel special

724
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,659
and loved.

725
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,150
He drove away

726
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,760
all the boys around me.

727
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,920
He said I belonged only to him.

728
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,100
We were always like that.

729
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,380
He loved me with his whole heart.

730
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,130
He even got a tattoo for me

731
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,710
and made me swear with him

732
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,989
that we'd never betray each other.

733
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,010
He said whoever betrayed the other

734
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,699
would be punished.

735
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,370
Well,

736
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,750
didn't his relationship with An Luran

737
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,270
count as betrayal?

738
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,950
He did it for me!

739
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,470
Since I knew about it, it was not betrayal.

740
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,910
For you?

741
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,590
Yes.

742
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,370
He rented this shop for me

743
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,640
with the money he earned.

744
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,550
His relationship with An Luran

745
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,580
was purely physical.

746
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,940
It was just for that one million yuan.

747
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,530
We agreed

748
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,010
that with that money,

749
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,170
I'd open a studio,

750
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,240
and in the future,

751
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,350
he'd open a clinic.

752
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,820
Then we could live

753
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,920
the life we had always wanted.

754
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,340
So,

755
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,750
at the beginning,

756
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,710
it was you

757
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,380
who came up

758
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,210
with that idea?

759
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,750
No.

760
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,010
It was Youliang.

761
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,700
Xiaoyin.

762
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,520
-Don't get wet.
-Stop following me!

763
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,960
Xiaoyin!

764
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,820
Calm down and listen…

765
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,470
How can I calm down?

766
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,170
That woman wants you to be her kept man.

767
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,350
Instead of refusing her,

768
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,230
you said you'd think about it.

769
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,630
What is there to think about?

770
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,460
If that's the case,

771
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,060
let's break up.

772
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,550
Xiaoyin.

773
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,460
We promised each other

774
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,440
never to say those two words.

775
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,070
Then what do you want me to do?

776
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,620
What am I supposed to do?

777
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,610
You want me

778
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,930
to let you make out with her?

779
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,430
I can't!

780
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,910
Ms. An promised

781
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,950
to give me one million yuan a year.

782
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,330
One million.

783
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,110
It's one million, Xiaoyin.

784
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,160
That's so much money.

785
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,280
What can we do

786
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,510
to earn that much money?

787
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,350
It's just one year.

788
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,240
Just one year.

789
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,610
Once I get the money,

790
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,650
we can live the life

791
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,270
we want, and all our dreams

792
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,550
will come true.

793
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,180
She's rich,

794
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,670
but she's also beautiful!

795
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,470
What will happen as time goes by?

796
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,060
You'll definitely leave me.

797
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,510
You'll surely betray me!

798
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,400
Xiaoyin,

799
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,150
I promise you,

800
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,350
I'll never betray you!

801
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,110
Trust me, okay?

802
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,700
No matter who I'm with,

803
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,690
you're the only one in my heart.

804
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,700
I'm doing all this for you.

805
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,450
As long as my tattoo is intact,

806
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,300
I'll always keep

807
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,480
my promise to you.

808
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,750
I see.

809
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,330
So in this studio,

810
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,010
is there anything

811
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,980
related to him left?

812
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,470
No.

813
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,020
He has a box

814
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,180
that contains some herbs

815
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,670
from his grandpa.

816
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,780
Would you like to take a look?

817
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,790
May I?

818
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,150
Sure.

819
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
Go ahead and look.

820
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,030
I don't know much about herbs.

821
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,050
(Wood Ash)

822
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,610
What's wrong?

823
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,060
Is there a problem?

824
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,870
Officer Shen?

825
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,740
Nothing.

826
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,090
I sense confusion in you.

827
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,900
Next time, come to me for a tarot reading.

828
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,130
Sure.

829
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,320
I'll definitely do that when I have time.

830
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,850
What are you doing?

831
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,440
Xiaoxuan was wandering outside.

832
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,570
You've come at the right time.

833
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,390
Sit down.

834
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,970
What are you doing?

835
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,190
What's that smell?

836
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,960
I'm doing an experiment.

837
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,770
Let me tell you a story first.

838
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,360
Several hundred years ago,

839
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,130
there was a craftsman in Berlin

840
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,150
who made carmine from cochineal.

841
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,060
One day,

842
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,230
he ran out of alkali,

843
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,120
so he borrowed some from an alchemist.

844
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,910
Then he returned home

845
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,060
to make pigments as usual.

846
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,220
Suddenly,

847
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,190
he found that

848
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,030
the precipitate

849
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,380
had turned deep blue.

850
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,090
Later, he learned that

851
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,950
the alkali provided by the alchemist

852
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,420
had been used to distill animal oil.

853
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,270
In the end,

854
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,580
this blue pigment was used

855
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,390
on Prussian soldiers' uniforms.

856
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,550
Hence, it was named Prussian blue.

857
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,000
I know Prussian blue.

858
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,420
That color is very popular.

859
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,670
Among Su Youliang's belongings,

860
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,350
(Wood Ash)

861
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,790
I found wood ash.
(Wood Ash)

862
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:49,350
(Wood Ash)

863
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,360
Theoretically,
(Wood Ash)

864
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,750
wood ash mixed with cow blood

865
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,930
can produce Prussian blue.

866
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,660
It's not human blood.

867
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,840
It's cow blood.

868
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,140
(4. Test Result)
It's cow blood.

869
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,010
He Rongyue

870
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,110
found cow blood

871
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,060
on Su Youliang's shirt.

872
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,050
That's why I'm here.

873
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,440
But what does this have to do with the case?

874
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,100
Prussian blue

875
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,150
is an effective antidote for thallium poisoning.

876
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,910
You mean

877
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,670
Su Youliang knew

878
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,970
he was poisoned

879
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,940
and made

880
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,830
Prussian blue as an antidote?

881
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,810
It's very likely.

882
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,630
Look.

883
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,920
By mixing cow blood and wood ash,

884
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,300
we get

885
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,870
potassium ferrocyanide.

886
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,910
This is the etching solution

887
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,870
I usually use for copperplate printing.

888
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,440
Iron chloride solution.

889
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,160
When it reacts with potassium ferrocyanide,

890
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,830
it should produce

891
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,690
the precipitate we want.

892
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,620
It's showtime.

893
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,620
If I can do this,

894
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,960
for a

895
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,980
medical student,

896
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,640
it's just a piece of cake.
