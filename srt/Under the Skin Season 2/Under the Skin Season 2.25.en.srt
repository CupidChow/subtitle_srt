00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,470
(An Luran)
(Reject) (Answer)

4
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,230
I can't find the core data.

5
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,550
Can't find it?

6
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,680
How is that possible?

7
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,110
Don't you know him well?

8
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,470
Doesn't he trust you a lot?

9
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,750
Is it that you can't find it,

10
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,160
or are you still harboring illusions about him?

11
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,390
I really can't find it.

12
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,030
Tang Keying, wake up.

13
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,030
Fang Kaiyi doesn't like you.

14
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,180
You're worthless in his eyes!

15
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,670
Stop it.

16
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,310
I actually regret it so much.

17
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,860
I just wanted to stay by Mr. Fang's side back then.

18
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,180
That's why I agreed to cooperate with you.

19
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,790
You've been using me all along.

20
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,390
And now I'm being blackmailed by you.

21
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,150
Do you think you have any other choice now?

22
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,910
Who is it?

23
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,070
Mr. Fang, it's me.

24
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,060
Whatever it is, let's talk about it tomorrow.

25
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,460
Mr. Fang.

26
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,870
Have you been drinking?

27
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,780
I...

28
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,190
I've made a mistake.

29
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,230
I'm sorry, Mr. Fang.

30
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,630
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,630
If you want to talk about

32
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,430
you sneaking into the studio,

33
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,170
then there's no need.

34
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,450
They're all pressuring me.

35
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,590
An Luran said

36
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,830
if I don't get the core data,

37
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,390
she'll make me

38
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,550
bear all the consequences.

39
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,080
And that police officer, Du Cheng,

40
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,410
is also on to me.

41
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,520
I really can't take it anymore.

42
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,100
Mr. Fang,

43
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,190
I've actually been thinking for a long time.

44
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,860
I think...

45
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,110
I think we can

46
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,750
give the core data to An Luran.

47
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,450
Once An Luran leaves,

48
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,660
she won't be involved in anything else.

49
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,710
Why do you think I'll help you?

50
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,460
I...

51
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,090
I just want to

52
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,450
get rid of her.

53
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,310
I want to be with you.

54
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,550
Enough.

55
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,870
I...

56
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,310
Everything I've done from start to finish

57
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,910
was all because of you.

58
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,340
I know

59
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,210
I'm not worthy to stand by your side.

60
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,510
So when An Luran told me

61
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
I could join the research institute,

62
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,470
I was overjoyed.

63
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,770
That's why…

64
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,900
that's why I agreed to everything she said.

65
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,630
Everything I've said,

66
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,390
everything I've done, was all because of you!

67
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,870
Don't try to make excuses

68
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,350
for your despicable actions.

69
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,270
You must bear the consequences of your own choices.

70
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,830
You shouldn't have come to me.

71
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,590
Everything I've done was because of you.

72
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,430
It's all because of you!

73
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,430
I'm sorry, I lost my composure.

74
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,030
Go.

75
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,510
I can't keep you here anymore.

76
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,230
Go find An Luran and have her arrange for you to leave.

77
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,550
She's the only one who can help you now.

78
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,420
I'm going back to the studio.

79
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,500
You calm down.

80
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,790
Close the door when you leave.

81
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,620
You still haven't gone back?

82
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,620
I'm looking at gene samples.

83
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,660
Time flew by without me noticing.

84
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,770
What happened to your hand?

85
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,540
It's nothing.

86
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,650
Just a small cut.

87
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,940
How about

88
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,160
you teach me how to paint?

89
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,590
What do you want to paint?

90
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,710
I want to paint the starry sky.

91
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,510
But...

92
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,580
I don't think there are many stars out tonight.

93
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,210
The starry sky is a kind of imagination.

94
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,680
The way each person looks up at the stars

95
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,680
reflects their

96
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,190
unique way of seeing the world

97
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,030
from within.

98
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,870
Every star

99
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,110
is a cell of the universe,

100
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,030
and every cell of a living being

101
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,610
is itself a universe.

102
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,880
I believe a leaf of grass is no less

103
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,390
than the journey-work of the stars.

104
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,620
Walt Whitman's poetry.

105
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,510
We can indeed see

106
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,210
vast information in grass.

107
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,110
DNA

108
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,380
is a powerful storage device.

109
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,120
Take humans for example.

110
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,590
The massive data in DNA

111
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,510
includes

112
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,800
the entire course

113
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,620
of human development,

114
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,320
specific characteristics of family lineage,

115
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,000
and the unique differences

116
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,900
of each individual.

117
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,300
There are also unspeakable

118
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,550
dark secrets.

119
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,670
Unfathomable like the black holes

120
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,910
of the universe.

121
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,380
I really want to know

122
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,790
what your starry sky looks like.

123
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,370
Chaos.

124
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,190
Why?

125
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,550
Perhaps it also reflects

126
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,710
my recent state of mind.

127
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,410
The more cases I work on,

128
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,110
the more I feel

129
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,430
like I'm walking deeper into the mist.

130
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,660
The mist of human nature

131
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,430
is gray

132
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,790
and complex.

133
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,940
But your work

134
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,910
should be clear-cut, black and white.

135
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,870
That's why I believe

136
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,120
that after crossing through the mist,

137
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,670
there will be a different view.

138
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,310
Here with me,

139
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,030
you can completely

140
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,670
focus on your research without distractions.

141
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,660
Humanity

142
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,930
is nothing but innate nature and habits.

143
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,910
Innate nature is naturally encoded in genes,

144
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,010
while habits

145
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,430
have also been engraved into our genes

146
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,790
after millions of years of development.

147
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,380
Please cherish the experimental data.

148
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,320
They sincerely

149
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,140
indicate the future.

150
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,490
Although we're not in the same field,

151
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,580
I believe making the world better

152
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,610
is our shared vision.

153
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I will work hard for it.

154
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,590
Let's go.

155
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,260
Let's paint the starry sky.

156
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,410
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

157
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,440
Captain Cheng.

158
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,250
Tang Keying has gone missing.

159
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,240
How is that possible?

160
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,190
I saw her just yesterday.

161
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,670
She hasn't shown up for work today

162
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,830
and she's not answering her phone.

163
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,790
Her colleagues at the research institute

164
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,000
don't know where she's gone either.

165
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,690
Have you checked the surveillance footage?

166
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,980
Yes.

167
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,990
She left the Kailai Biotechnology

168
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,870
at 8:30 last night.

169
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,950
Around 9:30,

170
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,380
she entered An Luran's villa.

171
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,350
She stayed for about 20 minutes,

172
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,790
and when she left, she was walking quickly.

173
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,550
At 11:30 PM,

174
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,510
she appeared

175
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,710
at Fang Kaiyi's residence.

176
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,860
Fang Kaiyi

177
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,190
left 10 minutes later

178
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,350
and didn't return all night.

179
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,510
As for Tang Keying,

180
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,190
it wasn't until half an hour later

181
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,010
that she left the complex and took a taxi.

182
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,490
At present, the surveillance footage

183
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,900
doesn't show anything unusual.

184
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,960
What about after that?

185
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,540
Where did she go? Who did she meet?

186
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,630
She took the taxi and headed toward

187
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,770
the seaside.

188
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,150
The approximate location was

189
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,270
the deserted beach southeast of Beijiang.

190
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,550
But tourism development

191
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,850
hasn't taken off in that area,

192
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,830
so the surveillance coverage is incomplete.

193
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,030
We can't find where she went

194
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,950
after that.

195
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,720
Before she went missing,

196
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,590
Fang Kaiyi was

197
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,550
the last person to see her.

198
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,450
That's what we know so far.

199
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,450
I see.

200
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,830
(Tang Keying)

201
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,510
Sorry,

(Tang Keying)

203
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,390
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,020

(Hang up)

206
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,040
Mr. Fang.

207
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,490
Do you know where Tang Keying is?

208
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,080
I don't know.

209
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,140
At 11:30 last night,

210
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,890
did she visit your residence?

211
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,710
Yes.

212
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,760
What happened to Tang Keying?

213
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,550
I saw her here

214
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,150
last night

215
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,910
around 8 PM.

216
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,830
You met her?

217
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,510
Yes.

218
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,560
She came last night

219
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,320
to copy materials

220
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,750
from Mr. Fang's computer.

221
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,070
We had a short chat

222
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,920
and she left.

223
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,280
Mr. Fang,

224
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,940
can we go to your residence?

225
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,670
Of course.

226
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,510
Let's go.

227
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,369
Feel free to look around.

228
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,350
Please have a seat.

229
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,950
Tang Keying came

230
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,300
to see you from

231
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,440
11:30 to 11:40.

232
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,620
Yes.

233
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,950
She discussed some

234
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,830
work arrangements with me.

235
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,570
Did you have an argument?

236
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,230
No.

237
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,270
There was a glass vase there

238
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,190
that I accidentally broke.

239
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,760
Did she mention

240
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,020
where she was going afterwards?

241
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,750
No.

242
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,390
What did you do

243
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,390
after she left?

244
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,070
I went back to the studio to learn painting from Shen Yi.

245
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,380
We painted all night.

246
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,390
Yes.

247
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,270
We painted the starry night.

248
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,190
You paint too?

249
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,990
Influenced by Shen Yi,

250
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,920
I wanted to give it a try myself.

251
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,600
We understand the situation now.

252
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,070
Thank you for your cooperation.

253
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,470
You're welcome.

254
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,710
-I'll go back later.
-Let's go.

255
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,490
(Public Security)

256
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,320
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

257
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,510
Tang Keying's cell phone signal
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

258
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,340
disappeared near
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

259
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,350
the beach on Baichuan Road.

260
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,630
A fisherman provided a lead

261
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,030
that he saw Tang Keying around 2 AM last night,

262
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,720
entering an abandoned fishing boat.

263
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,950
What about Fang Kaiyi?

264
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,190
Fang Kaiyi entered

265
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,560
the research institute at 12:15 AM

266
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,630
last night.

267
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,550
He left at 2 AM

268
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,470
and then drove by himself

269
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,590
toward Binxi Road.

270
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,390
But there are no surveillance cameras

271
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,630
near Binxi Road,

272
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,240
so we don't know where he went.

273
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,470
At 4:30 AM,

274
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,150
cameras captured him returning

275
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,480
to the research institute from Binxi Road.

276
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,760
Binxi Road is not far from Baichuan Road.

277
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,900
Li Han,

278
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,200
keep an eye on Fang Kaiyi.

279
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,110
Jiang Feng,

280
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,230
come with me to the beach.

281
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,510
The vase probably wasn't

282
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,750
accidentally broken, was it?

283
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,710
What exactly

284
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,590
happened here last night?

285
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,970
I originally thought

286
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,170
she came to apologize to me.

287
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,150
I never expected she would come to confess...

288
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,430
her love.

289
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,630
Her thoughts

290
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,630
indeed made me feel

291
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,610
a very strong sense of humiliation.

292
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,630
I didn't expect

293
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,710
she would think that way,

294
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,720
to the point that she would

295
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,200
lose her composure.

296
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,270
I indeed couldn't control myself.

297
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,670
But I really didn't hurt her.

298
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,790
What was she wearing

299
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,270
when she came?

300
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,440
I think it was gray clothes.

301
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,230
Are you interrogating me?

302
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,070
Don't I need to confirm

303
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,260
your involvement in this matter?

304
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,790
I really didn't see her

305
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,080
after she left.

306
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,510
That's the truth.

307
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,340
And now, I'm a bit...

308
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,870
worried something might happen to her.

309
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,910
You're afraid An Luran might harm her?

310
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,110
When Tang Keying came,

311
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,110
she was very emotional.

312
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,830
I think

313
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,790
An Luran must have

314
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,990
put a lot of pressure on her.

315
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,990
Moreover, she didn't get

316
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,910
what she wanted.

317
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,700
So for An Luran,

318
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,350
Tang Keying is no longer of value.

319
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,110
Shen Yi,

320
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,150
you must help me find her.

321
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,350
She's worked with me for so many years, after all.

322
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,250
Even if she's made mistakes,

323
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,550
I really don't want anything to happen to her.

324
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,390
But I need to confirm one thing.

325
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,640
What exactly was the thing

326
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,080
Tang Keying wanted to steal?

327
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
You've hidden it so well

328
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,590
and An Luran values it so much,

329
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,400
to the point that if she can't get it,

330
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,260
she might even harm Tang Keying.

331
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,990
So now,

332
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,350
you must be honest with me.

333
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,280
This concerns

334
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,750
what might happen to Tang Keying.

335
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,230
The core data of specialized human embryo

336
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,400
gene editing.

337
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:48,950
Rest assured.

338
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,240
Gene editing

339
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,350
on human embryos

340
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,230
itself is not illegal.

341
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,030
The boundary lies in

342
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,870
whether the results of gene editing

343
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,150
are stored or destroyed

344
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,350
according to laws and regulations.

345
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,520
According to international practice,

346
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,230
edited embryos

347
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,350
must be destroyed

348
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,820
within 14 days.

349
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,840
Going against norms

350
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,590
and implanting them into human bodies

351
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,420
is what constitutes a crime.

352
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,250
I see.

353
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,710
How's it going?

354
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,190
The entire cabin

355
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,390
has been thoroughly cleaned.

356
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,200
We didn't find

357
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,110
any obvious blood stains.

358
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,020
However,

359
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,190
we found this in the cracks

360
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,110
of the cabin floor.

361
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,190
We detected

362
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,670
traces of cyanide that hadn't fully evaporated yet.

363
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,110
Can you extract any human tissue?

364
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,630
If there is any, we should be able to.

365
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,400
Is it possible

366
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,810
that Tang Keying was killed here

367
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,390
and then the body was dumped into the sea?

368
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,310
That's unlikely.

369
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,390
Even if this is

370
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,390
the primary crime scene,

371
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,630
the killer wouldn't have

372
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,460
dumped her body into the ocean.

373
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,780
Why not?

374
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,230
Based on the ocean currents,

375
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,830
if the killer had chosen

376
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,710
to dump the body in the sea,

377
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,490
Tang Keying's body

378
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,990
would likely

379
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,230
have been discovered by now

380
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,640
at a downstream beach.

381
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,070
No matter where you go

382
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,980
from the beach,

383
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,570
you have to pass through this small path.

384
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,770
These tire tracks

385
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,230
are all from three-wheeled motorcycles

386
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,110
and the sand and soil trucks

387
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,330
from the nearby construction site.

388
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,990
This wider one

389
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,030
should be tire tracks from a business sedan.

390
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,490
What's in that direction?

391
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,260
I think it's a fishing village.

392
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,230
Take some people to that village

393
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,070
and ask the villagers if they saw

394
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,230
any business sedans last night.

395
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,050
Alright.

396
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,300
Mr. Shen,

397
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,280
are you here to see An?

398
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,880
My girlfriend's.

399
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,270
Officer Shen, what brings you here?

400
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,020
Is there any news about Tang?

401
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,510
You know Tang Keying is missing?

402
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,920
Captain Du just contacted me.

403
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,240
Last night, Tang Keying

404
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,410
called me.

405
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,560
What did she say on the phone?

406
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,230
I couldn't hear clearly.

407
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,030
When I answered, it was all

408
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,190
jumbled background noise.

409
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,610
I thought it was a misdial,

410
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,460
so I didn't pay attention to it.

411
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,190
This is my fault.

412
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,790
If only I had

413
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,950
called her back…

414
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,870
Ms. An, you went to the seaside again?

415
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,510
The guesthouse also serves as a dating spot,

416
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,230
doesn't it?

417
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,030
Officer Shen, is there anything else?

418
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,070
No, that's all.

419
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,920
Then if there's nothing else, I'll be going.

420
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,920
If you have any news about Tang,

421
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,990
please let me know immediately.

422
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,350
This is

423
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,630
the stuff from Tang Keying's workstation.

424
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,550
Thank you for your hard work.

425
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,790
By the way,

426
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,860
when Tang Keying came to see you,

427
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,750
did you notice her nails?

428
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,950
What about her nails?

429
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,870
Something like this with nail polish.

430
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,670
I think I remember something like that.

431
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,700
I really didn't pay attention.

432
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,350
Do you have any soda in your fridge?

433
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,270
Yes.

434
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,090
What brand do you want?

435
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,320
I'm not picky about the brand.

436
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,640
Okay, I'll go get it.

437
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,590
Captain Cheng,

438
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,040
a business sedan indeed

439
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,750
drove into the fishing village last night.

440
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,910
Due to the darkness

441
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,670
and the high speed,

442
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,360
it hit and injured a villager's dog.

443
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,340
The villager said the driver was a man.

444
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,390
What about the license plate number?

445
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,000
It was too dark, so he didn't notice.

446
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,090
But he said

447
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,080
the driver mentioned

448
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,710
he was heading to the animal protection shelter in Mingnanli.

449
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,230
He promised to take the dog for treatment

450
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,350
and then bring it back.

451
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,480
Alright, got it.

452
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,150
Hello, Xiaowu,

453
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,030
navigate to Mingnanli.

454
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,800
Navigating to Mingnanli.

455
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,890
Why are you here?

456
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,010
It's...

457
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,200
a human's.

Why are you at the animal protection shelter?

460
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,690
Among Tang Keying's office supplies,

461
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,070
I discovered a

462
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,580
calendar with pencil marks,

463
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,590
but the writing was very faint.

464
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,310
so I tried to

465
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,030
restore it.

470

The deceased is Tang Keying.

471
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,150
It really is her?

It seems he's a major suspect.

An Luran's shoes

482
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,190
should have been to the seaside.

The car.

484
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,750

485
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,679
There's a red press-on nail in the car.

Mr. Shen,

487
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,570
are you here to see An?

488
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,400
My girlfriend's.

489
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,670
When I saw Tang Keying yesterday,

490
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,469
she seemed to be wearing

491
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,620
red press-on nails.

492
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,190
Could it be such a coincidence?

493
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,020
Captain Cheng,

494
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,710
I searched Wu Bin's home

495
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,560
and An Luran's car that he was driving.

the face powder Tang Keying used

this car returned to An Luran's villa

at 9:07 PM

514
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,030
two nights ago.

515
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,150
The car left again at 1 AM

516
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,270
and didn't return until

517
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,190
5:48 AM.

518
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,060
It was out for

519
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,270
nearly five hours.

520
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,960
Wu Bin was driving,

521
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,670
but due to the car's privacy features,

522
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,630
it's unclear

523
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,150
whether An Luran was in the car or not.

The time the car left

525
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,950
was 1 AM.

526
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,270
The time it arrived at the animal protection shelter

527
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,070
was 3 AM.

528
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,590
Excluding the round-trip driving time,

529

Tang Keying's time of death

530
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,190
should be between

531

1:40 and 2:30 AM.

532
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,950
Do we have a cause of death?

533
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,270
We found partial skull fragments.

534
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,080
There's deformation,

535
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,580
suggesting she was struck.

536
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,270
There are signs of skull fracture,

537
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,190
but it wasn't fatal.

538

Combined with the drugs

539
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,120
we extracted from

00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,310
the abandoned fishing boat,

541
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,750

It ended before 9 PM.

548

Did you know that?

555
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,030
I didn't know.

In the middle of the night?

557
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,030

What did she do last night?

565
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,150
Last night,

566
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,790
she was with me.

567
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,710
She hasn't been feeling well lately.

568
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,670
I had to stay with her the whole time.

569
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,670
She didn't fall asleep until almost 1 AM.

570
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,710
I was still worried after she fell asleep,

571
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,870
so I slept on the lounge chair in the room.

572
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,310
Are you sure?

573
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,750
I'm sure.

574
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,960
(Interrogation Room 1)

575
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,810
Wu Bin.

576
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,590
Last night,

577
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,620
you went to the animal protection shelter, didn't you?

578
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,960
You used the incinerator too.

579
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,470
It was so late.

580
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,190
What were you doing there?

581
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,000
You know Tang Keying, right?

582
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,390
We found her hair

583
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,560
in the back seat of your car.

584
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,050
You two

585
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,130
met last night.

586
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,150
I killed her.

587
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,280
I... I killed her.

588
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,040
Why did you kill her?

589
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,000
What was your motive?

590
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,120
She annoyed me. I couldn't stand her,

591
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,320
so I killed her.

592
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,410
Last night,

593
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,090
you drove An Luran's car.

594
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,830
I-It has nothing to do with anyone else.

595
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,870
I killed her.

596
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,710
I killed her.

597
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,210
Captain Cheng,

598
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,580
I found out that Wu Bin

599
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,400
originally had severe hereditary anemia.

600
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,300
It was the gene therapy developed by Fang Kaiyi

601
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,430
that cured him.

602
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,260
We have a lead.

603
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,270
(China Construction Bank Transaction List)

604
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,590
Wu Bin was introduced

605
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,990
by Fang Kaiyi to be An Luran's driver?

606
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,320
Yes, and that's not all.

607
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,550
I also found out

608
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,860
that Fang Kaiyi has been transferring money

609
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,110
from his personal account

610
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,030
to Wu Bin every three months.

611
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,070
The amounts have been increasing.

612
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,110
From what I can see,

613
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,470
this doesn't seem like ordinary financial aid,

614
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,950
but rather payment for Wu Bin's services.

615
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,920
Wu Bin has been sending

616
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,870
all these payments back to his hometown.

617
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,150
People from his hometown can confirm this.

618
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,110
That's what we know so far.

619
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,790
So,

620
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,350
Wu Bin is not only

621
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,380
An Luran's driver,

622
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,260
but also works for Fang Kaiyi.

623
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,950
I even think

624
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,950
he might have a closer relationship

625
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,070
with Fang Kaiyi.

626
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,430
We also found out that on the night of the incident,

627
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,750
besides talking to An Luran,

628
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,630
he also had a conversation

629
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,230
with Fang Kaiyi.

630
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,220
Li Han checked the surveillance footage.

631
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,750
Fang Kaiyi left Kailai Biotechnology

632
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,950
between 2 AM

633
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,010
and 4:30 AM.

634
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,480
The technical investigation also found that Wu Bin and Fang Kaiyi

635
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,720
had a phone call record last night.

636
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,960
I was at his studio all night last night.

637
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,290
He was painting with me.

638
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,620
Are you sure that Fang Kaiyi

639
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,910
was with you the entire night yesterday?

640
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,870
There's something wrong with that painting.

641
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,240
(Interrogation Room 1)

642
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,230
We found out that besides

643
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,670
being a driver for An Luran,

644
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,630
you also have financial dealings

645
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,680
with Fang Kaiyi.

646
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,030
Kailai Biotechnology

647
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,510
usually conducts animal experiments.

648
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,150
Tang Keying would contact me

649
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,590
to help them

650
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,550
transport the animal bodies

651
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,180
to the animal protection shelter for cremation.

652
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,540
So, in that case,

653
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,790
you also work for Fang Kaiyi?

654
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,580
N-Not regularly.

655
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,960
It was gig work.

656
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,300
I guess you could call it a side job.

657
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,540
Besides transporting

658
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,130
the bodies of research animals,

659
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,410
what else was part of this side job

660
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,320
you just mentioned?

661
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,120
N-Nothing else.

662
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,890
That's all.

663
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,910
How's your personal relationship

664
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,790
with Fang Kaiyi?

665
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,170
He's the big boss.

666
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,430
How could I possibly

667
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,390
have a personal relationship with him?

668
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,510
Then why did we find out

669
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,450
that you called him at 1:56 AM

670
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,950
this morning?

671
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,030
What did you talk about?

672
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,330
I…

673
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,380
I called to ask him

674
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,470
how to discreetly

675
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,630
dispose of a human body.

676
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,830
Why did you ask him?

677
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,030
I thought he was educated

678
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:47,910
and knew about everything.

679
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,580
Didn't you just say

680
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,870
that you two weren't close?

681
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,870
He once cured my illness.

682
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,090
I don't want to implicate him.

683
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,780
What did he say at the time?

684
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:02,990
He...

685
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,700
thought I was joking.

686
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,410
Wu Bin,

687
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,040
stop talking nonsense here.

688
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,990
Most people hearing this

689
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,550
wouldn't think it's a joke.

690
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,740
Didn't he ask you

691
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,270
why you were asking

692
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,220
such a question?

693
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,270
H-He did ask.

694
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,430
I...

695
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,760
But I felt

696
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,630
he was my savior, after all.

697
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,110
With this kind of thing,

698
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,400
it's not good to involve him.

699
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,290
So I didn't say anything.

700
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,760
Did you tell him

701
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,030
that the body you were disposing of

702
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,950
was Tang Keying's?

703
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,750
Of course not.

704
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,990
Then I just hung up.

705
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,350
Officer,

706
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,030
I... I've already said

707
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,180
it has nothing to do with anyone else.

708
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,630
I killed

709
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,140
Tang Keying.

710
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,790
Wu Bin,

711
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,090
don't think I haven't noticed.

712
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,310
All your answers

713
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,430
are contradictory.

714
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,510
Think it through carefully.

715
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,660
At this point,

716
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,070
it's time to tell the truth, isn't it?

717
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,790
Can I have a glass of water?

718
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,190
Can you drink strong tea?

719
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:11,630
Thank you.

720
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:30,980
I didn't kill her.

721
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,910
The one who killed Tang Keying

722
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,750
was Fang Kaiyi.

723
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,310
I've thought it through.

724
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,470
I don't need to take the blame

725
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,670
for such a serious crime as murder out of gratitude.

726
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,230
Continue.

727
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,350
Last night,

728
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,390
Fang Kaiyi called me

729
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:01,350
and asked me to go to the shipyard.

730
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,800
He said there was something I needed to handle.

731
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,230
I left after 1 AM.

732
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,090
When I got there,

733
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,910
I saw

734
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,100
Tang Keying lying inside.

735
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,630
She seemed to be dead.

736
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,540
He called you?

737
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,030
When you arrived at the shipyard,

738
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,470
you didn't see Fang Kaiyi, did you?

739
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,630
No.

740
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:33,950
Then what?

741
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,970
I was shocked at that time.

742
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,520
So I called him.

743
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,690
He told me to clean up first

744
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,840
and if the police caught me,

745
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,290
I should take the blame.

746
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,240
So after you arrived at the shipyard,

747
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,140
were you sure Tang Keying was already dead?

748
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,220
Yes.

749
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,440
When I got there, she was already dead.

750
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,590
Then why are you retracting your confession now?

751
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,020
I want to live.

752
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,300
