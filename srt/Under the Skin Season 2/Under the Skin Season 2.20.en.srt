00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,100
(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,960
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:49,800
Li Han.

4
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,910
According to the hospital surveillance,

5
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,870
Guo Yuan left the hospital yesterday

6
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,780
at 10:20 in the morning

7
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,830
and got into a black sedan.

8
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,550
The license plate number is

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,789
Jiang A43C68.

10
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,150
Check the vehicle owner's information

11
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,870
and then confirm

12
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,110
all the data images along the route.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,540
Report back to me as soon as possible.

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,920
Captain Cheng.

15
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,030
We've found that this car

16
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,140
was using a fake license plate.

17
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,350
After leaving the hospital,

18
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,400
the surveillance footage along the way showed that

19
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,190
no one got in or out of the car.

20
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,190
This car

21
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,460
was last seen on surveillance cameras

22
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,870
near Renhe Community.

23
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,070
The time was yesterday noon,

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,090
12:15 PM.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,270
Contact the local police station

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,260
for cooperation immediately.

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,710
We'll go there now.

28
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,140
We've found something.

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,579
Some elderly ladies in the community reported that

30
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,550
every now and then,

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,470
Ge Yutian would come here

32
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,310
to take care of an elderly person.

33
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,190
You guys stay downstairs.

34
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,790
You guys come with me.

35
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,400
-Yes.
-Yes.

36
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,040
This is the unit.

37
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll go in first.

38
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,020
Sir.

39
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,470
Sir?

40
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,660
My medicine.

41
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,850
It's time for my medicine.

42
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,310
Jiang Feng!

43
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,760
Untie her.

44
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,980
Call an ambulance.

45
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,200
Dad.

46
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,280
Let that person go.

47
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,710
Dad.

48
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,260
Tian!

49
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,390
Tian!

50
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,590
There are some strange people in our house!

51
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,600
Strange... strange people!

52
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,110
Strange... strange people are here!

53
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,130
You're mistaken. There's no one here.

54
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,040
Dad, it's time to take your medicine.

55
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,540
No one's here.

56
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,360
Time for my medicine.

57
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,910
Officer Du,

58
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,830
I'll return this fake Zhao Yun

59
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,040
to you.

60
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,470
I found

61
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,670
a better candidate.

62
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,910
(Shen Yi)
(Hang up)

63
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,660
Sorry,
(Shen Yi)
(Hang up)

64
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,110
(Shen Yi)
(Hang up)

65
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,430
the subscriber you dialed
(Shen Yi)
(Hang up)

66
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,470
(Shen Yi)
(Hang up)

67
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,310
is unavailable.
(Shen Yi)
(Hang up)

68
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,950
is unavailable.

69
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,950
Please try again later.

70
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,950
Sorry.

71
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,960
Where is my colleague?

72
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,880
What did you do to my colleague?

73
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,210
(Two hours ago)

74
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,210
Why didn't I seize it?

75
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,100
If we had saved her then,

76
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,730
perhaps she...

77
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,990
Uncle, I'm scared.

78
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,080
Save me! Save me!

79
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,060
Ning.

80
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,710
Don't be afraid.

81
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,990
Don't be afraid, okay?

82
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,950
It's all my fault.

83
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,470
This time, I won't

84
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,350
leave you behind.

85
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,880
Ning. Ning!

86
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,870
Save me!

87
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,800
Ning!

88
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,390
Uncle!

89
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,090
Save me! Save me!

90
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,840
Ning!

91
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,669
Save me! Save me!

92
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,780
Ning!

93
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,430
Save me! Save me!

94
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,450
Save me! Save me!

95
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,590
Save me! Save me!

96
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,390
This time, I won't

97
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,680
leave you behind.

98
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,590
This time, I won't

99
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,670
leave you behind.

100
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,750
Officer Shen?

101
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,740
I want to tell you a

102
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,190
story about Feng Xiaowen.

103
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,980
Would you like to hear it?

104
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,310
Sure.

105
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,750
Go ahead.

106
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,170
I'm all ears.

107
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,590
Have a seat.

108
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,220
There was a person

109
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,950
who deeply loved Feng Xiaowen.

110
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,930
He always wanted to set up

111
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,950
a performance for Feng Xiaowen,

112
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,430
the "Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity."

113
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,070
"Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity"

114
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,360
was Feng Xiaowen's award-winning

115
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,910
classic play back then.

116
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,830
Unfortunately...

117
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,770
the theater troupe

118
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,190
dwindled in numbers.

119
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,430
Putting together

120
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,470
such a performance again

121
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,830
was too difficult.

122
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,270
It delayed Feng Xiaowen for ten years.

123
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,390
For ten years, she didn't have the chance

124
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,150
to perform it again.

125
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,270
I know.

126
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,700
She told me about it.

127
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,020
It was her dream.

128
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,310
It was the play she wanted to perform the most.

129
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,070
What a coincidence, isn't it?

130
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,150
That person also knew.

131
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,830
So he wanted to build a stage

132
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,110
for Feng Xiaowen.

133
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,790
He desperately wanted to present

134
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,270
this play to Feng Xiaowen.

135
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,710
This play

136
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,750
is his best tribute

137
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,260
to Feng Xiaowen.

138
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,700
How to start?

139
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,350
How exactly should it begin?

140
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,710
That fat guy,

141
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,990
Zhou Guoliang.

142
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,230
How about

143
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,070
starting the play with him?

144
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,810
Just the clown role

145
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,320
was not enough.

146
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,470
We needed an older female role,

147
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,200
Wu Guotai.

148
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,230
Until one day,

149
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,110
he saw someone

150
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,530
suffering from rickets.

151
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,340
Perfect.

152
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,990
She was...

153
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,220
She was absolutely perfect.

154
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,410
Her face was so vivid.

155
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,970
But her body,

156
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,600
when hunched over, looked so much like

157
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,790
an old woman.

158
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,510
There was no one

159
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,650
more suitable than her.

160
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,780
It had to be her.

161
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,430
But that was not enough.

162
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,760
Still not enough.

163
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,020
What about Sun Quan?

164
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,590
What about the maid?

165
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,430
Yes, yes, yes.

166
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,640
First, find the maid.

167
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,390
First, find the maid.

168
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,480
Sun Shangxiang's maid

169
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,430
was no ordinary person.

170
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,160
She grew up practicing martial arts

171
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,280
alongside Sun Shangxiang.

172
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,190
She couldn't possibly be

173
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,070
an ordinary woman.

174
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,330
He needed someone tall,

175
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,950
with a good figure,

176
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,540
and strong arms.

177
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,470
And that Wang Mengxiao.

178
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,710
She'd be good.

179
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,600
She was 1.7m tall and played basketball.

180
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,460
She was the perfect actress for

181
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,680
the other palace maid.

182
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,790
Sun Quan.

183
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,000
It was hard to find an actor for this role.

184
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,640
Green eyes, purple hair.

185
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,180
He searched for a long time...

186
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
And he actually found one.

187
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,040
That guy

188
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,350
looked just like a foreigner.

189
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,000
And coincidentally,

190
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,890
he dyed his hair purple.

191
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,630
Feng Xiaowen must be

192
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,630
blessing him in heaven, right?

193
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,320
He must fulfill her wish.

194
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,850
Great.

195
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:00,990
Great.

196
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,270
Now we just need a Zhao Yun.

197
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,400
Zhao Yun needs to be handsome.

198
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,180
If he's not handsome, Xiaowen won't like him.

199
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,030
Guo Yuan.

200
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,730
Guo Yuan is really suitable.

201
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,220
She can handle a spear,

202
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,910
and she's handsome.

203
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,290
Damn police!

204
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,840
They messed up the plan.

205
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,060
They destroyed the stage.

206
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,370
They took Feng Xiaowen away.

207
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,330
But it doesn't matter.

208
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:52,960
It doesn't matter.

209
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,920
The stage has never been

210
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,380
a specific place.

211
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,310
It's in the heart.

212
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:09,700
So,

213
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,630
so we must get Guo Yuan

214
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,360
back.

215
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,330
Officer Shen,

216
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,190
your story is a bit scary.

217
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,190
Excuse me.

218
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,650
I won't be reprising that role either.

219
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,170
It's mostly because

220
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,710
I think the

221
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,630
casting director's taste

222
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,620
is terrible.

223
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,380
I'm too disappointed.

224
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:57,950
What did you say?

225
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,060
A terrible taste?

226
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,839
How is it terrible?

227
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,099
Yeah.

228
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,720
Look.

229
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,910
His criteria for selecting the cast

230
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,790
is completely based on

231
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,910
his own imagination.

232
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,200
Which aspect conformed

233
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,710
to the true requirements of the opera's

234
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,670
traditional character roles?

235
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,310
For example,

236
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,310
Wu Guotai.

237
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,180
Peking Opera requires an older female role to have

238
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,150
a large, round face

239
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,270
and a commanding presence.

240
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,540
Now look at Li Hong,

241
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,140
with her pointy chin and sunken cheeks.

242
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,060
Is that suitable?

243
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,780
And then there's that Zhao Yuanqing.

244
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,390
He lacked presence.

245
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,480
How could he possibly play Sun Quan?

246
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,220
If Feng Xiaowen knew from the grave

247
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,510
that she had performed

248
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,560
in such a production,

249
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,140
how heartbroken she would be.

250
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,260
That's why I think that

251
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,800
this person is not at all

252
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,030
fulfilling Feng Xiaowen's wishes.

253
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,040
He's desecrating Peking Opera.

254
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,580
You're not her.

255
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,000
Can you make decisions for her?

256
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,470
Oh, right, right.

257
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,770
And then there's that Guo Yuan.

258
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,310
What I can't stand the most

259
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,260
is that Guo Yuan.

260
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,940
That's Zhao Yun we're talking about!

261
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,880
A man with piercing eyes and a heroic bearing!

262
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,990
Guo Yuan isn't even a man.

263
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,780
How can that work?

264
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,360
We must replace her.

265
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,180
Who should we replace her with?

266
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,050
Who should we replace her with?

267
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,860
I think you'd be great.

268
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,130
How about

269
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,020
you play the role?

270
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,440
Thank heaven

271
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,570
for giving me a real Zhao Yun.

272
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,700
(Hongda Chemical Plant)

273
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:47,480
♫In the past, Liang Hong matched with Meng Guang♫

274
00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:20,780
♫Mother would never act without care♫

275
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,780
Are you satisfied?

276
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,920
Satisfied.

277
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,760
Extremely satisfied.

278
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,540
The stage you wanted to give to Feng Xiaowen.

279
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,740
I completed it for you

280
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,710
with just a few strokes.

281
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,610
Now look at yourself.

282
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,510
Look at these people you've killed.

283
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,430
They should have had their own lives.

284
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,200
And their own stages.

285
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,060
But in the end,

286
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,550
they were all forcibly dragged here by you

287
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,600
to become sacrifices of your love.

288
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,890
Do you really think that

289
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,220
by putting on this festive

290
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,090
"Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity,"

291
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,630
you could give Feng Xiaowen the

292
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,410
eternal stage she had always wanted?

293
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,150
You're wrong.

294
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,790
It's all self-deception.

295
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,390
This is nothing but

296
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,430
a stage pieced together

297
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,650
by your cowardice and guilt!

298
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,950
This is it!

299
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,580
It is!

300
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,710
All of this

301
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,400
is what Xiaowen wanted.

302
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,520
This is the revelation Xiaowen gave me.

303
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,000
She wanted me to do this.

304
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,310
That day,

305
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,910
when I saw her body in the factory,

306
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,710
I didn't know what to do.

307
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,130
My mind went blank.

308
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,370
I just thought

309
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,970
I should let her go with some dignity.

310
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,940
It shouldn't be

311
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,560
like that,

312
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,570
so dirty and messy.

313
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,790
She wouldn't have liked it

314
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,590
that way either.

315
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,550
I had to at least let her leave

316
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,270
in a clean and tidy state.

317
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,530
So I went to buy a piece of cloth.

318
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,780
I wanted to come back

319
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,250
to take care of everything.

320
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,470
Driver, could you help me?

321
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,910
I can't get a cab.

322
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,350
It's just that Lyushui House up ahead.

323
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,620
Could you drive me there?

324
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,160
I'll give you a hundred yuan.

325
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,150
Hey, buddy.

326
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,100
That woman we had dinner with tonight,

327
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,010
she must be nearly sixty, right?

328
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,910
So old and still looking for a man.

329
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,280
And that, and that Li.

330
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,460
He's only in his early thirties.

331
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,480
That guy.

332
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,220
He sold his dignity for money.

333
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,390
He even did this for money.

334
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,310
Exactly.

335
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,970
Right, so old.

336
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,860
So, you see,

337
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,180
the thirties are like wolves,

338
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,890
the forties are like tigers,

339
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,000
the fifties...

340
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,620
I didn't know what to do.

341
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,770
So I just threw that fat guy

342
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,980
into the factory first.

343
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,470
Then I saw

344
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,870
the white patches on his face,

345
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,570
and I realized that

346
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,310
this must be Xiaowen

347
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,460
telling me

348
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,040
to make him the clown actor.

349
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,890
All of this

350
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,200
was Xiaowen's arrangement from beyond.

351
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,200
She wanted this play.

352
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,230
She wanted to perform

353
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,760
in the play she always dreamed of.

354
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,960
"Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity."

355
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,650
"Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity."

356
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,360
This was also

357
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,950
her wish for our love.

358
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,480
You actually know very well

359
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,400
that it wasn't any

360
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,870
revelation from Xiaowen.

361
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,310
The piece of cloth you used

362
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,130
to kill Zhou Guoliang was just stained...

363
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,820
With white dust when u wiped your car with it.

364
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,340
You're wrong!

365
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,660
What do you know?

366
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,560
You're not Xiaowen.

367
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,550
What gives you the right to say

368
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,540
that it wasn't Xiaowen's intention?

369
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,790
How dare you say that?

370
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,060
How dare you?

371
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,710
I dare, because Feng Xiaowen gave up her family

372
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,930
and everything else.

373
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,220
Because she resolutely

374
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,440
chose to be together with you.

375
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,290
From the moment she rushed into the fire,

376
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,350
that was the true swan song of her life!

377
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,469
That far surpassed

378
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,750
all her previous performances.

379
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,030
As for what you've done,

380
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,330
it doesn't even qualify as a memorial.

381
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,040
This is your desecration of her!

382
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,699
You're wrong.

383
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,389
This is not desecration.

384
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,739
This is a tribute.

385
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,880
This play

386
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,310
is about to be completed.

387
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,480
Ge Yutian.

388
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,330
Ge Yutian!

389
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,660
No!

390
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,570
Get up.

391
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,460
Let's go.

392
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,570
Let's go.

393
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,870
Behave yourself.

394
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,810
Was Guo Yuan rescued?

395
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,660
Rest assured.

396
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,590
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

397
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,350
Captain Cheng.

398
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,870
Where's Shen Yi?

399
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,420
Mr. Shen took a day off today.

400
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,790
Why did he take a day off?

401
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,100
He said

402
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,880
he could finally get a good night's sleep.

403
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,000
Have you found anything?

404
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,810
The body has been frozen.

405
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,980
It's difficult to determine the exact time of death.

406
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,350
The body is fully clothed.

407
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,550
There are no large-scale bloodstains at the scene.

408
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,970
But there are obvious drag marks.

409
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,630
This probably isn't the

410
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,190
primary crime scene.

411
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,130
What have you discovered?

412
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,730
I find this house strange.

413
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,610
It's full of chaos.

414
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,930
But it seems to be missing

415
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,040
that homey feeling.

416
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,940
Captain Cheng.

417
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,540
The drawers here

418
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,010
should have contained a large number of watches

419
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,600
and jewelry,

420
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,880
but now they're all gone.

421
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,110
Also,

422
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,130
over here.

423
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,180
This should be the actual crime scene.

424
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,560
It feels like a home invasion robbery and murder,

425
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,590
and then the body was

426
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,730
moved to the underground cold storage.
