00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,020
(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,039
(Episode 3)

3
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,750
Thank you.

4
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,460
Now that you've moved, how do you feel?

5
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,800
Can you sleep better?

6
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,420
Last night,

7
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,000
the girl in the red dress came to me again.

8
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,730
You moved for nothing.

9
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,150
Maybe the problem isn't the house,

10
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,020
but me.

11
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,480
What yogurt is this?

12
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,540
It tastes so weird.

13
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,680
This is...

14
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,420
The paint I made.

15
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,020
Is it toxic?

16
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,300
Did you swallow it?

17
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,570
Should I go to the hospital?

18
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,770
Why don't we ask He Rongyue?

19
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,640
Now that you've moved, how do you feel?

20
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,160
Can you sleep better?

21
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,620
Last night,

22
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,060
the girl in the red dress came to me again.

23
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,320
Something feels off to me.

24
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,470
Like what?

25
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,190
They're just an ordinary father and his daughter.

26
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,740
I don't know.

27
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,630
Looking at them just makes me uncomfortable.

28
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,310
Last night.

29
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,870
Last night, she walked past our car

30
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,390
in that red dress.

31
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,409
Her name is Sun Youning.

32
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,990
She was only seven this year.

33
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,830
Why did I let that feeling

34
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,659
slip my mind?

35
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,200
I should have trusted my feelings.

36
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,530
Why didn't I seize it?

37
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,380
What's wrong?

38
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,420
Yuan Zhaodi went crazy for love

39
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,040
and developed the urge to kill.

40
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,830
But she killed three people at once.

41
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,310
She even employed

42
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,909
the cruel method of slitting their throat.

43
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,350
I think...

44
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,990
Her murders were not entirely

45
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,490
motivated by love.

46
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,910
She must be hiding

47
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,310
a devil in her heart.

48
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,310
But what does

49
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,410
this devil look like?

50
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,190
Everyone's heart

51
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,360
houses a devil.

52
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,230
But not everyone will kill people.

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,080
No matter what,

54
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,940
it's a fact that Yuan Zhaodi killed people.

55
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,980
This is the most important thing for us.

56
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,720
I must pen down

57
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,790
this devil's appearance.

58
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,910
This is more important to me.

59
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,550
That's all for this artist's

60
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,590
recent works.

61
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,470
The six artists featured

62
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,710
in this joint art exhibition

63
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,400
are all deeply creative

64
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,720
and skilled in their crafts.

65
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,510
They are significant figures of

66
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,000
China's modern art scene.

67
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,520
This painter is Shen Yi.

68
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,400
He has a special identity.

69
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,190
He is a sketch artist for the Criminal Investigation Unit

70
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,190
of the Beijiang Public Security Bureau.

71
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,790
Perhaps due to his experience with life and death,

72
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,940
his state of mind is just like his paintings.

73
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,070
It's peaceful and indifferent,

74
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,560
yet profound and distant.

75
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,580
His works are not the most expensive,

76
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,430
but definitely

77
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,010
most worthy of being collected.

78
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,150
As for the three paintings

79
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,540
in front of us right now,

80
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,830
their artist also graduated from

81
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,310
the Zhongjiang Academy of Fine Arts.

82
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,420
What a pity.

83
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,950
I think it's a pity what happened

84
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,840
to this artist.

85
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,250
Why do you say that?

86
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,770
His painting

87
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,170
rely on skills more and more.

88
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,200
Though his skills are mature

89
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,720
and his thoughts rational,

90
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,170
he no longer retains

91
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,720
his keen cognition

92
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,820
and overflowing passion.

93
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,270
Artists

94
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,930
use their senses and touch

95
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,190
to express the world they see.

96
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,070
But he used rationality and boundaries

97
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,360
to bind his senses.

98
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,310
You know him?

99
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,630
No.

100
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,470
But through his paintings,

101
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,910
I can understand him.

102
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,820
He's a genius.

103
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,140
If he hadn't become a cop,

104
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,170
he could have been a criminal genius.

105
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,710
Artists

106
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,810
use their senses and touch

107
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,080
to express the world they see.

108
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,870
If he hadn't become a cop,

109
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,310
he could have been a criminal genius.

110
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,440
Actually, art history

111
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,140
also reads as criminal history.

112
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,060
Like Caravaggio.

113
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,150
He killed and fled,

114
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,620
but left behind masterpieces for posterity.

115
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,210
You should seize the moment.

116
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,930
Capture your excitement in fear

117
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,400
and use it to create.

118
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,590
I should have trusted my feelings.

119
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,360
Why didn't I seize it?

120
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,790
It's all fake!

121
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,550
Shut up!

122
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,240
Shut up! It's not, it's not!

123
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,110
He's a genius.

124
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,900
In this world,

125
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,420
most people

126
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,430
are useless.

127
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,250
Don't kill Doggie!

128
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,550
Useless people

129
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,890
should be killed.

130
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,190
Do you have anything else to ask?

131
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,210
Do me a favor.

132
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,510
Take a look.

133
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,000
Does this painting remind you of anyone?

134
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,750
Yes. Aunt.

135
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,230
Aunt.

136
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,380
Aunt?

137
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,850
Is she coming?

138
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,630
I'm useless now.

139
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,560
Aunt is coming to kill me.

140
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,140
I'm useless now.

141
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,150
Aunt is coming to kill me.

142
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,580
Aunt is coming to kill me.

143
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,270
Useless people must be killed.

144
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,180
I'm useless now.

145
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,990
Aunt is coming to kill me.

146
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,740
I'm useless now.

147
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,870
Aunt is coming to kill me.

148
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,730
Useless people

149
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,390
must be killed.

150
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,280
Who is this?

151
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,150
This is the devil

152
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,390
in Yuan Zhaodi's heart.

153
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,680
I went to see Yuan Zhaodi.

154
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,570
When she was young,

155
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,410
her grandma was always sick.

156
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,750
Her aunt took care of her instead.

157
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,400
And this aunt

158
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,590
is her nightmare.

159
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,910
In the end, she became

160
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,950
a part of her personality.

161
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,040
Yuan Zhaodi’s fierceness

162
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,790
came from the childhood harm

163
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,790
her aunt caused her.

164
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,200
Shen Yi.

165
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,490
We're the police.

166
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,870
Our job is to find the truth

167
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,330
and catch the murderer,

168
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,710
not social investigation.

169
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,270
You have the ability to see

170
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,480
The truth of humanity.

171
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,620
This is a good thing.

172
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,230
But you can't always let yourself

173
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,230
get entangled in them.

174
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,980
Because the deeper you fall,

175
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,420
the more painful it will be.

176
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
I understand your worries.

177
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,350
If I can't capture

178
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,390
the criminal's personality

179
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,670
hidden in their hearts,

180
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,440
my work will never be complete.

181
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,360
Drawing the appearance doesn't matter.

182
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,820
What I want to draw

183
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,080
is the heart.

184
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,020
Captain Cheng.

185
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,110
The time of the crime

186
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,690
is around 5 in the morning.

187
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,880
This should be the first scene of crime.

188
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,710
The victim was stabbed in the left side of his back.

189
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,140
He lost too much blood and became unconscious.

190
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,480
Hello?

191
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,190
The victim's information is confirmed.

192
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,520
(Basic information)(Name: Liu Qiang)

193
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,850
Liu Qiang.

under his care.
(Related experience) (Family information)

212
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,350
And he's usually very friendly

213
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,350
with little to no enemies.

214
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,790
Three weeks before the stabbing,

215
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,550
he posted a missing person notice.

216
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,550
He lost his son,

217
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:36,700
who is blind.

218
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,590
(Family Information)(Name: Liu Xiaopeng)
who is blind.

219
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,300

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,500

(Family Information)(Name: Liu Xiaopeng)

222
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,920
the missing person notice he posted

223
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,150
(Education: Undergraduate)(Household Registration: Beijiang City)
the missing person notice he posted

224
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,750
right now.
(Education: Undergraduate)(Household Registration: Beijiang City)

225
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,550
(Education: Undergraduate)(Household Registration: Beijiang City)

226
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,200
Okay.

227
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,950
Captain Cheng.

228
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,430
I found a kid's backpack.

229
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,850
It's full of loose change.

230
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,420
There's a notebook too.

231
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,470
But I cannot tell what's drawn

232
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,340
in it.

233
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,670
Okay.

234
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,430
Could it be his child's?

235
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,090
Li Han said his child went missing for three weeks.

236
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,390
But these things appeared

237
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,530
at the crime scene at this moment.

238
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,310
It's very likely that someone

239
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,490
kidnapped him and blackmailed Liu Qiang.

240
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,050
It's possible.

241
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,070
He was stabbed in the left rib.

242
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,310
It's very likely

243
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,640
he got hurt while fighting.

244
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,320
Captain Cheng.

245
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,940
The missing person notice.

246
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,000
(Missing Person)

247
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,510
This isn't right.

248
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,390
Li Han said his son was

249
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,370
seven years old.

250
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,270
But the photo on the missing person's notice

251
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,790
looks like the photo

252
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,720
of a three to four-year-old.

253
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,090
Liu Qiang was stabbed.

254
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,550
A blind child is missing.

255
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,990
Then can we merge and

256
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,180
investigate these two cases together?

257
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:53,880
No hurry.

258
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,320
By the way,

259
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,260
I saw a surveillance camera

260
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,320
over there just now.

261
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,510
It's 30 meters away from the crime scene.

262
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,300
But it's broken.

263
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,310
The case reporter

264
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,030
is a citizen who came here for a jog.

265
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,500
He witnessed part of the process.

266
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,720
We've brought him back to the bureau.

267
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,430
Mr. Shen and Mr. Yan are handling him.

268
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,130
What is that place?

269
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,790
Past this embankment

270
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,850
is the city village.

271
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,680
They are all illegally constructed shantytown areas.

272
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,590
It's a complicated place.

273
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,470
Foot traffic is very high there.

274
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,290
Jiang Feng.

275
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,380
Let's take a look there.

276
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,880
Look out for kids.

277
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,510
Okay.

278
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:30,550
His eyes are not big.

279
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,490
(Inquiry Room)
His eyes are not big.

280
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:31,910
(Inquiry Room)

281
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:31,960
His eyebrows and lips
(Inquiry Room)

282
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,630
His eyebrows and lips

283
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,710
are nothing special.

284
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,400
He has a big nose.

285
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,690
But the bridge of his nose is not high.

286
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,710
The part below the bridge

287
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,720
is significantly bigger.

288
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,310
Now,

289
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,150
forget the culprit's face.

290
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,710
I need you to carefully recall

291
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,800
the situation at the

292
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,950
riverbank back then.

293
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,070
Look.

294
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,870
Was it like this?

295
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,590
Yes.

296
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,870
The situation back then looked like this.

297
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,270
Alright.

298
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,390
Now, follow my lead and slowly recall it.

299
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,750
At that time,

300
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,750
you were running along the riverbank

301
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,390
from the west to the east.

302
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,890
The air was moist.

303
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,070
The mist was heavy.

304
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,390
It was quiet all around.

305
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,550
Suddenly,

306
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,970
you heard a quarrel.

307
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,540
So, you looked toward the front diagonally.

308
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,560
About 50 meters away,

309
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,190
you saw that someone

310
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,070
had collapsed.

311
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,620
The other person

312
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,960
was running away.

313
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,610
He shouted in despair

314
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,380
and ran with all his might.

315
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,620
By the sound of his voice,

316
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,980
he was quite old.

317
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,510
But his footsteps

318
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,420
were quite light when he ran.

319
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,580
It didn't suit

320
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,970
how old he looked.

321
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,000
Also, he was...

322
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,640
doing a tiptoe running.

323
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,440
You know,

324
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,350
when the front of the foot lands first.

325
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,000
What does that mean?

326
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,740
Based on my experience,

327
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,000
he has been trained.

328
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,140
But it didn't work out.

329
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,350
What about his speed?

330
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,750
Speed...

331
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,280
He wasn't slow.

332
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,250
I had my eyes on him as he ran.

333
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,710
The surroundings

334
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,310
blurred in comparison.

335
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,270
He ran quite fast.

336
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,660
Come in.

337
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,390
Is the portrait out?

338
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,910
His description was too detailed.

339
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,330
He was at least 50 meters

340
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,410
away from the crime scene.

341
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,720
Before sunrise,

342
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,580
the riverside was foggy.

343
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,060
He wouldn't have seen it so clearly.

344
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,210
His memory is contaminated.

345
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,270
Let's follow your portrait

346
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,430
and find him first.

347
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,640
Don't change the subject.

348
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,180
At 6 a.m.,

349
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,310
where were you?

350
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,990
I...

351
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,870
I was free in the morning,

352
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,100
so I went out to sell some DVDs.

353
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,790
A lot of old men

354
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,570
do their morning exercises there.

355
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,110
Why do you need a knife for that?

356
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,780
It's for self-defense.

357
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,670
That place is next to the city village.

358
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,590
It's a mess there.

359
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,310
I was robbed there before.

360
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,240
You found him so quickly?

361
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,190
Yes.

362
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,060
According to your portrait,

363
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,310
we went to a riverside near the crime scene

364
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,350
where the elderly often

365
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,490
fished and exercised,

366
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,430
and found him.

367
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,590
When we caught him,

368
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,830
he was selling R-rated DVDs.

369
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,640
I think I get it now.

370
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,310
Before the incident,

371
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,250
the witness met Li Bo.

372
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,400
It left him with a deep negative impression.

373
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,190
After the stabbing incident,

374
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,240
the witness was too nervous.

375
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,410
Seeing that the murderer's figure

376
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,390
was a bit like Li Bo's,

377
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,120
he took Li Bo's facial features

378
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,590
and misplaced them on the culprit.

379
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,470

381
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,310
How?

382
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,420
This is all we have.

383
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,430
In city villages like this,

384
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,150
both the environment

385
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,990
and the demographics

386
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,840
are very complicated.

387
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,270
Where should we start?

388
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,110
The culprit should be

389
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,910
an agile young man.

390
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,680
How did you know?

391
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,820
The witness is a football coach.

392
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,240
His impression of

393
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,490
actions, distance, and pace

394
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,710
should be more reliable than his impression

395
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,750
of appearances.

396
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,690
He said the culprit ran on tiptoe.

397
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,750
But based on

398
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,930
his sports experience,

399
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,430
the culprit didn't seem like

400
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,430
someone who had been through

401
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,430
full running training.

402
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,790
So someone like that would have

403
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,470
more developed calve gastrocnemius muscle

404
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,270
and tibialis anterior muscle.

405
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,480
His running stance

406
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,030
would be more like that of a young man.

407
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,340
Give it back!

408
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:09,920
Let go!

409
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,750
Give it to me. I found it first.

410
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,540
What are you doing?

411
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,460
So someone like that would have

412
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,290
more developed calve gastrocnemius muscle

413
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,150
and tibialis anterior muscle.

414
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,600
Get out of here.

415
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,930
If you keep chasing, I'll kill you!

416
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,660

417
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,460

What about him?

432
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,420
I think he ran on tiptoes.

433
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,120
The police are here!

434
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,230
Why are you shouting?

435

The police are here!

436
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,600
Where is he?

437
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,770
I told you, he's ahead.

438
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,920
Be careful!

439
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,910
Run!

440
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,680
Where is he?

I'm fine.

443
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,790
They must be in cahoots.

444
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,900
They know the terrain here well.

445

Captain Cheng.

00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,490
Before Liu Qiang was injured,

449
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,750
the last person he contacted with his phone

450
00:28:59,770 --> 00:28:59,840
was a part-timer in the city village,

451
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,110

was a part-timer in the city village,

didn't deliberately avoid the vital part.

without restraint, like a lunatic.

518

Could they be beating him up

519

so he could beg for money?

520
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,200

572
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,790
You investigated me?

573
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,650
Yun Lei, you're still young.

574
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,250
It's not too late to turn back.

575
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,860
You adults are

576
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,280
full of nonsense.

577
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,440
How long have you been here?

578
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,430
Three years.

579
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,820
Don't you want to go home?

580
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,700
Never.

581
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,500
Where did you hide the knife?

582
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,230
This trick, huh?

583
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,890
I hid it in my pants.

584
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,350
Why did you guys

585
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,070
lock Xiaopeng up?

586
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,440
Just

587
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,070
for

588
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,700
fun.

589
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,570
The five of them are united.

590
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,139
They have conspired

591
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:14,730
to keep their mouths shut.

592
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,940
(Liu Qiang Stabbing Case) (Five-member Group)
to keep their mouths shut.

593

These kids

594
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,330
frequented the police station.

595
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,929
They're experienced.

596
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,380

598
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,710
We've searched the city village.

599
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,389
We didn't find

600
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,800
the weapon that stabbed Liu Qiang.

601
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,510
It could have been thrown into the river.

602
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,800
Liu Qiang is still in the ICU.

603
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,659
He's in a coma.

604
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,949
We extracted the traces we found

605
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,070
on the cage that Xiaopeng was in.

606
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,230
But the analysis

607
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,330
needs more time.

608
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,830
Also, we found a kid's bag

609
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,510
at the crime scene.

610
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,070
The traces on it have been analyzed.

611
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,300
There are some loose changes inside

612
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,800
and a notebook.

613
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,440
On this small bag, we found

614
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,670
fingerprints belonging to

615
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,909

616
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,860
and the five teenagers.

In this notebook
(Liu Qiang)

620
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,790
are some strange

621
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,860
raised marks.

622
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,630
We asked a Braille teacher,

623
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,310
but it remains unidentified.

624
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,510
Most of the notes

625
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,030
are worth one or two yuan.

626
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,550
A few of them are worth more.

627
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:08,810
They seem to be received from begging.

628
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,150
(Five-member Group)(Illegal confinement)(Intentional assault)
They seem to be received from begging.

629
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,550
Seems like he was really being forced to beg.

630
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,940
Mr. Shen.

631
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,910
Do you think that

632
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,310
the marks on the notebook

633
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,670
are Xiaopeng's secret record

634
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,670
of his abuse?

635
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,820
What did Xiaopeng say?

verbal communication

643
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,430
alone is useless.

644
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,620
Xiaopeng is blind.

645
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,580
Moreover, he's a person who has suffered

646
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,970
emotional and physical trauma.

647
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,880
Facing a strange environment,

648
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,410
it's normal for him to be

649
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,460
anxious and distrusting.

tend to feel the world

652
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,830
better with their hands.

Touch it.

656
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,920
Guess what it is.

657
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,750
Here.

658
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,590

what this is.

do you know who

664
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,540
this is?

665
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,650
You don't know?

666
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,320
It's okay.

Let's change to another one.

668
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,280
What about this?

669
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,450
Feel it again.

670
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,830
This person has a big mouth.

671
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,710
A person with a big mouth?

672
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,180
Xiaopeng.

673
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,060
Do you know this person

674
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,910
with a big mouth?

675
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,270
What about this?

676
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,230
And this one?

677
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,070
You don't know this one either?

678
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,240
Here, touch it.

679
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,790
Xiaopeng, you seem to know

680
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,740
who this one is.

682
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,160
Does he look like

683
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,570
the one who made you upset?

684
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,180
I made figurines of the five teens

685
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,230
and let Xiaopeng touch them.

686
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,260
I found that

687
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,310
he didn't recognize

690
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,830
He didn't respond at all.

691
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,430
But when he touched

692
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,470
Yun Lei's figurine,

693
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,520
I saw his hands halt.

694
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,950
His expression changed too.

This means that Yun Lei

had close contact with him.

701
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,030
But when I

702
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,350
tried to ask him more,

703
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,950
he stopped talking.

704
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,500
How about letting Xiaopeng

705
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,820
listen to Yun Lei's voice?

706
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,400

You mean...

762
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,030
Glasses?

763
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,530
Is this the shell?

764
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,470
Good job.

765
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,040
What about his nose?

766
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,870
His nostrils

767
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,630
were

768
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,780
this big.

769
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,460
So thick?

770
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,550
What about his eyebrows?

771
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,540
This uncle's is thicker.

772
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,670
And the glasses?

773
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,210
Was he wearing it like that?

774
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,230
Yes.

775
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,070
Okay.

776
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,400
And his nose?

777
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,190
His nose...

778
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,340
is bigger than this uncle's.

779
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,610
(Treat patients with love and care)

780
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,990
(Treat patients with love and care)

781
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,210
Xiaopeng.

782
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,630
Touch it. Is it this person?

783
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,650
Yes.
