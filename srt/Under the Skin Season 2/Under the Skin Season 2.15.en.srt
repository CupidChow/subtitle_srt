(Episode 15)

3
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,390
Have a seat.

4
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,150
Can I sit across from her?

5
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,729
(Strict Regulation, Fairness and Justice, Procedural Legality, Objectivity and Impartiality)

6
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,560
I have nothing

7
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,780
to say to her.

8
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,740
Well, that's unfortunate,

9
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,840
because I have a lot

10
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,130
to say to you.

11
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,550
Are you crazy?

12
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,360
No matter what,

13
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,360
you and Jingjing

14
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,770
were once good friends.

15
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,350
How could you be so cruel

16
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,510
as to try to kill us?

17
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,190
Since you know

18
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,360
Jingjing and I

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,630
were good friends back then,

20
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,350
why did you

21
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,910
have to mess with both of us at the same time?

22
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,310
Now that you're about to get married,

23
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,310
why are you still the same as before?

24
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,630
Can't you treat Jingjing well?

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,620
What do you mean by the same as before?

26
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,000
What did I do?

(Palmfire Streaming)

30
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,750
was you, right, Luo Yifan?

31
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,080
Or am I

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,110
so unforgettable to you

33
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,510
that even when you are

34
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,680
with Jingjing,

35
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,950
you still fantasize about me?

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,260
That's nonsense, Ao Li!

37
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,810
Aren't you disgusted with yourself?

38
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,710
Don't believe

39
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,580
anything she says.

40
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,710
This is the same trick

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,120
she used back then.

42
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,290
Did it work?

43
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,230
Sit down.

44
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,910
Talk calmly.

45
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,480
Back then?

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,600
In terms of playing mind games,

47
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,690
I certainly couldn't outplay you.

48
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,020
Baby.

49
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,060
Did you miss me?

50
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,450
What's wrong?

51
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,230
I finally managed to make time

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,329
to be with you.

53
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,650
Why are you so upset?

54
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,660
You met Yan Jingjing behind my back,

55
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,270
didn't you?

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,130
Who told you that?

57
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,980
It's not like that.

58
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,280
I saw it with my own eyes.

59
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,900
At the movie theater.

60
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,040
Baby,

61
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,400
don't be angry.

62
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,500
Let me explain.

63
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,750
Yan Jingjing asked me out.

64
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,210
I saw it with my own eyes!

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,130
Who on earth am I to you?

66
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,600
Luo Yifan.

67
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,250
You're playing me, aren't you?

68
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm not.

69
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,750
It's not what you think.

70
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,070
D-Don't be angry.

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,950
Look,

72
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,670
my body

73
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,860
is so honest with you.

74
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,580
Be good, baby.

75
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,600
Even if I date someone in the future,

76
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,510
I'll still meet you once a week

77
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,260
as I did before,

78
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,070
okay?

79
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,340
Yes.

80
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,920
I was out of my mind back then.

81
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,540
I couldn't accept it.

82
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,230
I was dead set on taking you away

83
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,310
from Jingjing,

84
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,590
but I never expected that

85
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,630
you had such a foolproof plan.

86
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,780
You even plotted against me!

87
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,870
Fine.

88
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,750
I decided to escape

89
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,030
from the two of you.

90
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,360
But you're actually so disgusting.

91
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,710
Even now,

92
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,350
you still won't leave me alone!

93
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,830
Ao Li.

94
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,560
Ao Li.

95
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,360
What's bothering you?

96
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,370
You can talk to me.

97
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,020
You didn't have to do that.

98
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,910
As long as you two can't get married,

99
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,710
I'm happy.

100
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,640
I know.

101
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,890
You nailed a chicken head to my door

102
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,910
to get my attention.

103
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,670
Actually, back then,

104
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,540
if you hadn't been so stubborn,

105
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,070
we wouldn't have had to

106
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,140
break up.

107
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,300
Luo Yifan,

108
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,940
you're still such a confident jerk.

109
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,440
I've come to you,

110
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,010
so don't talk like that.

111
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,990
That's no fun.

112
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,850
It is fun.

113
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,070
It'll be a lot of fun when I tell Yan Jingjing.

114
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,220
Don't make a scene, Ao Li.

115
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,340
Ao Li,

116
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,140
stop pretending to be tough, okay?

117
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,020
I saw

118
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,670
what you did

119
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,990
in your livestream.

120
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,510
It really broke my heart.

121
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,580
There's a hotel nearby.

122
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,620
If you have any grievances,

123
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,600
you can take your time to tell me.

124
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,350
Luo Yifan.

125
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,570
Are you sick in the head?

126
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,940
Get lost!

127
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,780
Everyone's been fooled by you.

128
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,220
Only I know your true colors.

129
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,630
Why are you

130
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,710
making things up?

131
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,170
Who do you think

132
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,450
Jingjing will believe,

133
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,909
you or me?

134
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,610
You've said so much,

135
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,190
but do you have evidence to prove

136
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,460
that account is mine?

137
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,200
I want to sue her for defamation!

138
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,560
Evidence?

139
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,340
We have it.

140
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,110
This account has been following Ao Li for a long time

141
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,350
and frequently left her

142
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,400
provocative comments.

143
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,750
Well, what...

144
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,950
what does that have to do with me?

145
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,230
The phone number linked to this account

146
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,830
is not yours

147
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,510
but your cousin's.

148
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,870
But

149
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,650
that doesn't prove anything.

150
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,140
I don't even know

151
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,120
my cousin's phone number.

152
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,300
This account really isn't mine.

153
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,520
Luo Yifan.

Luo Yifan.

155
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,360
(Strict Regulation, Fairness and Justice, Procedural Legality, Objectivity and Impartiality)

156
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,770
What have you done?

157
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,240
I hope you can make it clear.

158
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,720
Jingjing.

159
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,230
Jingjing.

160
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,470
I meant every word

161
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,480
I said to you.

162
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,630
These people

163
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,190
are all helping Ao Li.

164
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,270
You must not believe

165
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:20,870
what they say.

166
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,890
Let's go.

167
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,830
Back then,

168
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,140
he always made me get a hotel room,

169
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,220
and he'd come up later.

170
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,350
He was afraid of

171
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,320
leaving evidence that he slept with me.

172
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,630
Also, he never expressed his affection

173
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,620
in text messages or on the phone.

174
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,680
He only did it when we were

175
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,820
in a hotel room face to face.

176
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,870
That's not true!

177
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,270
Ao Li,

178
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,100
I'll say it again.

179
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,060
I have no feelings for you.

180
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,900
The only person I've ever loved

181
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,550
is Yan Jingjing!

182
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,940
You and I,

183
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,790
from beginning to end,

184
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,910
have only been colleagues.

185
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,950
Understand?

186
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,300
We slept together.

187
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,910
When did that happen?

188
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,620
That's nonsense, Ao Li!

189
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,420
Hey, Jingjing.

190
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,990
I've delivered the medicine.

191
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,550
But there's something

192
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,670
I must tell you about.

193
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,860
Your good friend, Ao Li,

194
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,740
tricked me into delivering medicine for her

195
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,620
and tried to seduce me!

196
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,210
Stop!

197
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,150
Yan Jingjing!

198
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,750
You…

199
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,980
Yan Jingjing!

200
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,860
He's a scumbag!

201
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,190
Break up with him!

202
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,160
Ao Li.

203
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,510
When did I ever

204
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,550
have a relationship with you?

205
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:35,830
Fine.

206
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,380
Show me the hotel records

207
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,940
and text histories.

208
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,150
Show me!

209
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,690
See?

210
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,890
She's a lunatic!

211
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
A psycho!

212
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,400
Jingjing.

213
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,560
Believe me,

214
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,490
okay?

215
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,030
Yes.

216
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,560
I lost my mind

217
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,720
and was seduced by her,

218
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,830
but I swear

219
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,830
I've long

220
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,880
cut ties with her.

221
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,190
In my heart,

222
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,230
you're the one

223
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,070
I truly love.

224
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,440
Luo Yifan.

225
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,680
She was my best friend

226
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
at that time!

227
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,790
How could I be so naive?

228
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,660
I can't believe you've been deceiving me all this time.

229
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,470
It's not like that, Jingjing.

230
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,840
It really isn't.

231
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,400
I truly…

232
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,140
Enough!

233
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,110
Do you think

234
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,220
I'll forgive you over and over again,

235
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,150
only for you to

236
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,870
deceive me time after time?

237
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Do you think I can't

238
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,330
bring myself to leave you?

239
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,640
No.

240
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,060
How could I be so stupid?

241
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,280
What have I been doing all these years?

242
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,180
Jingjing.

243
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,790
Listen to me, please.

244
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,880
Y-You…

245
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,820
Get away!

246
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,780
You'll regret this.

247
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,230
Let's first take away

248
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,580
your personal belongings.

249
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,540
Later, you can find a moving company.

250
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,330
Here, let me.

251
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,110
Here.

252
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,720
Thank you, sir.

253
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,660
You're welcome.

254
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,470
I can move myself.

255
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,970
My dad had to make you help me.

256
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,770
I volunteered.

257
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,340
I just thought

258
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,580
if you came back alone

259
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,040
to get things from the new apartment,

260
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,550
it might bring back memories

261
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,390
and be painful.

262
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,790
So I wanted to check on you.

263
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,730
You know what?

264
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,790
I checked our

265
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,290
shared computer account.

266
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,560
It's never been just me.

267
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,490
Besides Ao Li,

268
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,150
there were other women too.

269
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,140
I think

270
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,450
being able to see his true colors before marriage

271
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,040
is actually a good thing.

272
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,270
We can be wrong about people now and then.

273
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,710
Don't be too upset.

274
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,630
But when I think about

275
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,550
the things he did,

276
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,930
I feel so disgusted

277
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,340
that I'm not as sad anymore.

278
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,310
Actually, I've been thinking,

279
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,020
should I

280
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,220
thank Ao Li?

281
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,350
Thank her?

282
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,400
I've thought about a lot of things lately.

283
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,920
Back when we were in college,

284
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,920
we dressed

285
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,510
the same and everything.

286
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,930
Even our personalities were the same.

287
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,390
Later,

288
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,280
things gradually changed.

289
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,280
At first, I thought it was

290
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,960
for personal reasons.

291
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,380
I didn't expect

292
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,910
she had been through so much too.

293
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,560
Haven't you been through a lot too?

294
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,360
Yet you're always thinking about others.

295
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,110
From now on, you need to love yourself more,

296
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,830
okay,

297
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,860
Yan Jingjing?

298
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,260
We all need to love ourselves.

299
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,410
Don't cry.

300
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,620
Let's go.

301
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,020
Han,

302
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,630
I want to ask you

303
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,590
for one more favor.

304
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,700
(Pizza Hut)

305
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,370
You look quite different today.

306
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,540
Why did you ask me out?

307
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,870
Jingjing asked me to.

308
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,490
Don't worry.

309
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,980
I won't do anything to her.

310
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,080
I've already given up on what I wanted to do.

311
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,190
Anyway, I've achieved my goal.

312
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,510
When something upsets me,

313
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,620
I just can't let it go.

314
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,870
I have to

315
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,590
let it all out

316
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,680
to feel at ease.

317
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,590
I just like

318
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,050
to mess everything up.

319
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,210
It's terrible, isn't it?

320
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,040
I don't like who I've become,

321
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,230
but this is who I am.

322
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,820
I used to be like you.

323
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,390
I also thought I was terrible.

324
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,090
Gradually,

325
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,870
I became

326
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,070
a sensitive snail,

327
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,700
afraid to step out of my shell.

328
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,580
But later,

329
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,970
I realized that

330
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,550
only after you accept yourself

331
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,220
will the world

332
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,190
become what you like it to be.

333
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,510
Jingjing asked me to give you this.

334
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,800
(Luo Yifan and Yan Jingjing)

335
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,540
She's still marrying Luo Yifan?

336
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,950
The wedding is on Sunday.

337
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,010
You can come

338
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,870
or not.

339
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,970
(Luo Yifan and Yan Jingjing)

340
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,400
(Luo Yifan and Yan Jingjing) (We're getting married!)

341
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,590
(Happy Marriage)

342
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,350
What does this mean?

343
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,100
Where is everyone?

344
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,150
What's going on?

345
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,560
You're messing with me, aren't you?

346
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Yan Jingjing.

347
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,550
If you want to get back at me,

348
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,890
come at me directly!

349
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,690
Don't pull these weird stunts!

350
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,150
Ao Li.

351
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,650
If I were to marry Luo Yifan,

352
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,510
what would you say to congratulate me?

353
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,870
If you married him,

354
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,870
you'd be doomed.

355
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,280
Congratulate you?

356
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,820
Like hell I would!

357
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,520
You'd wish for us to share the same bed but dream different dreams—

358
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,210
Luo Yifan dreaming of his lovers every night,

359
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,320
while I, Yan Jingjing,

360
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,130
lie awake all night, crying my heart out.

361
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,670
And the worst part?

362
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,600
I wouldn't even have anyone to talk to about it.

363
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,630
I'd deserve it, wouldn't I?

364
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,780
And when you wanted to end

365
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,030
that marriage,

366
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,670
you'd look at your children

367
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,970
and your aging face

368
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,750
and get cold feet.

369
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,130
So you'd have to swallow your pride

370
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,990
and live with that man unwillingly

371
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,270
for the rest of your life.

372
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,320
Sounds familiar?

373
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,600
The lyrics we wrote in college.

374
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,990
We even agreed

375
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,110
that when either of our exes got married,

376
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,310
we'd sing it at their wedding.

377
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,620
The one who didn't sing would be a coward.

378
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,790
Too bad we weren't talented enough

379
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,800
to finish it.

380
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,660
Yan Jingjing.

381
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,910
You've made such a big fuss

382
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,510
just to be here

383
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,710
reminiscing with me?

384
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,300
How can you still be so naive?

385
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,220
I am naive.

386
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,990
What can I do?

387
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,370
I spent so much money.

388
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,270
When I see these things now,

389
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,410
I feel mad!

390
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,690
Now you're cutting the photos.

391
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,550
Where were you earlier?

392
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,960
Don't you hate my naivety?

393
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,230
Don't you hate that I'm stupid?

394
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,750
Don't you hate

395
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,990
that I was with Luo Yifan?

396
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,270
What about you?

397
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,500
What about me?

398
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,990
You put on makeup like this

399
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,950
and dress yourself like this.

400
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,460
You danced like that

401
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,340
on a live-streaming platform.

402
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,980
Are you still you?

403
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,020
I like it this way!

404
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,190
Look who's talking.

405
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,270
You changed yourself

406
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,390
for Luo Yifan.

407
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,220
Where's the old you?

408
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,550
Where did she go?

409
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,500
Didn't I

410
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,710
warn you again and again?

411
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,910
Didn't I tell you

412
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,010
he's a jerk?

413
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,330
But you never

414
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,370
believed me for a second!

415
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,030
I believed you!

416
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,510
When?

417
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,670
Ao Li.

418
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,380
You know what?

419
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,400
From the very beginning,

420
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,630
I believed

421
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,390
that the person you were targeting was Luo Yifan,

422
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,610
not me.

423
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,060
You bitch.

424
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,350
The bitch you can never kill.

425
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,170
You're such a fool.

426
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,530
I heard Ao Li and Jingjing made up.

427
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,140
It's all thanks to you guys.

428
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,400
You've done Yan a big favor.

429
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,080
You came all the way here to see me.

430
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,940
It can't be just to say that, can it?

431
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,530
I sensed Ao Li was dangerous

432
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,780
and predicted

433
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,030
her car accident plan.

434
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,330
But nothing happened.

435
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,910
In the end, she didn't

436
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,870
take that step.

437
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,580
I didn't expect that.

438
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,870
Her plan wasn't perfect to begin with.

439
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,210
During the wedding shoot,

440
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,390
the car speed was steady.

441
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,570
It even slowed down at turns.

442
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,790
Ao Li overlooked

443
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,710
the most important factor.

444
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,310
Perhaps Ao Li

445
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,090
never intended it to be foolproof.

446
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,910
When she completed her plan

447
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,100
in the mini storage,

448
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,580
the murder

449
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,770
had been carried out in her head.

450
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,710
What stopped her from taking that step

451
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,360
was likely Yan Jingjing.

452
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,950
The moment she saw

453
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,110
Yan Jingjing…

454
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,060
She changed her decision.

455
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,540
So,

456
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,550
although Ao Li is aggressive

457
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,230
and dangerous,

458
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,480
she may not necessarily commit a crime.

459
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,530
I understand.

460
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,320
Alright.

461
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,490
You're the expert at capturing traces.

(Yan Jingjing)
(Reject) (Answer)

463
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,340
What?

464
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,220
I've got some great news.

465
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,390
Luo Yifan just got transferred to the head office,

466
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,620
and he's already been fired.

467
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,940
Really?

468
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,320
You didn't have anything to do with this, did you?

469
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,080
Don't be so blunt about it.

470
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,230
Jerk.

471
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,370
Serves him right!

472
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,140
Do you think what I did

473
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,470
was a bit childish?

474
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,230
Childish decisions

475
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,460
are what make people adorable.

(Beijiang Branch, Beijiang City Public Security Bureau)

477
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,750
Good morning, Captain Cheng.

478
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,440
Captain Cheng.

479
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,000
Look who this is.

481
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,390
What's this?

483
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,870
Take a closer look.

(House of Flowers)

485
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,350
That's…

486
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,110
Min Xue?

487
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,130
Yes.

488
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,310
I just happened to

489
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,270
come across this video.

490
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,450
She looked familiar,

491
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,950
so I ran a check. It's really her.

492
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,190
Who's Min Xue?

493
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,790
She was the victim in a case

494
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,590
that Captain Lei handled

495
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,830
when I first became a criminal investigator.

496
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,600
This poor girl had a tough life.

497
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,740
She grew up in an orphanage.

498
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,240
Later, she was adopted,

499
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,510
but while she was still a minor,

500
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,750
she was sexually abused by her adoptive father.

501
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,510
Captain Lei put in a lot of effort

502
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:52,580
to rescue her.

503
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,590
(House of Flowers)
to rescue her.

(House of Flowers)

505
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,050
We kept an eye on her until she became an adult.
(House of Flowers)

506
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
What is she doing now?

507
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,120
It seems she's running a charity

508
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,650
called the House of Flowers,

509
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,150

515
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,260
I'm surprised that she's so caring.

516
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,770
It must be challenging for her to do this.

517
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,420
Do you think we should help her?

518
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,540
Since it's a charity, we'll definitely help.

519
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,880
How old is she now?

520
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,410
Now…

521
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:21,690
twenty-four or twenty-five.

(House of Flowers)

530
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,350
her face doesn't look natural.
(House of Flowers)

531
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,930
Did she do something to it?

532
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,350
Impossible.

533
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,470
When I met her,

534
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,310
she looked like this.

535
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,410
And this is a video.

536
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,050
It's not real.

537
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,250
People nowadays

538
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,440
use filters to look better.

539
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,220
Look at how many girls she's taken in.

540
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,890
How could she afford plastic surgery?

541
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,480
I'll go report this to Director Zhang

542
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,060
and ask her to mobilize everyone.

543
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,220
Dr. He,

544
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,250
what do you think?

545
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,490
Director Zhang!

546
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,990
Director Zhang.

547
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,350
When will you

548
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,690
learn to knock on the door?

549
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,250
It's good news.

550
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,790
Alright, go ahead.

551
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,890
What's the good news?

552
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,160
Do you remember Min Xue?

553
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,080
Min Xue?

554
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,930
The underage victim

555
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,120
who was sexually abused by her foster father?

556
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,960
Yes.

557
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:21,950
What about her?

558
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,990
She's now running

559
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,880
a rescue station,

560
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,910
dedicated to helping

561
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,160
young women from troubled families.

562
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,100
That's great.

563
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,580
That young girl

564
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,510
has not only

565
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,790
overcome her psychological trauma

566
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,110
but is also doing charity work now.

567
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,730
It seems Captain Lei's

568
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,910
efforts for her weren't in vain.

569
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,110
However,

570
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,940
she seems to be quite tight on money.

571
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,740
I guess it's difficult for her to keep it afloat.

572
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,110
So I'm thinking,

573
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,250
can we organize

574
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,490
a fundraiser in the bureau to help her?

575
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,730
Sure, let's do it.

576
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,730
If we're

577
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,120
to raise money,

578
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,020
shouldn't you set an example

579
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,740
for everyone?

580
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,110
This way, we'll know

581
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,390
how much to donate.

582
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,640
How much are you all planning to donate?

583
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,830
Whatever feels right to you.

584
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,390
If you're donating 500 yuan,

585
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,770
I should at least donate 1,000 yuan.

586
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,480
How about this?

587
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,590
I'll donate 2,000.

588
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,420
Director Zhang,

589
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,440
you're so generous!

590
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,230
Don't just donate money.

591
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,200
When you have time, go and see

592
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,630
if there's anything specific

593
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,690
she needs help with.

594
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,550
After all, it was a case

595
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,390
Captain Lei was responsible for.

596
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,390
Okay.

597
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,170
Put it here.

598
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,020
Give me some.

599
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,670
Come on.

600
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:41,800
A little higher on this side.

601
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,830
(Police and Community Cooperation: Building a Foundation for Healthy Growth)
A little higher on this side.

(Police and Community Cooperation: Building a Foundation for Healthy Growth)

603
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,420
Yes.

604
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,320
Hang this here.

605
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,790
Good, good.

606
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,700
Such a grand occasion, huh?

607
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,690
Open this side.

608
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,670
Welcome, officers!

609
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,150
It's been so many years.

610
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,510
You haven't changed a bit.

611
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,750
Du, you've changed a lot

612
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,430
after becoming the captain.

613
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,480
You're so good with words now.

614
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,960
We're just here

615
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,260
because we heard you're running a charity

616
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,480
and we thought we could help out.

617
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,100
Captain Lei helped me a lot back then.

618
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,940
Now that I have the means,

619
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,070
I also want to do my best to help those I can.

620
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,450
We brought something.

621
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,310
Oh, Huanhuan.

622
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,260
Guys, come get this.

623
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,790
Come on.

624
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,390
Hurry.

625
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,910
Here.

626
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,490
We need a man here.

627
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,050
Huanhuan.

628
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,820
Check if everything's ready inside.

629
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:25,730
Okay.

630
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,320
She's one of the girls you're helping?

631
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,240
She looks quite mature.

632
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,750
Yes.

633
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,030
She just turned eighteen.

634
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,170
Her parents were involved in organized crime.

635
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,490
They're both serving time in prison.

(Police and Community Cooperation: Building a Foundation for Healthy Growth)

637
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,630
Go in and take a look.
(Police and Community Cooperation: Building a Foundation for Healthy Growth)

638
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,590
The girls who often come here

639
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,710
are all from poor or troubled families.

640
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,250
So our assistance can't be forced.

643
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,500
We need to make them want to come here.
(Architecture Paradise)

644
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,010
So, we came up with the idea

645
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,110
of using art

646
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,340
to cultivate their interests.

and regain their confidence.

657
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,620
Using art for healing

658
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,900
is indeed very suitable for these girls.

659
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,470
If you need,

660
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,180
I can come and help you.

661
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,510
Thank you.

662
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,430
Most of the girls here

663
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,510
have experienced psychological trauma.

664
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,350
We also regularly invite psychologists over

665
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,530
to provide psychological counseling and sex education for them.

666
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,140
Your donation has come

667
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,930
at just the right time.

are upstairs.

673

Captain Cheng,

674
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
you were so young in this photo.

675
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,320
That photo was taken

676
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,230
after Captain Lei died.

I've always regretted
(Wall of Honor)

680
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,910
I've always regretted

681
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,230
not taking a picture

682
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,270
with him back then.

683
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,420
He helped me so much.

684
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,510
If he could see

685
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,590
how great you are now,

686
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,300
he'd be very glad.

687
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,370
Du, let's take a photo together

688
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,469
to remember this day.

689
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,489
I'll help you.

690
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,790
Come on.

691
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,010
One, two, three.

692
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,370
Done.

693
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,270
Working late?

694
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,560
What are you doing?

695
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,719
I'm studying

696
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,870
Min Xue's facial proportions.

697
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,640
Can't you just let her go?

698
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,120
I still feel

699
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,030
she doesn't look like

700
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,430
a girl in her mid-twenties.

701
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,930
So how old do you think

702
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,830
she should be?

703
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,780
At least five years older than she is now.

704
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,780
Around thirty.

705
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,150
Then what do you think

706
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,820
that means?

707
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,020
Well, I think

708
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,830
it's just a force of habit.

709
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,960
I'm curious

710
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,900
and want to figure it out.

711
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,240
You

712
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,030
are just paranoid

713
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,220
and try to get to the bottom of everything.

714
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,980
You'll drive yourself crazy sooner or later.

715
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,340
We've known Min Xue for a long time.

716
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,240
There can't be any problems.

717
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,270
Here.

718
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,400
Have a glass of Orange Americano.

719
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,270
It'll perk you up.

720
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,680
Thanks.

721
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,170
Don't stay too late.

722
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,590
Hello.

723
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,430

Please wait a moment.
(Name: Min Shengmei)

728
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,510
Kids these days

729
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,430
have really been spoiled

730
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,380
by their parents.

731
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,700
She said it's too noisy at home

732
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,550
and demands to stay at a hotel

733
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,790
to focus on studying.

734
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,190
Do you think Mom's money

735
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,230
grows on trees?

736
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,290
You bad girl.

737
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,230
Mirror.

738
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,640
Watch your attitude.

739
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,820
Don't get impatient with me.

740
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,220
People will laugh at us.

741
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,180
Alright.

742
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,790
Here, madam.

743
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,650
Room 1018.

744
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,390
Thank you.

745
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:39,860
This way?

746
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,570
Yes.

747
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,090
Stop chewing.

748
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,450
Sorry

749
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,750
for keeping you waiting.

750
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,350
Say hi.

751
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,290
Hi.

752
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,840
Sit down.

753
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,910
Come on.

754
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,890
Hurry. You've met before.

755
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,530
Don't be so shy.

756
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,740
He's so nice to you.

757
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,090
He bought you so many gifts.

758
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,220
I'll be next door.

759
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,410
Take your time chatting.

00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,480
The deceased is named Wei Xianzhong.
(Police)

762
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,710
At 5:20 in the morning,

763
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,970
he fell from the roof of this building.

764
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,920
The person who reported it is his wife.

765
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,590
Go and ask her for more details.

766
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,450
(Police)

767
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,470
This is the deceased's wife.

768
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,030
What exactly happened?

769
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,800
Last night,

770
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,870
I thought he went out

771
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,070
for business entertainment.

772
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,270
I waited for him until

773
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,590
five in the morning,

774
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,930
but he still didn't return.

775
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,030
Then I discovered

776
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,900
he used my credit card

777
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,710
to book a room at this hotel.

778
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,430
I was worried he was cheating on me,

779
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,650
so I came to find him.

780
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,060
The deceased's injuries

781
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,570
are consistent with characteristics of a fall from a great height.

782
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,430
Preliminary assessment indicates

783
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,630
he had drunk a lot of alcohol before his death.

784
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,550
On his body,

785
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,750
there were remains of vomit from before he died.

786
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,550
There is

787
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,430
a strong odor of alcohol.

788
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,510
I checked

789
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,510
the hotel's surveillance footage.

790
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,830
He actually met

791
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,160
two young women in his room.

792
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,190
By the time I arrived,

793
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,550
they had already left.

794
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,630
I was about to go up to find my husband

795
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,130
when I heard

796
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,220
someone had fallen off the building.

797
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,600
Officer,

798
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,630
why would he jump off the building?

799
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,000
He must have been set up

800
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,500
and blackmailed by those two girls.

Let's begin.

The victim is Wei Xianzhong.

805
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,590
His wife called the police.

806
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,640
She suspects he jumped off the building

807
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,790
because he was blackmailed

808
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,110
in a badger game by two girls.

809
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,520
The hotel's surveillance footage

00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,320

guests returning from outside,

838
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,980
so they didn't stop them.

with a large amount of cash.

with a large amount of cash.

847
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,510
Later, after testing

848
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,750
the samples collected in his room,

849
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,510
we found no biological evidence

850
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,310
of sexual activity between

851
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,670
the two girls in the video

852
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,620
and Wei Xianzhong.

853
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,870
The trace expert

854
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,070
also determined from the footprints on the rooftop

855
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:14,930
that Wei Xianzhong

856
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,560
jumped off voluntarily.

857
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,850
Besides,

858
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,400
there were no other injuries

859
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,470
on his body.

860
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,800
Apart from a high level of alcohol in his blood,

861
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,270
there were no other toxic substances.

862
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,000
Min Xue told me that

863
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,270
Wei Xianzhong had contacted her

864
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,680
many times before his death,

865
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,330
asking her to receive his funding.

866
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,400
Min Xue

867
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,580
had refused him again and again.

868
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,140
This meeting

869
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,720
was suggested by Jiang Huan.

870
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,640
Jiang Huan

871
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,610
grew up in a family with a history of violent crime.

872
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,580
She's been through a lot and wasn't afraid.

873
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,880
Min Xue needed money

874
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,240
to keep the rescue station running,

875
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,100
so she agreed to go.

876
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,730
However, once they got the money,

877
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,500
Wei Xianzhong asked them to drink with him,

878
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,010
which scared them away.

879
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,490
From what we can see now,

880
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,080
it's just her side of the story.

881
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,240
What else?

882
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,570
I also found out

883
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,650
that Wei Xianzhong's company was poorly managed,

884
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,380
owing more than 20 million yuan.

885
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,600
He's just filed for bankruptcy

886
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,360
and received a court summons.

887
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,140
Could it be that

888
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,610
Wei Xianzhong couldn't handle the bankruptcy

889
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,880
and was already considering suicide,

890
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,140
so before taking his own life,

891
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,330
he spent all his money

892
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,230
to enjoy himself one last time?

893
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,170
We still need evidence.

898
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,140
knew there was a potential risk of sexual harassment,

899
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,160
yet she still went there

900
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,650
without recording

901

any audio or video.

902
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,370
How come her self-protection instincts

903
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,250
are worse than when she was a kid?

had never had children,

912
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,820
so after her divorce,

913
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,860
she lived alone.

914
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,950
She met the conditions for adoption.

she met Min Xue

and adopted her.

Min Shengmei treated her very well.

he started raping Min Xue.

932
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,140
What's worse is that Min Shengmei

933
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,560
did nothing about it

934
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,370

in cahoots with Zhang Bin.

937

couldn't bear the abuse anymore.
