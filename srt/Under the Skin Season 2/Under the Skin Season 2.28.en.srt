Where is Mr. Fang?

5
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,470
Mr. Fang is in the laboratory.

6
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,260
It seems there's been a key breakthrough today.

7
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,570
My mission

8
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
is to use genetic science

9
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,860
to fix the Creator's flaws,

10
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,220
creating a human race that,

11
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,630
with each generation, becomes better than the last.

DNA

13
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,870
is a powerful storage device.

14
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,630
Take humans, for example,

15
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,950

This poor guy, Cao Jian.

25

His family feud had

26

just ended

27
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,340
and he finally had a child at his old age.

28
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,000
But both the mother and child died.

29
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,409
Do you think

30
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,620
he was telling the truth?

31
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,110
Right now,

32
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,860
he's completely caught up in his emotions.

33

There's no evidence at all.

that things

deported back to the country.

That's great.

141

What else did you do for him?

142
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,310
He wanted me to confess

143
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,900
that I killed Tang Keying,

144
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,580
then implicate him,

145
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,070
and finally reveal

146

that An Luran did it.

148
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,720
to delay you

from finding An Luran.

150
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,870
He saved your life.

151
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,640
You survived.

152
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,420
But you survived

153
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,410
only to become his pawn.

154
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,670

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,400
the conflict between Tang Keying and An Luran,

156
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,080
exploited Wu Bin's loyalty,

157
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,030
and even exploited

158
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,040
my trust in you.

159
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,370
That's because she was stupid.

160
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,820
She betrayed me.

161
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,360
She sold out An Luran too.

162
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,830
Do you think An Luran

163
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,030
would let her live for long?

164
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,230
If she didn't die, we'd all die.

165
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,270
She forced me to do this!

166
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,010
What about that child?

167
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,650
The child in Zhou Shanshan's womb.

168
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,420
Did he force you too?

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,720
That day, Zhou Shanshan was there.

170
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,210
She told me with a face full of happiness

171
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,430
how much she was looking forward to

172
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,870
the birth of that child.

173
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,200
But because of your intervention,

174
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,320
because of your crossing the line,

175
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,950
two living beings

176
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,270
died just like that.

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,490
This is the price of success.

178
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,110
As long as I succeed once,

179
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,420
no one will remember these failures.

180
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,360
You know what?

181
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,330
This is the difference between you and me.

182
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,690

These are all your intuitions.

This is your Eden...

193
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,980
The place that makes you feel

194
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,990
the safest.

195
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,330
You're not as confident

196
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,870
about your research

197
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,470
as you appear to be.

198
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,300
Repeated failures

199
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,990
are eroding your patience.

200
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,300
You're like me.

201
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,430
We're both haunted by nightmares.

202
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,930
Only in this Eden

203
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,660
can we feel safe

204
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,210
and calm.

205
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,600
So I guess

206
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,090
the evidence you're demanding

207
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,200
must be hidden here.

208
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,900
Oh, by the way.

209
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,280
I noticed that

210
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,240
there are many

211
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,470
butterfly cocoons on this tree.

212
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,510
Golden ones.

213
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,210
They're beautiful.

214
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,160
Look at them.

215
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,260
How unique they are.

216
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,830
They're about to hatch.

217
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,220
They can't possibly hatch.

218
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,680
Because I can't feel

219
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,060
any life moving inside.

220
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,040
You 3D-printed them.

221
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,140
Didn't you?

222
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,700
You said that

223
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,440
DNA

224
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,850
is a powerful storage device.

225
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,120
Inside these

226
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,560
must be all your experiments

227
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,670
and test records,

228
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,990
including Zhou Shanshan's

229
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,110
and her unborn child's.

230
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,460
Because what you're most looking forward to

231
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,550
is the moment when your hand-engineered

232
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,650
genetic embryo

233
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,450
emerges from its cocoon as a butterfly.

234
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,160
This

235
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,460
is your evidence of crime.

236
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,630
This is also

237
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,339
the starry sky I wanted to share with you.

238
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,680
Captain Cheng.

239
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,150
Everyone has assembled.

240
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,350
Shall we head to Kailai Biotechnology?

241
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,320
Jiang Feng.

242
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,870
I won't be going this time.

243
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,980
You lead the team.

244
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,850
When you arrive, don't go in yet.

245
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,130
Wait for my orders.

246
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,790
Understood.

247
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,540
Why is that?

248
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,230
I know this idea is risky

249
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,340
and immature.

250
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,790
But I also want

251
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,000
to be like you were back then

252
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,710
and point him in the right direction.

253
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,910
Let me

254
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,380
handle this matter.

255
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,470
Shen Yi.

256
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,150
You possess the most

257
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,500
perfect genes I've ever seen.

258
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,310
You've seen

259
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,730
how perfectly I repaired

260
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,330
Cao Jian's genetic defects.

261
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,650
I wanted that child to have

262
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,380
a healthy body,

263
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,750
stable emotions,

264
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,930
and a higher IQ.

265
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,510
Although I failed,

266
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,850
as long as I still have a chance,

267
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,530
I will definitely achieve it one day.

268
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,300
And at that time,

269
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,420
humanity will take a great leap forward.

270
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,790
Let me leave here.

271
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,230
Let me continue in a place

272
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,230
where ethics and laws are more relaxed.

273
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,090
You know it.

274
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,550
I'm just

275
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,870
one step away from success.

276
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
But I don't agree with this kind of progress.

277
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,350
Have you ever considered

278
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,430
a spiritual possibility?

279
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,970
That baby's

280
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,390
final uncontrolled genetic mutation

281
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,620
was a form of rebellion against your intervention.

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,430
None of us has the right

283
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,160
to define what life

284
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,300
should be like.

285
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,210
We have even less right

286
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,400
to decide others' birth, aging, illness, and death.

287
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,480
Then what about your so-called crime prediction?

288
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,030
Isn't that also intervention and change?

289
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,060
You're like a mirror to me.

290
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,210
You've made me see myself.

291
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,840
I used to be like you.

292
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,790
I thought I could rely on

293
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,230
my own perceptions and standards

294
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,590
to infer human nature

295
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,150
and judge good and evil.

296
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,790
It's you who made me realize that

297
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,510
we can discover the truth...

298
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,350
But we must respect

299
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,790
the rules of this society...

300
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,150
And the laws of nature.

301
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,640
You've disappointed me so much.

302
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,330
Is this what you want?

303
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,380
To send me to prison,

304
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,960
to make it impossible for me

305
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,860
to realize my life's value?

306
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,500
Is that it?

307
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,990
You're sacrificing others' lives

308
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,270
to break out of your cocoon and become a butterfly.

309
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,290
In the end,

310
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,620
you'll only end up entangling yourself.

311
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,870
Turn yourself in.

312
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,920
Fang Kaiyi.

313
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,460
What are you doing?

314
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,480
This is also my perfect work.

315
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,190
Promise me.

316
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,010
Let a heartbroken scientist

317
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,670
be recorded on

318
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,780
the last page of your Human Nature Atlas.

319
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,870
This is my only request.

320
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,290
You shouldn't give up,

321
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,130
even if you've failed before.

322
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,890
Fang Kaiyi,

323
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,310
I've already completed it!

324
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,530
It's a portrait of you.

325
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,090
The you that I've perceived.

326
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,230
Ever since I first saw you,

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,160
♫Trapped in staring, questioning, and guessing♫

328

ugly,

406
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,830

Yes.

412
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,600
Sacrificing yourself

425

Jiang Feng.

426
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,180
You can go up now.

427
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,520
The case is closed.

428
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,790
Mr. Shen,

429
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,030
what did you say

430
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,600
to Fang Kaiyi?

431
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,260
How did he agree to turn himself in?

432
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,110
Is there really evidence

433
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,280
in such a small cocoon?

434
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,150
How did he put it inside?

435
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,940
How is it, Captain Cheng?

436
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,830
The provincial department has

437
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,350
decrypted the information in that cocoon.

438
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,120
They found

439
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,540
artificial DNA chains inside

440
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,500
storing Fang Kaiyi's

441
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,870
experimental data from illegal operations.

442
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,530
There really is evidence in this cocoon?

443
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,820
And they also discovered

444
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,160
that Fang Kaiyi is

445
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,940
the technical core of Maoyu Group.

446
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:21,990
He used his

447
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,110
overseas study background

448
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,600
to explore many gray areas.

449
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,510
The group profited enormously from this.

450
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,190
Such a good scientist,

451
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,270
why did it come to this?

452
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,180
The technical department's

453
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,210
gene sequencer has arrived.

454
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,170
Let's all go help out.

455
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,000
They allocated that to our bureau?

456
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,300
Because of this case,

457
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,840
they specially introduced a piece of equipment.

458
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,870
Then I'll go try it out.

459
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,510
Let's go.

460
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:40,910
Let's go.

461
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,690
I want to try it too.

462
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,310
How did you know I was here?

463
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:30,730
Intuition.

464
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,390
Thank you.

465
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,670
That day,

466
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,990
you didn't let Jiang Feng

467
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,030
bring people in directly.

468
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,590
What about you?

469
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,540
Why didn't you come that day?

470
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,670
Jiang Feng...

471
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,150
Has matured.

472
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,820

596
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,080
What's the FTO gene?

597
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,930
How does it cause obesity?

598
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,710
I'm not fat either.

599
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,560
Am I fat?

600
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,710
No, you're not.

601
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,850
You're not fat now.

602
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,430
But being a bit chubby is good.

603
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,860
It can hold down good fortune.

604
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,580
Do you want this good fortune?

605
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,400
Yes, I do.

606
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,800
What's yours?

607
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,760
Let me see.

608
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,950
Let me see.

609
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,030
Hair... hair loss.

610
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,070
The baldness gene.

611
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,650
It's okay.

612
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,080
If I really lose all my hair,

613
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,330
I'll just style it like a 1-9 haircut.

614
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,540
It'll look pretty trendy.

615
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,310
Alright, if that day really comes,

616
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,430
I'll definitely spend a fortune

617
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,290
to make you a wig.

618
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,830
Zhou.

619
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,550
Help me schedule a mammography.

620
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,980
Um,

621
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,580
for breast cancer, I don't have it yet.

622
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,140
It's not for your sister-in-law.

623
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,520
It's for me.

624
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,810
Thank you for your trouble.

625
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,840
Does Mr. Yan have breast cancer?

626
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,530
Can men get it too?

627
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,230
It's alright, Mr. Yan.

628
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,650
This isn't 100% certain.

629
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,990
It's just a very small probability.

630
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,200
No, it's just...

631
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,630
Looking at this prediction result,

632
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,920
I suddenly feel like

633
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,990
something's not quite right.

634
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,830
What's yours?

635
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,980
Let's see.

636
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,380
5-HT 1A CG type.

637
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,300
What kind of gene is this?

638
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,110
The single gene.

639
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,750
So it means you can't find a boyfriend, huh?

640
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,140
Let me tell you,

641
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,790
stop looking in the comment section from now on.

642
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,830
It's not reliable.

643
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,140
Captain Cheng.

644
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,150
Show me yours.

645
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,070
Lack of vitamin B

646
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,170
absorption ability.

647
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,630
Lack of vitamin B,

648
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,430
I know about this.

649
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,630
It's easy to get mouth ulcers.

650
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,650
My mom is like that.

651
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,820
(The story is still going on. Beijiang Team will never part.)

652
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,150
Your gene report
(The story is still going on. Beijiang Team will never part.)

653
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,180
(The story is still going on. Beijiang Team will never part.)

654
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,270
is quite ordinary.
(The story is still going on. Beijiang Team will never part.)

655
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,250
(The story is still going on. Beijiang Team will never part.)

656
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,590
Mr. Shen,

657
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,390
what about yours?

658
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,740
Mine is also very ordinary.

659
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,850
Please don't come, Director Zhang.

660
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,290
What do you mean? Am I not welcome?

661
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,360
It's not that.

662
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,490
I'm just having a small birthday celebration

663
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,470
at a small restaurant.

664
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,470
If you, such an important person, come,

665
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,670
the place won't be able to accommodate you.

666
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:57,960
Hello.

667
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,060
The number you have dialed is currently busy.

668
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,380
Don't give me that.

669
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,330
Are you afraid that if I come,

670
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,360
everyone won't be able to relax?

671
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,730
That's part of the consideration, yes.

672
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,270
Hello.

673
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,500
The number you have dialed is currently busy.

674
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,860
Then I won't come.

675
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,730
You all have a good time.

676
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,720
This meal is on me.

677
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,260
Happy birthday, Du Cheng.

678
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,500
Thank you, Director Zhang.
