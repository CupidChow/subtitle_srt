(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,009
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,970
Xiaojing!

4
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,300
Xiaojing!

5
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,639
There should be a pit down there,

6
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,630
do you want to take a look?

7
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,310
Yes, yes!

8
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,060
Let's take a look inside.

9
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,230
(Public Security)

10
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,240
Captain Cheng.

11
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,410
Captain Cheng.

12
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,540
You can head down from here.

13
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,870
Here, have something warm to drink.

14
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,490
You guys must be Xiaojing's parents.

15
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,400
We are.

16
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:28,829
I'm from Beijiang's

17
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,870
Criminal Investigation Team, my name is Du Cheng.

18
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,670
Hello.

19
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
What's the situation right now?

20
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,280
Our daughter Xiaojing,

21
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,360
has been missing for a week now.

22
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,440
We've been searching the mountains around the village

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,250
for three days now,

24
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,630
but there's been no news at all.

25
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,740
My wife is going crazy from worry.

26
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,560
Not only have we not found our child,

27
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,310
but

28
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,220
we've found a pit of bones instead.

29
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,140
It's not her, it's not her.

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,800
It's not her.

31
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,390
No, no.

32
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,270
No, no.

33
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,510
For Xiaojing,

34
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,330
no news doesn't necessarily mean bad news.

35
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,720
Don't worry,

36
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,710
We've already contacted

37
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,750
a professional rescue team.

38
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,410
They will conduct a large-scale search on the mountains.

39
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,480
Okay, thank you.

40
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,830
That bone pit,

41
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,020
can you take us there?

42
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,290
No problem.

43
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,980
This is an undeveloped wild mountain,

44
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,950
the path is very difficult to walk.

45
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,339
Everyone must be careful.

46
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,579
Jiang Feng,

47
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:19,940
you stay here

48
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,029
and work with the local police

49
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,350
to understand the basic situation.

50
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,580
The rest of you, follow me.

51
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,790
The plants have thorns, everyone be careful.

52
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,159
This mountain is very special.

53
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,600
It's said to be a suicide valley.

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,750
I never thought there would

55
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,870
actually be such a place.

56
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,670
Be careful, it's slippery.

57
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,070
Everyone, take it slow.

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,710
There's a cliff ahead, everyone be careful!

59
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,370
Okay!

60
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,470
Everyone watch your step!

61
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,620
The soil here is loose!

62
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,530
Try not to step on the rocks!

63
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,470
Be careful, be careful.

64
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,520
Come on.

65
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,660
Without professional equipment,

66
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,200
one wouldn't be able to

67
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,700
go down this pit.

68
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,160
This is the place.

69
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:12,890
Here.

70
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,600
This is where

71
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,990
the suicide valley leads to.

72
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,090
Thank you.

73
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,790
How is it?

74
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,240
The deceased

75
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,830
must have fallen from the cliff above

76
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,620
to their deaths.

77
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,810
Due to these large rocks,

78
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,640
the condition of the shattered bones here

79
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,390
are more severe than

80
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,250
high-rise falls in the city.

81
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,310
The damp environment at the bottom of the pit

82
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,260
accelerates the decomposition of the bodies.

83
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,340
Look at these shoes and clothes,

84
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,490
they have all decomposed.

85
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,400
Based on what we see right now,

86
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,260
we can assume

87
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,990
the fall and death

88
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,150
took place three to ten years ago.

89
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,550
In this situation,

90
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,600
can we restore the deceased's

91
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,510
facial features?

92
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,590
I'll give it a try.

93
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,090
Then I'll leave this to you.

94
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,240
A female child around eight years old,

95
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,690
approximately 1.4 meters tall,

96
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,450
died from a fall seven to ten years ago.

97
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Skull fracture,

98
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,830
fractures in limbs and ribs,

99
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,880
multiple thoracic and lumbar vertebrae,

100
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,910
and compression fractures,

101
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,360
are all injuries from falling down.

102
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,150
The other skulls belonging to adults,

103
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,240
are all scattered.

104
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,870
But this child's skull

105
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,770
remains relatively intact,

106
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,470
different from the adults'.

107
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,620
She must have fallen into those trees first,

108
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,780
slowing down her fall,

109
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,920
causing her

110
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,140
to not die immediately

111
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,200
when she hit the ground.

112
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,390
Instead, she crawled

113
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,090
in that direction for a while.

114
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,480
That period must have been

115
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,880
really painful for her.

116
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,890
I can't imagine how terrified

117
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,170
she must have been before she died.

118
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,830
This crabapple tree

119
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,090
grew from her palm.

120
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,100
She must have been

121
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,430
holding a crabapple fruit in her hand.

122
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,150
This crabapple fruit

123
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,270
must have been very important to her.

124
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,670
Even until death,

125
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,980
she couldn't bear to let it go.

126
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,580
This mountain is called Mt. Fengdu.

127
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,240
Under specific temperature and humidity conditions,

128
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,660
at a particular spot on the mountaintop,

129
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,120
you can witness a spectacular phenomenon.

130
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,030
A few years ago,

131
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,280
internet users successfully captured it

132
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,330
and posted it online.

133
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,790
Then, it was dubbed by netizens as

134
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,830
'Auroral Mist'.

135
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,630
Later on,

136
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,370
more and more people came to check it out.

137
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,150
However, the key point is

138
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,190
this mountain has never been

139
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,850
developed.

140
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,480
The mountains are all connected,

141
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,180
and the terrain at the foot of it is also complex.

142
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,480
Even the local villagers

143
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,760
don't dare to enter the mountains casually.

144
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,710
Tourist that come

145
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,160
to see the 'Auroral Mist'

146
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,950
have all encountered accidents.

147
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,950
Some have fallen to their deaths, some have been injured,

148
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,050
and some have gone missing.

149
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,230
It's difficult to carry out rescue operations.

150
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,440
Our township

151
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,410
also frequently

152
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,330
educates the villagers about

153
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,460
the dangers of climbing wild mountains,

154
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,390
asking them to help

155
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,470
persuade tourists to turn back.

156
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,210
But with seventeen villages in our township,

157
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,430
and limited police force,

158
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,310
it's difficult to achieve

159
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,430
24-hour surveillance.

160
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,230
We really can't monitor everything.

161
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,600
Do the villagers

162
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,470
know about this bone pit?

163
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,200
I've never heard of it.

164
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,840
But there have been family members who came

165
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,830
to report missing persons cases.

166
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,040
We gathered the villagers

167
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,130
to search for them

168
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:36,630
but...

169
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,040
Jiang Feng.

170
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,070
Captain Cheng.

171
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,040
Have the people arrived?

172
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,750
The rescue team we contacted

173
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,760
are in the mountains already.

174
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,410
They will continue searching for Xiaojing.

175
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,500
Captain Cheng,

176
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,610
is there anything else you need me to do?

177
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,390
I might need you

178
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,950
to wait a bit longer.

179
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,500
Once your teammate returns,

180
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,540
you guys will need to help write a statement.

181
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,990
Is there anyone in the village

182
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,430
who is very familiar with the mountain routes?

183
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,650
There is one person who should know.

184
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,960
I'll take you to find him.

185
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,600
This way.

186
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,500
This way.

187
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,750
This young man is called Chang Feng.

188
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,720
He often

189
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,830
helps us rescue those

190
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,510
who need help in the mountains.

191
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,880
Ten years ago,

192
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,920
his sister

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,950
also went up the mountain with him

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,700
to guide someone.

195
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,590
But she fell down the mountain

196
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,980
and was never found.

197
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,150
At that time,

198
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,140
he was only eighteen years old.

199
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,780
His parents passed away early,

200
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,000
and then he lost his sister.

201
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,190
So he's been

202
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,970
living here by himself.

203
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,590
Those that he saved

204
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,650
brought him compensation money,

205
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,570
but he refused to take any of it.

206
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,190
He donated it all to the villagers.

207
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,020
This young man has a kind heart.

208
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,830
Please, do your best

209
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,300
to help find his sister's remains.

210
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,460
Take it slow, please.

211
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,110
Chang Feng,

212
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,410
let me introduce you.

213
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,520
These two are

214
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,020
detectives from the Criminal Investigation Division of Beijiang Branch.

215
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,210
Captain Du and Officer Jiang.

216
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,910
They're here to gather some information from you.

217
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,780
What happened?

218
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,400
Have you seen this person before?

219
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,720
Her name is Xiaojing,

220
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,620
Full name is Zhang Sijing.

221
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,690
I haven't seen her.

222
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,550
I heard you've saved many

223
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,320
mountain climbers.

224
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,910
Yes,

225
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,000
but I wouldn't call it saving.

226
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,790
All I did was give them a few words of advice

227
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,550
and had the police take them away.

228
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,620
Can you tell us about the details?

229
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,520
Here's the thing,

230
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,860
many of them

231
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,070
are here to see

232
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,170
the Auroral Mist.

233
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,980
But that area is a cliff

234
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,270
and the path is particularly difficult to walk

235
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,250
so it's very dangerous.

236
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,590
I usually ask them

237
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,800
if they've climbed mountains before.

238
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,790
Even with my guide,

239
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,970
not everyone can make it to the top.

240
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,360
Many people climb halfway

241
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,550
and then say they want to head back down

242
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,700
because they're scared.

243
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,310
Can you take me up there?

244
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,960
Okay.

245
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,200
Since it's still bright out,

246
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,540
I'll take you up to have a look.

247
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,030
Do you remember the way we came?

248
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,010
I do.

249
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,200
Go back and get ready

250
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,910
to set up a tent.

251
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,480
We won't be able to leave tonight.

252
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,110
Let's go.

253
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,200
Alright.

254
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,220
Let's go.

255
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,920
Aren't we supposed to be climbing up the mountain?

256
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,520
Why do we keep heading downhill?

257
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,490
Don't worry, Captain Du.

258
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,630
The path I'm taking you

259
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,270
is the fastest.

260
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,470
When you guys use navigation for taxis in the city,

261
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,830
don't you often end up

262
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,020
in strange places?

263
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,270
Sometimes, I guess.

264
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,630
So,

265
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,590
it's still best to

266
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,200
follow someone who knows the way.

267
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,590
This way.

268
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Chang Feng!

269
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,510
Chang Feng!

270
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,140
Are you injured?

271
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,390
I'm used to

272
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,510
walking fast by myself.

273
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,550
I thought you were right behind me.

274
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,610
I heard

275
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,470
you had a sister

276
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,990
who also had an accident

277
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,810
in these mountains before.

278
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,100
Yes.

279
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,150
But it's been

280
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,200
so many years now.

281
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,370
What happened exactly?

282
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,290
There were four people

283
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,100
who wanted to see the Auroral Mist

284
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,730
and they asked me to guide them.

285
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,970
My sister

286
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,300
was following behind us.

287
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,980
But before we reached the summit,

288
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,079
we encountered heavy rain.

289
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,800
We couldn't see the path at all.

290
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,069
I could only focus on protecting

291
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,020
those four people first.

292
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,720
When I turned around,

293
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,569
she was gone already.

294
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,829
Why didn't you try to save her?

295
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,800
How could I?

296
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,830
Once someone falls,

297
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,630
there's no saving them.

298
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,830
For children like us who live in the mountains,

299
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,510
life is fragile.

300
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,430
I blame myself.

301
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,990
I shouldn't have let my sister

302
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,870
come with us.

303
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,790
Before it gets dark,

304
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,190
let's hurry and go.

305
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,550
Come on.

306
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,750
Let's go.

307
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,350
Come.

308
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,910
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

309
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,670
I put this here.
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

310
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,480
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

311
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,870
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

312
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,190
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

313
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,200
Since I'm here, it won't be dangerous.

314
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,390
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)
Stay close to me.

315
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,920
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

316
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,300
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

317
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,810
Come on.
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

318
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,430
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

319
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,090
Let's go, Shen Yi.

320
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,420
Today's classification work

321
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,360
is almost done.

322
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,500
The weather is about to change.

323
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,110
We need to leave here quickly.

324
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,540
Okay.

325
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,630
Over there.

326
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,870
So this is the Auroral Mist?

327
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,870
No.

328
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,230
The real Auroral Mist

329
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,360
is even more beautiful than this.

330
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,910
It's a sea of flowers,

331
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,980
as beautiful as a fairyland.

332
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,430
Many people don't know

333
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,490
the peculiarities of this place.

334
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,510
What you did just now was very dangerous.

335
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,150
You can easily fall down if you're not careful.

336
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,350
So that's why you

337
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,230
put up a sign over there

338
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,960
(Dangerous Route. No Climbing.)

339
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,080
to prevent accidents.

340
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,020
That's all I can do.

341
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,470
But everyone has their own fate.

342
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,440
When heaven wants to take someone,

343
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,110
no one can stop it.

344
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,720
Suicide Valley.

345
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,140
Let's go.

346
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,050
Wait.

347
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,430
Hold this for me.

348
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,720
What's wrong?

349
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:47,480
(Police)

350
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,950
Make sure the tents are secured tightly.
(Police)

351
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,410
The wind is strong at night.

352
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,560
Everyone, be careful.

353
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,790
Okay.

354
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,210
(Police)
Okay.

355
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,950
(Police)

356
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,430
Be careful.
(Police)

357
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,590
(Police)

358
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:06,460
(Police)

359
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,160
The more intact skulls

360
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,320
that we found today

361
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,250
are all here.

362
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,220
We've restored some of them.

363
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,790
There are still several remains

364
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,110
that have severe bone

365
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:17,820
fragmentation.

366
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,000
Since a lot of time has passed,

367
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,190
the process of identification and classification

368
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,910
is slow.

369
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,750
Today, Shen Yi found

370
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,880
a unique set of remains.

371
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,140
It's a little girl

372
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,080
who's around eight years old.

373
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,270
Eight years old?

374
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,060
Could it be Chang Feng's sister?

375
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,530
Officer.

376
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,270
Who are you?

377
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,020
We're in the middle of an investigation.

378
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,710
You can't come in.

379
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,350
Why are you here?

380
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,350
I thought since everyone's been climbing all day,

381
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,140
you guys must be tired

382
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,070
and hungry

383
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,600
so I prepared some food.

384
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,820
Noodles with wild boar meat and pickled vegetables,

385
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,790
please, have some.

386
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,950
Thank you.
-Thank you.

387
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,830
Put it in that room,

388
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,830
this room isn't suitable.

389
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,470
Alright.

390
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,980
Come, come.

391
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,390
Let me help you.

392
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:56,870
Thank you, thank you.

393
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,560
Let him identify it.

394
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,910
I'll distribute it to you all in a moment.

395
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,110
You eat first.

396
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,670
Chang Feng!

397
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,590
Come here for a moment.

398
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,120
Hello,

399
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,830
I'm the sketch artist from the criminal investigation team,

400
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,440
Shen Yi.

401
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,990
I'm specifically in charge of

402
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,120
the skeletal restoration work.

403
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,200
Take a look.

404
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,340
Is this your sister?

405
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,970
Yes...

406
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,560
We found a set of remains

407
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,600
that might be your sister.

408
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,650
It's her...

409
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,520
That day, she was

410
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,950
wearing this red sweater.

411
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,870
She was holding onto

412
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,960
a crabapple.

413
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,110
She held it tightly and didn't let go

414
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,980
and now,

415
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,470
it has grown into a small tree.

416
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,810
The hiking team gave it to her that day.

417
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,610
Xiaojuan saw it for the first time

418
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,960
and she thought the color was pretty.

419
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,600
She liked it very much.

420
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,160
She wouldn't let it go.

421
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,520
It's all in the past now.

422
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,410
So many years have passed,

423
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,110
yet you guys were able to find her,

424
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,240
it's Xiaojuan's good fortune.

425
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,200
Thank you all.

426
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,230
Once we finish

427
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,120
the DNA test

428
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,310
and confirm it's your sister,

429
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,390
you can take her home.

430
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,840
Okay.

431
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,570
I have some things at home

432
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,730
would you guys like to take a look?

433
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,430
Come.

434
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,990
Come.

435
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,770
Officer,

436
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,740
please have a seat.

437
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,390
Thank you.

438
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,270
I'll go and bring the things

439
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,320
here.

440
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,070
(Great love knows no boundaries; virtue and goodness endure forever.)

441
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,330
(Rescue in times of danger; the gratitude is as heavy as a mountain.)

442
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,190
(Rescue in times of difficulty; lifelong gratitude.)

443
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,300
(May good people live a lifetime of peace and safety.)

444
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,860
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

445
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,270
These are all belongings

446
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,490
left by those who jumped off the cliff.

447
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,960
If I've met them before,

448
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,750
I tried to remember their features

449
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,710
and wrote them all down

450
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,740
so that if families come looking in the future

451
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,170
they have something to remember them by.

452
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,610
Also if you officers come looking,

453
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,890
it's also a way to explain.

454
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,170
The unmarked ones

455
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,340
are the ones I haven't met before.

456
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,530
The things left on Mist Cliff,

457
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,720
if I come across them,

458
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,700
I just collect them as well.

459
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,830
Did you report it to the police?

460
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,020
Yes, I did.

461
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,350
I also took the police in to search.

462
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,670
But

463
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,460
they fell down below.

464
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,630
So,

465
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,680
tell us about it.

466
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,460
This woman,

467
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,790
I met her in 2016

468
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,050
at the beginning of autumn.

469
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,400
She was a bit chubby,

470
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,060
with wide-set eyes,

471
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,700
and a big nose.

472
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,480
She was fully equipped

473
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,670
and I thought she was here to tour.

474
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,590
She asked me for directions with a smile

475
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,690
and asked for water to drink.

476
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,590
But then

477
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,350
when I came inside to make her tea,

478
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,380
I turned around and she was gone.

479
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,580
In this bag,

480
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,100
there's a suicide note that she left behind.

481
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,000
I didn't open it

482
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,650
but it should contain her information.

483
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,640
(20120608 Zhang, playing basketball)

484
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,200
This young man's surname is Zhang.
(20120608 Zhang, playing basketball)

485
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,220
He played basketball.

486
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,580
He had thick eyebrows and big eyes,

487
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,780
looked quite spirited.

488
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,760
His facial features were very defined,

489
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,400
and he was quite tall.

490
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,510
He left his phone with me,

491
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,980
a black Huawei.

492
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,480
He said he had high competition pressure.

493
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,870
This was left by a middle-aged man.

494
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,020
He looked...

495
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,810
very depressed,

496
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,460
with sunken eyes,

497
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,890
thick lips,

498
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,660
and some stubble.

499
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,170
I had already guided him down the mountain,

500
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,390
but he snuck back up in the middle of the night.

501
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,960
(20190211 Female, fat)

502
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,350
I just don't understand

503
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,670
why people want to die.

504
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,740
Compared to them...

505
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,830
I can't even

506
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,710
keep my family alive.

507
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,690
It's so nice to be alive...

508
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,260
Is there anything

509
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,110
more important than being alive?

510
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,110
Take these portraits

511
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,140
back for comparison.

512
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,700
Alright.

513
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,700
Du Cheng,

514
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,210
I'll stay and keep him company,

515
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,950
and chat a bit more.

516
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,990
Okay.

517
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,920
Officers,

518
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,830
you guys came

519
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,990
yet I haven't even offered you any water.

520
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,590
I'll go get some right away.

521
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,130
It's fine.

522
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,230
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)
It's fine.

523
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,350
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

524
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,040
Um,
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

525
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,110
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

526
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,090
may I take a look around?
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

527
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:03,190
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

528
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,750
Feel free to.
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

529
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,910
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

530
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,270
Okay.
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

531
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,740
(Mt. Fengdu's Guardian)

532
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,750
That was my sister's room.

533
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,750
After she passed away,

534
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,390
I was afraid of being reminded of her,

535
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,900
so I burned all her belongings.

536
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,530
There's no use in dwelling on it.

537
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,020
Life must go on.

538
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,510
Don't you agree?

539
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,420
You're right.

540
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,780
Officer, here.

541
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,540
Thank you.

542
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,280
Have a seat.

543
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,980
(Memorial Tablet of late sister Chang Juan)

544
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,750
With all your family gone,

545
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,600
all these years,

546
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,000
why do you still stay here?

547
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,030
Haven't you ever thought about

548
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,190
leaving like others in the village,

549
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,490
to explore the outside world?

550
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,160
I like the life in the mountains.

551
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,530
It's free and easy,

552
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,480
with no attachments,

553
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,340
and just carefree.

554
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,670
The outside world

555
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,740
doesn't interest me much.

556
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,590
Why did you unravel it?

557
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,250
Just to pass the time.

558
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,010
You knit very well.

559
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
I... I learned it from my mother.

560
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,150
She was very good with her hands.

561
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,810
Knowing how to knit sweaters

562
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,110
saves a lot of money on clothes.

563
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,159
I can imagine

564
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,659
if your sister was still here,

565
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,340
this home

566
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,030
would certainly not look like this.

567
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,350
Come on,

568
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,260
let's try to imagine again.

569
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,860
Come on.

570
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,210
Imagine...

571
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,420
this is the mountain,

572
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,230
this is the river,

573
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,570
and this is an endless field.

574
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,770
Over here

575
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,650
is you and your sister's home.

576
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,430
If your sister was still alive,

577
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,950
how do you think

578
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,010
this home

579
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,480
will look like?

580
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,630
I've already arranged

581
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,860
the outdoor area for you.

582
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,990
The indoor area,

583
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,530
is up to you.

584
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,420
This is the entrance to the courtyard.

585
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,610
This is the kitchen.

586
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,160
This is my room.

587
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,190
I'm done.
