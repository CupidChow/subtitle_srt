(Episode 18)

3
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,150
Why was this plant abandoned?

4
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,509
In the past, this plant

5
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,390
stored ammonia tanks.

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,060
Later, a fire broke out

7
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,350
and caused an ammonia leakage.

8
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,990
It contaminated the entire plant.

9
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,670
The fire department and police

10
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,230
all came at that time.

11
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,220
They evacuated the people in the plant

12
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,680
and the surrounding residents.

13
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,850
It was a big incident.

14
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,680
Do you patrol every day?

15
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,090
Not every day.

16
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,710
We make rounds every few days.

17
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,190
So we can't rule out

18
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,750
the possibility of unauthorized entry and exit.

19
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,880
Here it is.

20
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,750
Open the door.

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,630
Alright.

22
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,079
It's been abandoned for so long,

23
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,110
there should be

24
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,290
nothing left inside, right?

25
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,960
That's the smell of ammonia.

26
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,430
This door has been locked for years.

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,180
I guess the smell from back then

28
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,230
hasn't completely dissipated yet.

29
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,240
What's down there?

30
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,780
Down there...

31
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,840
It should be the basement.

32
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,510
It's where they stored small liquid

33
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,750
ammonia tanks and other raw materials.

34
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,900
I've never seen this lock before.

35
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,940
Can you open it?

36
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,260
Let me try.

37
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,940
It's not working.

38
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,030
I've never opened this lock before.

39
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,810
Let me do it.

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,730

41
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,290
Captain Cheng.

42
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,320
This doesn't smell like ammonia.

43
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,740
These... are bodies.

44
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,220
Notify the forensics team and medical examiner immediately.

45
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,030
Yes, sir.

She went missing a week ago.
(Basic information) (Name: Wang Mengxiao)

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,350
We found bleeding in the petrous part

of her temporal bone.

70
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:44,670
We deduce that

71
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,750
the cause of death was drowning.

72
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,450
Moreover, there were binding marks

Jiang Feng,
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

179
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,030
I want you to investigate

180
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,950
the first victim

181
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,930
Feng Xiaowen's social connections before her death,

182
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,410
as well as her final movements.

183
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,100
The physical evidence from the Guo Yuan case

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,580
is linked to the chemical plant.

185
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,710
We can't rule out the possibility

186
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,090
that this is a continuation of the serial killings.

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,150

Although the investigative pressure is immense,

199
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,510
it's precisely this kind of case

200
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,870
that demonstrates our

201
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,560
role as the spearhead in overcoming difficulties.

213
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,390
to ask for our assistance in the investigation.

We

215

also found the hotel

216
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,510
Feng Xiaowen last stayed in.

217
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,830
The hotel owner

218
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,110
gave us a phone.

219
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,620
He said that two years ago,

220
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,500
when Feng Xiaowen left,

221
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,350
she left her phone

222
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,430
charging in the room.

223
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,870
Her luggage and other belongings were also there,

224
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,870
but she was gone

225
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,910
and never came back.

226
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,070
Did you find

227
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,630
any useful clues

228
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,680
in the phone?

229
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,430
We recovered some photos

230
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,770
and discovered that Feng Xiaowen

231
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,130
had performed in Beijiang

232
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,500
at the Hongda Chemical Plant.

234
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,790
Feng Xiaowen's daughter, Wu Nianjun,

235
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,040
has rushed here from Nansha.

236
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,710
How did my mother die?

237
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,790
The specific cause of death

238
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,750
is still under investigation.

239
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,540
Was she murdered?

240
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,340
Please calm down.

241
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,100
She must have been murdered!

242
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,450
She must have been murdered.

243
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,960
Regarding the cause of your mother's death,

244
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,450
do you have any leads?

245
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,700
My mother came to Beijiang

246
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,900
just to find Ge Yutian.

247
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,590
It was Ge Yutian who killed my mother.

248
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,210
Ge Yutian.

249
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,720
What do you want?

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,840
We're from the Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team.
(Police)

252
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,670
We need your

253
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,980
cooperation for the investigation of a case.

254
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,370
Thanks.

255
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,350
You used to work at

256
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,510
Hongda Chemical Plant, right?

257
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:32,790
Yes.

258
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,920
Before the incident at the plant,

259
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,190
I was a supervisor there.

260
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,950
After the incident,

261
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,950
have you been back there?

262
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,710
No.

263
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,710
After the fire,

264
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,830
that area was all contaminated.

265
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,070
The plant was shut down

266
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,120
and the surrounding area became deserted.

267
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,780
So I never went back.

268
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,970
Do you know this person?

269
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,580
Yes, I do.

270
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,250
But she's missing.

271
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,080
She hasn't been found yet.

272
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,350
When did you find out

273
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:16,990
about her disappearance?

274
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,350
It was about a year and a half ago.

275
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,660
Her daughter and the police came to see me.

276
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,580
That's when I heard about it.

277
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,510
But by that time, we had already

278
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,670
been out of touch for half a year.

279
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,950
Why did you lose contact?

280
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,860
How should I put it?

281
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,790
Her daughter

282
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,570
was quite resentful

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,670
of our relationship.

284
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,330
She thought I was a con man

285
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,400
trying to deceive her mother.

286
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,220
To avoid causing trouble for her mother,

287
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,350
I took the initiative to cut off contact.

288
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,110
So,

289
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,310
what exactly was your relationship

290
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,790
with Feng Xiaowen?

291
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,430
She was my...

292
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,540
Godmother.

293
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,740
We found out

294
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,550
that you once recommended Feng Xiaowen

295
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,340
to buy insurance.

296
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,800
(Insurance Policy of Beijiang Life And Property Insurance Co., Ltd.)

297
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,070
Yes.

298
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,710
At that time,

299
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,600
I was working part-time selling insurance.

300
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,870
To help with my

301
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,790
performance,

302
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,580
she put down my name.

303
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,230
But in the end,

304
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,880
she bought it from my colleague.

305
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,430
It had nothing to do with me.

306
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,310
On this insurance policy,

307
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,350
in the beneficiary column,

308
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,490
(The beneficiary's name: Ge Yutian)

309
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,750
your name is written.
(The beneficiary's name: Ge Yutian)

310
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,310
(The beneficiary's name: Ge Yutian)

311
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,230
Were you aware of this?

312
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,230
Yes, I knew.

313
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,510
She mentioned it to me

314
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,390
at the time.

315
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,190
She said

316
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,960
she had a bad relationship with her daughter.

317
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,569
They were always in conflict.

318
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,290
I'm not sure about the specifics.

319
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,069
But I guess

320
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,020
it might have been out of spite

321
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,540
that she put down my name.

322
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,990
But I refused it at the time.

323
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,099
Later, she disappeared

324
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,589
and it hasn't been changed until now.

325
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,830
Officer,

326
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,310
what exactly happened?

327
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,640
Is there any news about my godmother?

328
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,670
We found Feng Xiaowen's body

329
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,530
in the basement

330
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,460
of Hongda Chemical Plant.

331
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,350
You must be mistaken.

332
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,650
Her daughter says

333
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,510
you killed her

334
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,390
to fraudulently claim the insurance.

335
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,040
Feng Xiaowen

336
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,270
bought a participating policy.

337
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,180
The longer she lived, the more money she'd get.

338
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,050
What could I possibly defraud her of?

339
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,270
What could I possibly defraud her of?

340
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,000
(Inquiry Room)

341
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,060
How was it?

342
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,070
Did you find out anything?

343
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,040
Nothing yet.

344
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,680
I observed carefully

345
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,900
the arrangement of those bodies.

346
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,300
Each had its own position.

347
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,040
It was as if

348
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,030
there was some kind of ritualistic feel to it.

349
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,910
So I think Feng Xiaowen's death

350
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,870
is very special.

351
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,220
Why don't I talk to him?

352
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,470
Alright.

353
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,340
We've restored Feng Xiaowen's

354
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,390
photos from her phone.

355
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,170
I must say,

356
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,170
just by looking at these photos,

357
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,080
I can truly

358
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,510
appreciate her charisma on stage.

359
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,460
This performance of "The Drunken Concubine"

360
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,970
shows elegance

361
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,440
with a touch of drunken charm.

362
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,400
This "Xie Yaohuan" is even more extraordinary.

363
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,700
The young lady role

364
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,930
and the young man role.

365
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,280
She switched between them effortlessly.

366
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,060
But my favorite

367
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,250
is still this one.

368
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,350
Yu Ji from "Farewell My Concubine."

369
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,090
It's truly exquisite.

370
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,000
She is your...

371
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,190
Godmother.

372
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,100
Then this photo

373
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,560
must be of your godmother

374
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,550
performing at your plant

375
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,650
for the first time, right?

376
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,430
Yes.

377
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,010
She played Sun Shangxiang.

378
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,720
Truly captivating and full of spirit.

379
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,550
So you two got to know each other

380
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,640
after this performance?

381
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,290
Could you help me recall

382
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,690
the scene at that time?

383
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,730
Feng Xiaowen's passing

384
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,940
saddens me as well.

385
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,150
I never had the chance

386
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,780
to experience in person

387
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,710
the charm of her performance.

388
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,060
Help me make up for this regret,

389
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,250
as a way for me to commemorate her.

390
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,840
Would that be alright?

391
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,830
At that time,

392
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,310
she was coming to perform at our plant.

393
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,230
My colleagues all protested,

394
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,330
saying the boss was too stingy.

395
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,350
He could have invited

396
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,830
even a D-list celebrity.

397
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,580
But he got a Peking opera singer instead.

398
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,810
No one wanted to watch that.

399
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,450
During the performance,

400
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,860
there weren't many people watching.

401
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,310
Of course,

402
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,870
no one understood the play either.

403
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:59,840
♫In days of old, Liang Hong wed Meng Guang♫

404
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,020
To be honest, I couldn't understand it either.

405
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,270
♫Today, Shang Xiang meets Liu Wang♫
To be honest, I couldn't understand it either.

406
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:15,270
♫Today, Shang Xiang meets Liu Wang♫

407
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,310
I wanted to leave,

409

but I felt it would be disrespectful.

I was really torn.

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:39,540
♫Today, Shang Xiang meets Liu Wang♫

413
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,390
Just as I

414
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,990
finally decided to leave,

415
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,630
one gaze from her

416
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,770
made me stay.

417
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,990
With just one person in the audience,

418
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,870
she actually persevered

419
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,990
and finished the entire play.

420
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,580
I was deeply moved.

421
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,140
After the show ended,

422
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,180
I wanted to

423
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,030
express my gratitude.

424
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,360
So I looked her up online.

425
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,600
I found out she was

426
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,540
a famous Peking Opera performer.

427
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,590
The difference between the two of us

428
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,700
and our status

429
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,550
was too great.

430
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,750
I thought

431
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,030
she wouldn't even bother with me.

432
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,710
But

433
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,830
to my surprise,

434
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,110
she was quite approachable.

435
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,520
Ms. Feng.

436
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,080
Thanks for your hard work.

437
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,410
Your singing just now was beautiful.

438
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,560
Oh, it's you.

439
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,430
Thank you, thank you.

440
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,720
You haven't eaten, have you?

441
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,790
I bought you a bowl of wonton.

442
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,680
Is this for me?

443
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,680
Yes.

444
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,870
Thank you, thank you.

445
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,230
Let me put something underneath.

446
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,750
I can do it myself.

447
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,500
Let me, let me.

448
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,070
Careful.

449
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,290
It's quite hot.

450
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,040
Thank you.

451
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,590
Here.

452
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,590
Please try it.

453
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,710
Okay.

454
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,920
It smells so good.

455
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,710
I'm really hungry.

456
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,570
Does this taste familiar?

457
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,550
I got it from the

458
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,710
provincial court cafeteria.

459
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,120
No wonder.

460
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,860
I searched online.

461
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,370
Didn't you mention this

462
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,550
in an interview before?

463
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,750
That was a long time ago.

464
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,030
You're so thoughtful.

465
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,550
I'm sorry, Ms. Feng.

466
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,690
We're just rough workers

467
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,020
who don't understand opera.

468
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,000
Please don't mind us.

469
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,670
The workers might not understand,

470
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,150
but you think the bosses can?

471
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,560
I'm sorry.

472
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,290
I mean, even if no one watches,

473
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,510
we still have to keep performing.

474
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,900
Maybe someday,

475
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,560
we'll meet someone who appreciates it.

476
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,450
Here, wipe it with this.

477
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,090
It's fine.

478
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,470
Are you on duty today?

479
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,390
I'm the supervisor here.

480
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,820
I see.

(Beijiang Life Insurance Ge Yutian)

483

484

(Insurance)
This is just my

485
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,650
part-time job.

486
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:49,460
It's okay.

487
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,570
(Insurance)
It's okay.

488
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,410
Life and property.

489
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,110
Thank you.

490
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,740
Indeed.

491
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,830
From her social media photos,

492
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,810
I can see that

493
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,650
her performance venues

494
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,950
became increasingly modest.

495
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,670
Yes.

496
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,650
It was increasingly harder

497
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,230
for traditional opera to gain an audience.

498
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,750
Not only that,

499
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,740
I've noticed another change.

500
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,040
The previous photos she shared

501
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,460
on her social media,

502
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,340
whether in terms of composition

503
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,670
or lighting,

504
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,710
were clearly professional stage photos.

505
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,270
But ever since she performed

506
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,110
at your plant,

507
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,990
she seemingly became less particular

508
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,910
about the photos.

509
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,300
Look at this one.

510
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,230
It was obviously taken with a phone

511
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,590
from the audience seat.

512
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,200
Due to the stage lighting,

513
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,220
the photo is overexposed.

514
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,870
Then I checked

515
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,290
the information of these photos

516
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,690
and found that

517
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,500
the phone used to take this photo

518
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,530
matches the model of the phone

519
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,420
you're currently using.

520
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,480
Although they were not professionally shot,

521
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,350
I have to say that

522
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,150
only you

523
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,460
managed to capture Feng Xiaowen's

524
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,330
true beauty.

525
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,410
Yes.

526
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,460
I took all these photos.

527
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,200
So after that,

528
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,350
you became her...

529
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,830
Die-hard fan.

530
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,400
Since then,

531
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,750
I became

532
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,950
more and more obsessed with opera.

533
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,630
I never missed any

534
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,390
of her performances.

535
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,270
It was like

536
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,530
chasing after an idol.

537
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,150
Just like that.

538
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:39,750
I see.

539
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,350
But it seems like you've seen

540
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,230
her non-idol side as well.

541
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,710
In this photo,

542
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,620
she's without makeup,

543
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,510
smiling like a young girl.

544
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,910
Village opera performances

545
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,830
are so lively.

546
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,350
All those stalls at the entrance

547
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,450
were selling delicious food.

548
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,750
My apprentices were drooling over them.

549
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,830
Are you singing again tomorrow?

550
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,890
Are you coming again?

551
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,590
Of course.

552
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,840
I'll come if you're singing.

553
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,980
Baoding Village is quite far away.

554
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,800
It's no problem.

555
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,560
I borrowed a car from the plant and drove here.

556
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,870
That's great.

557
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,710
I really want to perform a good show for you.

558
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,320
The stage in this village is too small.

559
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,520
If it were bigger,

560
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,110
my entrance for my second act today

561
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,970
should have been like this.

562
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,480
Are you crazy?

563
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,830
Acting like a ghost in the middle of the night.

564
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,570
Are you alright?

565
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,170
Lunatic!

566
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,550
I'm sorry.

567
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,190
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,070
Let's go, let's go.

569
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,120
Tilt it more to me.

570
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,070
Thank you.

571
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,560
Ms. Feng.

572
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,570
Weren't you on duty today?

573
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,190
Here, this is for you.

574
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,040
This is called a Chinese rose.

575
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,350
It's also called the Monthly Bloom.

576
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,640
Water it once every three or four days.

577
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,920
If you take good care of it,

578
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,280
it will bloom every month.

579
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,360
Here.

580
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,330
I'll take it.

581
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,530
I'm leaving now.

582
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,630
Alright, go ahead.

583
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,190
Thank you.

584
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,550
The Monthly Bloom you gave her.

585
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,370
Is it the one in this photo?

586
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,820
Yes.

587
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,310
After every performance,

588
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,260
I would gift her a bouquet.

589
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,960
The flower language of Monthly Bloom is

590
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,820
"Waiting for hope."

591
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,990
So what were you waiting for?

592
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,710
I don't understand what you're saying.

593
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,550
You don't understand?

594
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,590
Then let me tell you.

595
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,200
What were you waiting for?

596
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,870
You were waiting for her to take the bait.

597
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,380
To think you have the nerve

598
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,390
to make yourself sound so sincere.

599
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,870
But the truth is, you're no different from those

600
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,910
who deceive the elderly

601
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,670
into buying substandard products

602
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,840
by visiting them with fake concern.

603
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,820
You're just like those scammers.

604
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,800
You were simply treating Feng Xiaowen

605
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,880
as a cash cow.

606
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,190
You were swindling her money.

607
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,030
That's not true.

608
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,430
It's not like that.

609
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,370
How is it not?

610
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,670
When you met her,

611
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,390
she wasn't even fifty.

612
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,600
There were so many insurance policies she could buy.

613
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,350
And the premiums were high.

614
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,670
What gives you the right to say this about me?

615
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,120
I'm not a scammer.

616
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,270
Such a big business deal,

617
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,950
of course it was worth your full dedication.

618
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,030
You even went as far as calling her "Godmother."

619
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,230
Shut your mouth!

620
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,480
You

621
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,310
are just like them.

622
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,270
It's people like you who killed her.

623
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,270
It's your prejudice

624
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,290
that drove her to death.

625
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,460
It's you who drove us to death!

626
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,520
Us?

627
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,120
Since when

628
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,830
did you become inseparable from her?

629
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,240
This was the location of the first victim,

630
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,690
Feng Xiaowen.

631
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,910
I remember you said in the meeting

632
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,750
that her cause of death hasn't been confirmed yet,

633
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,190
right?

634
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,130
Yes.

635
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,340
We only found

636
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,360
fractures in her left lower leg bone

637
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,740
and left forearm,

638
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,290
and dislocation of four fingers on her right hand.

639
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,500
Look,

640
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,230
there's a large amount of Feng Xiaowen's

641
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,000
old bloodstains here.

642
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,390
I believe this was

643
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,750
her original position at the time of death.

644
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,480
Hold this for me.

645
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,400
Fractures in the left lower leg and left forearm.

646
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,300
Dislocation of four fingers on the right hand.

647
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,910
Here.

648
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,670
There are obvious old bloodstains and scratch marks.

649
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,630
Feng Xiaowen might have

650
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,990
crawled over from here.

651
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,450
Do me a favor.

652
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,560
Suppose you were trapped here.

653
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,030
And then you discovered

654
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,180
this escape ladder.

655
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,140
You wanted to use this ladder

656
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,950
to climb to the window and escape.

657
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,750
It's too slippery.

658
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,880
Are you okay?

659
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,590
I'm fine.

660
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,830
I understand now.

661
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,260
Feng Xiaowen's build

662
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,290
was similar to mine.

663
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,030
Her fractures on the left side

664
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:33,950
were likely caused by

665
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,900
what happened to me just now.

666
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,590
She was trying to grab that handle

667
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,230
to climb up,

668
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,230
and then accidentally fell, causing the injuries.

669
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,290
So the real situation back then

670
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,040
should be that Feng Xiaowen

671
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,800
was trapped here for some reason,

672
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,500
failed in her attempt to escape,

673
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,720
and ultimately died here.

674
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,480
So she's different from the other victims.

675
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,370
She might not have been murdered.

676
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,070
Instead...

677
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,150
She starved to death.

678
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,510
How painful that must have been.

679
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,110
Even if Feng Xiaowen

680
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,230
wasn't murdered,

681
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,110
we still need to investigate

682
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,650
what exactly caused

683
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,760
her to be trapped and die here.
