(Episode 10)

3
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,470
Current location signal is weak.

4
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,030
Location updates may be delayed.

5
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,180
Do you know the deceased?

6
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,079
No, I don't,

7
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,650
it's my first time here, too.

8
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,260
Officer,

9
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,470
look,

10
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,930
can I go and change my pants first?

11
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,300
Take him.

12
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:37,870
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,500
An image of despair.

14
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,830
Captain Cheng,

15
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,760
there's 50,000 yuan in cash here.

16
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,990
Also,

17
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,670
there were originally

18
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,070
two desktop computers under here

19
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,610
and one has been taken away.

20
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,780
What is this?

21
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,900
Cement?

22
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,670
The color is similar,

23
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,830
but it's finer than cement.

24
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
It could be some other construction material,

25
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,940
or it might be...

26
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,650
sculpting clay.

27
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,820
I'm not sure.

28
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,420
We should take it back to the station for analysis.

29
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,990
Has the victim's identity been confirmed?

30
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,950
Not yet,

31
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,460
Li Han is working on it.

32
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,930
This place is so bizarre.

33
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,390
Someone was both living and working

34
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,920
inside this air raid shelter.

35
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,909
I just checked and noticed that

36
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,880
all the books here

37
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,690
are about law,

38
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,670
and the deceased died in such a terrible way

39
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,890
what on earth happened?

40
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,390
(Anatomy Room)

41
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,730
The time of death

42
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,910
was approximately between

43
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,430
8AM and 11AM yesterday.

44
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,640
The cause of death was due to organ damage

45
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,730
and massive blood loss.

46
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,830
The murder weapon was a 15 centimeters long,

47
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,590
5 centimeters wide,

48
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,910
single-edged sharp instrument.

49
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,360
There are five stab wounds to the chest,

50
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,200
each fatal, right to the point.

51
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,420
The lower abdomen suffered 16 stab wounds,

52
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,800
and his genitals

53
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,150
were completely mutilated.

54
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,070
Based on the angle

55
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,620
and force of the attacker's strikes,

56
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,870
the victim was likely

57
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,940
lying on the ground.

58
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,100
Judging from the ligature marks on his wrists,

59
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,110
and the varying degrees of bruising,

60
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,100
it seems that

61
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,330
before death, the victim

62
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,420
was continuously beaten by the attacker.

63
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,520
That's some brutal violence.

68
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,310
the deceased is named Dong Yidan.

69
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,310
He was 39 years old,

70
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,670
and graduated with a law degree

71
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,840
and worked as a lawyer.

72
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,190
However, due to multiple violations,

73
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,350
his license was revoked.

74
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,510
He is currently

75
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,670
an illegal private detective.

76
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,800
He has counter-surveillance skills,

77
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,610
therefore surveillance cameras were unable to capture

78
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,030
the entrance and exit of his office.

79
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,720
Private detective?

80
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,460
Have you found out

81
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,680
what cases he was working on recently?

82
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,650
No,

83
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,040
but a desktop computer

84
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,510
is missing

85
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,970
and only the power cord remains.

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,280
just informed us that

(Customer list of Beijiang Telecom Co., Ltd. Internet and data list)

92
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,670
at 9AM.

93
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,750
This means

94
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,510
it's highly likely that

95
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,500
the attacker took it after killing.

96
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,590
How's the crime scene?

97
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,430
No murder weapons were found at the scene

98
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,930
and no fingerprints were recovered.

99
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,010
No footprints were found on the floor either,

100
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,230
so it seems the attacker

101
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,159
deliberately cleaned up afterwards.

102
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,750
However, on the doormat,

103
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,350
two bloody

104
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,250
shoe print outlines were discovered.

105
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,720
Size 45.

106
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,640
There bed didn't have a bedsheet

107
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,190
so we don't know

108
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,510
if it was taken away by the killer.

109
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,100
On the sofa cushion,

110
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,590
we found the deceased's semen

111
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,910
and a woman's bodily fluids.

112
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,430
Based on the room's temperature,

113
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,570
humidity, and air flow rate,

114
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,230
it was likely produced

115
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,970
10 to 20 hours before the crime took place.

116
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,170
The voice recorder found at the scene

117
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,510
has been recording for a week prior to the incident.

118
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,760
What's wrong?

119
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,310
The content is as follows:

120
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,030
Yes...

121
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,820
Just like that...

122
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,750
Have you found out

123
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,530
the source of this recording?

124
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,830
Not yet,

125
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,580
but the day before the incident,

126
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,510
a woman

127
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,429
called him.

128
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,200
Her name is Song Minjie.

129
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,220
I also found a

130
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,350
canvas bag containing

131
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,070
50,000 yuan in cash at the scene.

132
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,350
Unfortunately, the cash in the bag

133
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,430
have been handled by too many people

134
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,480
during circulation,

135
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,750
so we are unable

136
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,550
to extract any

137
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,570
proper fingerprints from the bag.

138
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,030
Through the phone logs,

139
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,070
we also discovered that

140
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,190
on the day of the incident

141
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,670
some photos in his phone

142
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,510
were deleted.

143
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,830
By using technical means,

144
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,520
we recovered those photos

145
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,550
but they're either covered

146
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,910
or very blurry,

147
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,070
completely indistinguishable.

148
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,910
Is that all?

149
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,670
Currently, this is all we have from the phone.

150
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,440
However, I believe

151
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,200
these photos are likely

152
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,390
discarded photos left on the phone.

153
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,470
What do you mean?

154
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,990
If someone were to

155
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,270
transfer photos

156
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,530
from their phone to a computer,

157
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,750
typically

158
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,160

(Choose)
select the photos

163
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,790
they want to transfer.

164
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,310
Then after transferring,

165
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,470
they would take their phone

166
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,010
and delete the already transferred photos.

167
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,950
Then, what's left on the phone

168
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,120
would just be useless photos

169
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,390
that might be deleted

170
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,810
altogether after a month

171
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,040
or even longer.

172
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,750
Can the tech department recover them?

173
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,970
It'd be possible if it were an exposure issue,

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
but since these photos

175
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,190
are covered up

176
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:50,960
or were taken

177
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,360
unclearly in the first place,

178
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,160
there's nothing we can do.

179
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,230
I can give it a try.

180
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,210
(Guangyang pottery workshop)

181
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,990
What's this?

182
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,170
Cement?

183
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,090
The color is similar,

184
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,810
but it's finer than cement.

185
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,170
It could be some other construction material,

186
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,500
or maybe...

187
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,030
clay used for sculpting.

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,670
What's wrong?

190
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,130
This is the location I was able to track down

191
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,830

soil particles we found

201
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,350
in the money bag?

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,910

Yes, I have.

Yes, I'm sure.

217
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,830
Who are they?

218
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,520
Eight years ago

219
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,980
they were the attackers of a case.

220
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,110
The Haisu Internet Cafe arson case.

221
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,910
The internet cafe owner,

222
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,910
locked the iron gate

223
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,920
in order to avoid a surprise inspection

224
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,300

so they set fire to the debris at the back door of the internet cafe,

237
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,040
which resulted in the death of the owner,

238
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,390
and 18 other people.

239
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,950
At the time, since all three of them

240
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,370
were under 18 years old,

241
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,970
Huang Tao was sentenced to seven years,

242
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,370
Hao Ziqiang was sentenced to eight years,

243
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,270
and Ruan Fangfang was probably

244
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,450
under 14 years old,

245
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,950
so she wasn't held criminally responsible.

246
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,750
We also found this video

247
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,740
taken near Dong Yidan's Law Firm

248
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,030
by the public surveillance cameras.

249
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,430
On that day,

250
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,110
these two men

251
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,990
gave the black canvas bag holding the money

252
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,950
to Dong Yidan.

253
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,550
Their escape route

254
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,360
and the location reconstructed by Mr. Shen

255
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,770
matches together.

256
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,970
So these two men

257
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,950
are very likely

258
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,100
to be Huang Tao and Hao Ziqiang.

I want to ask him

276
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,830
why he hired a murderer

277
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,310
to work here!

278
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,180
Why?!

279
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,670
We already served our time in prison,

280
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,830
and the law now allows

281
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,920
us to return to society.

284
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,510
have all been destroyed

285
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,260
by you murderers.

286
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,350
Why should you be released

287
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:16,910
after just a few years?!

288
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,910
Why should you?!

289
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,130
Why should you?! Tell me!

290
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,990
Do you know what kind of life

291
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,030
I had in there?

292

You deserve it!

297

What do you guys want?!

298
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,070
To kill us?

299
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,640
A life for a life?

I was molested by the internet cafe owner,

308
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,850
and you guys stood up for me,

309
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,930
then went to prison.

310
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,110
I can't let you guys

311

324
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,000
don't take me back to jail.

325
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,580
I... I won't go back.

326
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,350
I... I'm begging you.

327
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,350
I'm begging you.

328
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:54,870
Don't take me back.

329
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,500
I beg you guys.

330
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,710
No one is taking you back to jail.

00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,960
I need to fix many cars...

334
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,270
That way I can pay Fangfang back...

335
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,390
I have to fix so many cars

336
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,590
to be able to pay back Fangfang.

337
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,840
His name is Dong Yidan.

338
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,850
He's an illegal private detective

339
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,300
who has been following you.

340
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,750
Officer,

341
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,020
I... beg you guys...

342
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,120
please... don't...

343
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,690
don't... don't blame Fangfang.

344
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,070
If you must...

345
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,590
If... you want to punish me... then punish me...

346
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,440
She is a good... good person...

347
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,110
She took...

348
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,830
the only fifty yuan she had...

349
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,340
to buy... food for me...

350
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,750
She...

351
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,840
She's more pitiful than I am.

352
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,240
But I...

353
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,290
I really don't want to go back.

354
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,800
I don't want to go back to prison.

355
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,670
This person seems

356
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,830
to be a bit unstable.

357
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,090
I knew he was following us.

358
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,110
Why did you go to see him that day?

359
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,270
He was blackmailing us

360
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,580
and demanding money from us.

361
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,700
If we didn't pay him

362
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,560
he threatened to send our addresses

363
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,110
to the victims' families.

364
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,230
Does the 50,000 yuan found at the scene

365
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,070
belong to you guys?

366
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,030
Yes.

367
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,790
What happened after you paid?

368
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,730
That bastard suddenly went back on his word,

369
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,060
and refused to delete the photos.

370
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,750
So you guys killed him?

371
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,320
No!

372
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,440
We just snatched his phone

373
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,579
and deleted the photos.

374
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,260
We didn't kill anyone!

375
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,010
Then was Dong Yidan's computer

376
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,339
taken away by you guys?

377
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,510
No.

378
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,890
We left after deleting the photos.

379
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,690
That bastard went back on his word...

380
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,270
so whoever the killer is,

381
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,480
I thank them.

382
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,109
You and Hao Ziqiang

383
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,109
have just been released recently.

384
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,250
50,000 yuan is not a small amount.

385
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,980
How did you guys manage to get that much?

386
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,880
We scraped it together.

387
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,460
How did you scrape it together?

388
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,330
Hao Ziqiang had no money at all.

389
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,060
I gathered from here and there

390
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,900
and got a little over 10,000 yuan.

391
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,000
A little over 10,000 yuan?

392
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,720
What about the rest?

393
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,360
The rest...

394
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,270
was all taken care of by Fangfang.

395
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,400
Ruan Fangfang?

396
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,750
Yes.

397
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,700
After I got out,

398
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,190
I contacted her.

399
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,390
I just wanted to know

400
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,270
how she had been doing these past few years,

401
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,470
but who knew that Dong Yidan

402
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,720
had been following us all along

403
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,370
and ended up exposing her instead.

404
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,470
So Dong Yidan initially

405
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,470
didn't know Ruan Fangfang's

406
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,270
actual whereabouts?

407
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,430
That's right.

408
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,030
It's all my fault.

409
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,150
Fangfang is the most innocent one...

410
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,850
Not only did she not blame me,

411
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,330
but she also helped us raise the money.

412
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,390
Officer,

413
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,950
this whole thing has nothing

414
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,830
to do with Fangfang.

415
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,270
She was just dragged into it.

416
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,670
Ruan Fangfang?

417
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,900
You've killed so many people,

418
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,670
yet you haven't spent a single day in jail.

419
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,180
Living quite comfortably out here, aren't you?

420
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,430
(New recording 10)

421
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,220
If I were to reveal the identities of you three
(New recording 10)

422
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,940
If I were to reveal the identities of you three

423
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,270
online,

424
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,590
what do you think will happen?

425
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,580
Fifty thousand,

426
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,590
to buy your happy life.

427
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,030
This deal

428
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,390
is a bargain, isn't it?

429
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,380
I don't have that much money.

430
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,680
No money?

431
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,190
If you don't have money, you can sell!

432
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,940
I've recorded this,

433
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,310
I can go to the police.

434
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,200
I know where you live.

435
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,410
I also know where those two

436
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,670
little punks of yours live.

437
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,630
Think it through carefully,

438
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,420
you're a murderer yourself.

439
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,710
If you don't want to pay this money,

440
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,700
then fine,

441
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:51,790
(Voice recorder)
then fine,

to Wang Hao.
(Voice recorder)

448
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,800
You were blackmailed,

449
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,750
why didn't you choose to report it to the police?

450
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,440
I wanted to report it to the police.

451
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,580
He molested me,

452
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,050
and took nude photos of me.

453
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,000
Did you meet Dong Yidan alone?

454
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,390
He found out where

455
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,780
the three of us lived

456
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,720
and demanded money from us.

457
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,400
I was thinking,

458
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,610
Huang Tao and the others

459
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,420
had finally just

460
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,740
gotten out of jail.

461
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,650
If Dong Yidan

462
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,440
were to meet them,

463
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,060
I was afraid something might happen.

464
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,430
So I decided to

465
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,510
meet Dong Yidan alone.

466
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,470
I wanted to see if there was

467
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,430
any other solutions.

468
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,790
I never expected that he would

469
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,710
actually...

470
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,200
He even threatened me...

471
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,200
to do the things that I don't like...

472
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,830
I'm sorry...

473
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,970
I'm sorry...

474
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,510
I didn't want it to be like this...

475
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,380
Why didn't you choose to resist?

476
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,960
I'm guilty.

477
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,650
I've made mistakes in the past.

478
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,790
So no matter what happens to me,

479
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,710
whatever it is,

480
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,150
I accept it.

481
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,000
At the end of the recording,

482
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,270
the Wang Hao mentioned,

483
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,380
who is he?

484
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,470
He's from the association of

485
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,460
the fire victims' families back then.

486
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,310
He's the one who commissioned Dong Yidan

487
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,560
to investigate our whereabouts.

488
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,670
This, too.

497
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,130
Although the shoe sizes match,
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

498
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,470
the shape of the shoes

499
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,910
doesn't match the pattern on the treads.

500
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,350
The DNA of other individuals

501
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,220
found on the body

502
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,180
also doesn't match theirs.

503
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,750
Also, the female DNA

504

extracted from the bodily fluids at the scene

505
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,130
doesn't belong to Ruan Fangfang either.

506
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,680
We can basically conclude

507
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,430
it wasn't them.

we've confirmed with the telecommunications department
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

512
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,150
that the cell phone signals of Huang Tao and the other two,

and their movement range and timing,

514
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,570
are the same as their statements.

515
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,660
They weren't lying.

I've found some information.

519
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:32,870
She's a family member

520
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,020
of a victim from that fire

521
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,870
and has a husband named Wang Hao.

522
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,640

(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

525
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,550
You two go to Song Minjie's house

526
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,110
and check for any leads.

527
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,900
-Okay.
-Okay.

528
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,830
Oh right,

529
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,830
you can release them now.

530
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,230
Understood.

531
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,790
Ms. Song,

532
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,590
we're here today

533
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,260
to understand

534
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,350
the case of Dong Yidan's murder

535
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,480
and some related circumstances.

536
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,940
We hope you can cooperate.

537
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,890
Ms. Song,

538
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,180
what was your relationship

539
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,540
with Dong Yidan?

540
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,030
He's the legal consultant

541
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,990
we hired.

542
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,380
Eight years ago,

543
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,300
my son died in an internet cafe fire.

544
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,890
It was that infamous

545
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,830
Haisu Internet Cafe arson case.

546
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,840
The three culprits were only sentenced to a few years,

547
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,130
and they've all been released now.

548
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,000
I just wanted to know

549
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,910
their current address.

550
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,120
What did you want to do

551
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,920
with their address?

552
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,260
Nothing.

553
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,880
We just wanted to know

554
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,990
their current situation.

555
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,130
Simply by knowing that they aren't doing well

556
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,400
will give us a peace of mind.

557
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,180
Then did you find it?

558
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,290
Dong Yidan is a liar.

559
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,180
He always claimed to have leads,

560
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,750
and repeatedly asked for money,

561
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,670
but what he provided

562
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,920
was all useless information.

563
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,770
But we've learned that

564
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,150
the day before yesterday,

565
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,670
you went to Dong Yidan's

566
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,390
office, didn't you?

567
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,020
I went there to ask for a refund.

568
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,610
The information he provided was all useless.

569
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,910
At first, he was unwilling to give back the money.

570
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,590
But when I said I would sue him,

571
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,490
he agreed.

572
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,170
Actually, I doubt

573
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,550
that he would actually give me back the money.

574
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,430
I'm just taking it one step at a time.

575
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,270
Is that all?

576
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,710
That's all.

577
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,000
Ms. Song,

578
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,040
actually,

579
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,280
we found a voice recorder

580
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,510
at the scene.

581
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,090
There's an audio clip inside,

582
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,390
please listen to this.

586
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,910
Yes...

587
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,640
Just like that...

588
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,920
We've already collected

589
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,510
the female bodily fluids

590
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,680
left at the scene

591
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,890
and detected the DNA.

592
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,080
It's me.

593
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,480
But I was forced to do it.

594
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,520
Are you saying...

595
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,190
Dong Yidan forced you?

596
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,990
It was my husband,

597
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,670
Wang Hao.

598
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,250
Wang Hao?

599
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,750
Your husband?

600
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,430
I know you guys won't understand.

601
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,350
No one can understand.

602
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,820
You guys don't know...

603
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,930
how it's been like since we lost our child...

604
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,440
I... the life I've been living...

605
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,740
Wang Hao keeps an eye on me every day.

606
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,230
This home...

607
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,000
has become...

608
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,990
a prison for me...

609
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,950
and Wang Hao...

610
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,000
is the prison guard.

611
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,720
You're back,

612
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,820
perfect timing,

613
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,780
dinner is ready.

614
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,780
Where are our son's photos?

615
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,060
I put them away.

616
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,340
I wanted to organize them.

617
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,090
No matter what,

618
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,070
we need to

619
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,540
go on and live our lives, right?

620
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,780
We need to look forward.

621
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,050
How dare you talk about looking forward?!

622
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,940
I work hard every day,

623
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,780
and the only thing I asked of you was to

624
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,020
take good care of our child.

625
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,480
Can't you even do that one thing right?!

626
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,450
How old is our son?

627
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,730
Fifteen...

628
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,730
Fifteen years old...

629
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,510
spending the night at an internet cafe

630
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,220
because you couldn't keep an eye on him.

631
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,930
What kind of mother are you?!

632
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,560
Now you want to look forward?!

633
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,860
That's not possible!

634
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,560
I shouldn't have slept that day...

635
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,470
I don't know why

636
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,810
but I was so tired.

637
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,500
I'm guilty...

638
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,360
It's my fault...

639
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,790
I'm guilty... I'm guilty...

640
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,270
You're guilty, right?

641
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,590
Let me tell you something,

642
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,180
if you really feel guilty,

643
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,630
find the three bastards

644
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,080
that killed our son

645
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,090
and kill them all.

646
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,950
That's how you can atone

647
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,320
for your sins!

648
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,290
But I couldn't do anything...

649
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,680
I could only keep on

650
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,110
going to see Dong Yidan.

651
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,260
I have to do something,

652
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,050
to make myself

653
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,590
feel a little better, right?

654
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,360
Dong Yidan

655
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,160
always gave me ambiguous information

656
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,110
to stall me

657
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,530
and asked me to make exchanges.

658
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,820
I've struggled...

659
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,910
I've resisted...

660
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,190
but later on...

661
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,410
I actually...

662
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,430
found a bit of

663
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,040
inner peace

664
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,710
through his insults.

665
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,190
I think...

666
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,680
self-destruction...

667
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,940
is also a form of atonement.

668
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,990
Wang Hao probably

669
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,390
noticed my change,

670
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,470
so

671
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,580
he put a listening device

672
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,560
in my bag.

673
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,540
I've had enough.

674
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,900
I thought

675
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,900
he would surely follow me.

676
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,550
I wanted him to rush in

677
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,550
and kill me.

678
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,200
If I died...

679
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,230
all of this

680
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,580
would be over.

681
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,570
But...

682
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,650
he didn't come.

683
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,780
When you left,

684
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,090
was Dong Yidan still alive?

685
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,760
Can anyone prove it?

686
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,550
He saw me out to get a taxi.

687
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,430
The driver should have seen him.

688
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,280
Yesterday morning, from 8AM to 11AM,

689
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,320
where was Wang Hao?

690
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,540
I don't know.

691
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,990
Then when was the last time

692
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,970
you saw him?

693
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,640
Last night.

694
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,110
At home?

695
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,800
Did he seem unusual?

696
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,370
I don't know.

697
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,270
We haven't had a normal conversation

698
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,520
in a long time.

699
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,160
Ms. Song,

700
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,620
we'd like to take a look at

701
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,340
some household items.

702
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,790
Do you mind?

703
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:56,920
Please, go ahead.

No,

722
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,450
I wanted to learn pottery from you.

723
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,909
Don't you usually work on cases?

724
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,630
I'm a sketch artist.

Yes, I draw.

727
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,230
But I don't know much about pottery.

728
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,150
I heard you opened a pottery studio,

729
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,199
so I thought I'd come and learn.

730
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,429
No problem,

731
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,270

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,270
feel free to look around.

733
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,429
Is something missing from

734
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,990
the center of this ceramic shard?

735
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,900
It looks fragmented,

736
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,550
as if trying to escape.

737
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,710
Isn't it much better now?

738
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,040
It can't escape anymore.

739
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,060
It's so difficult.

740
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,560
It breaks as soon as

741
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,940
I apply too much force.

742
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,470
That's how pottery is.

743
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,590
You need to learn to control the force.

744
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,650
If you don't apply enough pressure,

745
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,920
you can't control the shape.

746
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,090
If you apply too much pressure,

747
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,910
all your efforts will be wasted.

748
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,630
Control

749
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,360
is the key.

750
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,830
Why did you want to open a pottery studio?

751
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,650
I opened this small workshop

752
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,180
so that I could have

753
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,230
a quiet place.

754
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,270
No one here

755
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,230
knows about my past.

756
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,560
I can also escape the endless harassment

757
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,030
from those families.

758
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,950
But I know that

759
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,710
I can't escape.

760
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,230
I know you

761
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,230
didn't really come to

762
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,990
learn pottery from me.

763
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,630
How's this one

764
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,830
that I made?
