00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,020
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,860
What's your relationship with Chen Qin?

4
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,940
Do you know Li Muhe

5
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,690
and the other two victims?

6
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,710
On the day they were killed,

7
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,540
where were you?

8
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,220
I killed them.

9
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,780
(Chen Qin)

10
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:32,970
(Chen Qin)

11
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:53,680
(Love you, Chen Qin.)

12
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,430
Fool!

13
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,390
The one in there.

14
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,350
Go clean the bathroom.

15
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,700
Do you know…

16
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,990
what this means?

17
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,170
It's a diamond.

18
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,630
Qin said

19
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,890
the body of sand turns into rotten water;

20
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,180
the heart of diamonds is eternal.

21
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,420
In this world,

22
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,100
most people

23
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,830
are useless.

24
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,310
Before I met Qin,

25
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,590
I was just like them.

26
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,159
Cowardly,

27
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,440
useless,

28
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,640
and worthless.

29
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,110
I was wasting my life.

30
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,250
Until I saw Qin.

31
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,659
His smiles

32
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,610
shine like diamonds.

33
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,690
Qin

34
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,310
is the simplest

35
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,590
and purest person

36
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,670
in this world.

37
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,370
But some people

38
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,590
actually hurt him so deeply.

39
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,670
So you killed them

40
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,610
for Chen Qin?

41
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,310
No!

42
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,630
They deserved it!

43
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:17,700
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)
They deserved it!

44
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:17,980
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

45
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,380
They insulted Qin
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

46
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,030
and tried to destroy him completely!

47
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,180
I'd never allow them

48
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,680
to do it.

49
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,810
So,

50
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,270
I killed them.

51
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,390
Do you know

52
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,310
the consequences of murder?

53
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,560
Yes.

54
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,710
A life for a life.

55
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,130
I was waiting

56
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,390
for you to arrest me.

57
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,430
Then why did you run away

58
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,820
after killing them?

59
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,710
After the killing,

60
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,510
you should've

61
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,090
waited for the police at the scene.

62
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,870
Why did you

63
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,510
squeeze into

64
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,310
the narrow giraffe

65
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,310
at the risk of suffocation

66
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,910
to let

67
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,230
the cleaning staff take you out

68
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,300
the next day?

69
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,100
Why?

70
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,150
Because I wanted

71
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,810
to see Qin perform for the last time.

72
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,990
Without those three clowns,

73
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,830
his performance that day

74
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,280
was perfect.

Yuan Zhaodi

110
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,020
lived with her relatives when she was young.

111
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,710
Her parents took her brother to work in the city.

112
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,590
She lived

113
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,750
with her grandma and aunt.

114
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,470
A left-behind child.

115
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,870
After graduating from junior high,

116
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,830
she found a job in the city

117
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,630
and spent all the money she earned

118
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,450
on Chen Qin's albums

119
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,630
and merch.

120
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,190
In Chen Qin's fan club,

121
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,100
she's the earliest

122
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,020
and most loyal fan.

123
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,240
Captain Cheng.

124
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,550
I have a question.

125
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,830
Yuan Zhaodi

126
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,000
is thin and small.

127
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,110
She killed three men

128
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,220
all by herself?

129
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,770
Is that really possible?

130
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,790
At the scene,

131
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,300
no trace of anyone else was found.

132
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,800
In Yuan Zhaodi,

133
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,710
I noticed two kinds of vibes

134
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,450
that were completely different yet mingled together.

135
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,990
Look.

136
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,030
Mr. Shen.

137
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,830
Do you mean Yuan Zhaodi

138
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,880
was acting

139
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,310
when interrogated?

140
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,830
She was acting to convince us

141
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,100
that she was the murderer.

142
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,840
Some of her emotions were true,

(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

146
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,270
she was hiding something.

147
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,750
I found some clues.

148
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,470
In Yuan Zhaodi's phone,

149
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,990
she followed Chen Qin

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,390
on almost all social media platforms.

151
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,350
She often sent him messages

152
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,240
or commented on

153
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,710
his posts.

154
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,610
Chen Qin has never

155
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,400
replied to her.

156
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,720
But we've found that

157
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,600
they're actually friends

158
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,180
on WeChat.

159
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,430
I printed out

160
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,310
some of their chats.

161
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320

175

and even mentioned

and even mentioned

177
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,750
(It wasn't easy for me to join TBBT. I cherish it so much but they don't.)
(I see no point in living like this.)

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,830
for me.

373
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,730
That was Chen Qin's performance.

374
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,990
There were thousands of you before the stage.

375
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,110
But I'm unique.

376
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,990
Are you?

377
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,670
Yuan Zhaodi isn't the fan who has

378
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,250
spent the most money on you.

379
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,830
Why did you choose

380
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,030
to complain to her?

381
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,710
I chat

382
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,830
with those rich women too.

383
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,750
With people older than me,

384
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,110
I share the joy of life.

385
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,710
With people younger than me,

386
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,150
I share the worries of growing up.

387
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,180
They have different needs,

388
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,480
and I meet them differently.

389
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,190
Creating a loving atmosphere

390
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,080
requires skill.

391
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,030
Only by inspiring the fans' imagination can I be popular.

392
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,270
You love him so much.

393
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,050
But for Chen Qin,

394
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,300
it was just a performance.

395
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,170
His love for you

396
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
is all in your imagination.

397
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,920
No.

398
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
We love each other.

399
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,140
But I can't see it.

400
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,630
He treats you

401
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,270
just like how he treats

402
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,000
his countless other fans.

403
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,630
This is his job.

404
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,260
As he said,

405
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,160
he just provided the service

406
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,390
that an idol should provide.

407
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,830
Wake up, Yuan Zhaodi!

408
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,230
It's all in your imagination!

409
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,110
Shut up!

410
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,710
Shut up!

411
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,030
-Qin loves me!
-It's fake!

412
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,630
Qin loves me!

413
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,380
Wake up. He doesn't love you!

414
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,440
How can you prove it?

415
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,710
He kissed me!

416
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,550
He kissed me.

417
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,940
It's all true.

418
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,220
Just now…

419
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,550
I was acting.

420
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,970
You acted so well.

421
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,640
I was scared.

422
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,550
I learned it from you.

423
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,340
Gather round!

424
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,250
I interrogated

425
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Yuan Zhaodi just now.

426
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,460
(TBBT Dormitory Murder Case)

427
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,370
She believed
(TBBT Dormitory Murder Case)

428
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:41,710
(TBBT Dormitory Murder Case)

429
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,970
the wedding on stage
(TBBT Dormitory Murder Case)

430
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,710
was meant for her from Chen Qin.

431
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:45,950
So I kept

432
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,310
provoking her

433
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,590
and telling her

434
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,780
Chen Qin's love for her was fake.

435
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,110
In the end,

436
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,070
she said that the two of them

437
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,190
once kissed.

438
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,070
They kissed?

439
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,590
At that moment, all her reactions

440
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,270
showed that

441
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,250
it should be true.

442
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,990
Combined with the glove we found,

443
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,030
I've come to the conclusion that

444
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,510
Chen Qin and Yuan Zhaodi

445
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,650
do have

446
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,150
some kind of feelings

447
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,430
for each other.

448
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,190
And

449
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,350
they're covering up a promise

450
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,430
they made to each other.

451
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,470
It was a conspiracy.

452
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,860
Then how did the murderer know

453
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,750
when the camera

454
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,220
would be turned or covered?

455
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,730
How did she know

456
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,430
when the three victims

457
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,900
would be immobile?

458
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,960
Could it be that on the night of the murder,

459
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,220
Chen Qin helped Yuan Zhaodi?

460
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,620
Why did you call me here?

461
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,030
You're about the same height as Chen Qin.

462
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,890
Stand here for me

463
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,710
as a model.

464
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,300
What do you want?

465
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,870
I'll try to find out

466
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,710
why Chen Qin stopped here

467
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,820
based on the shadow

468
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,380
caught on camera.

469
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,830
Is this okay?

470
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,340
Yeah. Wait for me.

471
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,160
Alright, Du Cheng.

472
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,470
Now,

473
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,390
get down.

474
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,870
Du Cheng.

475
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,160
What now?

476
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,700
Kneel.

477
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,120
Kneeling.

478
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,370
Okay.

479
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,490
Now,

480
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,650
put that monkey

481
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,510
on the ground

482
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,120
with its head towards you.

483
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,290
Look at its eyes.

484
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,430
Okay.

485
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,870
Now,

486
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,660
kiss that monkey.

487
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,650
Kiss it.

488
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,010
Didn't Little Eggshell say

489
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,610
Chen Qin kissed her?

490
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,540
Help me recreate that moment.

491
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,420
How long should I keep kissing it?

492
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,370
A bit longer.

493
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,710
Chen Qin stopped for one minute

494
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,710
to kiss Little Eggshell?

495
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,480
It seems

496
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,300
only Little Eggshell

497
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,640
can tell us the truth.

498
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,910
What is this?

499
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,710
What do you think

500
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,470
this painting is about?

501
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
I think

502
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,740
it's a wedding.

503
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,550
I want to tell you about this painting.

504
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,830
Are you interested?

505
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,710
Yes.

506
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,890
The painter of the original version

507
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,130
spent his whole life

508
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,910
drawing paintings

509
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,520
about his wife.

510
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,000
Wedding dresses,

511
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,030
grooms,

512
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,190
and brides

513
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,850
are all important elements in his paintings.

514
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,940
Just like Qin and me.

515
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,910
You still don't understand.

516
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,860
The Black Glove has strong colors

517
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,500
and distorted forms.

518
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,350
It shows the strong surges

519
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,870
of emotions in the painter.

520
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,990
Look at that bride.

521
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,030
In unstable surroundings,

522
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,430
she's the only one

523
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,120
who's covered

524
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,310
in steady brightness.

525
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,510
She represents true love.

526
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,670
But do you see

527
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,030
the black glove by her feet?

528
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,360
That's an ominous fear.

529
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,540
A house that will collapse at any time.

530
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,940
A crimson bird.

531
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,010
Everything is chaotic,

532
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,800
distorted,

533
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,830
and struggling.

534
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,320
This painting

535
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,270
shows the dangers

536
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,270
in a romantic relationship.

537
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,160
Like the groom in the painting.

538
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,730
So far away

539
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,800
and small.

540
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,370
Chen Qin is the same.

541
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,230
He's just a fictional man

542
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,550
you made up for yourself.

543
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,140
He's not real.

544
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:08,950
He is.

545
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,590
In this world,

546
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,160
he's the first person

547
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
to care so much about me.

548
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,470
He's not that boy!

549
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,100
No!

550
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,110
He's an imposter, isn't he?

551
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,230
Even an impression is better than this.

552
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,640
I shouldn't have come.

553
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,130
We'd made it clear before we came.

554
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,730
The boy has grown older.

555
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,870
Of course he looks different.

556
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,250
He's been booed off the stage,

557
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,790
yet you still want me to pay you?

558
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,950
Impossible.

559
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,100
That's your problem,

560
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,210
not ours.

561
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,630
You are Chen Qin.

562
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,790
I can prove it.

563
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,870
I watched Stars After Sunset.

564
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,250
In it,

565
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,990
you told your sister

566
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,670
not to be afraid

567
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,430
because you'd protect her.

568
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,390
That show is very old.

569
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,220
Are you wearing that

570
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,010
for a deceased family?

571
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,950
My grandma died.

572
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,270
Now,

573
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,310
no one cares for me.

574
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,110
That's great.

575
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,410
I hope my parents can leave me alone,

576
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,070
but they keep taking me around for gigs

577
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,070
to make money.

578
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,950
You're useful if you can make money.

579
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,820
That's great!

580
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,410
Don't be upset.

581
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,110
Let me perform something for you.

582
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:40,080
(For plot purposes. Please do not try this.)

583
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,070
W-What are you doing?

584
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,950
It's dislocated.

585
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,020
Why aren't you laughing?

586
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,030
Every time I do this,

587
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,280
people laugh.

588
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,890
Y-You can't do this.

589
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,260
You're harming yourself.

590
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,500
He encouraged me to leave my original home

591
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,989
and give myself a new home.

592
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,370
I listened.

593
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,989
From then on,

594
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,230
wherever he went,

595
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,989
I followed him there

596
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:18,710
to do part-time jobs.

597
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:26,330
He told me about all his worries.

598
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,310
He also shared

599
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,460
happy moments with me.

600
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,340
I know everything about him.

601
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,280
Isn't this love?

602
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,110
You've just projected the love you desire

603
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,620
onto him.

604
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,820
But Chen Qin

605
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,270
can't represent love.

606
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,980
Because love is bright.

607
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,650
Love won't make you pick up a knife.

608
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,110
The moment

609
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,230
you held that knife up,

610
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,430
you were already consumed

611
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,890
by the darkness and evil around you.

612
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,110
Yuan Zhaodi.

613
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,680
It's not wrong to sacrifice for love.

614
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,800
But sacrificing your life

615
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,880
for a kiss

616
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,100
that didn't mean anything

617
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,760
is not worth it.

618
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,150
If he didn't love me,

619
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,110
why did he kiss me

620
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,350
and save me?

621
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,890
His breath

622
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,350
was hot.

623
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,350
His blood

624
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,200
was so sweet.

625
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,160
What happened to your lip?

626
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,430
I hit it by accident a few days ago.

627
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,610
It's all true.

628
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,270
It really happened,

629
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,200
didn't it?

630
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,290
Didn't it?

631
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,370
It's all make-believe.

632
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,190
Only when you believe

633
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,620
this love is real

634
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,620
can you do anything for him.

635
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,350
At the end of the day,

636
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,520
you just want to prove

637
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,360
you're useful.

(Forensic Identification Center of Beijiang City Public Security Bureau)
(Blood Test Report)

639
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,300
As you guessed,

640
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,170
in the giraffe-shaped stool,

641
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,020
we found trace amounts of blood.

642
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,530
(Conclusion: The analysis of samples 1 and 2 revealed that
the bloodstains on the giraffe-shaped stool are similar to those of Chen Qin.)

00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,570
It matches

the bloodstains on the giraffe-shaped stool are similar to those of Chen Qin.)

647
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,020
We've confirmed that

648
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,570
after the murder, before it dawned,

649
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,250
you met Yuan Zhaodi.

650
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,590
You even kissed her.

651
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,830
We also found blood

652
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,020
in the giraffe-shaped stool

653
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,050
at the scene.

654
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,150
It matches

655
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,800
your DNA.

656
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,870
The wound on your lip

657
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,110
was caused at that time, right?

658
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,960
Yuan Zhaodi admitted that

659
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,290
you told her

660
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,160
when and where

661
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,100
to kill the victims.

662
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,990
You even offered her

663
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,370
the motive.

664
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,270
It was a conspiracy.

665
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,880
Qin?

666
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,840
What are you doing here?

667
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,580
You're back.

668
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,180
Are you hungry?

669
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,390
Come and eat.

670
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,120
Why are you eating these things?

671
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,480
They'll make you gain weight.

672
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,440
You can't eat that!

673
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,740
Don't take mine.

674
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,470
Eggshell.

675
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,920
There's more over there.

676
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,310
Eat them.

677
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,430
I never knew

678
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,390
how drugs could make you feel.

679
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,190
They forced you to do it?

680
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,760
They forced me to take a few whiffs.

681
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,310
I'll kill them!

682
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,820
Qin.

683
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,600
Qin.

684
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,160
I'm serious.

685
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,750
Just let me

686
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,740
be useful for once,

687
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,550
will you?

688
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,910
I have to go.

689
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,430
Qin, wait.

690
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,880
If you agree,

691
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,260
give me a wedding…

692
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,800
in your performance.

693
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,230
Consider it our wedding.

694
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,920
If I can marry you,

695
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,420
I don't mind dying.

696
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,780
Afterward,

697
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,110
I talked with the producer

698
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,510
and made "wedding" the theme

699
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,510
of the performance.

700
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,550
We announced it on Weibo.

701
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,230
I promised her that.

702
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,520
I thought about

703
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,510
telling her to quit.

704
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,500
Qin.

705
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,460
I'm here.

706
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,390
I made it.

707
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,510
Yes.

708
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,720
But I can't hold on any longer.

709
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,940
It'll be over soon.

710
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,350
Hang in there, okay?

711
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,770
The cleaner will come at 5 a.m.

712
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,070
You'll be free then.

713
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,070
I really didn't want her feelings

714
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,270
to be unreciprocated.

715
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,470
I want to know

716
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,770
what Yuan Zhaodi

717
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,230
means to you.

718
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,270
She's the only audience who understands me.

719
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,830
If she lives,

720
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,030
I live.

721
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,710
If she dies,

722
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,060
I die.

723
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,630
In order to prove

724
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:14,400
she was useful,

725
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,290
she killed people

726
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:16,870
and believed

727
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:17,880
it was all for love.

728
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,990
How absurd.

729
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,150
If Chen Qin hadn't been so selfish

730
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,870
and had cherished her love,

731
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,240
maybe they wouldn't have ended up like this.

732
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,710
Humanity is

733
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,870
complicated.

734
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:32,630
His love is true.

735
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,370
It's also true

736
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,780
that he's selfish and cowardly.

737
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:37,430
Alright.

738
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,060
A crime is a crime.

739
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,130
They need to bear the consequences of it.

Captain Cheng.

742
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,290
Eat something.

743
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,340
You've been working all day

744
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,510
without eating anything.

745
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,230
Here.

00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:21,610
Cold noodles?

747
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,150
The water was not hot.

748
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,090
So I had to

749
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,530
use lukewarm water.

750
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:33,960
I'll just drink this.

751
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:34,690
It's refreshing.

752
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:41,950
By the way,

753
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,610
I'm almost done here.

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,100
Wrap it up after going back.

755
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,630
Write a case closing report.

756
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,780
No problem.

757
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,490
I'll eat this then.

759
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,860
the packing is exhausting.

760
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,410
She asked me to buy drinks for everyone

761
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,440
for refreshment.

762
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,590
Thank you.

763
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,560
Yours is different.

Three boxes, right?

768
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,650
Okay, put them there.

769
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,020
Refresh yourself.

Director Zhang.

771
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,410
The case is closed?

772
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,090
Yes.

773
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,490
How's the packing?

774
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,620
Almost done.

775

Jiang.

776
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:29,670
Did you buy drinks

777
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,610
for everyone as I asked?

778
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,710
They're on the table.

779
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,190
Distribute them.

780
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,550
Okay.

781
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,670
Come on, guys!

782
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,310
Finish packing soon

783
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,380
so we can get off work early.

784
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,740
Okay.

785
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,310
Zheng, give me a hand.

786
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,040
Coming.

787
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,500
Here's another box.
