Sister,

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,699
will you come to lead us again tomorrow?

6
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,990
I'd like to learn more from you.

7
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,990
Keep it up.

11
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,160
Be careful.

12
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,200
Your condition today

13
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,700
is really quite dangerous.

14
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,990
Your health is important.

15
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,480
I can handle it.

16
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,829
I need to make money.

17
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,890
But you can't risk your life for money.

18
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,470
You care about me?

19
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,720
If you want to pity me,

20
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,600
you won't even be able to do this job!

21
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,700
Don't think I don't know

22
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,830
what you're up to.

23
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,940
If you want me to take you under my wing, just say it.

24
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,580
Stop acting innocent here.

25
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,510
Doing laundry is what you should be doing.

Who's the sick one?

27
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,010
I care about you out of kindness.

Even if you don't need me,

29
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,110
you don't have to be like this.

30
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,200
You're sick.

31
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,070
Who do you think you are?

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,450
Why does this person

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,750
look so much like Jiang Feng?

Insomnia, maybe?

Instead of tossing and turning in bed,

43
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,839
why don't you

44
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,310

I was being nice to her

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,160
but she just blew up at me.

57
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,350
Her face changed faster than flipping pages.

I don't even know

what I did to offend her.

67
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,170
Why was she so mean...

68

and resentment.

Think about it.

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,970
She's been in this kind of

98
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,960
work environment for a long time.

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,310
Being insincere

100
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,650
is her normal state.

101
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,790
It's rare for someone

102
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,830
to treat her sincerely.

103
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,670
But your

104
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,530
sudden and sincere concern

105
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,150
made her feel at a loss.

106
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,950
It's as if someone had caught a glimpse of

107
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,410
the vulnerability she hid deep inside.

108
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,710
So,

109
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,800
aggression

110
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,600
became her defense mechanism.

111
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,440
This also represents

112
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,350
some of the uncertainty

113
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,340
in her state.

114
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,140
Shen Yi, then do you think

115
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,650
Jingjing might

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,430
become

117
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,570
her attack target again?

118
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,650
These are all just my speculations.

119
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,150
They don't represent facts.

Ao Li's behavior,

122
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,990
this information alone is not enough.

123
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,550
Why are you all here after work?

124
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,130
Captain Cheng,

125
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,040
you're back.

126
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,820
If I hadn't come back,

127
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,270
the police station would have turned into a live-streaming room.

129
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,260
Don't you have anything better to do

130
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,190
while I'm not in the office?

131
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,470
It's not like that.

132
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,050
Well, this matter

133
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,060
is not Jiang Feng's fault.

134
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,380
He just wanted

135
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,100
to help Jingjing.

136
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,200
But I assure you,

137
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,910
it was all done after work hours.

138
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,230
It didn't interfere with work at all.

139
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:16,870
Really.

140
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,630
Actually, this is my fault.

141
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,640
I was the one

142
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,260
who arranged it.

143
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,670
This isn't Li Han's fault.

144
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,500
If anyone's to blame, it's me.

145
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,620
I insisted on going.

146
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,830
I just wanted to help Yan.

147
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,690
As for Ao Li,

148
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,050
I find her quite interesting.

149
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,440
I wanted to study her a bit.

150
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,040
I asked someone to look into it.

151
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,820
This is Ao Li's resume from before she became

152
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,750
a streamer, right?

153
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,340
We were just thinking of getting this.

154
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,220
Captain Cheng, you're a godsend.

155
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,250
Thank you, Captain Cheng.

156
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,010
Are you satisfied?

157
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,670
You don't look as

158
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,140
overbearing as you do

159
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,000
in the live stream.

160
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,340
Do you like this outfit then?

161
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,530
I wore it especially for you.

162
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,010
It does have a certain appeal.

163
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,880
If you're willing

164
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,010
to wear it every time in the live stream,

165
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,730
I would definitely send lots of...

166
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,930
It's ruining the mood.

167
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,250
Let's talk about it another day.

168
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,790
Little dumpling.

169
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,030
Did I say you could leave?

170
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,160
Stand still.

171
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,250
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,910
Please punish me.

173
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,650
If you want to look, just look openly.

174
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,190
But you can also

175
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,310
watch my livestream

176
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,670
and send me gifts.

177
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,560
If you become the top gifter,

178
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,290
I might go on a date with you.

179
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,610
Jingjing and Yan told me

180
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,200
that you were very popular

181
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,030
during your college years.

182
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,510
You were a loyal friend

183
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,620
and an excellent student.

184
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,470
You shouldn't be like this.

185
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,220
You're using self-destructive ways

186
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,250
to hurt yourself.

187
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,430
So you're a police officer too.

188
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,360
I didn't know there were such handsome cops.

189
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,050
Alright,

190
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,970
no need to beat around the bush.

191
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,270
They don't mean much

192
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,470
to me in my heart.

193
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,060
They're the ones being pathetic,

194
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,490
insisting on disgusting me.

195
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,390
So I have no choice

196
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,060
but to disgust them back.

197
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,660
Why can't I get a cab?

198
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,390
Taxi!

199
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,660
Taxi!

200
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,610
Taxi!

201
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,960
Taxi!

202
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,660
So?

203
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,340
Do you think I'll be grateful to you?

204
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,890
It's hard to get a cab here.

205
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,400
I asked my colleagues to pick us up

206
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,120
and send you back.

207
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,440
Take the police car?

208
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,760
People might think

209
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,710
I'm a murderer.

210
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,290
But would you become one?

211
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,980
Guess.

212
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,220
If I had never

213
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,150
met Luo Yifan

214
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,260
and Yan Jingjing,

215
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,670
what would I be like now?

216
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,900
You're right.

217
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,100
I was a top student.

218
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,210
I was that kid other parents envied.

219
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,000
If I hadn't chosen to pursue arts,

220
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,110
maybe I'd be

221
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,980
at Peking University now.

222
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,620
It's still not too late to become

223
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,100
who you want to be.

224
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,230
Not too late?

225
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,630
It's way too late!

226
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,170
You saw it just now.

227
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,150
This is who I am now.

228
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,440
I'm rotten to the core.

229
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,590
Every choice I made

230
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,650
was a mistake.

231
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,300
I was doing well in school.

232
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,660
Why did I have to

233
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,300
study landscape design?

234
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,800
The clothing store was doing well.

235
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,160
Why did I have to give all my money

236
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,320
to that bastard

237
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,400
to help me find a designer?

238
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,670
I wanted to start my own brand.

239
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,720
Then I wanted to get married.

240
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,500
I chose to marry a jerk

241
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,000
who transferred his assets

242
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,670
to his ex-wife and daughter

243
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,430
before our wedding.

244
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,810
I thought

245
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,829
I was marrying for love.

246
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,630
Ao Li.

247
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,540
Calm down first.

248
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,650
The rain is too heavy now.

249
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,069
You should-

250
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,500
Don't come near me!

251
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,810
Every choice

252
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,200
has led to this

253
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,670
miserable life.

254
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,110
Every time I trust someone,

255
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,470
I end up completely hurt.

256
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,570
I'm so stupid.

257
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm just a fool!

258
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,230
Ao Li.

259
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,840
It's too dangerous in the middle of the road.

260
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,890
Come back quickly.

261
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,270
Don't bother.

262
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,590
Don't bother with me!

263
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,510
Come back quickly. It's too dangerous.

264
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:48,810
Ao Li.

265
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,010
Who are you to me?

266
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,230
Are we close?

267
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,100
Listen, Ao Li.

268
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,920
Let's go back first.

269
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,790
If murder weren't illegal,

270
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,520
would you have thought about it?

271
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,650
Get in the car.

272
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,780
Get in first.

273
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,100
You can stop here.

274
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,810
Thanks.

275
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,470
Why did she come here

276
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,700
instead of going home?

277
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,700
That's about it.

278
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,260
Anyway, according to Jiang Feng,

279
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,340
Ao Li's state is

280
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,720
relatively normal at work.

281
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,240
There are occasional extreme behaviors,

282
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,030
which might be

283
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,120
to relieve stress.

284
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,420
If that's the case,

285
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,130
there shouldn't be any problem.

286
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,110
Have some pizza.

287
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,330
Good food solves a thousand worries.

288
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,250
Thank you, Yan.

289
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,160
Let me do it.

290
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,370
Shen Yi, come.

291
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,550
(Every pizza is made to order)

292
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,050
Mr. Shen,

293
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,000
have some too.

294
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,910
I think we still haven't found

295
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,920
the root cause of the illness.

296
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,840
The information Du Cheng found shows that

297
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,350
after the incident

298
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,190
with Jingjing and Luo Yifan,

299
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,240
Ao Li's life has endured great ups and downs,

300
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,590
and she's encountered

301
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,390
quite a few other hardships.

302
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,230
So why is she still fixated on

303
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,550
Jingjing and Luo Yifan's matter?

304
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,240
Hasn't this resentment

305
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,550
lasted for too long?

306
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,180
Shen Yi,

307
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,930
from what we can see,

308
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,350
Ao Li hasn't gone looking for Yan Jingjing again.

309
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,640
Why don't we just let it go?

310
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,960
We can't let it go, Yan.

311
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,360
Ao Li's emotional fluctuations

312
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,310
are too unstable.

313
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,840
Her personality

314
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,870
is filled with danger,

315
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,190
even self-destructive tendencies.

316
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,440
She could

317
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,220
be provoked at any time.

318
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,470
Comrades.

319
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,030
I...

320
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,990
Is this a celebration party for my return?

321
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,870
Why are you back?

322
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,340
Have a bite.

323
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,100
I resigned from Palmfire.

324
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,200
Let me tell you,

325
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,680
that job was simply inhuman.

326
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,830
Dancing day and night,

327
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,930
who could endure that?

328
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,920
Eat more,

329
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,860
you've lost weight.

330
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,310
Who bought this?

331
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,240
-Yan.
-It’s from Yan.

332
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,290
You've been working hard.

333
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,140
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

334
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,230
Oh, right,

335
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,550
Ao Li also resigned from Palmfire.

336
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,560
When she left,

337
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,630
she made a big scene.

338
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,500
Stop right there.

339
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,490
Give me that.

340
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,070
Hand it over.

341
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,860
Everyone,

342
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,440
take a look!

343
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,780
Quick, look at this.

344
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,190
Don't look! Don't pick them up!

345
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,900
What do you want?

346
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,050
I've already prepared a copy

347
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,170
to send to your daughter's school.

348
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,700
I'll let her classmates see

349
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,880
how her father is involved

350
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,670
with multiple female streamers.

351
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,410
So,

352
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,740
do you still want that

353
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,330
penalty fee?

354
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,600
If you do this, you're finished too.

355
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,700
Infamy is still fame, isn't it?

356
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,520
Stop!

357
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,220
Stop it!

358
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,590
Destroy those she hates,

359
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,450
including herself.

360
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,940
If murder weren't illegal,

361
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,090
would you have thought about it?

362
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,080
I think a violent incident might happen soon.

363
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,480
Where are you going?

364
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:10,910
I want to go

365
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,280
check out where Ao Li got off.

366
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,270
Shen Yi, I...

367
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,110
I'll go with you.

368
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,930
Then we'll go too.

369
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,900
I'll contact the police station

370
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,950
to coordinate with the property management.

371
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,370
I'm from the local police station.

372
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,220
This is the warehouse Ao Li rented.

373
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,070
What kind of

374
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,420
style is this?

375
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,250
For Ao Li, this is

376
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,390
like a child's

377
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,290
secret base.

378
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,790
It's a world

379
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,020
that completely belongs to her.

380
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,400
So,

381
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,500
her most authentic self

382
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,410
must be locked in here.

383
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,560
Her most authentic self?

384
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,920
She likes these dolls?

385
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,270
Then she must be quite innocent.

386
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,450
These are bisque dolls.

387
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,080
Bisque dolls

388
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,630
are products from over a hundred years ago.

389
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,560
Although the same face mold

390
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,120
was used to produce hundreds or thousands,

391
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,570
other things like

392
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,700
the hair,

393
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:37,970
makeup,

394
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,670
and clothing

395
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,400
were all created by

396
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,830
different designers.

397
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,040
So in a sense,

398
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,800
in this world,

399
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,420
no two bisque dolls

400
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,620
are identical.

401
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,640
They're considered art pieces.

402
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,630
These dolls

403
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,630
have a common feature:

404
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,660
their eyeballs

405
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,810
are blown from glass.

406
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,130
They all have a mechanism

407
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
in their heads.

408
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,230
When they sit up,

409
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,240
their eyes open.

410
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,510
And when they lie down,

411
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,330
their eyes close.

412
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,060
But why did Ao Li

413
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,310
deliberately

414
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,230
glue this doll's eyes

415
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,100
shut?

416
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,560
Its eyes are glued shut.

417
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,910
That's really creepy.

418
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,750
You just said she was innocent,

419
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,900
and now you're calling her creepy.

420
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,980
Innocent?

421
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,950
Creepy?

422
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,470
Lilith.

423
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:52,920
Ao Li has disguised

424
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,960
her most innocent side

425
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,310
as a demon.

426
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,820
No, Shen Yi, she...

427
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,940
Why did she

428
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,160
do these things?

429
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,230
This is her murderous intent.

430
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,570
Where's Jingjing?

431
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,670
She didn't tell me.

432
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,350
I think she's taking wedding photos tomorrow.

433
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,380
Wedding photos?

434
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,360
It's my first time dressing so formally in my life.

435
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm not used to it.

436
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,190
Aren't you going to button up?

437
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:32,970
This one?

438
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,310
They said I don't need to button it.

439
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,890
How do I look?

440
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,910
They're here.

441
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,190
Dad.

442
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,630
Uncle.

443
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,790
Jingjing,

444
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,830
you look beautiful.

445
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,910
Thank you.

446
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,740
Very nice, very nice.

447
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,630
I want to figure out

448
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,750
Ao Li's specific plans as soon as possible.

449
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,990
You guys go ahead first. Keep in touch.

450
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,620
Let's go.

451
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,210
L-shaped curve road.

452
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,260
Turning mirror.

453
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,610
Sharp heavy object.

454
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,790
Beautiful.

455
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,560
Come on.

456
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,910
Do a heart pose.

457
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,530
Come on.

458
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,600
Sweetheart pose, that's right.

459
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,480
It's essential.

460
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,260
Okay, good.

461
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,000
Good.

462
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,150
Groom, hug the bride.

463
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,200
Tighter, tighter. Come on.

464
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,270
Smile, that's it.

465
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,190
Beautiful.

466
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,160
Double shot Americano.

467
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,850
This outfit.

468
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,080
I think it looks pretty good.

469
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,210
Why are you looking at me?

470
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,330
Look at the bride.

471
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,350
I am looking.

472
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,690
Jiang Feng.

473
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,620
Come, have some coffee.

474
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,540
Fresh coconut latte.

475
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,080
Americano.

476
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,220
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Yan.

477
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,030
You've started buying

478
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,250
things that young people like.

479
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,790
Face each other.

480
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,550
Good, very nice.

481
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,220
Groom, make more eye contact

482
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,970
with the bride.

483
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,760
Show your love.

484
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,700
Smile brighter.

485
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,870
Good.

486
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,690
Beautiful.

487
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,820
Du Cheng.

488
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,490
Can you not

489
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,300
tell Jingjing about yesterday?

490
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,680
It's a once-in-a-lifetime event for her.

491
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,650
I, I...

492
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,640
I want everything to go smoothly for her.

493
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,320
Good, nice one.

494
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,560
You can also raise it up, yes.

495
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,590
Don't cover your face. Good.

496
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,480
Look happy.

497
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,900
Bright and sunny.

498
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,390
Good.

499
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,100
Beautiful.

500
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,770
The rearview mirror at noon

501
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,000
will reflect intense light.

502
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,860
When the wedding car reaches the turn,

503
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,460
the driver will be dazzled

504
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,370
and have their vision impaired.

505
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,950
There will be a momentary blind spot,

506
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,830
causing them to crash into a building.

507
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,030
Sharp, heavy objects will then fall.

508
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,970
The brooch

509
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,090
represents Ao Li herself.

510
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,790
She intends to cause an accident.

511
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,300
Her furnishings

512
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,640
are a preview of her crime.

513
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,180
Du Cheng,

514
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,620
I got it now.

515
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,510
The sun's glaring today.

516
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,199
Is Jingjing alright?

517
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,540
You didn't take that step.

518
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,280
(Strictly regulate fair and just procedures, legality, objectivity, and fairness)

519
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,100
Because there was a risk
(Strictly regulate fair and just procedures, legality, objectivity, and fairness)

520
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,350
of a major accident occurring,
(Strictly regulate fair and just procedures, legality, objectivity, and fairness)

521
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:24,910
(Strictly regulate fair and just procedures, legality, objectivity, and fairness)

522
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,700
we've asked you to come in to assist with our inquiries.
(Strictly regulate fair and just procedures, legality, objectivity, and fairness)

523
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,890
You learned about Yan Jingjing

524
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,130
and Luo Yifan's itinerary

525
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,150
through the alumni group, didn't you?

526
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,360
Why did you search for the watering schedule

527
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,140
of Baicui Road last night?

528
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,910
At nine o'clock this morning,

529
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,500
you went to Baicui Road

530
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,750
and lingered near the construction site

531
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,220
for more than ten minutes.

532
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,110
Were you planning to use

533
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,190
the road conditions and environment

534
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,750
to cause a car accident?

535
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,070
You calculated in advance

536
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,070
the time and location.

537
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,460
If you had rushed onto the road

538
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,590
and the wedding car couldn't dodge in time,

539
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,470
it would have swerved off the road

540
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,130
and crashed into the scaffolding.

541
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,720
If.

542
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,300
Maybe.

543
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,290
Officers,

544
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,880
you sure are good at making up stories.

545
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,480
But the second half of this story

546
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,000
didn't happen, did it?

547
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,350
What were you really doing

548
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,310
at Baicui Road?

549
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,470
Of course, I was there to send my blessings.

550
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,400
Only those with guilty consciences

551
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,020
would mistake a surprise

552
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,010
for a scare.

553
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,180
(Beijiang Branch, Beijiang City Public Security Bureau)

554
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,220
Yan,

555
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,020
I know you're anxious,

556
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,550
but try to calm down.

557
00:37:59,550 --> 00:37:59,830
No,

558
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,350
but this girl Ao Li,

559
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,220
I originally thought

560
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,680
she was just a bit extreme and temperamental.

561
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,050
Who could have imagined

562
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,390
that she would be heartless enough

563
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,550
to do such a thing?

564
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,060
I dare say that

565
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,630
Du Cheng and the others

566
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,940
won't be able to get anything out of her.

567
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,980
This kid is just too slick.

568
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,830
You didn't see

569
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,630
how pitiful she looked

570
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,500
when she apologized to me before.

571
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,980
And now look at her.

572
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,190
But fortunately now,

573
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,310
Jingjing and the others haven't suffered

574
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,800
any substantial harm.

575
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,950
Right now, this child

576
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,950
is just a lunatic.

577
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,740
If she's let out,

578
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,690
I... I...

579
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,870
I'm afraid Jingjing won't have

580
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,310
any peace in her life.

581
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,300
Then why don't we just go all out?

582
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,030
How do we do that?

583
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,570
Dig out her true inner self

584
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,630
and resolve the toxic tumor in her heart.

585
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,670
Have Luo Yifan and Ao Li

586
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,780
confront each other

587
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,460
about what happened five years ago.
