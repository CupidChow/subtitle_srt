(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,000
(Episode 12)

3
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,470
Here's the unglazed ceramic piece you fired.

4
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,910
It has gone through procedures like

5
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,790
shaping, drying, and trimming.

6
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,550
Before entering the electric kiln,

7
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,190
there's an underglaze painting step.

8
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,190
So,

9
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,450
now it's time to paint.

10
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,500
Yes.

11
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,510
Paint any pattern you like.

12
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,300
Paint whatever you want.

13
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,880
Are you left-handed?

14
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,490
Not really.

15
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,750
When I paint with my right hand,

16
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,960
I tend to rely on techniques.

17
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,510
The ones they made all looked

18
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,250
so interesting.

19
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,470
I want to draw something fun too.

20
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,240
These three

21
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,270
represent the three of you?

22
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,500
If you say so,

23
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,150
I guess.

24
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,710
You've always been protected by them.

25
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,230
Reuniting again

26
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,040
must symbolize

27
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,190
a perfect ending.

28
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,670
But to me,

29
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,030
their protection

30
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,040
is a kind of pressure.

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,450
Back then,

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,300
we relied on each other.

33
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,270
But after serving

34
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,710
such a long prison sentence,

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,870
we've all changed.

36
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,390
They are no longer

37
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,670
the same as they were before.

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,950
When I see them,

39
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,430
they feel so unfamiliar.

40
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,670
Especially Huang Tao.

41
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,390
He liked me back then.

42
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,430
After getting out,

43
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,750
he wanted to develop a relationship with me.

44
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,920
I hadn't seen him for seven years.

45
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,100
How could there be any feelings?

46
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,970
I've always seen him as a brother.

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,550
But he never understood

48
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,590
how I felt.

49
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,920
Whenever we meet,

50
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,630
he tries to be nice to me.

51
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,120
To be honest,

52
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,829
I'm a bit scared.

53
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,740
You're too tense mentally.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,230
But I have a method

55
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,310
that can help you relax a bit.

56
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,630
Do you want to try it?

57
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,500
What method?

58
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,690
Just use clay.

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,000
Mold anything you like.

60
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,100
It can be a person,

61
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,590
a house,

62
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,130
or a plant.

63
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,510
Anything you can think of

64
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,310
is fine.

65
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,990
But you can't make

66
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,350
just another vase or bowl.

67
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,720
Give it a try.

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,790
This is me.

69
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,380
This is the person who hurt me.

70
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,960
This is my home.

71
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,920
Good.

72
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,380
Now,

73
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,170
knead these three things

74
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,540
forcefully together.

75
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,680
Imagine it's all your

76
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,190
negative emotions.

77
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:14,990
Use force.

78
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,910
Good.

79
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,400
Now imagine that

80
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,910
all your negative emotions

81
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,700
and pain

82
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,670
are concentrated

83
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,800
in this clay.

84
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,230
Squeeze harder.

85
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,680
Even harder.

86
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,190
Good.

87
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,110
Open your palm.

88
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,030
Do you see it?

89
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,880
All your negative emotions

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,060
are as weak as this piece of clay.

91
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,670
Now,

92
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,730
throw it away.

93
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,130
Don't you feel better?

94
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,910
Kind of, yeah.

95
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,830
I wonder what Mr. Shen

96
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,990
has been up to lately.

97
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,490
It feels like I haven't seen him in ages.

98
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,030
Is something going on?

99
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,720
Captain Cheng.

100
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,670
Captain Cheng.

101
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,830
Why are we here?

102
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,260
To buy something.

103
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,810
Are you looking to buy a gift for a friend?

104
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,680
What kind of person is your friend?

105
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,350
I can give you some

106
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,260
recommendations.

107
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,140
It's alright.

108
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,980
I'll just have a look around myself.

109
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,070
Okay.

110
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,860
It's so expensive.

111
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,750
This mouse is quite cute.

112
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,280
Look at its angry expression.

113
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,169
And it's entirely hand-carved.

114
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,270
I like this one.

115
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,419
Alright.

116
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,230
This fan is quite artistic too.

117
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,900
Put it down.

118
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,140
Ms. Fangfang,

119
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm here to pick up my cup.

120
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,660
Okay.

121
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,660
Follow me.

122
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,440
It didn't fail this time.

123
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,310
It looks good too.

124
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,350
I should post it on my social media.

125
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,890
Ms. Fangfang,

126
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,950
the advice you gave me last time

127
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,980
was really good.

128
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,910
Without you,

129
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,110
I couldn't have gotten rid of

130
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,080
that cheating scumbag who kept bothering me.

131
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,860
Now it's all good.

132
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,030
I finally dumped him.

133
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,850
You were right.

134
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,880
Dealing with such a terrible person

135
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,640
really requires some harsh measures.

136
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,030
If it's not harsh, he won't learn his lesson.

137
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,440
Didn't I send him

138
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,980
that picture you found for me?

139
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,600
The one that was censored.

140
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,670
He really thought

141
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,390
I had burned his cat to death.

142
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,590
He sent me messages all night,

143
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,960
apologizing and breaking up.

144
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,110
Later,

145
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,940
when I returned the cat to him,

146
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,350
he was so scared that he didn't dare to stay

147
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,770
near me for even a second.

148
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,790
It really cracked me up.

149
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,770
He finally got what he deserved.

150
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,710
Ms. Fangfang,

151
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,360
thank you so much for your help.

152
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:06,920
Bye.

153
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,510
Bye.

154
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,900
Who are you drawing?

155
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,600
You.

156
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,150
I drew you.

157
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,510
It's different from

158
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,560
how you draw yourself.

159
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,330
I wish

160
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,950
I looked like

161
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,190
how you've drawn me.

162
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm trapped.

163
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,400
I don't know what to do.

164
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,540
Can you help me?

165
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,060
Can you talk to Huang Tao?

166
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,120
There's no one around me

167
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,500
who knows about my past.

168
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,840
There's no one I can talk to.

169
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,390
It's okay.

171
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,050
I can help you.

172
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,960
I said I can help you.

173
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,630
Really?

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,870
Then can you

175
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,670
go with me to Huang Tao's store?

176
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,950
Sure.

177
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,750
Perfect timing.

178
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,740
I've just finished drawing.

188

You can go back first.

189
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,500
Welcome, everyone,

190
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,750
to the "Heir in the Flames"

192
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,900
Now, let's turn to the first page.

193
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,010
I booked this game.

194
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,640
I asked for Huang Tao as the dungeon master.

195
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,980
Huang Tao is hosting another session

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,960
and can't come over for now.

197
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,360
But don't worry,

198
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,520
I've hosted this script

199
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,750
many times before.

200
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,250
I only want Huang Tao.

201
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,800
Just a moment.

202
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,810
The rain was pouring down.

203
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,580
Thunder and lightning were crashing.

204
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,250
Everyone was thinking

205
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,790
about Miss Laila who had just died.

206
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,870
Was it because she regained her memory

207
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,030
and remembered

208
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,840
the culprit from that fire years ago

209
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,870
(Heir in the Flames)

210
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,230
that she was tragically killed?
(Heir in the Flames)

211
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,030
(Heir in the Flames)

212
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,210
If that were the case,

213
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,750
the murderer

214
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,110
must be among us.

215
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,390
You are the murderer,

216
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,310
Huang Tao.

217
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,440
I can't be the murderer.

218
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,140
Stop playing dumb.

219
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,550
You are the one who

220
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,550
set fire to the internet cafe eight years ago.

221
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,510
A person who committed

222
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,150
such a heinous crime without realizing it,

223
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,950
feeling no guilt at all.

224
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,350
I set up this gathering today

225
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,850
to let everyone see clearly

226
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,110
(Heir in the Flames)

227
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,270
what a murderer who treats
(Heir in the Flames)

228
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,190
others' lives as a game
(Heir in the Flames)

229
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,270
looks like.

230
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,460
This part isn't in the script.

231
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,990
Is this some new gameplay?

232
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,300
I'm not joking!

233
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,420
Look at the news in the group chat.

234
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,890
My brother was burned to death

235
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,930
in that fire.

236
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,610
My dad and mom

237
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,420
cry their eyes out every day.

238
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,300
So I can't accept it.

239
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,920
I can't accept that the murderer

240
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,710
is still living like nothing happened!

241
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,130
Huang Tao.

242
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,800
Look,

243
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,820
what's going on here?

244
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,990
Do you know how much damage

245
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,460
these rumors are causing

246
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:30,790
(Beijiang LARP Players Group)
these rumors are causing

247
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,850
to our store's reputation?
(Beijiang LARP Players Group)

248
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,710
(Beijiang LARP Players Group)

249
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,430
The DM is actually
(Beijiang LARP Players Group)

250
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,430
an ex-convict murderer?
(Beijiang LARP Players Group)

251
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,270
Who did he kill?

252
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,310
Haven't you heard about that case

253
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,390
from a few years ago?

254
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,430
He set fire to an internet cafe

255
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:38,910
and burned many people to death.

256
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,910
Shouldn't he have been sentenced to death?

257
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,330
He was a minor, so it was difficult to sentence him.

258
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,950
So he served a few years in prison and got out.

259
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,720
Can we still come to this store

260
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,550
to play games in the future?

261
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:43,870
This store

262
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,870
really dares to hire anyone.

263
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,190
He's a murderer.

264
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,920
You can't employ murderers!

265
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,960
Dear customer,

266
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,260
please calm down.

267
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,440
I just found out about this situation as well.

268
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,520
Fire him right now.

269
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,710
If you continue to employ

270
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,440
this murderer,

271
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,430
I'll make everyone

272
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,350
give your store bad reviews

273
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,560
until you're forced to close down.

274
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,490
Huang Tao,

275
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,510
I've always thought you were

276
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,890
quite an honest young man.

277
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,070
You... you...

278
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,160
It's not easy for me to run a store.

279
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,310
Please try to understand my position.

280
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
You'd better leave.

281
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,950
Go!

282
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,480
Why aren't you leaving yet?

283
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,090
Get out!

284
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,670
Get out!

285
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,050
What are you doing?

286
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:23,960
Go!

287
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,330
Why aren't you leaving yet?

288
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,550
What's going on here?

289
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,380
You're a murderer too!

290
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,160
What are you victims' families doing?

291
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,970
Why won't you let this go?

292
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,770
In their eyes,

293
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,580
we are inferior.

294
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,080
We must be maggots that can't see the light,

295
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,730
rotting in the corners.

296
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,290
They'd be happy if we turned to ashes.

297
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,610
Don't film him.

298
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,220
Film me.

299
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,790
My heart

300
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,140
and the hearts of the victims' families

301
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,010
feel the same ache.

302
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,460
I know the taste of this suffering.

303
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,880
For so many years,

304
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,820
I haven't had a good night's sleep.

305
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,550
Every day in my dreams,

306
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,440
I can see that accident.

307
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,110
Every day,

308
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,750
I tell myself

309
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,800
to have a grateful heart.

310
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,670
In a couple of days,

311
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,630
it will be their death anniversary.

312
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,070
The three of us

313
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,070
will hold an apology meeting

314
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,390
for all the families.

315
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,330
I will kowtow

316
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,380
until they tell me to stop.

317
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,030
I can promise the families

318
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,680
to fulfill all their demands.

319
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,200
I'll work down to the bone

320
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,490
and spare no effort.

321
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,070
Why did you call me here?

322
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,280
Enough.

323
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,700
Stop it. That's enough.

324
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,430
Is this alright?

325
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,980
Alright, alright. Stop filming, everyone.

326
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,390
Put your phones away.

327
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,600
Everyone, please disperse.

328
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,930
On what grounds?

329
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,930
Who are you?

330
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:01,370
(Police)

331
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,090
Everyone, please disperse.
(Police)

332
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,330
Go home and get some rest first.

333
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,130
You can always find another job.

334
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,630
What are you here for?

335
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,370
Mr. Shen is here to help us.

336
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,090
No one can help us.

337
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,280
Let's go.

338
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,500
Why did you go see Ruan Fangfang again?

339
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,310
Before you arrived,

340
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,830
she noticed there were so many phones

341
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,790
pointing at her.

342
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,610
It actually made her more eager to perform.

343
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,250
She's playing the role of a weak person,

344
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,980
but she's using this act of vulnerability

345
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,580
to create trouble,

346
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,380
stir up others' emotions,

347
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,190
and guide the development of events.

348
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,670
So she is actually

349
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,870
a complete manipulator.

350
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,230
She has the ability to manipulate others

351
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,710
into doing her bidding

352
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,850
and extricating herself from trouble,

353
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,690
even when it involves crime.

354
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,320
But Ruan Fangfang looks

355
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,350
so gentle and weak.

356
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:03,960
Yes.

357
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,950
It's precisely because she appears

358
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,130
so gentle and weak

359
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,700
that she's particularly deceptive.

360
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,020
I previously used clay

361
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,230
to secretly conduct

362
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,460
a House-Tree-Person test on her.

363
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,040
The tree she molded

364
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,170
had sharp branches,

365
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,550
representing aggressiveness.

366
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,550
The house had no doors or windows,

367
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,340
indicating extremely strong psychological defenses.

368
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,550
So I suspect

369
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,200
she's likely to have

370
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
antisocial personality disorder.

371
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,810
But she hasn't done anything.

372
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,950
Before we have concrete

373
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,110
evidence of her crimes,

374
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,710
we can't determine

375
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,090
that she will definitely commit a crime.

376
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,710
You asked the police for help?

377
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,410
Then what am I to you?

378
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,270
I thought you said

379
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,770
that we were all we had.

380
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,870
(Fangfang)

381
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,630
Remember?
(Fangfang)

382
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,920
(Fangfang)

383
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,430
I'm doing this to protect us.

384
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,530
And is it working?

385
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,690
Our way of survival

386
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,220
is to stay together.

387
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,910
No one can escape it.

388
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,490
We'll

389
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,750
pay off our debts together.

390
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,850
Once we've paid them,

391
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,750
we'll be free.

392
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,200
Thanks.

393
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,560
Wait a moment.

394
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,320
Captain Cheng.

395
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,310
Please check if this

396
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,480
report is good to go.

397
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,030
Li Han.

398
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,800
You've had a long day.

399
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,800
Have some of this

400
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,800
to replenish your energy.

401
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,740
Thank you.

402
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,710
Is Mr. Shen here?

403
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,870
He hasn't returned from class yet.

404
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,700
What's the matter?

405
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,770
I helped Mr. Shen

406
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,580
look into Ruan Fangfang's background.

407
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,020
I found that from elementary to high school,

408
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,390
on average, she stayed at each school

409
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,210
for no more than a year.

410
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,630
Moreover,

411
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,740
the teachers' impressions of her

412
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,820
were quite memorable.

413
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,100
Was she often bullied since childhood?

414
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,480
Was she forced to transfer schools?

415
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,540
No, she was forced to drop out.

416
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,520
Why?

417
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,490
The teachers said

418
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,470
she often stirred up trouble

419
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,390
among her classmates,

420
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,800
claiming others bullied her.

421
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,750
She even slandered her teachers.

422
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:00,870
Many times,

423
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,170
it escalated to the school leaders.

424
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,830
Upon investigation,

425
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,560
they were all lies she made up herself.

426
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,350
But she insisted

427
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,710
that the school was unfair to her

428
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,630
and bullied her.

429
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,820
She even threatened to jump off the building.

430
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,200
So, many schools

431
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,460
persuaded her to leave.

432
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,660
What about her parents?

433
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,710
Don't they care?

434
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,060
Her father

435
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,850
seems to have some mental illness.

436
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,040
Her mother can't control her at all

437
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,460
and is even a bit afraid of her.

438
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,270
But Ruan Fangfang

439
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,480
seems quite normal, doesn't she?

440
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,470
She looks soft and delicate.

441
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,240
Doesn't seem like it.

442
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,000
Could she have turned over a new leaf?

443
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,570
What's the date today?

444
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,120
The 14th.

445
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,310
Today is the anniversary of the victims

446
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,630
of the Haispeed Internet Cafe arson case.

447
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,250
Ruan Fangfang mentioned before

448
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,790
that she wanted to hold

449
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,110
an apology meeting for the families today.

450
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,170
Li Han,

451
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,730
go ask those families

452
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,600
if this is true.

453
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,230
Okay.

454
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,460
Jiang Feng,

455
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,340
go and check again

456
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,840
on the recent activities

457
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,630
of Hao Ziqiang and Huang Tao.

458
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,750
Why are we checking on those two again?

459
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,370
Hopefully, I'm just overthinking.

460
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,180
In Western art history,

461
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,580
many master artists

462
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,870
depicted the

463
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,740
same subjects

464
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,640
in different styles.

465
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,800
These oil paintings

466
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,130
are all depicting the same person.

467
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,300
Salome.

468
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,560
Salome was the stepdaughter

469
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,950
of King Herod in this story.

470
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,750
King Herod greatly admired Salome.

471
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,580
However, Salome

472
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,440
fell in love with Saint John.

473
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,440
Saint John was

474
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,080
wise

475
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,110
and noble.

476
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,620
He rejected Salome's advances.

477
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,920
So,

478
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,030
when King Herod

479
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,950
said to Salome at the banquet,

480
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,220
"If only

481
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,210
you would dance for me,

482
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,350
I will give you anything you ask,"

483
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,730
Salome unexpectedly replied,

484
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,710
"I want the head of Saint John."

485
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,840
I know this story.

486
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,690
But the version I heard

487
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,650
is different.

488
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,700
Indeed,

489
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,280
this story

490
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,150
has changed a lot

491
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,200
over time.

492
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,540
In the original version,

493
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,680
the main character of the story

494
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,620
was supposed to be Salome's mother,

495
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,820
Herodias.

496
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,070
She used

497
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,060
her innocent daughter,

498
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,080
Salome,

499
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,970
to kill Saint John.

500
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,760
But gradually,

501
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,270
the story was adapted into

502
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,750
a version people preferred to hear.

503
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,700
The role of Herodias

504
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,690
was gradually downplayed,

505
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,530
while Salome's image

506
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,130
became increasingly prominent.

507
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,080
She transformed from

508
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,350
a manipulated innocent girl

509
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,010
into

510
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,300
a dark witch who actively

511
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,630
killed Saint John.

512
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,290
This is the Salome

513
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,710
depicted by the American painter,

514
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,670
Henry Ossawa Tanner.

515
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,960
Unlike classical oil paintings

516
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,070
of the same theme,

517
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,480
Tanner no longer focused on

518
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,870
presenting the narrative

519
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,370
and portraying characters,

520
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,930
and instead used color

521
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,700
to convey emotions

522
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,210
and suggest the truth.

523
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,650
We can see that

524
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,570
Salome's face in the painting

525
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,070
is hidden in the shadows,

526
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,960
while the arm in the lower left corner

527
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,230
suggests the death of Saint John.

528
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,890
The painter wanted to express

529
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,520
Salome's fear

530
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,950
and confusion.

531
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,630
Indeed,

532
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,230
we can also

533
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,500
deeply feel

534
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,670
her inner unease.

535
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,400
Against the deep blue background,

536
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,020
her luminous,

537
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,180
exposed body

538
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,870
appears like

539
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,470
a manipulated innocent soul,

540
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,640
used by the evil forces behind the scenes.

541
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,820
So, Mr. Shen,

542
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,530
isn't this

543
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,430
a more

544
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,090
realistic version of Salome?

545
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,030
I think

546
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,850
he at least depicted

547
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,140
Salome's fear.

548
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,770
And the real manipulator,

549
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,740
Herodias,

550
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,640
cleverly hid

551
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,000
her evil deeds

552
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,240
behind the tragedy.

553
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,300
This is just like many antisocial

554
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,090
criminals.

555
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,080
He cunningly cloaks himself

556
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,110
in a layer of

557
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,910
seemingly innocent disguise.

558
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,530
The bottle is ready.

559
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,090
You can come and get it later.

560
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,640
(Pottery workshop)

561
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,010
Don't touch it yet.

562
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,700
It's hot.

563
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,720
I didn't expect

564
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,290
it to turn out like this.

565
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,440
All beginners go through this process.

566
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,770
Try making something else next time.

567
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,340
It'll get better each time.

568
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,960
Your color choice

569
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,120
is indeed very unique.

570
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,920
It's unexpected.

571
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,000
The Gates of Hell.

572
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,170
Why did you make these?

573
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,370
I'm not just capable of making

574
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,820
cute and adorable things.

575
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,490
I like it.

576
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,930
There's no other reason.

577
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,620
You put them here

578
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,870
so that you could

579
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,810
admire them repeatedly.

580
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,220
You're reminiscing about that fire.

581
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,410
And these

582
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,090
are all your trophies.

583
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,010
Whether I reminisce or not

584
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,560
is no longer important.

585
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,660
This piece is finished.

586
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,090
That's all there is to it.

587
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,140
You locked the door of the internet cafe.

588
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,200
You're here to investigate me,

589
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,820
aren't you?

590
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,340
But

591
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,070
I didn't do anything.

592
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,580
Oh, right.

593
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,470
I'm going to the apology meeting now.

594
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,830
Mr. Shen,

595
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,130
are you coming?

596
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,590
Be a witness for me.

597
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,450
Alright.

598
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,290
I'll compensate you.

599
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,700
Sorry.

600
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,740
The number you have dialed

601
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,030
is temporarily unavailable.

602
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,660
Please try again later.

603
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,730
Why isn't Shen Yi answering the phone?

604
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,660
Captain Cheng,

605
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,500
I've found information on Huang Tao

606
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,340
and Hao Ziqiang's movements.

607
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,060
They've purchased a large amount of hydrogen.

608
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,630
Hydrogen?

609
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,400
Something bad might be happening.

610
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,070
Contact the victims' families.

611
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,140
See if they're at home.

612
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,810
Understood.

613
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:58,910
The situation is urgent.

614
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,580
I'm going to find Director Zhang.

615
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,360
Stay on standby.

616
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,640
Director Zhang.

617
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:04,960
Du Cheng.

618
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,350
Learn to knock.

619
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,140
It's an emergency.

620
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,630
We found that the arsonists,

621
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,510
Huang Tao and Hao Ziqiang,

622
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,630
have purchased a large amount of hydrogen.

623
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,670
I suspect that what Ruan Fangfang said about

624
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,350
the family apology meeting is just a cover.

625
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,100
In fact, they are planning to carry out revenge.

626
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,160
If the hydrogen explodes,

627
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,260
the consequences would be unimaginable.

628
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,270
I'll allocate the forces now.

629
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,150
You should deploy immediately.

630
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,830
We must stop them

631
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,630
before they

632
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,240
take action.

633
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,980
Understood.

634
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,430
Tell everyone to be careful.

635
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,230
Understood.

636
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,920
Where did he go?

637
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,980
He's not answering his phones either.

638
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,340
Captain Cheng.

639
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,930
I've contacted the family members separately,

640
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,790
but couldn't reach any of them.

641
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,940
And none of them are at home.

642
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,560
For those with cars, check their license plates first.

643
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,640
If that doesn't work, go to the information center

644
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,450
and search the streets.

645
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,340
Have you seen Shen Yi?

646
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,330
I think he had classes today.

647
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,430
Captain Cheng

648
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,150
I found this internet cafe address

649
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,480
in the arson case files.

650
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,820
Do you think they might have gone there?

651
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,220
Let's go check it out.

652
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,950
(Haispeed Internet cafe)

653
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,530
After all these years!

654
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,830
I'll never forgive you!

655
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,640
You murderer!

656
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,600
This isn't over today.

657
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,940
We can't let them off so easily.

658
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,940
It's been so many years.

659
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,090
This is truly unjust.

660
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,570
Uncle,

661
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,100
are you wearing your prayer beads today?

662
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,340
What is she trying to do?

663
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,350
What's she doing?

664
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:50,330
(Beijiang Branch, Beijiang City Public Security Bureau)

665
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,159
All

666
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,889
one hundred and eight of them.

667
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,630
Uncle.

668
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,090
Eight years ago,

669
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
right here,

670
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,449
I was falsely accused by the Internet cafe owner

671
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,969
of stealing money.

672
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,889
They forcibly searched me,

673
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,030
stripped off my clothes,

674
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,010
forced me to eat cigarette butts, made me crawl like a dog,

675
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,630
and slapped my face.

676
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,560
Huang Tao and I were threatened

677
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,200
that if we didn't pay back the money,

678
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,820
we would be forced to drop out of school.

679
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,760
Huang Tao was preparing for art school at that time.

680
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,720
To him,

681
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,770
it was a matter of utmost importance.

682
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,810
At that time,

683
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,400
we didn't dare tell our families.

684
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,860
We didn't know what to do.

685
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,900
I know that nothing I say

686
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,750
will bring back

687
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,230
those nineteen lives.

688
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,260
I gathered everyone here today

689
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,020
to offer my life

690
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,060
to you.

691
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,610
Please, vent your anger as you wish.

692
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,150
Come on.

693
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,320
What's wrong?

694
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,460
Are you afraid?

695
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,230
Fine,

696
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,980
I'll do it myself.

697
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,480
Don't do this.

698
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,690
Please, don't do this.

699
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,550
Let go of me.

700
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:07,990
Let go.

701
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,920
This has nothing to do with you.

702
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,600
Don't do this.

703
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,670
Don't stop me.

704
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,430
Let go!

705
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,590
Stop acting!

706
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,990
Stop the act! Let her do it herself!

707
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,270
Hurry up and do it!

708
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,870
Do it!

709
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,630
Do it!

710
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,030
Give my child back!

711
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,980
Don't come any closer!

712
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,080
Stay back!

713
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,390
These are filled with hydrogen.

714
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:32,960
Come on,

715
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,210
let's die together. Come on!

716
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,740
Come on, let's all die together!
