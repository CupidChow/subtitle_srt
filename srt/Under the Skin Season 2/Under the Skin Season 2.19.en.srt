00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,960
(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,950
(Episode 19)

3
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,240
You didn't sleep well again last night?

4
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,150
It's okay.

5
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,860
How did your talk with Ge Yutian go?

6
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,990
I think Ge Yutian

7
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,510
and Feng Xiaowen's relationship

8
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,050
is not as simple as it seems.

9
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,910
Wasn't Feng Xiaowen

10
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,440
Ge Yutian's godmother?

11
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,010
They were likely to have a romantic relationship.

12
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,190
And the chemical plant

13
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,190
is where they met.

14
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,560
For them,

15
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,390
it held special significance.

16
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,240
So Feng Xiaowen's death

17
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,840
must have something

18
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,910
to do with Ge Yutian.

19
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,900
The police station has sent over Feng Xiaowen's

20
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,240
missing person investigation files from back then.

21
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,500
They show

22
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,790
that she left the hotel

23
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,710
on April 20th

24
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,780
at 8:50 AM

25
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,580
two years ago

26
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,200
and then disappeared.

27
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,310
And on that very day,

28
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,380
April 20th,

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,830
the explosion

30
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,590
at the chemical plant happened.

31
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,870
Moreover, Feng Xiaowen's

32
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,730
last call

33
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,510
was to Ge Yutian.

34
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,890
But he didn't answer.

35
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,070
(Inquiry Room)

36
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,750
Are you sure that on the day of the fire,
(Inquiry Room)

37
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,150
he wasn't at the factory?

38
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,130
I specifically checked.

39
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,430
That day, Ge Yutian

40
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,020
was supposed to be at work,

41
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,270
but two days before the fire,

42
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,070
he took time off,

43
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,990
saying a family member was hospitalized

44
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,030
and he needed to look after them.

45
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,840
Yes, I was the nurse in that ward.

46
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,700
I remember him.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,450
He was indeed looking after a patient in my unit.

48
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,920
Why do you remember him so clearly?

49
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,510
That day, the TV reported

50
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,870
about the chemical plant fire.

51
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,450
They mentioned there was a leak.

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,640
He was so shocked,

53
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,000
rushed out of the ward,

54
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,420
and called his colleagues

55
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,450
to ask about the situation.

56
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,760
Then I learned that

57
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,510
he worked at the chemical plant.

58
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,420
At the time, everyone said

59
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,340
he had a lucky escape.

60
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,750
When the fire broke out,

61
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,310
everyone was desperately trying to escape.

62
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,500
I was moving things at the time.

63
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,680
If I hadn't reacted quickly,

64
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,070
I would've lost my life.

65
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,339
Did you see this person

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,490
at the scene at that time?

67
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,670
We all freaked out.

68
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,390
Everything was chaotic.

69
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,909
Everyone was running for their lives.

70
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,450
No one paid attention to anyone else.

71
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,930
I remember now.

72
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,940
I think I saw this person.

73
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,590
I recall that, at that time,

74
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,550
everyone was running out,

75
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,810
but she was pushing her way in.

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,750
She even stopped me and asked to borrow my phone.

77
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,460
I was desperate to get out of there,

78
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,440
so I ignored her.

79
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,120
Are you sure you saw her?

80
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,540
I can't be sure.

81
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,300
But she looks somewhat familiar.

82
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,060
I remember

83
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,650
her gripping me so tight.

84
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,290
It was as if she had gone mad.

85
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,830
It's been confirmed that

86
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,990
on the day of the fire,

87
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,990
Ge Yutian was not at the factory,

88
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,750
and he couldn't have known

89
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,430
Feng Xiaowen

90
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,000
would be there.

91
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,790
On the day of the fire…

92
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,510
You must have gone there to find Ge Yutian.

93
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,540
The last four digits of the phone number?

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,790
1005.

95
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,280
Officer Shen.

96
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,010
What are you up to this time?

97
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,290
I want to give you a painting.

98
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,390
I hope this painting has captured

99
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,710
the beauty of Feng Xiaowen in your eyes.

100
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,590
What do you mean?

101
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,590
I think

102
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,350
everyone is wrong

103
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,150
about your relationship.

104
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,260
We've always thought

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,750
you asked Feng Xiaowen to be your godmother

106
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,310
to purposely get close to her.

107
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,880
Now I understand.

108
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,150
It was your way of dealing with

109
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,230
the prejudice from others.

110
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,520
Your relationship

111
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,740
must have been difficult, right?

112
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,080
Hello.

113
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,030
I'd like to ask

114
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,870
if Ms. Feng is here.

115
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,000
Your daughter has come to the troupe

116
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,830
to make a scene several times.

117
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,960
Rumors about you

118
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,300
have spread

119
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,590
in the whole troupe.

120
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,750
I didn't want to interfere.

121
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,510
In our line of work,

122
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,590
it takes a lifetime to build a good reputation,

123
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,159
but to ruin it,

124
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,870
just a few words will do, right?

125
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,770
Xiaowen,

126
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,070
you're the pillar of our troupe.

127
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,330
In others' eyes,

128
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,630
you're a respected artist.

129
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,130
That's what you've carefully built

130
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,190
over a lifetime.

131
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,250
I'm an artist. So what?

132
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,940
Don't artists have

133
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,110
the freedom to love?

134
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,930
That's not what I mean.

135
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,490
You know

136
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,110
how tough the opera market

137
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,330
is right now.

138
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,310
The higher-ups have long wanted to disband

139
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,790
our money-losing troupe.

140
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,590
It's because of your stellar reputation

141
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,510
that they haven't.

142
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,190
But look at what you've done.

143
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,870
You've given them a reason

144
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,510
to doubt the way you conduct yourself.

145
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,990
What have I done wrong?

146
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,950
So, as a widowed woman,

147
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,590
if I have a relationship,

148
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,950
I'm immoral?

149
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,309
It depends on who you're in a relationship with.

150
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,270
He's so much younger than you.

151
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,590
To put it mildly,

152
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,240
it's an age gap.

153
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,030
To put it harshly,

154
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,640
you're from different generations.

155
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,510
I'll do as I please.

156
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,720
It's none of anyone else's business.

157
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,710
Xiaowen,

158
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,550
do I have to

159
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,590
spell it out for you?

160
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,510
He's just an insurance salesman.

161
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,600
How old are you now?

162
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,410
You've weathered

163
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,420
all kinds of storms.

164
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,540
Can you see it?

165
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,040
He's just after your money!

166
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,310
Xiaowen.

167
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,910
I've said everything

168
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,190
I need to say.

169
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,230
You can not care

170
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,870
about our troupe.

171
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,830
You can not care

172
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,550
about Peking opera either.

173
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,150
But

174
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,970
please consider our decades

175
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,820
of hard work through thick and thin

176
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,510
and the young players

177
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,590
you've carefully nurtured

178
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,860
and trained!

179
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,870
I understand.

180
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,910
What are you doing here?

181
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,500
Here.

182
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,830
So beautiful.

183
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,190
Is this real or fake?

184
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,440
It smells so good.

185
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,590
Well…

186
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,580
When did you

187
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,600
buy that insurance?

188
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,400
And...

189
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,350
the beneficiary...

190
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,350
Why is it me?

191
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,980
What's wrong?

192
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,700
Is there a problem?

193
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,940
Shouldn't you have...

194
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,740
discussed it with me first?

195
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,720
What's there to discuss?

196
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,670
When I buy insurance,

197
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,630
shouldn't the beneficiary be my partner?

198
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:54,990
Sit down.

199
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,650
I heard…

200
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,790
what the troupe leader said

201
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,600
just now.

202
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,510
After what you did,

203
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,180
what would others think of us?

204
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,370
Does this matter

205
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,920
concern anyone else?

206
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,710
I've made up my mind anyway.

207
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,860
Actually, this insurance

208
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,190
is kind of

209
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,990
a promise…

210
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,780
for our future.

211
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,830
Do you know why

212
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,380
people get bolder as they get older?

213
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,070
Why?

214
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,580
Because...

215
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,270
Maybe it's because there are fewer things

216
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,230
they're afraid of losing.

217
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,030
Except for us,

218
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,950
no one believed

219
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,150
in our love.

220
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,310
So what happened then?

221
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,790
Why did you break up?

222
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,080
Then…

223
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,490
She chose you,

224
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,040
but you backed out, didn't you?

225
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,720
You...

226
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,810
I wasn't expecting you.

227
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,950
You didn't tell me.

228
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,550
Come on in.

229
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,180
Let me introduce you.

230
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,010
This is my daughter.

231
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,650
This is her fiancé.

232
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,110
They're getting married this Saturday.

233
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,450
Sit here.

234
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,670
I'll get you some water.

235
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,030
Let me do it.

236
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,670
Let me do it.

237
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,190
Let me.

238
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,270
It's fine.

239
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:36,790
Let me do it.

240
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,440
Let me.

241
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,950
It's fine.

242
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:38,950
Sit down.

243
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,390
Let me do it.

244
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,500
Mom.

245
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,590
I'm getting married.

246
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,540
I won't be able to keep you company as often anymore.

247
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,870
You should find someone reliable.

248
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,000
Otherwise,

249
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,140
you'll be all alone

250
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
and feel very lonely.

251
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,350
Well, I...

252
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,710
But you must be careful.

253
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,950
Don't get fooled by those

254
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,350
with bad intentions.

255
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,310
Come here, Mom. Listen.

256
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,350
Nowadays,

257
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,380
there are many swindlers out there

258
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,030
pretending to be harmless.

259
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,350
Although you're a reputed artist,

260
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,550
it may be hard for you to stay clear-minded

261
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,070
after being alone for so long.

262
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,380
Those swindlers

263
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,910
will use all sorts of sweet talk

264
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,990
to coax you.

265
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,510
By the time you realize it,

266
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,630
you'll have already been deceived.

267
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,790
Am I right?

268
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,270
What's wrong with you?

269
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,480
I can accept

270
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,430
a stepfather.

271
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,260
But he needs to be old enough to be my father.

272
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:30,990
Jun.

273
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,430
By the way,

274
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,030
is this your new disciple?

275
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,230
He's what you called…

276
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,630
I'm Ms. Feng's...

277
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,670
I'm Ms. Feng's fan.

278
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,820
I often watch Ms. Feng's operas.

279
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,570
Ms. Feng thinks highly of me.

280
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,190
So I asked her to be…

281
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,830
my godmother.

282
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,070
So you're her godson.

283
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,820
Then what should I call you?

284
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,290
Brother?

285
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,050
I happened to bring a gift today.

286
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,670
I didn't know about

287
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,360
your upcoming wedding.

288
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,590
I wish you

289
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,050
a happy and long marriage.

290
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,350
Congratulations. Here.

291
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,050
Accept it.

292
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,960
It's from my brother.

293
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,430
Thank you, Brother.

294
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,430
Thank you, Brother.

295
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,380
Thank you for

296
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,140
helping with my business.

297
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,870
In the future,

298
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,510
I won't bother you anymore.

299
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,910
You guys chat.

300
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,910
I'll take my leave.

301
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,990
Yes.

302
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,170
I backed out.

303
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,650
I didn't want her to bear

304
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,140
more pressure and criticism

305
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,470
because I loved her

306
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,390
and wanted the best for her.

307
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,350
But to be honest,

308
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,670
I was just a coward.

309
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,440
I chickened out.

310
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,510
Do you know why Feng Xiaowen's daughter

311
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,070
waited half a year

312
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,990
before reporting her missing?

313
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,790
She resolutely

314
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,180
cut ties with everything in her past

315
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,140
and came to Beijiang

316
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,230
to find you.

317
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,590
In the end, she still chose you.

318
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:20,430
(Happy Marriage)

319
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,110
Mom.

320
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,830
I'm leaving for my honeymoon tomorrow.

321
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,720
What are you doing?

322
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,800
Come.

323
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,460
You're already married.

324
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
I can rest easy.

325
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,830
Next,

326
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,510
you're about to start a new life.

327
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,580
As for me,

328
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,650
I'm also going to search for

329
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,950
my new life.

330
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,230
I've already resigned from the troupe.

331
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,130
You're going to find Ge Yutian?

332
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,870
I have

333
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,700
spent my whole life acting out love stories,

334
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,740
other people's love stories.

335
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,840
I really want…

336
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,840
I really want

337
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,000
to play in my own love story for once.

338
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,110
Just let me live for myself for once,

339
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,710
okay?

340
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,070
Mom!

341
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,870
If you leave,

342
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,870
we'll no longer be mother and daughter.

343
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,360
Sweetie,

344
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,670
please give me your blessing, okay?

345
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,520
I'll be happy.

346
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,510
When the chemical plant caught on fire,

347
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,830
everyone was running for their lives.

348
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,620
The ammonia tank is on fire!

349
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,960
Get out of here!

350
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,210
This way!

351
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:20,920
Out! Out!

352
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,180
The ammonia tank is on fire!

353
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,920
Everyone, get out!

354
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,540
Hurry!

355
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,270
Out! Out!

356
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,710
Excuse me,

357
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,150
have you seen Ge Yutian?

358
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,420
It's about to explode!

359
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,310
The ammonia tank is on fire!

360
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,720
Excuse me, have you…

361
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,500
have you seen Ge Yutian?

362
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,650
Could I borrow your phone?

363
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,630
Please, please.

364
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,070
Run! It's going to explode!

365
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,740
I need to call him!

366
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,650
Go!

367
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,640
Everyone, leave immediately!

368
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,130
Watch your step!

369
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,560
-Watch your step.
-Ge Yutian.

370
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,630
Ge Yutian!

371
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Everyone, get out!

372
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,610
Out, out!

373
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,230
Watch your step!

374
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,360
Ge Yutian!

375
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,510
Ge Yutian!

376
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,740
Ge Yutian!

377
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,600
Only Feng Xiaowen

378
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,550
ran against the crowd, rushing in.

379
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,390
She thought you hadn't answered your phone

380
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,480
because something had happened to you in the factory.

381
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,990
She was terrified.

382
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,720
Ge Yutian!

383
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,860
She was desperately trying to find you

384
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,000
and save you.

385
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,160
Ge Yutian!

386
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,360
Ge Yutian!

387
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,730
Ge Yutian!

388
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,170
Ge Yutian!

389
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,710
Ge Yutian!

390
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,090
Ge Yutian!

391
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,240
Ge Yutian!

392
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,110
Ge Yutian!

393
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,870
However…

394
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,510
In the end, she ran towards death.

395
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,970
So,

396
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,390
if I had answered that call…

397
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,180
I'm the one who caused her death.

398
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,750
I'm the one who killed her.

399
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,110
It's now confirmed

400
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,510
that Feng Xiaowen wasn't murdered,

401
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,350
and the second victim, Zhou Guoliang,

402
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,590
was the first victim.

403
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,750
Has the foreign object in Zhou Guoliang's mouth

404
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,390
been identified?

405
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,350
Yes.

406
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,910
It's calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate,

407
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,270
possibly from gypsum, marble,

408
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,340
or chalk dust.

409
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,710
We presume it's transferred

410
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,350
from the murder weapon used to cover

411
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,720
his mouth and nose into his respiratory tract.

412
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,920
Could the killer's profession

413
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,270
be related to sculpture

414
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,540
or interior decoration?

415
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,070
Go and find those around Zhou Guoliang

416
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:47,990
who fit this profile.

417
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,590
Okay.

418
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,710
I want to check the scene.

419
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,630
Captain Cheng,

420
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,510
Zhou Guoliang's wife is here.

421
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,270
Don't do anything rash.

422
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,430
Guoliang

423
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,710
was always cautious and sincere.

424
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,880
Everyone says real estate agents

425
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,630
make a profit

426
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,640
from the price difference and such.

427
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,710
But he never did that.

428
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,670
Everyone says he followed rules

429
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,870
when doing business.

430
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,830
He really didn't have any enemies.

431
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,430
Then do you know

432
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,630
if he had dealings with

433
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,190
anyone

434
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,870
who was a teacher,

435
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,710
a sculptor,

436
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,670
or worked in the renovation industry?

437
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,390
No teachers.

438
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,820
Sculptors are even less likely.

439
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,240
But since he worked in real estate,

440
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,780
he inevitably had to deal

441
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,940
with renovation teams.

442
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,710
Then did he ever have any conflicts

443
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,270
with the renovation teams?

444
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,360
He did,

445
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,480
but they were not serious.

446
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,590
They couldn't have led to murder, could they?

447
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,020
You were kneeling…

448
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,360
to him.

449
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,150
You were making a fist-and-palm salute,

450
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,870
also to him.

451
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,270
Why were you the only one sitting?

452
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,390
Why were you guys standing behind me?

453
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,880
This was a stage.

454
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,190
It's calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate.

455
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,070
It could be gypsum, marble,

456
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,060
or chalk dust.

457
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,750
We presume it's transferred

458
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,350
from the murder weapon used to cover

459
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,630
his mouth and nose into his respiratory tract.

460
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,230
White powder.

461
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,110
The evil character.

462
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:30,580
♫Venture into the tiger's den♫

463
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,270
Feng Xiaowen.

464
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,850
You were the leading role on this stage.

465
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,910
Do you know this person?

466
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,950
This is Zhou Guoliang, the real estate agent.

467
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,590
Yes.

468
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,180
However,

469
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,900
I haven't seen him for a while.

470
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,720
What's your relationship with him?

471
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,950
When his houses

472
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,550
needed repairs

473
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,590
or replacements for things,

474
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,380
he came to me.

475
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,670
Then did you have

476
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,350
any conflicts with him?

477
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,070
We didn't have any conflicts.

478
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,680
We actually got along quite well.

479
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,790
We often drank together.

480
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,990
You got physical once, right?

481
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,190
Yes, just once.

482
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,100
We were both drunk.

483
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,660
He said

484
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,610
I worked away from home for years

485
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,020
and my wife

486
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,500
must be fooling around with other men.

487
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,310
I lost it,

488
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,390
and we got into a fight.

489
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,680
B-But

490
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,460
we made up the next day.

491
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,590
He even called

492
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,750
to apologize to me.

493
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,910
Officer,

494
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,110
what happened to him?

495
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,230
He's dead.

496
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,370
D-Dead?

497
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,100
Officer,

498
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,500
it has nothing to do with me.

499
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,910
If you hadn't come to me,

500
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,190
I wouldn't even know he was dead.

501
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,910
I-I didn't kill him.

502
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,550
Alright.

503
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,980
No one said you killed him.

504
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,450
For the time being,

505
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,830
don't leave town.

506
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,670
Keep your phone on.

507
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,120
Okay, okay.

508
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,960
Feng Xiaowen's daughter.

509
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,600
What did she say?

510
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,070
She said Ge Yutian asked to meet her.

511
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,520
Let's go.

512
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,720
(Pizza Hut)

513
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,280
I called them.

514
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,910
Is it okay?

515
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,440
Of course.

516
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,710
Of course.

517
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,000
It's good to have

518
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,060

about Ms. Feng's death.

522
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,320
Don't give me that.

523
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,440

I was so angry…

550
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,480
that I said she was not my mom anymore.

551
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,080

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,840
Feng Xiaowen acted in.

573
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,820
Here it is.

574
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,630
Feng Xiaowen won

575
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,030
many opera performance awards

576
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,480
for her role as Sun Shangxiang

577
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,870
in "Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity."

578
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,690
You think

579
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,620
this case is related to Peking opera?

580
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,710
My intuition tells me

581
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,360
this is just a play.

582
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,360
The comprehensive investigation

583
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,910
into the bodies

584
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,660
in the basement of the chemical plant

585
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,690
has concluded that

586
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,180
aside from Feng Xiaowen, who died accidentally,

587
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,140
the other five were murdered.

588
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,060
However, we haven't yet

589
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,110
found the original crime scenes

590
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,540
where these people were murdered,

591
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,630
nor have we discovered

592
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,760
any connections

593
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,390
between their murders and

594
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,230
the relocation of their bodies to the basement.

595
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,830
The only thing we can be sure of is that this is

596
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,230
an indiscriminate murder case.

597
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,270
However,

598
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,510
Mr. Shen and I

599
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,470
just discovered something.

600
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,350
Based on the perspective relationship

601
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,830
of the bodies' positions at the crime scene,

602
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,390
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

603
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,030
I've tried to recreate what happened.
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

604
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,750
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

605
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,030
Is that a theater stage?
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

606
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,470
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

607
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:37,960
Yes.
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

608
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,910
Do you remember the white powder

609
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,350
found in Zhou Guoliang's

610
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,270
respiratory tract?

611
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,030
If this white powder

612
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,130
was used in traditional opera,

613
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,710
how would it be used?

614
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,800
To paint a white face.

615
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,200
Correct.

616
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,350
Let's assume

617
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,720
Zhou Guoliang

618
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,230
played the white-faced evil character.

619
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,750
The one with a hunched back

620
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,830
was the elderly female role,

621
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,800
Li Hong.

622
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,070
Zhao Yuanqing,

623
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,150
with green eyes and a purple beard, was the painted-face role,

624
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,230
a tough male character.

625
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,470
Feng Xiaowen

626
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,510
played a demure female character.

627
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,630
Wang Mengxiao and Liu Fang

628
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,550
played two young female roles.

629
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,620
Then who's that one?

630
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,070
The martial male role.

631
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,510
All the bodies

632
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,470
have been accounted for.

633
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,290
Who played the martial male role?

634
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,400
Don't forget Guo Yuan.

635
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,540
But Guo Yuan is a woman.

636
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,890
How could she play the martial male role?

637
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,440
I haven't

638
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,870
figured that out either.

639
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,710
Look at this.

640
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:56,700
(Guo Yuan)

641
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,420
This is Guo Yuan's social media account.
(Guo Yuan)

642
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,900
(Guo Yuan)

643
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,710
That explains it.

644
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,050
Guo Yuan

645
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,910
was the martial male role.

646
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,550
We've found out about their roles,

647
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,980
but what exactly was this play?

648
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,130
"Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity."

649
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,640
My dad is an opera enthusiast.

650
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,430
He often took me

651
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,310
to watch this play when I was young.

652
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,350
I'm absolutely sure

653
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,630
it's "Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity."

654
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,150
I looked into Feng Xiaowen.

655
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,870
Her award-winning play

656
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,110
was indeed "Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity."

657
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,060
Let me tell you.

658
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,710
"Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity"

659
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,610
is a story set in the Three Kingdoms period.

660
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:45,950
Sun Quan wanted Jingzhou back

Mr. Shen,

am I right?

704
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,870
Absolutely.

705
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,610
No.

706
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,020
What about Liu Bei?

707
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,310
Where was Liu Bei?

708
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,000
Liu Bei was missing in this play.

709
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,110
Who was playing Liu Bei?

710
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,100
Liu Bei

711
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,030
was Ge Yutian.

712
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,950
He was also the director of this play.

713
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,120
Hello?

714
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,550
What?

715
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,780
Guo Yuan is missing?

716
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,320
Okay.

717
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,070
The police station called.

718
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,220
They said Guo Yuan left the hospital yesterday,

719
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,430
but after leaving,

720
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,740
she disappeared.

721
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,380
She hasn't returned to school yet.

722
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,710
Her classmates felt something was wrong,

723
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,450
so they called the police.

724
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,350
Go check

725
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,270
the surveillance cameras near the hospital

726
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,310
to see if there are any clues about Guo Yuan.

727
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,070
Okay.

728
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,270
Jiang Feng,

729
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,270
let's take some people to the hospital.

730
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,790
Okay.

731
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,790
It's Ge Yutian.

732
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,430
In "Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Prosperity,"

733
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,150
every role

734
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,310
was carefully chosen by him.

735
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,390
He chose Guo Yuan to play Zhao Yun.

736
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,100
He won't give up easily.

737
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:42,950
Du Cheng.

738
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,990
-We can't…
-I know what you think.

739
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:45,910
Don't worry.

740
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,750
We'll save Guo Yuan.

741
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,380
Wait for my news.
