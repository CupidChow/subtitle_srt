This is the sketch I drew based on Xiaopeng's description

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,509
of the assailant.

5
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,220
It's not Yun Lei?

like a forty-something, doesn't he?

11
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,670
Xiaopeng listened to the recording

12
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,700
and clearly stated that the assailant was someone else.

13
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,990
According to his description,

14
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,510
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

15
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,710
it was a middle-aged man.
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

16
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,669
This is weird.

17
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,990
We did find the guy

18
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,270
at Yun Lei's place.

19
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,590
Now it's said he's not the culprit.

20
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,990
Could this child

21
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,329
have some cognitive impairment?

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,460
Probably not.

23
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,550
He touched my face

24
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,790
and described it very accurately.

25
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,510
Yun Lei and the other boys

26
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,579
are just in their teens,

27
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,050
yet they've already developed thieving habits.

28
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,550
When facing the police,

29
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,430
they're slick and experienced.

30
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,620
Where did they pick this up?

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,870
I wonder if someone's been

32
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,950
instigating them.

33
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,260
Now we can almost confirm that

34
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,040

and the child abuse case
(Missing)

38
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,860
involve the same suspects.

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,550
It's possible that

40
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,630
they first kidnapped Xiaopeng

41
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,880
and then stabbed

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,550
Liu Qiang, who came to rescue Xiaopeng.

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,520
Li Han,

44
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,150
go search

47
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,790
and see if anyone

48
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,740
in the city village matches them.

49
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,970
Okay.

50
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,140
Jiang Feng,

51
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,830
free them all.

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,120
Have someone follow them.

53
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,190
You think

54
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,500
they'll meet with their boss?

55
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,829
If there's really

56
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,800
an instigator,

57
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,829
they'll surely go meet him

58
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,670
after being released.

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,510
Understood.

60
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,329
Hello.

61
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,010
Hello.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,320
Have you seen this man before?

63
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,440
Nope.

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,950
Excuse me, have you seen this person before?

65
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,310
No, I haven't.

66
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,550
Nah.

67
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,790
Excuse me, have you seen

68
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,660
this person around here?

69
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,730
Hot air balloon.

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,900
No, that's not it.

71
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,690
Ice cream.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,170
Ice cream...

73
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,290
No...

74

75
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,950
Water.

76
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,630
Water.

77
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,150
Then what's this?

78
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,900
It's a bottle cap.

79
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,060
It's water in a bottle.

80
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,430
A mineral water bottle.

81
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,210
Toy tank?

82
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,750
No.

83
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,370
Then what are these two?

84
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,830
Knobs.

85
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,210
This is a microwave.

86
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,480
This is a kettle.

87
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,190
Tangerine.

88
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,030
Watering can.

89
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,980
This is an oil drum.

90
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:49,830
A tire.

91
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,940
Interesting.

92
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,210
Hair.

93
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,270
A furry animal...

94
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,990
A puppy!

95
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,600

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,830
I found your little backpack.

103

And also

104
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,750
your little notebook.

105
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,659
Can you tell me

106
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,030
what's drawn

107
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,140
in this notebook?

108
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,500
Let me take a guess.

109
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,960
If I get it right,

110
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,030
you'll have to tell me

111
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,150
the story about them, okay?

112
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,230
I guess

113
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,270
it's got a microwave,

a mineral water bottle,

115
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,250

How did you know that?

117
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,030
I won't tell you either.

(Treat patients with love and care)

122
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,030
why you drew these things,

123
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,430
I'll tell you the answer.

124
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,030
Fine...

125
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,560
The kettle

126
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,240
is made of metal.

127
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,070
The microwave

128
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,430
is

129
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,290
an electrical appliance.

130
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,170
The mineral water bottle

131
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,140
is made of plastic.

132
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,620
So,

133
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,510
are you recording something, Xiaopeng?

134
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,310
I just did it for fun.

135
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,610
Sir...

136
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,670
Do you know

137
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,150
what these dots are for?

138
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,110
The dots?

139
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,080
Let me guess.

140
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,060
These dots

141
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,510
probably represent

142
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,950
the number of things.

143
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,380
Sir,

144
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,790
you're so smart!

145
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,080
But I don't know

146
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,470
why the microwave is red,

147
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,620
and the tangerine is red too.

148
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,549
Red?

149
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,789
Xiaopeng,

150
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,440
you didn't color them?

151
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,870
I didn't color them.

152
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,990
But I like red the most.

153
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,950
Why?

154
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,030
Because

155
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,230
red

156
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,310
is

157
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,190
very valuable.

158
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,550
Valuable?

159
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,320
Who told you that?

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,570
(Treat patients with love and care)

161
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,310
Alright,

162
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,270
let me ask you

163
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,150
one last question.

164
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,530
Tell me

165
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,190
if this is

166
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,090
some kind of small animal.

167
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,270
It's a dog.

168
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,660
Dogs bite people.

169
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,160
I hate dogs the most.

170
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,230
Okay,

171
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,430
I see.

172
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,550
I

173
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,870
brought you a little gift.

174
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,780
A small car.

175
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,290
In exchange,

176
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,680
can I return it to you

177
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,270
tomorrow?

178
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,150
Okay.

179
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,190
Come in.

180
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,620
Du Cheng,

181
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,610
I got it now.

182
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,770
These colors

183
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,480
are actually a way

184
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,430
of emotional classification.

185
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,370
Emotional classification?

186
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,030
Yep.

187
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,760
Xiaopeng said

188
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,960
red means valuable.

189
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,030
He likes red.

190
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,950
So food, appliances,

191
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,740
and other things

192
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,350
painted red

193
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,910
are all his favorites.

194

195
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,390
Dogs bite people.

196

197
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,180
So I draw a conclusion.

198
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,150
Red,

199
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,120
orange,

200
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,110
and yellow

201
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,850
are the ones he likes.

202
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,500
Blue, green, and purple

203
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,500
are the ones he dislikes.

204
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,750
In a nutshell,

205
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,710
these six colors roughly

206
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,490
represent either positive or negative emotions.

207
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,430
But Xiaopeng is a blind child.

208
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,350
Who painted them for him?

209
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,350
I want to go

210
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,870
take another look at the place where Xiaopeng was found.

211
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,630
You go over there

212
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,910
and take some photos for evidence.

213
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,380
Got it.

214
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,990
Hi, Shen Yi.

215
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,590
Hello, Dr. He.

216
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,430
We wanna collect some more

217
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,670
DNA traces

218
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,150
to take back for further analysis.

219
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,330
This is a dead end.

220
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,670
But I've always felt

221
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,340
this cage is placed

222
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,150
in a weird spot.

223
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,190
It's in a recess of a ruined wall

224
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,390
with no

225
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,430
signs of life around.

226
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,430
If Yun Lei

227
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,180
wanted to keep Xiaopeng here,

228
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,350
it would actually

229
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,190
be inconvenient for him.

230
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,640
These little inventions

231
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,910
are quite interesting.

232
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,630
All the building materials and furniture

233
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,070
were collected from the surroundings.

234
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,070
They're

235
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,430
no more than piles of garbage,

236
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,230
but they've still

237
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,500
been made into a playground.

238
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,810
That cage

239
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,750
was probably temporarily

240
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,980
moved over from here.

241
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,870
This is where Yun Lei and Xiaopeng

242
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,590
actually lived.

243
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,800
There might be an armed conflict in the city village.

244
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,650
What are you doing?

245
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,910
Stop, all of you!

246
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,420
Stop!

247
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,490
What are you doing?

248
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,600
Get out of the way!

249
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,530
All of you, stop!

250
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,610
Did you hear me?

251
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,740
Freeze, all of you!

252
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,500
Stop!

253
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,170
Everyone, stop right now!

254
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,070
Stop!

255
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,890
Don't move!

256
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:49,850
Hurry up!

257
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,320

Hurry up!

259
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,050
Get down!

261
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,670
Get down...
(Copy & Photograph)

262
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,750
How dare you

263
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,870
fight right under the noses of the police?

264
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,000
-Get down!
-Get down!

265
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,660
Where's Yun Lei?

266
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,020
Where is Yun Lei?

267
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,150
Du Cheng.

268
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:12,950
Send it to Director Zhang.

269
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,570
Okay.

270
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,380
We found that the cage

271
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,200
had been moved.

272
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,220
Then we searched along the alleys

273
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,710
and found a garbage dump,

274
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,400
where Yun Lei and Xiaopeng

275
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,480
were actually living.

276
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,930
I've already taken samples

277
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,320
and will get the forensic report as soon as possible

278
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,390
to see if there's any evidence

279
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,360
of Xiaopeng being abused.

280
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,870
Captain Cheng.

281
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,700
We lost track of Yun Lei.

282
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,200
That man

283
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,510
incited a few of his buddies

284
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,390
to start a big gang fight,

285
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,900
which turned out to be a diversion.

286
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,090
He had already sneaked away.

287
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,270
And this gang

288
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,260
doesn't really have a boss.

289
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,800
Yun Lei is their leader.

290
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,870
I think the person who abused Xiaopeng

291
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,750
might not be Yun Lei.

292
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,980
Then who else could it be?

293
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,390
Actually, I have

294
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,380
a suspicion,

295
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,490
but it needs to be verified.

296
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,660
Anyway,

297
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,990
we gotta find Yun Lei first.

298
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,880
Li Han!

299
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,450
Yes, Captain Cheng.

300
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,360
Use technical investigation methods

301
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,750
to track Yun Lei's movements.

302
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,390
Got it!

303
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,230
Hello, Captain Cheng.

304
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,620
Ertou's phone signal

305
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,650
appeared at the People's Hospital.

306
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:23,800
(Medical Technology Building)
appeared at the People's Hospital.

307
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:23,820
(Medical Technology Building)

308
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,220
But Yan is interrogating him right now.

(Medical Technology Building)

310
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,670
This should be Yun Lei.

(Medical Technology Building)

312
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,390
He's probably there for Liu Qiang.

(Department of Critical Care)

316
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,730
Director Zhang,

317
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,590
we've tracked down

318
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,710
Yun Lei at the People's Hospital.

319
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,250
Jiang Feng and I are leading a team over there.

320
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,220
I suspect that he intends to launch

321
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,280
a second attack on Liu Qiang.

322
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,800
No matter what, we must

323
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,950
stop Yun Lei.

324
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,300
The hospital is a sensitive place.

325
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,270
When you move,

326
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,540
make sure to control the area

327
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,750
to avoid secondary incidents.

328
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,050
Understood.

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,890
(Beijiang Children's Hospital)

330
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,380
Have some pizza.

331
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:21,829
Is it good?

332
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,510
Is it

333
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,350
a box?

334
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,400
Yeah, it's a box.

335
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,490
Today, I

336
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,130
want to reintroduce you

337
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,510
to these colors in your notebook.

338
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,690
For example,

339
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,210
the box you just touched

340
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,160
is in your favorite color, red.

341
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,980
And red

342
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,870
symbolizes good things.

343
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,110
Such as

344
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,730
victory,

345
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,270
celebration,

346
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,550
and reunion.

347
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,310
They can all be represented by red.

348
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,110
Just like during the Spring Festival,

349
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,740
when everyone gathers for the New Year's Eve dinner,

350
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,780
every household

351
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,830
will put up

352
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,550
two red Spring Festival couplets on their door.

353
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,510
Adults will also give children

354
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,290
lucky money.

355
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,960
The envelope containing lucky money

356
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,190
is also red.

357
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,150
I

358
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,230
have never celebrated the Spring Festival before,

359
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,150
and neither do I know

360
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,210
what lucky money is.

361
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,230
Xiaopeng,

362
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,430
the colors

363
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,590
I just taught you

364
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,680
can actually

365
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,910
all be found in your notebook.

366
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,350
Shall we try

367
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,310
using those colors

368
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,420
to draw?

369
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,630
I've brought the paint box.

370
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,770
This paint box

371
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,190
has six colors inside.

372
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,270
There's a number

373
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,630
under each color.

374
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,950
One.

375
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,790
Two.

376
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,930
Three.

377
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,110
They are red, orange, and yellow respectively.

378
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,550
All good colors.

379
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,830
Four.

380
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,350
Five.

381
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,720
Six.

382
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,100
They are green, blue, and purple respectively.

383
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,870
Bad colors.

384
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,220
Do you remember?

385
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,880
Great!

386
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,020
Now, let's start

387
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,950
to touch the paintings.

388
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:33,930
Feel it.

389
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,200
Xiaopeng,

390
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,300
has this person

391
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,350
abused you?

392
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,830
Look, it's about time.

393
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,290
(Visitor's Outfit)

394
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,170

395
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,350
(Visiting Time: 16:30 to 17:00

396
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,510
(Visiting Passageway)

397
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,780
You...

398
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,190
Who are you?

399
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,290
Someone has entered the ICU.

400
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,340
Open the door!

401
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,640
What are you gonna do?

402
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,390
What's going on?

403
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,540
I'm going to call security!

404
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,120
What's happening?

405
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,760
I want to see Liu Qiang.

406
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,330
I can feel it.

407
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,110
You're a bit scared

408
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,030
of the person on the paper.

409
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,710
Relax, Xiaopeng.

410
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,070
It's absolutely safe here.

411
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,430
You won't get hurt in any way.

412
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,660
Just feel free to draw.

413
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,380
What are you doing?

414
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,260
I...

415
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,100
I'm looking for something.

416
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,820
What's this piece of junk?

417
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,360
That...

418
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,410
That's what Mom left for me.

419
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,640
Can you stop acting like a wimp?

420
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,700
Crying all day!

421
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,990
Still thinking about her?

422
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,820
Still missing her?

423
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,600
Stop thinking about her!

424
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,770
Got it?

425
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,370
How dare you still think about her?

426
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,990
Still thinking about her?

427
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,110
How dare you?

428
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,930
Huh?

429
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,120
(Interrogation Room)

430
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,750
You're still keeping silent?
(Interrogation Room)

431
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,230
Now Yun Lei has rushed to the hospital

432
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,770
to do something wild!

433
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,670
It's all done for, you know?

434
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,590
What on earth is your relationship

435
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,350
with Xiaopeng?

436
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,170
We've been raising him like our little brother.

437
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,230
When Lei first

438
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,550
found him,

439
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,750
his dad had beaten him so badly

440
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,230
that there were bruises all over his body.

441
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,840
Lei wanted to take him in,

442
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,430
while Xiaozhuang disagreed,

443
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,670
saying that we could barely

444
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,590
take care of ourselves,

445
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,950
let alone an extra burden.

446
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,630
He suggested

447
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,880
we send him to the police station.

448
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,300
Lei refused,

449
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,750
fearing Xiaopeng would be taken away by his dad.

450
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,350
What are you doing?

451
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,590
Look! A nurse's been taken hostage!

452
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,790
My family member is still inside!

453
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,250
My dad's still in there!

454
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,470
Open the door!

455
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,350
Open up!

456
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,210
Jiang Feng.

457
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,380
Excuse me,

458
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,760
we're on official duty.

459
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,310
We'll handle this situation.

460
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,280
My family is still inside.

461
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,080
Go ask how to open this door.

462
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,590
Got it.

463
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,050
Later, Xiaopeng's dad came.

464
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,470
Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team
Later, Xiaopeng's dad came.

465
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,030
He was beating Xiaopeng!

466
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,430
Lei injured him

467
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,310
in order to save Xiaopeng!

468
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,910
Please! Please save Lei!

469
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,750
You must get him back!

470
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,720
Don't let him...

471
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,740
Don't let him kill anyone.

472
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,340
Otherwise, his life will be

473
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,660
r-ruined.

474
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,390
-I beg you...
-Alright...

475
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,150
Please...

476
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,790
-I'm begging you.
-Okay...

477
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,550
Go save him!

478
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,390
Calm down, boy...

479
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,490
Tell the people inside to open the door!

480
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,600
Captain Cheng,

481
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,760
we can't open the door.

482
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,430
Why?

483
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,910
To open it from the outside,

484
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,900
we need to cut the power.

485
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,590
But the inner door

486
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,390
and the outer door

487
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,630
are on the same circuit.

488
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,870
If we cut the power

489
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,890
to open the door from the outside,

490
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,010
the inner door will open too.

491
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,700
Yun Lei!

492
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,250
Don't come in!

493
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,310
I'm Du Cheng.

494
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,870
Put the knife down.

495
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,820
Open the inner door!

496
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,270
I'm going to gonna kill Liu Qiang!

497
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,920
Yun Lei,

498
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,520
listen to me.

499
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,730
This nurse is innocent.

500
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,070
She has nothing

501
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,560
to do with your issue!

502
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,510
Whatever grudge you hold

503
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,900
against Liu Qiang,

504
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,140
put down the knife, come out, and tell me.

505
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,870
I'll help you solve the problem, okay?

506
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,600
I have nothing to talk to you!

507
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,930
I just want to kill Liu Qiang!

508
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:38,710
Pick it up.

Du Cheng,

513
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,460
those kids told us that

514
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,420
Yun Lei insisted on taking in Xiaopeng

515
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,580
and had been taking care of him all along.

516
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,770
Those boys

517
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,670
are like brothers.

518
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,810
They've been begging us

519
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,570
to stop Yun Lei no matter what.

520
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,750
Yun Lei!

521
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,230
Your brothers just

522
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,170
called me,

523
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,460
asking me to make sure you don't do anything wild.

524
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,190
They said you're a good guy,

525
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,490
very loyal.

526
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,210
Put the knife down

527
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,150
and come out.

528
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,980
Let's talk, okay?

529
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,420
You know nothing.

530
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,730
If Liu Qiang's alive,

531
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,920
Xiaopeng will die!

532
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,860
Open the door!

533
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,060

Hello?

539
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,150
Hello?

540
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,710
Can you bring Xiaopeng to the hospital?

541
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,910
Then ask the people inside to open it!

542
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,540
Yun Lei!

543
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,680
I've already made a call!

544
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,250
Xiaopeng is on his way here.

545
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,880
Don't let him come!

546
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
I can't let him

547
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,980
see me in this state...

548
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,830
Captain Cheng,

549
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,990
he's way out of his mind now.

550
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,910
Let's just break in.

551
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,540
No.

552
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,590
Don't force me!

553
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,550
If we break in,

554
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,310
once this door opens,

555
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,270
the inner door to the ICU

556
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,100
will open too.

557
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,720
When he tries to kill Liu Qiang, things will

558
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,390
run out of control.

559
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,770
Open the door! Or I'll kill you!

560
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,970
The only way out

561
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,420
is to wait for Xiaopeng to arrive

562
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,090
and persuade him to come out.

563
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,270
Open the door!

564
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:19,990

565
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,640
Hold on...

566
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,820
Please, just wait a moment.

567
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,800
Where's Xiaopeng?

568
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,830
Let me give it a try.

569
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,590

Open the door!

Or I'll kill you!

574
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,340
Xiaopeng can see now.

575
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,590
Really?

576
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,630
Look.

00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,670
I saw the colors in the drawings.

580
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,170
Xiaopeng's personal notebook

581
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,360
originally contained only

582
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,960
the patterns marked in a way for the blind.

583
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,670
The colors on them

584
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,250
were all painted by you later,

585
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,060
right?

586
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,770
To understand him better,

587
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,910
you marked what he likes

588
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,840
and what he dislikes

589
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,710
with colors.

590
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,350
Although you were leading

591
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,150
a homeless life,

592
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,520
you still chose

593
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,110
to give Xiaopeng

594
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,150
a life full of colors.

595
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,850
Look!

596
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,990
He colored

597
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,670
the portrait of you.

598
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,680
Xiaopeng,

599
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,870
why did you use completely different colors

600
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,300
for Yun Lei

601
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,790
compared to the ones

602
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,830
for your dad's portrait?

603
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,180
Because

604
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,440
Yun Lei is different from Dad.

605
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,800
But I also spot a bit of blue

606
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,390
on Yun Lei's face.

607
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,200
That's because Yun Lei

608
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,070
always says he's a bad boy,

609
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,190
but

610
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,330
living with him

611
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,140
makes me happy.

612
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,260
In such a short time,

613
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,310
you've figured out the secret between Xiaopeng

614
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,150
and me.

615
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,070
It was Xiaopeng who revealed

616
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,230
the truth to us through colors.

617
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,590
You're not the one

618
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,350
who's abused him.

619
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,780
The person we're looking for

620
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,430
is him!

621
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,360
It's his dad.

622
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,300
Xiaopeng is still waiting for you at home.

623
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,260
His biggest worry right now

624
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,320
is that he'll never see

625
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,350
his brother, Yun Lei, ever again.

you'll need a skill

645

00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,550
if I worked hard enough

00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,430
and ran fast enough,

739
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,150
I could just run

740
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,190
into a life different from my parents'.

741
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,510

744
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,200

745
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,880

and end up like me,

759
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,390
collecting garbage

760
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,190
and fighting every day.

761
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,030
It was also meeting Xiaopeng

762
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,740
that made my life meaningful.

763
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,880
I want to save money for his education

764
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,260
and let him learn to run.

765
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,440
I just want him to have

766
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,170
an egg

767
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,790
and a glass of milk every day.

768
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,060
So when he grows up,

769
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,830
he can participate in the Paralympics.

770
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,420
He can paddle his own canoe,

771
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,560
and I can be his pacesetter.

772
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,870
I finally felt

773
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,330
there was something to look forward to in life.

774
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,920
How could I let someone ruin it again?

775
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,550
A boy?

776
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,990
Little one,

777
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,480
where's your home?

778
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,200
He can't see...

779
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,430
He's blind.

780
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,310
Xiaopeng!

781
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,230
Xiaopeng?

782
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,910
Where are you?

783
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,220
Xiaopeng!

784
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,920
Where the heck are you?

785
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,950
Did your dad beat you like this?

786
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,310
Quiet.

787
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,010
Eat some more.

788
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,210
There's more.

789
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,200
I've already had one.

790
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,180
I can't eat anymore.

791
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,860
If I do eat more,

792
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,600
I'll get beaten again.

793
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,750
After you come in,

794
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,360
grab this door.

795
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,330
And then...

796
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,350
Bang!

797
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,100
The door will close.

798
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,970
Feel around you.

799
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,790
Is it sturdy?

800
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,190
Shake it a bit.

801
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,190
How's it?

802
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,280
This way, when we go out,

803
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,860
the stray dogs won't be able to bite you.

804
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,050
(Missing)

805
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,030
Five yuan.

806
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,790
Xiaopeng!

807
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:30,930
Xiaopeng!

808
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,960
Little brat, so you are here.

809
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,650
Go home with me!

810
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,710
Let go of me!

811
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,060
You're learning from your mom, huh?

812
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,650
You wanna abandon me as well?

813
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,000
Right?

814
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,650
Brother Yun!

815
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,350
Lei!

816
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,400
Hands off him!

817
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,390
It's okay.

818
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,470
Little brat...

819
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,830
You little brat!

820
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,170
Little brat...

821
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,070
How dare you kidnap my son?

822
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,290
How dare you?

823
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,050
Lei!

824
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,700
Lei!

825
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,870
Lei?

826
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,310
Lei!

827
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,630
Lei!

828
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,710
Lei!

829
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,270
Lei!

830
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,710
Lei!

831
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,430
Lei...

832
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,590
Lei...

833
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,150
Let go of my brother.

834
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,550
Get out of the way!

835
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,390
Let's go!

836
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,750
Lei!

837
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,990
Hold onto me!

838
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,750
Please hold onto me!

839
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,980
Lei!

840
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,310
Lei!

841
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,780
Lei...

842
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,340
Save me.

843
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,070
Lei...

844
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,160
Hold onto me...

845
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,590
Hold onto me!

846
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,990
Xiaopeng?

847
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,830
Xiaopeng!

848
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,230
Xiaopeng!

849
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,830
Yun Lei.

850
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,580
Xiaopeng.

851
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,250
Xiaopeng.

852
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,340
Yun Lei.

853
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,300
-Xiaopeng.
-Yun Lei.

854
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,300
Xiaopeng!

855
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,340
Yun Lei!

856
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,720
Yun Lei...

857
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,360
Lei!

858
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,710
Yun Lei...

859
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,430
Yun Lei.

860
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,150
Xiaopeng.

861
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,960
-I'm here. I'm here with you.
-Yun Lei...

862
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,190
-Xiaopeng, don't be afraid.
-Where have you been?

863
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,800
-No worries.
-Where have you been?

864
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,600
Where have you been?

865
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,140
Yun Lei...

866
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,990
I went to see the picture

867
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,450
you drew for me, Xiaopeng!

868
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,250
It's so beautiful!

869
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,950
Xiaopeng, you can now

870
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,370
draw with colors,

871
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,500
can't you?

872
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,670
At this rate,

873
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,070
you can soon become

874
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,620
a little teacher!

875
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,620
Remember to listen to them.

876
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,030
Eat well

877
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,080
and exercise well.

878
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,790
Yun Lei...

879
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,310
I promise you,

880
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,320
Xiaopeng, when you grow up,

881
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,030
I will come back.

882
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,090
Okay?

883
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,890
Don't cry anymore.

884
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,160
Come on...

885
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,160
Don't cry.

886
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,150
Don't cry anymore.

887
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,710
If you keep crying, you'll

888
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,310
look ugly.

889
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,250
Yun Lei...

890
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,430
So I was the one

891
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,080
who was blind.

892
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,910
Xiaopeng helped me open my eyes.

893
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,230
He can see everything with his heart.

894
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,380
We've already started investigating

895
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,970
the evidence of Liu Qiang abusing Xiaopeng.

896
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,190
Don't worry,

897
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,580
no one's gonna

898
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,350
bully him again.

899
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:11,660
Thank you.

900
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,710
Thank you.

901
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,040
Hey, Xiaowu.

902
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,770
Hello.

903
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,020
Activate rest mode.

904
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,170
Got it, sir.

905
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,060
From now on, get along well

906
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,960
with the other kids here.

907
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,870
Can you?

908
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:53,710
Good boy.

909
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,470
The teacher is here.

910
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,230
Come on.

911
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,070
Xiaopeng,

912
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,270
I have a painting for you.

913
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,080
Feel it

914
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,540
and see if you can tell

915
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,590
what's drawn on it.

916
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,500
It's Yun Lei and me!

917
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,110
Clever boy.

918
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,150
I made this based on your way

919
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,910
of perceiving.

920
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:26,880
Do you like it?

921
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,490
Yeah, I like it!

922
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,760
It's a gift for you.

923
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,690
We'll entrust him to you.

924
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,510
Then I'm taking him inside now.

925
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,200
Let's go.

926
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,510
Be good, okay?

927
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,830
Sirs,

928
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,350
may I

929
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,850
touch your faces?

930
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,580
I want to remember what you look like.

931
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,310
Come here.

932
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,850
This is your cheek.

933
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,200
This is your forehead.

934
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,990
These are your eyebrows.

935
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,670
These are your eyes.

936
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,160
This is your nose.

937
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,480
This is your mouth.

938
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,470
This is your chin.

939
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,210
Did you remember them?

940
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,230
Yeah.

941
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,680
What's this?

942
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:50,870
(Public Security)

943
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,590
This is
(Public Security)

944
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,410
(Public Security)

945
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,350
a police badge.
(Public Security)

946
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,340
(Public Security)

947
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,210
People with this badge

948
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,170
will protect you.

949
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,010
This is a police badge.

950
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,220
Did you remember that?

951
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:05,740
Yes!

952
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,310
Let's go.

953
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,700
Goodbye, Mr. Shen and Mr. Du.

954
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,180
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

955
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:43,940
I believe Xiaopeng

956
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,710
will meet

957
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:45,870
more people who care for him here.

958
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,590
I hope he can

959
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,070
forget all those awful memories

960
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,350
and grow up here

961
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,980
happily and healthily.
