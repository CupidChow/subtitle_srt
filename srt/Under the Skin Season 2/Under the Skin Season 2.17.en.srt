(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,039
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,110
Back then, Captain Lei

4
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,180
did indeed visit this welfare home.

5
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,030
The welfare home had clear

6
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,420
identity information for Min Xue.

7
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,570
From this perspective,

8
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,550
there was nothing wrong with Captain Lei's approach.

9
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,690
If there was nothing wrong,

10
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,160
I wouldn't be here now.

11
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,550
That teacher

12
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,820
said Min Xue was very skillful with her hands.

13
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,670
Captain Lei's notes

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,170
also mentioned this.

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,400
What do you think?

16
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,829
I saw Min Xue's handmade crafts

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,550
in that photo album just now.

18
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,740
Her technique

19
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,140
was clearly very mature.

20
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,510
This indicates

21
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,950
she has a natural talent in this area.

22
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,150
Doing handicrafts

23
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,490
can please the teachers

24
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,750
and help make friends.

25
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,210
It's like a reward system,

26
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,940
which is quite normal.

27
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,860
Yes.

28
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,160
How could a homeless child

29
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,670
have such

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,230
mature survival skills?

31
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,230
You think her the logic behind her actions

32
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,630
didn't match her age at that time?

33
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,940
Or rather,

34
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,020
she had been trained before,

35
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,700
and before this,

36
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,270
she had already mastered this skill.

37
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,380
Then the Tuyuan City Welfare Home

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,630
might not be the only welfare home

39
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,990
she had stayed at.

40
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,020
Many welfare homes offer handicraft classes.

41
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,110
If we investigate them one by one,

42
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,990
it'll be very time-consuming.

43
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,520
Characteristics for a search

44
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,670
are like keywords in a search engine.

45
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,040
The more keywords,

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,800
the more we can narrow down

47
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,150
the scope and length of the investigation.

48
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,600
I remember two things

49
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,230
from the photo album.

50
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,400
One is braiding.

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,390
The other is origami.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,350
Then we should focus on investigating

53
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,950
welfare homes that offer

54
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,079
these two types of classes.

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,110
I think we

56
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,950
are quite in sync.

57
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,410
You really won't come with me to the city bureau?

58
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,070
I...

59
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,310
No need.

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,240
I was just kidding.

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:42,710
I'm sorry.
(Puxi City) (Fengdu Mountain)
(Lianjiang Middle Road) (Aofeng Road)

63
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,630
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,240
I'm not very familiar

65
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,570
with the past.

66
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,550
I've contacted

67
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,990
our retired director.

68
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,270
She's on the way here now.

69
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,390
Please feel free to look around first.

70
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,790
Alright, thank you.

71
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,760
Here you go.

72
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,950
Thank you.

73
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,470
Are all the children here

74
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,630
good at doing this?

75
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,930
Well, no.

76
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,710
It's just that Lin Xue was particularly clever.

77
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,210
She not only learned quickly,

78
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,670
but could also braid

79
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,270
very intricate patterns.

80
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,720
(July 2010) (Zhang Ting)

81
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,650
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

82
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,440
for keeping you waiting.

83
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,230
I heard from Ms. Cai

84
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,690
that you are police officers.

85
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,370
Yes.

86
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,830
We're here to find someone.

87
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,000
Please take a look.

88
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,320
Do you recognize this person?

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,740
Isn't this Zhang Ting?

90
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,270
That child was really wonderful.

91
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,410
Smart,

92
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,960
skillful, and sensible.

93
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,570
She loved taking care of the younger girls

94
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,290
and even helped our teachers

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,710
with a lot of childcare work.

96
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,320
Then

97
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,840
did she

98
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,610
make this origami too?

99
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,270
Yes, isn't it beautiful?

100
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,190
We've kept it here

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,560
for so many years,

102
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,910
not bearing to throw it away.

103
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,550
We use it as a craft model

104
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,330
for the other children.

105
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,560
Did you have

106
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,790
a child here

107
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,750
named Lin Xue?

108
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,650
Lin Xue?

109
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,140
Lin Xue?

110
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,530
Yes, yes, yes.

111
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,540
There was one.

112
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,300
Zhang Ting often played with her,

113
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,390
but Lin Xue was much younger.

114
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,630
Then where did

115
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,490
Zhang Ting go?

116
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,660
After she turned 18,

117
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,430
she didn't get into college.

118
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,880
Then she left the welfare home directly.

119
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,860
Usually, children from the home

120
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,040
come back to visit us

121
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,460
and their younger siblings

122
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,730
after they've grown up,

123
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,090
but Zhang Ting

124
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,630
never came back again.

125
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,060
Could I trouble you one more time?

126
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
Do you recognize this person?

127
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,660
No,

128
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,770
I don't have any impression.

129
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,520
I probably haven't seen him before.

130
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,630
Alright, thank you.

(July 2010) (Zhang Ting)

132
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,800
While investigating Min Xue's call records, I found that

133
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,909
she had many contacts

134
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,320
who are sex workers.

135
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,870
She contacted them frequently.

136
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,910
However, I'm not sure

137
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,010
if this has anything to do with the rescue station.

138
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,670
Why was she frequently contacting

139
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,790
sex workers?

Didn't we agree on 2:30?

147

Why are you

148

half an hour early?

152
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,880
We'd like to ask you some questions.

153
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,080
Is that alright?

154
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,010
Have a seat.

155
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,380
We won't sit.

156
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,750
Put on some clothes.

157
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,430
You've seen

158
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,370
her before, right?

159
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,570
What's your relationship with her?

160
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,480
Officer,

161
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,510
she was always the one

162
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,550
who contacted me first.

163
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,620
I'm asking

164
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,940
what your relationship with her is.

165
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,270
Well,

166
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,500
what else could it be?

167
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,490
We just make money together.

168
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,960
How exactly do you make money?

169
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,060
She

170
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,980
always makes me

171
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,640
pretend to be an underage girl

172
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,910
to meet those really perverted men,

173
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,620
secretly record videos,

174
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,430
and then she blackmails them for money.

175
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,390
I didn't actually do anything.

176
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,650
I just help her act.

177
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,990
Go ahead.

178
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,150
Min Xue's real name is Zhang Ting.

179
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,270
She lied about her age back then

180
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,870
and used a false identity.

181
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,750
Min Xue's information

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,990
was all entered

183
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,150
into the national public security system.

184
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,710
But now it seems

185
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,200
it might be because

186
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,670
the household registration system was not well-developed at that time.

187
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,310
She took advantage of this.

188
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,790
Regarding how we should we characterize and handle

189
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,110
this matter,

190
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,870
the city bureau needs to hold a meeting to discuss it.

191
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,940
Is there anything else?

192
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:12,990
No.

193
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,790
Wait for my news.

194
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,150
On the way back, Captain Lu

195
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,310
mentioned

196
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,270
a crucial piece of information.

197
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,240
It's about China's welfare home system.

198
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,430
Before 2017,

199
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,430
there was no nationwide network system.

200
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,950
This resulted in

201
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,870
the information of many orphans

202
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,950
not being shared between institutions.

203
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,150
Moreover, many orphans' files

204
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,350
lacked photo information.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,090
So this Zhang Ting,

206
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,970
also known as Min Xue,

207
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,400
could easily

208
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,110
use the excuse of helping teachers at school

209
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,600
to access other orphans'

210
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,030
original residence information and family background,

211
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,930
then take the opportunity to change her own identity information.

212
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,120
We also found out that

213
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,320
Min Xue had sex workers

214
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,620
pose as underage girls

215
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,800
to blackmail those donors with ill intentions.

216
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,100
So what's the plan now?

217
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,250
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

218
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,580
Morning.

219
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,190
Morning.

220
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,050
Du.

221
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,630
Mr. Shen.

222
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,460
Have I done something wrong?

223
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,550
Who is she?

224
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,270
Beatrice Cenci.

225
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,810
Like you,

226
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,670
she had a baby face.

227
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,030
People in later generations thought

228
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,470
she was an underage girl.

229
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,470
She was a girl with a tragic fate.

230
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,800
She was sexually abused by her violent father.

231
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,470
In the end, unable to bear it any longer,

232
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,260
she conspired with her family to kill her father.

233
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,190
She...

234
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,410
Her experience...

235
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,390
It's very similar to yours.

236
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,590
But in fact, when she killed her father,

237
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,350
she was already 21 years old.

238
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,230
Min Xue.

239
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,230
Lin Xue.

240
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,800
Zhang Ting.

241
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,730
What should we call you?

242
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,030
You don't understand.

243
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,850
For people like us,

244
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,810
who were abandoned at birth,

245
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,170
we long so much for someone to rely on.

246
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,550
When the brothers and sisters

247
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,910
who grew up and come back

248
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,930
to the welfare home

249
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,350
to visit after leaving,

250
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,180
they all say

251
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,390
that whether it's work

252
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,490
or life,

253
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,730
they're all alone out there,

254
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,530
with no one to rely on.

255
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,390
I was terrified of leaving the welfare home.

256
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,390
So...

257
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,960
I came up with a plan.

258
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,940
I used

259
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,860
the identity of Lin Xue, who was much younger than me,

260
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,230
to stay at the welfare home.

261
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,120
I just liked being taken care of by them.

262
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,950
At least

263
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,530
I wasn't alone.

264
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,100
There were people with me.

265
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,500
This child was very likable.

266
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,790
She was a sweet-talker.

267
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,890
She especially liked to play with the younger girls.

268
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,130
This child was really wonderful.

269
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,950
Smart,

270
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,620
skillful and sensible.

271
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,260
She loved to take care of the little girls.

272
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,160
Why did you conceal it back then?

273
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,070
Why didn't you tell Captain Lei your real age?

274
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,150
Because I wanted Zhang Bin

275
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,310
to pay the price.

276
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,170
The law will make him pay.

277
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,700
It's not enough.

278
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,270
It's not enough.

279
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,550
Compared to what he did to me,

280
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,890
the price he paid is too light.

281
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,290
After Min Shengmei

282
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,270
adopted me,

283
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,970
she was kind and gentle at first.

284
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,890
I tried my best to be well-behaved.

285
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,050
I thought I was lucky

286
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,610
and could finally have a home.

287
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,650
Until she took me

288
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,260
and married Zhang Bin.

289
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,520
Crispy, isn't it?

290
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,800
Your hand.

291
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,339
Dad's home.

292
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,579
Watching TV?

293
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,060
I bought some Gala apples for Xue.

294
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:20,720
They're delicious.

295
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,829
Thank you, Dad.

296
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,650
Xue.

297
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,820
Dad wants to eat too.

298
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,370
Dad.

299
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,490
Dad, what are you doing?

300
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:42,990
Mom!

301
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,390
Don't move.

302
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,350
Mom!

303
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,750
Don't move.

304
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,350
Dad, what are you doing?

305
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,470
Mom!

306
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,950
Don't move.

307
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,110
Xue, call Dad for dinner.

308
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,190
Mom.

309
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,780
Dad assaulted me.

310
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,010
How can you talk like that?

311
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,470
How could Dad assault you?

312
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,660
Alright, go call him now.

313
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,290
Xue,

314
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,480
what are you sitting there for?

315
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,880
Hurry up and eat.

316
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,860
Xue, Xue!

317
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:31,950
Xue!

318
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,790
Are you not listening

319
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,190
to what Mom is saying anymore?

320
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,150
You're not my mom.

321
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,430
He's not my dad either.

322
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,910
What are you saying, child?

323
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,210
You can't leave.

324
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,830
Where would you go in the middle of the night?

325
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,010
It's none of your business!

326
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,030
Keep your voice down.

327
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,130
If you leave here,

328
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,150
the welfare home

329
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,470
definitely won't take you back.

330
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,270
Do you want to end up on the streets?

331
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,280
Neither of you are good people.

332
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,820
Watch your language.

333
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,490
There are even fewer good people out there.

334
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,670
Once you leave,

335
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,480
you won't even know

336
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,000
how you got sold.

337
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,750
I want to call the police.

338
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,300
Call the police?

339
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,930
She wants to call the police.

340
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,730
My precious daughter,

341
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,750
have you forgotten what

342
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,470
I do for a living?

343
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm a lawyer.

344
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,480
Think about it.

345
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,820
Who do you think

346
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,220
the police will believe?

347
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,200
Enough.

348
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,110
Don't make things harder for yourself.

349
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,900
If you tell too many lies...

350
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,920
Naturally,

351
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,250
no one will believe you anymore.

352
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,350
What are you standing there for?

353
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,000
Take off your jacket.

354
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,580
Hurry up.

355
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,760
In a moment,

356
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,350
go in and apologize to Dad properly.

357
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,180
We're all unfortunate people.

358
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,880
Dad provided us

359
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,290
with such good conditions.

360
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,960
We should be grateful.

361
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,480
You shouldn't act recklessly.

362
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,390
Be obedient.

363
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:04,870
Be good.

364
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,070
We have investigated everything.

365
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,040
Zhang Lili and the others pretending to be minors

366
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,070
to commit fraud

367
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,830
are all connected to you.

368
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,710
And the targets of their fraud

369
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,250
were all donors to your rescue station.

370
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,110
Why did you do this?

371
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,920
Because there are always some people with bad intentions

372
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,860
who use the donations

373
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,110
to exchange with me for those girls.

374
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,830
Just like what Zhang Bin did to me back then.

375
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,750
Xue,

376
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,700
are there any little girls

377
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,830
in your welfare home who like

378
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,350
nice things?

379
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,020
What do you want?

380
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,480
Nothing.

381
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,960
Don't worry.

382
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,560
Dad won't leave you.

383
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,700
Dad

384
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,660
can help them fulfill their wishes.

385
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,540
Maybe

386
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,350
they'll meet

387
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,590
someone better than me.

388
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,920
They'll be able to buy things they like,

389
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,660
go on vacations

390
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,790
and even buy pets.

391
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,810
They can go to university

392
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,220
or even study abroad.

393
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,500
Later,

394
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,170
I had Zhang Lili and the others

395
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,080
pretend to be minors

396
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,960
to set up a trap

397
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,810
and extort them.

398
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,770
This way,

399
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,910
those people were punished,

400
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,790
and I had money

401
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,270
to run the rescue station.

402
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,790
I genuinely wanted to help

403
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,950
those girls.

404
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,950
I didn't want them to

405
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,550
experience the misfortunes I had.

406
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,840
But now I can't do anything anymore.

407
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,430
Du,

408
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,680
what will happen

409
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,270
to the rescue station?

410
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,310
Don't worry.

411
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,180
They will be properly taken care of.

412
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,700
Thank you.

413
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,250
From now on,

414
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,230
how would you like us to address you?

415
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,980
Min Xue?

416
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,530
Lin Xue?

417
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,170
Zhang Ting.

418
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,910
Now, I finally have the chance

419
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,720
to let go of all this

420
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,780
and be Zhang Ting again.

421
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,370
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

422
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,770
After the city bureau's analysis,
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

423
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,470
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

424
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,030
first,
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

425
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,680
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

426
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,320
it can be confirmed that
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

427
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,060
it can be confirmed that

428
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,700
Min Xue's real name is Zhang Ting,

429
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,940
and there is evidence of identity theft.

430
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,390
I will compile and report

431
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,550
the supplementary evidence found by the Beijiang Branch

432
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,470
to the city bureau

433
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,400
and transfer it to the prosecutor's office and the court.

434
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,820
Second,

435
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,270
regarding

436
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,350
the approach,

437
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,570
process, and case conclusion

438
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,080
of Lei Yifei's investigation into the age discrepancy

439
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,280
of Min Xue...

440
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,130
It is all in compliance with regulations and without fault.

441
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,880
Everyone has worked hard during this period.

442
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,910
The meeting is adjourned.

443
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,500
Being able to identify problems,

444
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,140
acknowledge them,

445
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,500
and work together to solve them,

446
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,560
you two

447
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,190
did well.

448
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,650
Keep it up.

449
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,640
Let's go.

450
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,620
Sit.

451
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,100
The case is closed.

452
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,010
What else do you have to say, Captain Lu?

453
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,820
It's precisely because the case is closed

454
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,080
that I came to say hello.

455
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,490
I heard from Director Zhang

456
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,790
that you voluntarily requested

457
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,870
to investigate this.

458
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,700
Why?

459
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,490
I wouldn't trust anyone else to do it.

460
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,170
You clearly had good intentions,

461
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,240
but you were so serious when you came

462
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,710
that I didn't know

463
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,800
if you were friend or foe.

464
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,820
It's not the first time.

465
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,270
You'll get used to it.

466
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,830
So,

467
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,860
the truth about Captain Lei's case has come to light.

468
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,710
Are you satisfied with the result?

469
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,750
Goodbye.

470
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,630
I'm leaving.

471
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,600
Leave and don't come back.

472
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,460
Don't worry,

473
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,020
I won't come back.

474
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,940
I'll wait for you to come find me.

475
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:03,540
(2009 Outstanding Worker: Lei Yifei)

476
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,890
You said you specially invited me for a meal.

477
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,770
You really put some thought into it.

478
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,870
The case is closed successfully.

479
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,750
You should rest.

480
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,150
Originally,

481
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,950
I cooked something myself.

482
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,800
But I tasted it.

483
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,410
In the end,

484
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,660
I ordered some delicious food.

485
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,110
Eat it while it's hot.

486
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,330
Did you make the coffee?

487
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,910
Yes.

488
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,190
Although the case is closed...

489
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,140
I've been thinking

490
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,640
that if nothing had happened to Captain Lei,

491
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,080
he would've kept an eye on Min Xue.

492
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,990
Then maybe Min Xue

493
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,480
wouldn't have come this far.

494
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,910
The harm that Min Shengmei and Zhang Bin

495
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,230
caused her back then

496
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,600
was indeed too deep.

497
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,120
Although she used

498
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,190
the method of concealing her age

499
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,070
to take revenge on Zhang Bin,

500
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,150
once the seed of malice

501
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,000
was planted in her heart,

502
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,110
it might be difficult for her

503
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,150
to trust anyone again.

504
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,690
I was negligent.

505
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,940
I should've kept an eye on Min Xue

506
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,720
on behalf of Captain Lei.

507
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,100
If Captain Lei knew

508
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,590
what happened,

509
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,300
he'd be very sad.

510
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,850
Have you ever thought about

511
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,190
that if Captain Lei knew

512
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,310
that the little troublemaker he saved back then

513
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,430
has become

514
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,750
an outstanding criminal police captain

515
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,910
and taken over his position,

516
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,320
would he be less sad?

517
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,250
Who are you calling a troublemaker?

518
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,940
I was just going through a rebellious phase.

519
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,850
Didn't you have one?

520
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,420
I haven't named it yet.

521
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,550
You think of one.

522
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,190
The Person Who Changed My Life.

523
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,190
Indeed, he did change

524
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,020
my life.

525
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,970
Help!

526
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,260
Help! Help!

527
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,810
Help!

528
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,230
Help!

529
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,270
Help!

530
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,520
At three in the morning,

531
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,270
a sanitation worker

532
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,409
heard an alarm.

533
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,250
Upon entering, he found a woman

534
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,570
lying there unconscious.

535
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,250
Captain Cheng.

536
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,889
Are there any surveillance cameras nearby?

537
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,010
No,

538
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,000
because this entire area

539
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,750
is a demolition zone.

540
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,400
It's usually fenced off,

541
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,389
but someone

542
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,370
made an opening

543
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,590
to take a shortcut through here.

544
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,929
People occasionally pass through.

545
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,780
How long has this area been under demolition?

546
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,360
From the start of relocation until now,

547
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,230
it's been about 1.5 to 2 years.

548
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,270
Has the victim's information

549
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,030
been found?

550
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,990
She's a local female university student

551
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,790
named Guo Yuan,

552
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,770
20 years old.

553
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,730
How is her condition now?

554
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,840
After emergency treatment,

555
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,890
she has regained consciousness.

556
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:32,110
(Missing)

557
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,520
Ms. Guo,

558
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,860
do you

559
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,480
often walk through that demolition area?

560
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,390
Rarely.

561
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,040
Have you recently

562
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,190
had any conflicts

563
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,270
with anyone?

564
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,630
No.

565
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,270
Do you remember

566
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,860
what your attacker looked like?

567
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,560
No.

568
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,230
Everything

569
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,430
happened too fast.

570
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,910
My head was covered,

571
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,750
and then he came and hit me.

572
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,380
He kept hitting me,

573
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,320
like a wild beast.

574
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,150
He wanted to beat me to death.

575
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,800
He wanted to beat me to death.

576
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,790
Ms. Guo,

577
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,340
please calm down.

578
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,460
I'm a sketch artist.

579
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,150
If

580
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,870
you can try your best

581
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,910
to recall more details

582
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,830
of the incident,

583
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,160
we can help you find your attacker

584
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,080
as soon as possible.

585
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,370
You won't be able to find him.

586
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,470
I shouldn't have gone that way.

587
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,040
They all say that once you go in,

588
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,270
you won't be able to

589
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,230
leave that path.

590
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,790
Yes.

591
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,430
It wasn't a human.

592
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,950
It was a ghost.

593
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,370
A ghost attacked me.

594
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,820
Not a human, not a human.

595
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,430
Captain Cheng,

596
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,550
we found the information

597
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,950
on Li Hong from the missing person flyer.

598
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,330
She's a local,

599
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,300
37 years old,

600
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,770
made a living by collecting recyclables.

601
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,010
She went missing a year ago.

602
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,720
Her husband reported her missing.

603
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,990
When she disappeared,

604
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,390
she didn't take any belongings with her.

605
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,790
Her whereabouts are still unknown.

606
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:20,960
Also,

607
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,750
she had rickets as a child.

608
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,050
She's hunchbacked.

609
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,200
Can we confirm the location where she went missing?

610
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,460
It's unclear.

611
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,580
I want to go check the demolition area again.

612
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,050
You suspect

613
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,910
it's related to Guo Yuan's attack?

614
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,800
Not sure.

615
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,160
Let's take a look.

616
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,960
Okay.

617
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,870
Think carefully again.

618
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,470
Was this the brand logo

619
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,620
on the gloves

620
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,840
of your attacker?

621
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,110
Yes.

622
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,150
Isn't the red tick Nike's logo?

623
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,790
But just now,

624
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,030
our colleagues have verified that

625
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,960
Nike has never produced

626
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,940
the type of

627
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,660
worker safety gloves you described.

628
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,250
It's okay, Ms. Guo.

629
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,640
Please think carefully again.

630
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,920
Try to recall

631
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,270
if there are any more details.

632
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,370
I remember the glove

633
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,840
was a bit worn out.

634
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,590
There were many broken parts.

635
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,190
Ms. Guo,

636
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,610
here.

637
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,410
Take a look.

638
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,670
Did the hand

639
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,370
that attacked you appear

640
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,080
at this angle?

641
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,150
Yes.

642
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,270
Yes.

643
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,350
That's right.

644
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,200
So,

645
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,380
you filled in the gaps with your imagination

646
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,500
and imagined it as

647
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,430
a red checkmark.

648
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,470
Now I need you

649
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,750
to continue to recall.

650
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
What other angles did you see

651
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,010
the gloves' logo from?

652
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,050
I can try to reconstruct it.

653
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,010
How did it go?

654
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,610
I asked around,

655
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,690
but no one knows this Li Hong.

656
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,430
Let's go.

657
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,590
Give me that.

658
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,320
Sir,

659
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,960
do you often collect things here?

660
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,890
What do you want?

661
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,690
Can't you see I'm busy?

662
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:25,870
Here's the thing.

663
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,290
We're looking for someone.

664
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,240
Do you know

665
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,440
someone named Li Hong?

666
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,040
Li Hong who?

667
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,510
I don't know.

668
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,270
She used to collect things here too.

669
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,030
Take a look.

670
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,060
Isn't that

671
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,190
the hunchbacked woman?

672
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,710
You know her?

673
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,390
I don't know her.

674
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,600
Haven't seen her in a long time.

675
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,740
Maybe she quit.

676
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,000
Why are you looking for her?

677
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,170
Well,

678
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,910
she's a relative of ours.

679
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,680
We suddenly lost contact with her.

680
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,700
We're worried something happened,

681
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,510
so we came out to look for her.

682
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,810
Or do you know

683
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,600
if she might be

684
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,750
collecting things somewhere else?

685
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,020
I don't know. I really don't know!

686
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,070
Don't bother me.

687
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,670
Grandpa,

688
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,940
our family is really worried about her.

689
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,440
We've been looking for a long time but can't find her.

690
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,770
Please tell me.

691
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,300
Alright.

692
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,430
I'll check in the group for you.

693
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,350
There's a group?

694
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,110
Nice acting.

695
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,500
Got it.

696
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,530
That's on Kaifang Street.

697
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,740
She collected cans there.

698
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,640
And on Chunzhi Road,

699
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,260
she even found some good stuff.

700
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,750
There's more.

701
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,720
She's been to that old district.

702
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,460
There's a chemical plant there.

703
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,750
There was an accident there,

704
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,660
so we all avoid it,

705
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,950
but she's been there.

706
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,410
That's all.

707
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,470
Thank you.

708
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,030
Thanks.

709
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:05,580
Thank you, sir.

710
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,790
(Kaifang Street) (Chunzhi Road) (Hongda Chemical Plant)

711
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,570
I think that's the

712
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,680
hunchbacked woman, right?

713
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,250
She used to come here often.

714
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,350
I even told her

715
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,590
this place had an accident before.

716
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,020
The factory has been abandoned for so long.

717
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,310
There's nothing valuable left here,

718
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,440
but she wouldn't listen.

719
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,310
She insisted on coming in,

720
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,640
so I just let her be.

721
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,200
Have you seen her recently?

722
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,440
No, I haven't.

723
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,140
Thank you.

724
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:36,710
No problem.

725
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,670
Based on Guo Yuan's

726
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,150
description of the gloves worn by the killer,

727
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,950
I've reconstructed the logo on them.

728
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:50,550
(Hongda)

729
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,310
They're worker safety gloves from Hongda Chemical Plant.
(Hongda)

730
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,520
(Hongda)

731
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,050
I have another question.

732
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,980
What was the name of this plant

733
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,980
before it was abandoned?

734
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,120
Hongda.

735
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,600
Hongda Chemical Plant.
