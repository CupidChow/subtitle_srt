00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,070
(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,979
(Episode 13)

3
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,140
Something's happened.

4
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,060
The fire trucks are here.

5
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,390
Whose house is it?

6
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,820
Excuse me.

7
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,270
Please, make way.

8
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,370
Excuse me, thank you.

9
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,910
Are you sure there are

10
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,830
hydrogen storage tanks

11
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,570
inside?

12
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,090
Yes.

13
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,600
What do you suggest?

14
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,270
If there really are

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,330
hydrogen storage tanks inside,

16
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,510
if there's an explosion,

17
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,940
the massive shockwave created instantly

18
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,060
will have unimaginable consequences.

19
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,590
Come, let's die together!

20
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,400
Come!

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,740
Let's die together!

22
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,780
The door is locked!

23
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,420
The door is locked.

24
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,520
Huang Tao, calm down.

25
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,120
Calm down.

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,190
I'll tell you the truth.

27
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,450
Ruan Fangfang.

28
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,230
All along,

29
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,310
this was just a show

30
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,160
that you put on.

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,480
Huang Tao,

32
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,260
you've been deceived by her.

33
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,070
There was never any molestation.

34
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,570
Back then,

35
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,430
she was the one who instigated you to set the fire.

36
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,040
She was found by Dong Yidan first,

37
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,030
which led to you being tracked down.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,090
But she's been lying to you all along.

39
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,590
Because she's afraid

40
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,800
of facing fear alone.

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,430
That's why she

42
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,579
keeps using others.

43
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,340
Acting as the victim

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,100
is her

45
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,480
only way of survival.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,440
We'll evacuate the crowd.

47
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,340
I'll leave the rest to you.

48
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,630
Everyone, disperse.

49
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,410
Go away.

50
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:15,990
Go! Go!

51
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,540
Go that way.

52
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,060
Captain Cheng.

53
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,310
The last location

54
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,230
Mr. Shen's phone signal appeared

55
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,510
was Ruan Fangfang's studio.

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,380
You should leave too.

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,930
Okay.

58
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,510
Is it true?

59
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,630
Yes.

60
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,230
I saw

61
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,690
you came back and locked the door.

62
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,690
For you,

63
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,680
I didn't say anything until the end.

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,440
I was sentenced to seven years.

65
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,170
It's not like that.

66
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,970
How could I possibly use you?

67
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,180
We agreed

68
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,490
to be together forever.

69
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,860
You love me.

70
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,960
You asked me to carve the name.

71
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,890
We promised

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,210
we won't be separated.

73
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,310
But you two are not

74
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,150
relying on each other.

75
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,400
Because she's not like you.

76
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,909
She has no emotions.

77
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,159
She doesn't love you at all.

78
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,280
No, Huang Tao.

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,250
How could I not love you?

80
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,480
I love you.

81
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,960
We agreed

82
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,150
to go to a place

83
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,610
where there's no one else.

84
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,250
Huang Tao,

85
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,850
let's go.

86
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,970
After today,

87
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,230
we'll be free.

88
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,350
Huang Tao,

89
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,580
think about it.

90
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,600
You didn't betray her even when you went to prison.

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,540
You're just one of her

92
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,750
qualified trophies.

93
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,070
She's not worth you risking your life

94
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,790
to protect.

95
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,640
If this continues,

96
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,570
she will do everything

97
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,070
to shatter your autonomy

98
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,170
and consume your soul.

99
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,030
By then, it will be too late!

100
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,040
It's not like that.

101
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,650
it's not like that.

102
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,010
It's not like that.

103
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,310
He…

104
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,940
He assaulted me.

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,360
It's not like that.

106
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,040
You've been like this from the beginning.

107
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,880
How could I not have realized?

108
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,870
If it was just a prank,

109
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,400
why did you actually set the fire?

110
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,340
Did you find it thrilling?

111
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
Fun?

112
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,810
You've always been like this,

113
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,060
threatening me with your life.

114
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,150
What have I done?

115
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,070
I just wanted to save you.

116
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,530
So in your heart,

117
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,560
whether it's me

118
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,490
or Hao Ziqiang,

119
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,150
we're all just empty shells beneath your feet,

120
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,690
right?

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,210
If I didn't love you,

122
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,760
what meaning

123
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,630
would our pain

124
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,040
and life and death have?

125
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,960
Huang Tao.

126
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,430
You all are guilty.

127
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,340
Go to hell.

128
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,560
You all are guilty.

129
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,630
Hao Ziqiang.

130
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,720
Here!

131
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,320
We...

132
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,870
are each other's

133
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,830
meaning.

134
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,610
Don't move!

135
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,590
Is anyone there?

136
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,030
Open the door!

137
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,990
Is anyone there?

138
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,990
Let us out!

139
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,050
Open the door!

140
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,580
It's going to explode!

141
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,340
What are you doing?

142
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,210
Don't come over.

143
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,430
What are you doing?

144
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,240
Are you satisfied now?

145
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,910
Ae you satisfied?

146
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,650
Are you satisfied?

147
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,770
Ruan Fangfang.

148
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,429
Come.

149
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,179
Give me the lighter.

150
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,630
It's not too late.

151
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,860
Step back!

152
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,660
Open the door!

153
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,890
Open the door!

154
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,110
What have you done

155
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,880
to a good person?

156
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,390
Look.

157
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,320
What have I done wrong?

158
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,130
Then let's all die!

159
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,860
Ruan Fangfang!

160
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,710
Du Cheng!

161
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,160
Du Cheng!

162
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,700
Du Cheng, are you alright?

163
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,610
Catch her!

164
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,810
Du Cheng, are you okay?

165
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,750
Hurry!

166
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,850
Everyone, run that way!

167
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,420
Quick, go!

168
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,290
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

169
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,810
Du Cheng.

170
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,670
Why didn't you

171
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,440
contact the team immediately?

172
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,220
Ruan Fangfang snatched my phone

173
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,630
and threw it under the electric kiln.

174
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,870
I didn't have time

175
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,610
to contact you then.

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,940
Did you think about

177
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,070
what would have happened

178
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:50,810
if I hadn't arrived in time?

179
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,270
Have you thought about

180
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,270
what would've happened

181
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,710
if I hadn't

182
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,640
caught that lighter?

183
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,400
I can't guarantee

184
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,680
that I'll always arrive in time.

185
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,110
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,050
I'll accept any punishment from the team.

187
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,490
Where are you going?

188
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,280
Shen Yi.

189
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,710
Shen Yi!

190
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,010
We've figured it out.

191
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,970
After examining the scene,

192
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,830
we indeed found

193
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,940
a hidden

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,910
emergency exit behind the internet cafe.

195
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,020
Combining the testimonies of Huang Tao and Hao Ziqiang,

196
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,720
Ruan Fangfang did indeed

197
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,880
have a backup plan from the beginning.

198
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,990
She planned to use them to ignite the gasoline,

199
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,960
cause chaos,

200
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,070
and escape before the explosion.

201
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,900
Really?

202
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,730
It seems my judgment wasn't wrong.

203
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,160
Ruan Fangfang indeed wouldn't choose to die together with them.

204
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Yes.

205
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,890
You were right all along.

206
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,700
I really shouldn't have acted on my own.

207
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,570
If I had predicted this earlier,

208
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,170
this wouldn't have happened.

209
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,680
We

210
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,270
are police officers.

211
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,190
Police officers don't just

212
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,320
rely on predictions to prevent crimes.

213
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,350
When I approached Ruan Fangfang,

214
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,430
I discovered that the pottery

215
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,830
she collected and fired was all

216
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,340
black in color,

217
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:24,760
which was distinctly different

218
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,870
(Gate of Hell Color Card extracted)
which was distinctly different

219
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,430
from the vibrant colors
(Gate of Hell Color Card extracted)

220
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,390
used by other students.
(Gate of Hell Color Card extracted)

221
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:27,890
(Gate of Hell Color Card extracted)

222
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,810
Her color preference and works

223
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,530
suggested a subconscious

224
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,720
appreciation and externalization

225
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,960
of criminal achievements.

226
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,500
Based on this suspicion,

227
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,740
I conducted a House-Tree-Person test on her

228
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,270
using clay sculptures.

229
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,820
The test results indicated

230
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,330
that she has a criminal personality.

231
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,390
The House-Tree-Person test

232
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,760
can indeed help us

233
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,790
conduct

234
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,320
criminal psychological analysis

235
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,210
on some mentally strong

236
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,880
and extreme criminals.

237
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,990
It was used in the

238
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,980
silver case before,

239
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,850
but this was the first time

240
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,940
it was used with clay sculptures

241
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,170
when the criminal was unaware.

242
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,220
Moreover, using color to infer

243
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,980
a criminal's consciousness

244
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,950
is an approach that is

245
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,690
highly innovative.

246
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,020
Shen Yi

247
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,950
isn't just satisfied with

248
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,870
reconstructing suspect profiles now.

249
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,270
He's organically combining

250
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,170
the two techniques

251
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,490
of art and psychology.

252
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,850
He reopened the Haispeed Internet Cafe arson case

253
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,340
from eight years ago

254
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,870
and uncovered the mastermind behind it.

255
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,180
In my opinion,

256
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,390
this case

257
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,060
is worth an in-depth discussion.

258
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,690
This tragedy was averted

259
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,830
partly because we

260
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,270
discovered that Hao Ziqiang and Huang Tao

261
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,500
had purchased large amounts of hydrogen,

262
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,500
allowing us to arrive at the scene in time to stop the crime.

263
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,640
On the other hand,

264
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,780
Shen Yi's House-Tree-Person test

265
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
deduced Ruan Fangfang's antisocial personality,

266
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,680
which supported our prediction.

267
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,120
Shen Yi's research is a good supplement,

268
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,030
but I believe

269
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,380
solving cases must rely on objective evidence.

270
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,270
Psychological tests

271
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:47,950
cannot…

272
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,870
I'm sorry.

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,870
Du Cheng here

274
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,380
was talking about investigative concepts.

275
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,000
As for Shen Yi,

276
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,190
he told me before

277
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,240
that he can use art and psychology

278
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,910
to conduct

279
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,190
criminal personality analysis

280
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,120
and explore a new crime investigation method.

281
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,420

If he hadn't taken the initiative

286
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,550
to approach the suspect,

287
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,430
I'm afraid that even now,

288
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,350
we wouldn't know

289
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,510
who the mastermind behind this case

290
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,520
really was.

295

in the investigation process,

296
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,300
but also provided a more

297
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,490
effective approach

298
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,360
during our interrogation,

299
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,670
which allowed us to find

300
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,040
the flaws in the story

301

Shen Yi,

303
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,990
the city bureau will likely

304
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,070
need to invite you more often

305
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,870
to participate in solving difficult cases in the future.

306
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,510
Are you interested in joining the city bureau?

307
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,160
Assisting you is fine,

308
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,230
but the transfer can be discussed later.

309
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,220
Right?

310
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,290
Yes.

311
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,370
Summarizing also requires case studies.

312
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,920
I can't do it without the support

313

Don't tell me it's a mistress who got married.

whether to call the cops or not,

I'm sorry.

347
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,280
I never really meant

348
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,780
to hurt Jingjing.

349
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,070

and about to get married,

352
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,560
I just felt upset.

353
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,540
I was jealous of her.

355
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,520

361
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Shouldn't you also hope

362
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,270
that she's doing well too?

363
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,780
Yes.

364
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,930
I really just acted on impulse.

365
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,870
I was being stubborn.

366
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,100
I was hot-headed.

367
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,740
That's why I did such a thing.

368
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,150
But what kind of person

369
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,270
would hang a bloody chicken head

370
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,410

had conflicts in the past,

375
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,710
it doesn't justify doing something like this.

Yes,

good lives.

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,430

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,710
were always good, weren't they?

386
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,150
No matter how difficult the days are,

387
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,150
you still have to get through them.

388
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,480
Right, child?

389
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,050
Mr. Yan,

390
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,620
I really know I was wrong.

391
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,540
Please forgive me, Mr. Yan.

392
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,030
Well,

393
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,350
this letter of understanding...

394
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,550
It's so shiny.

395
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,480
Ao Li and I were classmates.

396
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,950
How did it come to this?

397
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,330
Don't worry.

398
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,430
Your dad

399
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,870
is mediating with her right now.

400
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,880
It will definitely be resolved.

401
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:04,940
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)
It will definitely be resolved.

402
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,630
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

403
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,230
Thank you.

404
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,790
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

405
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,360
You sent Ao Li a wedding invitation.
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

406
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,910
It was out of goodwill.

407
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,620
She's the one who's not right in the head.

408
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,650
If she dares to do anything bad,

409
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,870
Mr. Yan and I will protect you.

410
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,230
And don't forget about me.

411
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,640
They're here.

412
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,260
Jingjing,

413
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,210
I'm sorry.

414
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,180
I...

415
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,800
I shouldn't have done that to you.

416
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,750
I caused you

417
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,070
emotional distress.

418
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,850
I'm truly sorry.

419
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,300
I will never

420
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,030
do it again.

421
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,700
Please forgive me,

422
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,990
will you?

423
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,830
This is the letter of understanding

424
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,990
issued by the police station.

425
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,240
According to the regulations,

426
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,810
if there are no issues,

427
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,210
you two can sign it.

428
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,410
However,

429
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,850
this matter

430
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,250
is for you two to decide.

431
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,150
Ao Li,

432
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,950
do you really hate me that much?

433
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,400
No.

434
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,190
I hate myself.

435
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,090
Compared to a letter of understanding,

436
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,400
what I care about more is

437
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,490
that you don't be angry at me anymore.

438
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,400
Please.

439
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,670
Thank you, Jingjing.

440
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,720
When you get married,

441
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,670
I'll definitely give you

442
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,570
the biggest red envelope.

443
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,350
Thank you.

444
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,030
That's not necessary.

445
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,340
I wish you a happy marriage in advance.

446
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,830
Child,

447
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,590
this kind of thing

448
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,830
absolutely cannot happen again.

449
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,510
Understand?

450
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,240
Please see her out.

451
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,120
Yifan.

452
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,640
Come home earlier

453
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,640
after work these days.

454
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,150
You need to take good care of her.

455
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,820
Of course.

456
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,520
Don't worry.

457
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,880
Yan.

458
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,870
Jingjing is here too?

459
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,530
I'll be away for two days.

460
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,260
What's wrong? Did something happen?

461
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,100
No.

462
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,060
Regarding Ruan Fangfang's case,

463
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,960
the higher-ups want to hold

464
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,490
a comprehensive summary meeting.

465
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,630
Director Zhang insists that I go.

466
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,170
Go ahead, don't worry.

467
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,850
Keep an eye on Shen Yi for me.

468
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,600
Jingjing,

469
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,240
congratulations on your marriage.

470
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,580
Thank you.

471
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,600
You can go back now.

472
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,800
Mr. Shen,

473
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,910
let me tell you about

474
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,960
something really strange

475
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,350
that happened to me.

476
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,830
What is it?

477
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,330
My dad

478
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,950
lost his watch.

479
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,610
I bought

480
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,910
this watch for him with

481
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,520
my first paycheck.

482
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,840
Although it's not worth much,

483
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,980
it means a lot

484
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,240
to my dad.

485
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,740
He feels guilty about losing it,

486
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,680
and because of this guilt,

487
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,440
he can't sleep at night.

488
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,440
He's constantly having insomnia.

489
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,830
Was it stolen?

490
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,630
No way.

491
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,190
Absolutely not.

492
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,170
You can't even imagine

493
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,570
how cheap this watch is.

494
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,690
A thief wouldn't steal it.

495
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,870
You can't be sure about that.

496
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,480
Even if the watch is cheap,

497
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,060
what if the thief doesn't know about watches?

498
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,110
You should ask your dad

499
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,750
to try and remember

500
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,940
his route that day.

501
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,490
If he could remember,

502
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,030
why would I come to you?

503
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,110
So,

504
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,510
why did you come to me?

505
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,110
Could you draw it for me?

506
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,740
Use your magic pen

507
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,330
to reveal the truth.

508
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,490
Jiang Feng,

509
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,800
sketching

510
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,410
is a technical method.

511
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,150
Using it to help find your dad's watch

512
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,470
is something I've never tried before.

513
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,370
Well,

514
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,140
should I draw a watch

515
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,340
or a map?

516
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,330
Draw both.

517
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,710
Maybe we'll develop a new technique.

518
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,270
Alright, alright.

519
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,860
Go ahead and develop it.

520
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,540
Stop causing trouble and leave.

521
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,550
For this matter,

522
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,270
you should

523
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,630
go to the local police station with your dad

524
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,410
and file a report.

525
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,670
I am the police.

526
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,850
Why would I file a report?

527
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,310
Fine.

528
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,160
Jiang Feng,

529
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,410
since the watch is so cheap,

530
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,200
why don't you just buy another one?

531
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,260
That's right.

532
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,680
The watch is so cheap,

533
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,490
I'll buy a new one for him

534
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,220
and tell him it's been found. Wouldn't that work?

535
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,610
You're the expert at capturing traces.

536
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,350
Sketch artist detective extraordinaire.

537
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,120
Okay, just go now.

538
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,030
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

539
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,640
Troublemaker.

540
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,230
Mr. Shen,

541
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,130
let me tell you,

542
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,030
his matter isn't serious at all.

543
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,280
I have something important.

544
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,750
Can you give me some advice?

545
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,040
Did you lose something too?

546
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,880
No,

547
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,940
it's about Yan's daughter,

548
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,970
Jingjing.

549
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,340
Yes, I heard about it.

550
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,670
How is it?

551
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,520
Is she okay?

552
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,040
She's fine

553
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,110
and she's already written a letter of understanding.

554
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,550
The person who did this

555
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,560
is named Ao Li.

556
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,740
She said it was because she was jealous of Jingjing,

557
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,140
but she's actually

558
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,670
a somewhat famous internet celebrity.

559
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,820
Her income is much higher than Jingjing's.

560
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,530
Let me show you her livestream.

561
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,740
Look, it's this one.

562
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,010
(Come On, Ao Li)

563
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,830
She and Jingjing were college classmates

564
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,240
and they were roommates too.

565
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,150
They studied garden design.

566
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,820
After graduation,

567
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,500
they both joined the same company.

568
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,130
They used to be good friends,

569
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,350
but later,

570
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,490
Jingjing started dating Luo Yifan.

571
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,110
It seems Ao Li also had

572
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,190
some interest in Luo Yifan.

573
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,430
The three of them became

574
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,580
(Come On, Ao Li)
The three of them became

575
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:57,600
(Come On, Ao Li)

576
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,030
something like a love triangle.
(Come On, Ao Li)

577
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,380
Later, Ao Li made a big scene,

578
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,140
and the two of them fell out.

579
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,070
So now, you think

580
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,490
this matter might not be over?

581
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,250
You're worried

582
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,930
she did this for other reasons?

583
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,870
So I wanted to discuss this

584
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,890
with you.

585
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,700
(Come On, Ao Li)

586
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,890
Look into this pendant.

587
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,020
I can't find the same model.

588
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,020
Is there a problem?

589
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,680
It's custom-made?

590
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,770
Or did she make it herself?

591
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,990
Give me your phone.

592
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,530
This is the symbol on Ao Li's badge.

593
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,200
I've further broken it down

594
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,310
into these elements.

595
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,830
A woman,

596
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,180
the moon,

597
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,240
a snake,

598
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,470
and an owl?

599
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,900
Is there any special meaning after these symbols

600
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,060
are combined?

601
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,690
It refers to

602
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,300
the first woman created

603
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,130
in Western legends,

604
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,680
Lilith.

605
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,670
But there are many versions

606
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,640
of legends about her.

607
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,200
For example,

608
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,790
one ancient saying goes

609
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,780
that Lilith was

610
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,460
created at the same time as Adam

611
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,370
and was also Adam's first wife.

612
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,850
But unlike Eve,

613
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,680
Lilith was unwilling

614
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,090
to submit to such an arrangement.

615
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,340
She escaped from the Garden of Eden.

616
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,840
There's also a legend

617
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,350
that portrays the evil serpent

618
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,360
that tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit

619
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,980
as an incarnation of Lilith.

620
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,070
There's even a legend

621
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,980
that Lilith is a moon demon

622
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,340
who would lure children

623
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,800
at night

624
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,130
and kill them.

625
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,940
Do you want some late-night snacks?

626
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,030
You scared me to death!

627
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,620
Mr. Shen, let's continue.

628
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,170
Ignore him.

629
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,100
Thank you.

630
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,100
As for Lilith,

631
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,740
she doesn't have a fixed image.

632
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,400
In different versions of the legends,

633
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,670
she has been mixed with many different

634
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,090
mystical beliefs.

635
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,770
Take this as an example.

636
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,210
This is a work from over a hundred years ago

637
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,900
by Dante Gabriel Rossetti,

638
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,230
"Lady Lilith."

639
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,970
The woman in the painting,

640
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,440
with her thick, long hair,

641
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,870
her expression and posture,

642
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,100
all carry strong sexual allure.

643
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,710
This indicates that

644
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,520
in the Victorian era,

645
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,240
Lilith represented a woman

646
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,610
focused on her own beauty,

647
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,420
with a hint of narcissism.

648
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,870
But in modern times,

649
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,390
because Lilith was the first

650
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,400
demon or god

651
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,600
to rebel against patriarchy,

652
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,840
to rebel against the duties imposed on women,

653
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,910
she is now more often seen

654
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,510
as a symbol of the awakening

655
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,560
of women's personal power.

656
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,920
In short,

657
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,230
regardless of the era

658
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,440
or version of the legend,

659
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,160
Lilith always represented

660
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,930
temptation

661
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,330
and revenge.

662
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,180
So you're saying

663
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,680
that Ao Li likes these kinds of

664
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,790
mysterious and slightly evil things,

665
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,060
which is why

666
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,730
she wears such a badge.

667
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,880
Is that what you mean?

668
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,010
It's possible.

669
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,130
You're all still at work?

670
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,060
Talking about Ao Li, I suppose?

671
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,270
Carry on.

672
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,320
So, I speculate

673
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,350
that the elements in the badge

674
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,160
might be projecting

675
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,420
her inner darkness

676
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,630
and aggressiveness.

677
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,530
Darkness and aggressiveness?

678
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,530
I've always felt that

679
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,890
for a young girl like Ao Li,

680
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,740
having some jealousy

681
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,340
and extreme thoughts is quite normal.

682
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:58,790
Besides,

683
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,100
she knows my profession.

684
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,170
She probably wouldn't dare to do anything to Jingjing.

685
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,950
But we still need to know

686
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,080
what exactly she's planning to do

687
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,650
or what triggered her, right?

688
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,840
Well, well, well...

689
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,280
As for what she'll do next,

690
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,310
I really can't easily

691
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,120
make a judgment based on my current understanding.

692
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,390
How about this?

693
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,400
Anyway,

694
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,110
I have more days off recently.

695
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,350
I'll switch my shift

696
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,090
to get consecutive days off

697
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,390
and visit Ao Li's company.

698
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,660
I'll take it as experiencing a different life.

699
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,520
What for?

700
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,730
To become a female streamer?

701
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,820
Is it appropriate for you to go to such a place?

702
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,400
Is that a place you can go to?

703
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,210
Don't forget you're a female police officer.

704
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,370
If anyone should go, it should be me.

705
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,780
I took dance classes for three years when I was young.

706
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,240
I can go there to dance.

707
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,230
During this period,

708
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:46,990
our unit doesn't have much going on.

709
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,890
I can go after work.

710
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,800
If anything happens,

711
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,020
I'll report to you immediately.

712
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,270
How should I put it?

713
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,070
I should also do something

714
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,750
for Jingjing.

715
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,110
But...

716
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,990
It's settled then.

717
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,070
Shen Yi,

718
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,390
Yan,

719
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,540
Li Han,

720
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,620
leave it to me.

721
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,260
As expected from a sports college graduate.

722
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,670
When I saw you doing a test

723
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,070
just now in the livestream,

724
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,550
I'm sure those muscles of yours

725
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,580
will definitely be a hit.

726
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,540
Look,

727
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,320
here in my company,

728
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,550
we have about a hundred

729
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,840
livestreaming rooms like this.

730
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,070
Correspondingly, we have

731
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,070
over a hundred female streamers.

732
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,820
The competition is quite fierce.

733
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,590
But for male streamers,

734
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,600
we currently have less than 20.

735
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,020
If it weren't for

736
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,220
handsome male streamers

737
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,100
suddenly becoming a hot trend,

738
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,280
I wouldn't have planned to recruit anyone.

739
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,490
You just happened to catch this opportunity.

740
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,380
Thank you.

741
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,780
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

742
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,070
You're welcome.

743
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,010
There's even someone playing the guzheng here?

744
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,500
We have all kinds of streamers.

745
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,070
It's mainly based on market demand.

746
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,400
By the way, boss.

747
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,090
Does our company

748
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,630
have a female streamer

749
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,180
named Ao Li?

750
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,800
You've just arrived and already want to ride on someone's coattails

751
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,700
to gain popularity, huh?

752
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,170
You've got quite a clear agenda, kid.

753
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,020
No,

754
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,830
I've heard about her before.

755
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,910
She's quite popular.

756
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,730
I just want to learn from her,

757
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,460
so I can make money faster.

758
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,260
Very good.

759
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,470
I wouldn't even consider someone

760
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,470
without ambition.

761
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,700
Besides, being content with little

762
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,950
doesn't suit our industry either.

763
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,630
You won't make it to the trending list.

764
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,290
Ao Li's streaming room is up ahead.

765
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,040
Follow me.

766
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,920
Welcome.

767
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,370
Welcome all the lovely viewers

768
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,210
to Ao Li's livestream.

769
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,440
Welcome, everyone.

770
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,930
Please help by following me.

771
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,860
Like, comment, and share with one click.

772
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,620
Feel free to join my fan group.

773
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,550
Love you all.

774
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,550
Me?

775
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,860
I'm a talent streamer.

776
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,660
I do dancing, fitness, and such.

777
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,890
Ao Li.

778
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,910
It's nothing.

779
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,550
I'm just...

780
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,880
She used to be quite popular.

781
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,310
Fans would come every day

782
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,090
to the company to give her gifts.

783
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,410
Those nouveau riche bosses

784
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,200
were indeed quite generous.

785
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,440
What happened to her?

786
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,460
She's been streaming non-stop, day and night.

787
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,920
She's developed a bit of myocarditis.

788
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,000
Myocarditis?

789
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,910
She has myocarditis and still won't rest?

790
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,210
What are you thinking?

791
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,060
She's not as popular as she used to be.

792
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,690
She feels the crisis herself.

793
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,820
She's an old face, you know.

794
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,890
The rich men will eventually get tired of seeing her.

795
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,660
Who doesn't want to support new girls?

796
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,520
Welcome.

797
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,770
So,

798
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,240
Ao Li keeps streaming all day,

799
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,540
trying to attract new fans and increase her following.

800
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,810
How else can she make money?

801
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,040
Now that she's sick,

802
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:07,830
it's perfect for her

803
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,180
to play the sympathy card.

804
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,300
It's good.

805
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,930
How's Ao Li doing today?

806
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,460
Only gained ten followers.

807
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,940
That's too few.

808
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,020
Let me see.

809
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,140
(Come On, Ao Li)

810
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,030
Yes.
(Come On, Ao Li)

811
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,070
(Come On, Ao Li)

812
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,240
There was a period before when I
(Come On, Ao Li)

813
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,630
(Come On, Ao Li)

814
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,630
streamed twice a day.
(Come On, Ao Li)

815
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,230
(Come On, Ao Li)

816
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,270
It was quite exhausting.
(Come On, Ao Li)

817
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,290
(Come On, Ao Li)

818
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,410
I was really pushing myself.
(Come On, Ao Li)

819
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,770
But I had no choice.

820
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,670
At that time, my boyfriend was

821
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,950
studying for his master's degree abroad

822
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,630
and he needed a lot of money.

823
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,170
And then?

824
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,700
And then...

825
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,560
(Come On, Ao Li)

826
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,350
I guess you all can

827
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,020
probably

828
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,600
figure out what happened.

829
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,070
Yeah.

830
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,630
At that time, I was just...

831
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,540
At that time, I was just

832
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,750
too naive.

833
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,100
What she's talking about,

834
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,300
when did it happen?

835
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,330
It's not true.

836
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,790
This is all a trick.

837
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,110
(Come On, Ao Li)

838
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,429
It's a bit cliché,
(Come On, Ao Li)

839
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,469
(Come On, Ao Li)

840
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,670
but for these rich men,
(Come On, Ao Li)

841
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,500
it's quite effective.

842
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,150
Look,

843
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:44,969
they're sending gifts now.

844
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,940
Thank you.

845
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,040
Thank you.

846
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,139
You can do this?

847
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,280
Thank you.

848
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,400
After this, Ao Li will persuade

849
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,320
these men

850
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,750
not to send gifts.

851
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,310
But these men

852
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,570
will send gifts like crazy.

853
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,260
What are you guys doing?

854
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,400
Men, you know.

855
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,800
Competitive

856
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,750
and try to outdo each other.

857
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:02,950
(Come On, Ao Li)

858
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,750
Please stop sending gifts.
(Come On, Ao Li)

859
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,800
(Come On, Ao Li)

860
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,310
You're making it seem like

861
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,110
I'm playing the sympathy card.

862
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,480
It's really rare for me

863
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,230
to speak from my heart.

864
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:12,910
(Come On, Ao Li)

865
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,670
Really, please stop.
(Come On, Ao Li)

866
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,550
(Come On, Ao Li)

867
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,280
If you keep doing this,
(Come On, Ao Li)

868
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,310
(Come On, Ao Li)

869
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,710
I won't share anymore in the future.
(Come On, Ao Li)

870
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,250
(Come On, Ao Li)

871
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,350
Seriously.

872
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,870
Before?

873
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,320
I've actually only been in

874
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,750
this one relationship.

875
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,900
I haven't dated anyone since then.

876
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:30,620
But now that I have you guys,

877
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,780
(Come On, Ao Li)
But now that I have you guys,

878
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:32,810
(Come On, Ao Li)

879
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,200
I only believe in you.
(Come On, Ao Li)

880
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,880
You want to take care of me?

881
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,170
Really?

882
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm not easy to take care of, you know.

883
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,030
Because I'm

884
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,810
a scratcher.

885
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,060
Do I need to do this too?

886
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,650
This can only retain existing fans,

887
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,830
not attract new ones.

888
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,090
Tell Ao Li to end her stream.

889
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,490
Ask her to come see me.

890
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,450
Okay.

891
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,560
Currently, this is how

892
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,550
the livestreaming industry is.

893
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,820
You don't need to overthink it.

894
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:11,940
Just boldly follow our lead

895
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,610
and you'll be fine.

896
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,970
Here comes my little wild cat.

897
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,050
You've worked hard.

898
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,040
Who's this?

899
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,830
A newcomer.

900
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,810
He'll start streaming tomorrow.

901
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,850
Ms. Ao Li,

902
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,640
hello.

903
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,010
I'm Feng.

904
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,370
Please take care of me in the future.

905
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,110
You've got good looks.

906
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,150
Can I squeeze you?

907
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,700
Squeeze where?

908
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,830
Where do you want me to squeeze?

909
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,340
Cute.

910
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,150
Mr. Liu, you've still

911
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,460
got a good taste in people.

912
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,290
Sit.

913
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,400
Have a seat.

914
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,750
If it weren't for Mr. Liu supporting me back then,

915
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,270
I wouldn't have

916
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,470
the number of fans I have now.

917
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,880
From now on, just follow Mr. Liu

918
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,590
and work hard.

919
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,570
Thank you for the reminder, Ms. Ao Li.

920
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,670
I certainly will.

921
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,010
Alright,

922
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,350
let's get down to business.

923
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,510
The four-person on-demand model

924
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,570
is very popular recently.

925
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,460
You've been working so hard to attract new users,

926
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,880
but the results aren't great.

927
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,320
Do you want to give it a try?

928
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,120
Are you asking me to

929
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,050
do a livestream with the newcomers

930
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,310
where viewers can

931
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,480
request a dance for just one yuan?

932
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,560
That's right.

933
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,600
Entering the lower-tier market will create more buzz,

934
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,480
and it also suits your

935
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,070
current strategy of playing the sympathy card.

936
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,170
What do you think?

937
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,500
Mr. Liu,

938
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,110
over these years,

939
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,940
you've helped me so much.

940
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,520
Whether I succeed in attracting new fans or not,

941
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,430
helping the company promote newcomers

942
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,670
is the right thing to do.

943
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,590
If it weren't for you,

944
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,400
how could I have

945
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,710
millions of fans now?

946
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,070
Without the company,

947
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,460
there wouldn't be the Ao Li of today.

948
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,650
I'll do whatever you say.

949
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,890
Just arrange it as you see fit.

950
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,580
Hearing you say that,

951
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,030
I really feel that...

952
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,600
You're still the most

953
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,350
obedient one.

954
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,070
No need to be so formal with me.

955
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,760
Stop it, there's an outsider here.

956
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,900
It's okay, it's okay.

957
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,510
Well,

958
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,010
I've joined the company too, right?

959
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,400
I-I'm one of you now.

960
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,330
Please, carry on.

961
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,280
Ignore me.

962
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,530
I'm just air.

963
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,070
In the future,

964
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,600
learn more from Ao Li.

965
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,670
Has your cough gotten better?

966
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,990
I've been so worried about you.

967
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,130
Let me say this first.

968
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,930
I can help the company attract new users,

969
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,600
but you have to remember...

970
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,380
Okay, okay, okay.

971
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,480
I'm here.

972
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,890
Orange Americano and fresh coconut latte.

973
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,890
Which one would you like?

974
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,160
I'll have the fresh coconut latte.

975
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,190
Oh, let me introduce you.

976
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,400
This is my father's colleague,

977
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,790
a famous sketch artist from Beijiang,

978
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,490
Mr. Shen Yi.

979
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,460
Hello.

980
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,330
Hello.

981
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,240
Jingjing,

982
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,410
you're in a good mood today.

983
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,670
Because I went shopping!

984
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,980
Preparing for the wedding is exhausting,

985
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,740
but shopping is so much fun!

986
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,150
Jingjing has been so worried about the wedding

987
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,310
she couldn't even sleep well.

988
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,930
But with today's exercise,

989
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,200
she should be able to get a good night's sleep.

990
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,140
What happened to your hand?

991
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,100
Yesterday, when I was cutting my nails,

992
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,000
I didn't do it properly.

993
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,800
I scratched myself while taking a shower.

994
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,120
How could you be so careless?

995
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,040
It's nothing.

996
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,830
You two,

997
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,380
don't overthink things lately.

998
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,950
With friends like us around,

999
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,870
she won't dare to do anything.

1000
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,680
But this person

1001
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,130
is quite peculiar.

1002
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,790
It's been so long since it happened,

1003
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,210
yet she's still holding a grudge.

1004
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,730
What happened before?

1005
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,610
It's quite a dramatic story, I guess.

1006
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,400
She and I used to be

1007
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,430
very close friends.

1008
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,690
Later,

1009
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,760
I really didn't expect

1010
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,040
she could do such a thing.

1011
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,730
She went behind my back to flirt with Yifan.

1012
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,150
That day,

1013
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,590
we were on a business trip

1014
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,850
and stayed in the same hotel.

1015
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,870
She said she had cholecystitis

1016
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,790
and was in severe pain,

1017
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,150
so she texted me,

1018
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,470
asking me to bring her

1019
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,150
a box of painkillers.

1020
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,820
At the time, I thought

1021
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,620
she asked me to go

1022
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,960
because Jingjing wasn't there.

1023
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,770
That's why I agreed.

1024
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,480
Yifan did call me to ask about it.

1025
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,010
At the time, I thought

1026
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,190
he was the team leader,

1027
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,830
so it was normal for a leader

1028
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,900
to check on team members.

1029
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,440
Thinking about it now,

1030
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,160
if he hadn't told me

1031
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,870
about this in advance,

1032
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,630
this misunderstanding would've been much worse.

1033
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,100
Ao Li.

1034
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,690
Ao Li, what are you doing?

1035
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,950
What?

1036
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,400
Do whatever you want.

1037
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,390
Ao Li.

1038
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,350
Ao Li, don't do this.

1039
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,050
Ao Li,

1040
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,770
don't do this.

1041
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,540
Ao Li!

1042
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,800
How could you do such a thing?

1043
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,230
Don't go.

1044
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:49,850
Ao Li.

1045
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,720
Don't go.

1046
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,520
Please don't leave.

1047
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,510
What are you doing?

1048
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,550
Let go of me.

1049
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,590
Ao Li?

1050
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,150
Ao Li,

1051
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,630
you said you didn't want to eat,

1052
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,910
-so I bought you some fruit.
-Let go.

1053
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,470
What's going on here?

1054
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,800
Things aren't

1055
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,510
what you think.

1056
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,380
Ao Li,

1057
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,230
if you wanted to meet with Mr. Luo, you could have just done so.

1058
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,600
Why did you ask me to come?

1059
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,470
What a mess this is.

1060
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,230
Wait a moment.

1061
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,480
We need to clear this up.

1062
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,930
Otherwise, there will be a big misunderstanding.

1063
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,680
Misunderstanding?

1064
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,190
Originally, you dated me

1065
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,920
before you got together with Yan Jingjing.

1066
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,320
Ao Li,

1067
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,240
you asked me to come here to bring you medicine,

1068
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,630
and then you pounced on me.

1069
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,520
You deliberately called her here

1070
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,100
to set me up, didn't you?

1071
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,730
That female colleague

1072
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,510
was notorious

1073
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,950
for being a big gossip at the company.

1074
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,390
Ao Li did this

1075
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,310
to make her

1076
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,700
spread rumors in the company,

1077
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,360
so everyone would think

1078
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,260
Yifan was two-timing.

1079
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,470
And I

1080
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,770
would be seen as the homewrecker.

1081
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,230
This Ao Li

1082
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,350
was even willing to be caught by a colleague

1083
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,820
in her most disgraceful state

1084
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,550
to try and ruin your relationship with Jingjing.

1085
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,650
I think her actions

1086
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,250
have always been quite extreme,

1087
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,150
so it's not surprising

1088
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,580
that she's now seeking revenge

1089
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,550
like this.

1090
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,320
When she can't have what she wants,

1091
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,020
she can act so recklessly.

1135
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,920
Seeing such a big streamer

1136
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,220
being tormented like this

1137
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,380
breaks your heart?

1138
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,310
No, no.

1139
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,090
I was just thinking,

1140
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:31,180
(Palm Fire Livestream)
I was just thinking,

1141
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:31,250
(Palm Fire Livestream)

1142
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,950
even in this state,
(Palm Fire Livestream)

1143
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,030
(Palm Fire Livestream)

1144
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,320
she's still posing like that.
(Palm Fire Livestream)

1145
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,550
(Palm Fire Livestream)

1146
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,350
Is she deliberately
(Palm Fire Livestream)

1147
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,540
trying to attract attention
(Palm Fire Livestream)

1148
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,540
and not rest?

1149
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,100
You've figured it out.

1150
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,370
The reason Ao Li is doing this

1151
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,390
is to attract more people

1152
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,830
to her livestream to torment her.

1153
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,570
Indeed.

1154
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:52,990
It's starting again.

1155
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,230
This is pure self-torture.

1156
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,080
I think she might

1157
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,760
be born with such a personality,

1158
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,570
willing to do anything

1159
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,120
to achieve her goals.

1160
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,290
It might not necessarily be innate, though.

1161
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,510
When we were in school together,

1162
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,480
we were actually together

1163
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,470
from morning till night.

1164
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,520
At that time,

1165
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19,910
she was quite normal.

1166
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:21,790
Oh, right.

1167
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,620
Didn't you tell me before?

1168
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,180
One time,

1169
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,680
to win a tug-of-war competition,

1170
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,790
she tied the rope

1171
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,080
around her waist

1172
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,580
and desperately held onto the horizontal bar,

1173
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,170
almost breaking her ribs?

1174
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,470
That was because some girls from the architecture department

1175
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,950
had bullied me,

1176
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,790
so she wanted to win back some dignity for me.

1177
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,380
That's why she was so desperate to win.

1178
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,870
How can you be so sure

1179
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,550
that she didn't have a competitive spirit of her own?

1180
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,040
Right?

1181
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,790
So,

1182
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,900
what you two have seen

1183
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,150
wasn't the same side of her.

1184
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,390
Of course, maybe

1185
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,360
you and Jingjing represent

1186
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,670
different things to her.

1187
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,480
Is she alright?

1188
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,910
She's fine.

1189
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,220
She's very happy.

1190
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,190
After dancing like this,

1191
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,310
her own account

1192
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,770
must be gaining followers like crazy.

1193
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,780
The dear fans

1194
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,100
who like Ao Li,

1195
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,500
don't forget

1196
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,120
to go to Come On, Ao Li

1197
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,830
and give me a follow!

1198
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,590
She's gained so many followers!

1199
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,560
I told you, didn't I?

1200
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,320
In our line of work,

1201
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,870
if you want to get rich,

1202
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,220
you've got to go crazy first.

1203
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:33,820
Alright,

1204
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
prepare to end the stream.

1205
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,470
Okay.
