(Episode 24)

3
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,680
This is the room.

4
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,170
Su's roommate is away for an internship.

5
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,150
During this time,

6
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,830
he had been living here alone.

7
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,120
Thank you.

8
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,350
You can go ahead with your work now.

9
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,670
Shen Yi.

10
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,400
It should be ox blood.

11
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,350
We've found the raw material.

12
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,230
Let's see if we can find

13
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,960
Prussian blue.

14
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,770
Let's keep looking.

15
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,030
Du Cheng.

16
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,240
Is it Prussian blue?

17
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,750
It's identical to what

18
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,570
I made at home.

19
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,450
Then we can confirm

20
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,760
that Su Youliang knew

21
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,750
he was being poisoned

22
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,430
and even made an antidote.

23
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,450
No wonder

24
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,260
An Luran said

25
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,190
he was unwell for a while

26
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,910
but then recovered.

27
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,630
He knew he was being poisoned.

28
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,790
So why didn't he report it to the police?

29
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,610
I suspect he's covering for the perpetrator.

30
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,480
He loves me very resolutely.

31
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,230
He even made me swear with him,

32
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,390
promising not to betray each other.

33
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,090
He said

34
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,510
whoever betrays the other

35
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,480
will be punished.

36
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,960
Du Cheng.

37
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,190
I know what that

38
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,300
underlying tattoo means now.

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,110
Next,

48
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,310
we need to focus on investigating

49
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,510
all the people around Su Youliang

50
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,830
who have emotional connections with him.

51
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,950
We also need to check

52
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,620
if they had any possibility of coming into contact with thallium.

Li Han,

56
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,430
go meet Lin Xiaoyin's parents.

57
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,310
Okay.

58
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,390
I want to go talk to Lin Xiaoyin

59
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,000
again tomorrow.

60
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,030
Alright.

61
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,780
Everyone, let's split up and get to work.

62
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,000
What do you want to ask?

63
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,110
About relationships.

64
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,320
I'm asking on behalf of my two friends.

65
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,590
You came after all.

66
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,470
Have a seat.

67
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,950
Then let's start right away.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,590
Alright.

69
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,160
First, in your mind,

70
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,350
silently think of your question.

71
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,380
Don't stop.

72
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,300
Go on. From left to right,

73
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,590
choose three cards in order.

74
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,110
They represent the past, the dilemma, and the action.

75
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,560
The Lovers.

76
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,710
Gemini.

77
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,990
It's clear as day.

78
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,010
In the past, they were deeply in love.

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,240
Their love was passionate and pure,

80
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,510
without any impurities.

81
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,470
You can understand it as

82
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,310
a childlike fervor.

83
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,470
So it can't be interpreted with

84
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,750
a mature emotional perspective.

85
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,560
That's right.

86
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,630
It's very accurate.

87
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,040
Real-life issues.

88
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,270
They're facing difficulties because of this.

89
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,440
Because of money,

90
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,870
they feel lost.

91
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,750
And then?

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,150
What action will they take?

93
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,070
Move forward for love.

94
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,590
Overcome all obstacles.

95
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,500
Indeed.

96
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,390
These two friends of mine

97
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,270
have a great relationship.

98
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,630
Young people

99
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,270
all feel lost when facing

100
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,030
societal pressures.

101
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,070
One day,

102
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,350
an opportunity beckoned

103
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,270
to this boy.

104
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,670
It was risky,

105
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,720
yet tempting.

106
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,710
The boy agreed.

107
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,030
We all thought

108
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,390
that this girl would

109
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,670
break up with the boy because of this.

110
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,330
But unexpectedly,

111
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,670
this girl resolutely

112
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,790
chose to stay with him,

113
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,790
taking on this huge risk.

114
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,870
For the same goal,

115
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,110
they worked together.

116
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,550
Childishly in love, reckless,

117
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,150
even...

118
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,870
Even...

119
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,190
Gradually deviating from their original intentions.

120
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,610
Also gradually...

121
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,909
Falling apart.

122
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,659
Next,

123
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,250
I want to read about this girl.

124
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,870
Okay.

125
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,910
It's alright.

126
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,350
Take your time shuffling.

127
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,370
What do these three cards mean?

128
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
I'm not in a good state.

129
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,970
Let's not do the reading today.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,790
Let me do it.

131
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,090
This girl

132
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,250
seems to be on the verge of realizing her dreams.

133
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,840
But in reality,

134
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,000
she's under immense pressure.

135
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,660
And this pressure...

136
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,890
She has no one to share it with anymore.

137
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,020
She must be exhausted,

138
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,010
yet she doesn't dare to break down.

139
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,600
She's torn.

140
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,890
How do you know?

141
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,860
I'm just interpreting the cards.

142
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,710
Next...

143
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,960
This card

144
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,600
suggests that this girl might have been deceived.

145
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,120
Money was the beginning of their troubles,

146
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,490
and in the end,

147
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,750
they were consumed by it.

148
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,710
Lin Xiaoyin,

149
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,360
Su Youliang almost had a change of heart.

150
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,350
You know that, don't you?

151
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,390
(Inquiry Room)

152
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,750
We've checked Su Youliang's
(Inquiry Room)

153
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,700
and your family group's

154
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,470
chat history.

155
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,710
We found that from

156
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,960
seven or eight months ago,

157
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,470
you've been constantly urging Su Youliang

158
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,430
to leave Lin Xiaoyin.

159
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,380
So what?

160
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,240
So it was at that time

161
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,430
you learned about Su Youliang's

162
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,390
relationship with An Luran.

163
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,840
Yes.

164
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,110
Our family isn't well-off either.

165
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,510
After I graduated from high school,

166
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,470
I didn't get into college.

167
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,510
I couldn't find a good job.

168
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,540
If he got together with An Luran,

169
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,710
my job and the house for marriage

170
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,870
would all be taken care of, right?

171
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,890
Besides, I've met An Luran.

172
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,280
She's quite pretty,

173
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,550
not at all inferior to Lin Xiaoyin.

174
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,450
So we advised him

175
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,270
to be sincere with An Luran

176
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,230
and have a good life together.

177
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,270
How did Lin Xiaoyin find out

178
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,030
about this?

179
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,030
I sent a voice message

180
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,950
and she overheard it.

181
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,870
She came over to confront me,

182
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,070
asking why I was sowing discord.

183
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,060
I just told her straight out.

184
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,230
There's no choice.

185
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,490
The inferior person gets abandoned,

186
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,810
and the inferior item gets thrown out.

187
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,830
She's no match

188
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,740
for An Luran in any aspect.

189
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,350
What does Su Youliang think about this?

190
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,670
Do you know?

191
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,460
My brother hasn't given in.

192
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,490
But I think

193
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,230
he's somewhat wavering.

194
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,300
I'm closing the shop for the day.

195
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,310
The emotional separation.

196
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,970
This time,

197
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,310
this girl fully experienced

198
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,870
that everything was taken away from her.

199
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,710
She began to feel

200
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,270
a strong distrust towards this boy.

201
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,700
And the sword in her hand

202
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,510
represents her naked killing intent.

203
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,510
You hate him.

204
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,310
You hate him for betraying you

205
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,300
for An Luran.

206
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,980
So I'm guessing

207
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,270
that the poison in the cup

208
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,390
that An Luran gave him

209
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,710
was actually put there by you, wasn't it?

210
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,020
Didn't you say you didn't understand this?

211
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,590
You lied to me.

212
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,710
I really don't understand,

213
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,480
and I don't believe it at all.

214
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,410
I'm just stating the facts.

215
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,440
What facts?

216
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,920
You have no evidence.

217
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,220
Captain Cheng, we have a new lead.

218
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,880
I just found out.

219
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,240
Lin Xiaoyin has a close friend.

220
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,310
She's from the University of Science and Technology,

221
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,740
a graduate student in the Chemistry Department.

222
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,230
Lin Xiaoyin frequently

223
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,080
visits her laboratory.

224
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,070
Their lab

225
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,110
has records of purchasing thallium salt

226
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,070
and data on its usage.

227
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,140
Does this look familiar?

228
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,880
This is the tattoo Su Youliang

229
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,230
got for An Luran.

230
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,560
There's a trident on it.

231
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,270
I originally thought

232
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,000
this was An Luran's way of claiming

233
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,110
ownership over Su Youliang.

234
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,990
Later I realized that

235
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,790
this trident

236
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,430
was only added because it couldn't cover the original design.

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,910
So they incorporated it

238
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,310
into the composition of the later tattoo.

239
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,870
And the trident in the original design

240
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,980
was actually tattooed by Su Youliang for you.

241
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,400
It represents loyalty and punishment.

242
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,460
An eternal and unchanging vow.

243
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,090
No matter who betrays whom,

244
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,360
punishment will ultimately be served.

245
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,070
We found thallium salt hidden

246
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,350
in a crystal ball at Lin Xiaoyin's house.

247
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,370
Where's your crystal ball?

248
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,830
It's indeed a clever hiding place for thallium salt.

249
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,720
You went to my house?

250
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,770
Why did you poison him?

251
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,020
I...

252
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,280
I thought if the tattoo changed,

253
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,570
I would lose him.

254
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,900
Just because his feelings changed,

255
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,020
you had to punish him?

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,120
I didn't want it to be like this.

257
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,210
But I really...

258
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,180
I really didn't mean to hurt Youliang.

259
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,800
I truly didn't want to harm him.

260
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,100
Due to the poisoning,

261
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,280
his bodily functions were impaired.

262
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,150
He needed to take medication.

263
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,270
Who would have thought

264
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,570
that an overdose of aphrodisiacs

265
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,180
would cause his already damaged body

266
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,320
to be unable to withstand the stress,

267
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,440
leading to his sudden death.

268
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,470
It's all my fault.

269
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,070
It's all my fault.

270
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,630
If I had known it would be like this,

271
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,940
I should have stopped him then.

272
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,020
I should have stopped him then...

273
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,140
Greed is endless.

274
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,830
It only makes people sink deeper and deeper.

275
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,950
Okay.

276
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,460
Alright, I understand.

00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,470

283
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,430
Captain Cheng,

284
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,150
can we

285
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,829
close the case now?

286
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,310
There's one thing I still can't figure out.

287
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,869
A sudden myocardial infarction

288
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,440
doesn't cause immediate death.

289
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,030
Usually, when it occurs,

290
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,150
there's a process.

291
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,829
During this process, people

292
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,369
struggle due to the pain,

293
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,569
even calling for help.

294
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,130
But when An Luran reported it,

295
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,670
she said that when she woke up,

296
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,830
Su Youliang was already dead.

297
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,350
They were together all night,

298
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,670
yet she didn't notice anything.

299
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,910
Isn't that strange?

300
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,950
Could it be that she was in a deep sleep?

301
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,350
Su Youliang's case

302
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,060
can be closed.

303
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,470
But Li Han,

304
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,530
could you please help me check

305
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,610
the surveillance footage

306
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,310
near An Luran's house that night?

307
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,530
Hopefully, I'm just overthinking.

308
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,420
Jiang Feng.

309
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,190
Captain Cheng.

310
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,190
I found out that

311
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,710
on the night Su Youliang died,

312
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,350
An Luran made an online transaction

313
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,560
at a small private convenience store

314
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,340
in Yongxing Beach.

315
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,100
I just checked the surveillance footage and found that

316
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,960
she made the purchase in person.

317
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,910
She bought a pack of cigarettes.

318
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,380
An Luran is indeed suspicious.

319
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,110
At that time,

320
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,630
Su Youliang was likely already dead.

321
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,880
There was a corpse in the house,

322
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,140
yet she didn't call the police.

323
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,790
Instead, she went to the beach.

324
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,510
Do we have any information on her whereabouts after that?

325
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,340
The beach area is quite complex.

326
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,870
There are fishing villages, swimming areas,

327
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,270
and container homestays nearby.

328
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,670
There are many blind spots in the surveillance coverage.

329
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,830
We can't be sure where she went afterward.

330
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,270
The beach police station

331
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,590
just reported an important lead.

332
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,950
On the very night Su Youliang died,

333
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,910
the maritime police intercepted a smuggling fishing boat.

334
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,830
The captain said

335
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,150
these smuggling boats

336
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,810
are all involved in illegal organ transplant business.

337
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,630
Many of the smuggled individuals

338
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,640
have already been matched for transplants

339
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,740
and are here for bone marrow extraction.

340
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,710
They come and go on the same day.

341
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,090
It's like a black market.

342
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,750
Let's go.

343
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,910
We'll investigate at the beach.

344
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,530
Alright.

345
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,320
Why haven't you finished cleaning up yet?

346
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,870
Hurry up, all of you!

347
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,190
Be careful with what you're doing!

348
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,720
The more you rush, the messier it gets.

349
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,520
Come on, hurry up!

350
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,640
Clean up the footprints on the beach.

351
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,500
Alright, understood.

352
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,070
Officer Shen,

353
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,790
coming to the beach for a date so late?

354
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,270
What about you?

355
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,750
It's so late,

356
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,020
did you just see someone off?

357
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,430
Or are you waiting for someone?

358
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,030
Thank you.

359
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,690
No problem.

360
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,510
This entire area

361
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,630
is privately contracted.

362
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,920
But the containers inside

363
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,270
are all rented to individuals.

364
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,510
Some use them as leisure cabins,

365
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,940
some rent them as warehouses,

366
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,230
and others convert them into guesthouses

367
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,090
for business.

368
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,640
The floating population is very dense

369
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,960
and lacks centralized management.

370
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,020
Was that Tang Keying?

371
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,270
This is private property.

372
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,190
What do you want?

373
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,040
Miss Tang,

374
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,550
please open the door.

375
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,460
Tang?

376
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,110
Why are you with

377
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,790
Officer Du?

378
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,290
And with so many people?

379
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,980
Why are you here?

380
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,560
I was deceived by a scumbag,

381
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,730
lost my child,

382
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,010
and I'm feeling down.

383
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,640
I invited Tang

384
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,550
to find a quiet place

385
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,490
for a girls' night chat.

386
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,370
Is that not allowed?

387
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,790
Officer Du, are you interested

388
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,730
in joining us?

389
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,340
Tell everyone to call it a day.

390
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,290
Pack up.

391
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,010
How did you end up here?

392
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,460
I suspect that on the night Su Youliang died suddenly,

393
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,700
An Luran came to the beach.

394
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,830
I checked the recorder

395
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,830
carried by the paramedics that day

396
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,050
and found this.

397
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,250
This piece of clothing belonging to An Luran

398
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,540
is dyed turmeric yellow with pure natural plant dyes.

399
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,550
Turmeric yellow has a unique property.

400
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,970
It turns red when it encounters alkaline substances,

401
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,210
and reverts to yellow when it encounters acid.

402
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,500
So the red stains on it

403
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,570
are not blood

404
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,700
nor paint.

405
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,380
Instead, I suspect that

406
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,480
this piece of her clothing

407
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,250
came into contact with seawater,

408
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,000
and then passed through some kind of acidic environment,

409
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,510
which is why there are

410
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,590
streaks of yellow marks on it.

411
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,110
Li Han also found out

412
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,870
that on the day of the incident,

413
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,920
only this garden area had been sprayed with acidic pesticides.

414
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,410
That's why I came here.

415
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,330
I suspect that on the night of Su Youliang's death,

416
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,950
An Luran's hasty departure

417
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,540
was related to the transfer of illegal immigrants at the beach

418
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,400
and the participation in illegal organ transplants.

419
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,610
When you were inside just now,

420
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,930
did you find anything?

421
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,080
No.

422
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,670
Looks like we've come up empty-handed today.

423
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,730
Alright,

424
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,900
let's head back.

425
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,920
I came here by bike.

426
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,130
Load it onto my car.

427
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,510
This place.

428
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,610
I think...

429
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,120
We can put it here too.

430
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,070
You're back.

431
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,030
I understand.

432
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,830
I see.

433
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,440
Alright, goodbye.

434
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,240
I'll never expect

435
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,230
you to knock again.

436
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,190
I saw you were busy earlier.

437
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,510
Alright, let's get down to business.

438
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,600
There's a big case in the city.

439
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,550
The higher-ups have assigned our Criminal Investigation Team

440
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,010
to join the core task force.

441
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,450
It's under the command of the Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission.

442
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,830
The Municipal Supervision Commission, Public Security, and Drug Administration

443
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,680
are all working together on this.

444
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,870
What kind of case is it?

445
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,790
Such a big commotion.

446
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,430
Based on the previous investigation results,

447
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,030
Hua'an Medical Center and

448
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,350
Maoyu Biochemical Group

449
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,000
are suspected of illegal drug manufacturing,

450
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,270
smuggling of prohibited goods,

451
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,670
and illegal organ transplantation.

452
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,870
This case also involves

453
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,710
collusion between government and business,

454
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,000
and major economic crimes.

455
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,430
So the city

456
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,780
has made a firm decision

457
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,990
to take unified action

458
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,950
to break through this case.

459
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,790
I understand.

460
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,190
I will synchronize

461
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,030

462
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,750
with them.

463
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,630
Currently, this case

464
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,700
involves units

465
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,970
with complex backgrounds and sensitive nature.

466
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,890
Our task

467
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,130
is to thoroughly investigate

468
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,380
the deep-rooted criminal activities behind the scenes.

469
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,350
What's the matter?

470
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,190
Why did you call me here so urgently?

471
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,550
Look.

472
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,750
These are the heatmaps of genetic samples

473
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,630
I used for the experiment.

474
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,150
Their owners

475
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,880
all have different genetic defects.

476
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,060
Some affect physical health,

477
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:08,440
while others affect mental health.

while others affect mental health.

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,110
is a

569
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,930
multinational medical investment company.

570
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,790
Kailai Biotechnology Research Institute

571
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,790
and Hua'an Medical Center

572
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,930
have a cooperative relationship.

573
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,110
Most of Kailai Biotechnology's

574
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,090
medical projects

575
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,070
are clinically tested

576
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,200
by Hua'an Medical Center.

577
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,220
The two institutions collaborate very closely.

578
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,290
(Kailai Biotechnology)

579
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:08,010
(Relationship between Hua'an Medical Center and Kailai Biotechnology)

580
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,190
(Director of Kailai Biotechnology: Fang Kaiyi) (Assistant: Tang Keying)

581
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,630
Tang Keying, as

582
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,430
the common liaison

583
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,310
for these two institutions,

584
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,030
will be our breakthrough point

585
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,910
for the upcoming investigation.

586
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,150
What a coincidence,

587
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,230
Miss Tang.

588
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,910
Running into you at the entrance of our research institute

589
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,830
is probably not just a coincidence, is it?

590
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,430
Officer Du.

591
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,600
Can we have a quick chat?

592
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,070
I'm sorry,

593
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,780
but I have a meeting to attend.

594
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,790
It won't take long.

595
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,810
I don't know anything.

596
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,960
I haven't even asked anything yet.

597
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,550
How do you know

598
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,430
that you don't know anything?

599
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,220
You were parachuted into Kailai.

600
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,990
And as soon as you arrived, you became

601
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,550
Professor Fang Kaiyi's

602
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,150
research assistant.

603
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,930
In less than two months,

604
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,670
you became the liaison between Hua'an Medical

605
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,270
and Kailai Biotechnology.

606
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,310
What exactly do you want to ask?

607
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,680
After our investigation,

608
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,890
we found that Hua'an Medical

609
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,070
is suspected of serious illegal activities.

610
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,060
I hope you can cooperate with us

611
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,950
and provide us with some leads.

612
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,110
I'm only responsible for

613
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,230
technical matters.

614
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,190
I know nothing about anything else.

615
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,000
Given your special position

616
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,160
and your close relationship with An Luran

617
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,990
as her best friend,

618
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,140
it's hard for us to believe

619
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,700
that you're completely unaware.

620
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,350
I'm sorry,

621
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,940
but I really need to go to my meeting now.

622
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,040
You're an only child.

623
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,600
Although your parents' income is modest,

624
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,080
you've attended the best schools

625
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,550
throughout your life.

626
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,820
They've done everything they can

627
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,870
to support your education

628
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,060
and have high hopes for you.

629
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,590
I'm sure you wouldn't want

630
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,540
them to be heartbroken

631
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,670
because of you.

632
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,510
When an avalanche occurs,

633
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,140
no snowflake is innocent.

634
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:20,910
I hope you can

635
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,940
consider what I've said.

636
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,290
Excuse me,

637
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,640
can I borrow your phone to make a call?

638
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,430
Thank you.

639
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,070
This is my number.

640
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,560
If you have any information,

641
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,440
I hope you'll contact me.

642
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,000
I won't keep you from your meeting any longer.

643
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,429
Director An.

644
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,030
After the container incident,

645
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,870
the police are watching us closely.

646
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,630
Should we reduce our contact?

647
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,630
Why are you panicking?

648
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,000
If they had any evidence,

649
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,550
we would be

650
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,670
in the interrogation room by now.

651
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,679
However, given the current situation,

652
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,270
we can't do business domestically anymore.

653
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,420
I plan to leave the country.

654
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,260
So you mean

655
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,100
you're leaving me here to take the fall alone?

656
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,090
Do you want to come with me?

657
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:01,730
I...

658
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,550
Coming with me can at least protect you.

659
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,550
But you know me,

660
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,710
I don't keep idle people around.

661
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,480
You need to do something for me.

662
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,350
The new company abroad

663
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,590
has already been registered.

664
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,580
Securing investment funds

665
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,600
is not an issue either.

666
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,070
What I need are the

667
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,910
core data and experimental results

668
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,830
related to

669
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,350
embryonic gene editing.

670
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,440
Once we have these technologies,

671
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,310
you'll have a place to use your skills too.

672
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,100
So you're saying

673
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,480
you want me to steal

674
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,800
Mr. Fang's core technology?

675
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,230
I don't care if you steal, rob,

676
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,070
or deceive.

677
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,660
These are the conditions.

678
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,960
Once you get it,

679
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,750
you'll come with me.

680
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,550
The benefits and power

681
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,310
I promised you before

682
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,910
will only increase, not decrease.

683
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,510
Once we're abroad,

684
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,070
you can also work freely

685
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,830
to build your own career.

686
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,290
What about Mr. Fang?

687
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,930
Are you kidding me?

688
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,780
You're still worried about him?

689
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,990
You have no right to worry about him.

690
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,390
Don't tell me you still

691
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,190
have feelings for him.

692
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,310
After all these years,

693
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,790
you've been hovering around him.

694
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,590
If he had any interest in you,

695
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,510
it would have happened by now.

696
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,860
To put it nicely,

697
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,110
you're his confidant.

698
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,510
To put it bluntly,

699
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,790
in his eyes,

700
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,190
you're just a bunch of genetic code.

701
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,510
I'll say it again,

702
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,510
don't expect anything from men.

703
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,030
Think about all the things you've done.

704
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,550
If something really goes wrong,

705
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,140
can he protect you?

706
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,830
Is he even capable of protecting you?

707
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,320
But he's extremely cautious in his actions.

708
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,710
This involves

709
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,950
an extensive amount of research data

710
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,910
and experimental results related to

711
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,730
embryonic gene editing.

712
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,790
I have to find a chance to...

713
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,630
So you do know

714
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,550
where these core data

715
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,550
are stored.

716
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,190
Anyway, the situation of the group

717
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,790
is uncertain from day to day.

718
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,390
We must make every second count.

719
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,430
These core data

720
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,100
are our trump card

721
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,700
for starting over,

722
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,630
and also your lifeline.

723
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,090
Sister.

724
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,590
Your fate

725
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,750
is in your hands.

726
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,110
My future

727
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,490
is also in your hands.

728
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,130
I've said all I needed to say.

729
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,410
I'll go first.

730
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,620
In this item,

731
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,750
the molecular structure of ribonucleic acid

732
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,750
has a unique proportion.

733
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,950
We need to focus on studying

734
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,950
its formation factors.

735
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,010
Tang, please follow up on this.

736
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,510
We'll continue the discussion next week.

737
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,000
Did you hear that, Tang?

738
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,110
Yes, Mr. Fang.

739
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,140
We're having dinner with Academician Fu tonight.

740
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,260
All of you will join us.

741
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,980
Mr. Fang.

742
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,270
I'm not feeling well.

743
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,280
Then you should rest.

744
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,740
The rest of you come with me.

745
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,430
Alright, Mr. Fang.

746
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,630
(Please wait)

747
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,590
Based on what I know about him,

748
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,790
he wouldn't keep the core files

749
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,400
on this computer.

750
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,740
Mr. Shen.

751
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,950
Who sent you here?

752
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,830
I'm helping Mr. Fang...

753
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,630
Is it An Luran?

754
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,260
Last time at the container,

755
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,580
I could tell

756
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,990
you were working for her.

757
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,250
So,

758
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,290
what did she send you to do?

759
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,770
Steal research results?

760
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,410
You should know that

761
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,880
what she's asking you to do

762
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,760
is illegal, right?

763
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,020
Mr. Shen, could you

764
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,030
not tell Mr. Fang?

765
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,000
I can see

766
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,910
you're already in too deep now.

767
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,760
Tang Keying.

768
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,230
You're just

769
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,730
an ordinary staff member.

770
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,140
You can't handle these murky waters.

771
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,910
Don't make another mistake.

772
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,340
Whatever deal you've made with An Luran,

773
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,960
cut your losses

774
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,050
and give up now.
