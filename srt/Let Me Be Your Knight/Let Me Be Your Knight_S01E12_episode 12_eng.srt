1
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,480

2
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,670

3
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,880
If it were before, I would've not even worried about it.

4
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm so well off now.

5
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,630
  Now is the time for Ms. In Yoon Joo and us to say goodbye.

6
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,190
  Let's see each other next time.

7
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,530
  I hope you have a happy relationship.

8
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,350
What does this mean?

9
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,970

10
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,950
Yes, Unni.

11
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,380
  I...

12
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,120
  I met up with Yoon Tae In today.

13
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,300
  I went to see him to compensate on my end,

14
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,590
  but in the end,

15
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,150
  he paid off your debt.

16
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,310
  He said it was for the treatment fee.

17
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,240
  I thought I should tell you about this.

18
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,340
  Also,

19
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,210
  he asked me where you are and how you've been,

20
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,110
  so I told him to call you directly.

21
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,890
Why on earth would he do that?

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,280
Please stop the car here.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,400
How much is it?

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,830
It's 27,000 won. (~$27)

25
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,000
Actually, can you follow that car right there?

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,990
Why?

27
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,630
That is...

28
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,710
He cheated on you, right?

29
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,360
Excuse me?

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,970
Yes, that's right! So please hurry up.

31
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,110
Okay, put the seat belt on tightly.

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,780
What?

33
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,730
It's unlocked.

34
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,200
It's been a long time since we came here.

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,370
It's the first time since we moved our company building.

36
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,570
You're right.

37
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,380
When we were trainees, we came up here every time we felt frustrated.

38
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,270
Do you remember that?

39
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,790
At that time, Tae In always played the songs he made

40
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,750
to us up here after practice.

41
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,430
That's right.

42
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,940
Whenever we said something was even a little off,

43
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,510
he would fix it for days and play it again to us.

44
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,820
Again and again.

45
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,860
It was us, so we could handle his personality.

46
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,000
I know.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,340
But Tae In

48
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,100
might have been better at that time.

49
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,930
Now he's trying to take care of everything on his own.

50
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,520
At that time,

51
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,700
we only needed to worry about the debut,

52
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,370
but now, everything is complicated.

53
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,010
For Tae In Hyung and Yoo Chan Hyung as well.

54
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,800
Maybe it's because our team house became bigger.

55
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,520
Recently, Tae In told me this.

56
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,390
Before, we knew everything about each other, even if we didn't want to.

57
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,050
But he wondered if the reason why we became like this

58
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,340
was that our house got bigger.

59
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,150
Did Tae In Hyung say that?

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,970
  I think he is in a sleepwalking state.

61
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,620
  But who is that woman?

62
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,700
  Why did she take Yoon Tae In?

63
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,280
I think we might get caught by them. What should I do?

64
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,050
  Is there another person who knows Yoon Tae In's situation

65
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,290
  besides the CEO and his members?

66
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,860
  Even if so, the situation earlier

67
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,730
  didn't seem right.

68
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,910
  I'll quietly gloss over this case.

69
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,770
 I can't let our LUNA go on the news' society section.

70
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,900
Ma'am, we might get caught.

71
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,810
No, I can't...

72
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,170
I shouldn't go overboard.

73
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,420
Right? You don't think so as well, right?

74
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,290
Excuse me, sir?

75
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,360
Didn't you tell me to stop following the car?

76
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,840
No, I didn't mean that! We're going to lose the car!

77
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,940
Oh, no!

78
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,330
Our house is big indeed.

79
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,210
Ga On said he's bringing Yoo Chan Hyung with him.

80
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,120
You'll make up with Yoo Chan Hyung when they come, right?

81
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,010
I'm telling you once again.

82
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,140
I'm just going to take my stuff and go out again.

83
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,470
I get it!

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
Hyung!

85
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,940
Hurry up and come here.

86
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,370
Hyung!

87
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,040
Why is our door open?

88
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,900
That's strange.

89
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,290
Isn't Tae In Hyung by himself?

90
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,570
What's going on?

91
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,760
The lights are all off, too.

92
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,990
Is Yoon Tae In sleeping?

93
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,050
I'll go upstairs to check.

94
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,570
- Here. 
 - If he's coming all the way here to have an affair,

95
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,130
it doesn't seem like their relationship will end that easily.

96
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,020
Wouldn't it be better for you to go back to Seoul?

97
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,140
Thank you.

98
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,550
Tae In Hyung is not in his room.

99
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,720
Only his phone was there.

100
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,480
Then he must be in the practice room.

101
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,390

102
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,560
- Doctor. 
 - Is it Dr. Kang Sun Joo?

103
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,160
Pardon?

104
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,350
Tae In is?

105
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,820
It looked off, so I followed him.

106
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,560
But the CEO is not picking up his phone,

107
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,330
so I only thought of you to call, Woo Yeon.

108
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,620
  Where are you? I'll go there.

109
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,060
It's dangerous, so just wait there.

110
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,950
I think I found where Yoon Tae In is.

111
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,050
I'll text you the location here.

112
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,150

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,150
I can do this.

114
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,340
Ga On, you got this.

115
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,590
Hyung,

116
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,840
trust me.

117
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
Wait.

118
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,890
It hasn't been that long since you got your driver's license.

119
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,690
Don't worry about it. I got a perfect score on the driving test.

120
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,100
Did you get a perfect score for the skill test?

121
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,230
That's not that easy.

122
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,370
I meant the written test.

123
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,230
W-W-Written test..?

124
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,070
Then what do you want to do?

125
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,030
Yoo Chan Hyung doesn't have a license and you two drank.

126
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,810
- It's okay. I can do it. 
 - Hey!

127
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,060
Let's go, let's go!

128
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,210
What's that?

129
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,870
Why did you bring those with you?

130
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,620
We don't know what might happen.

131
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,420
I should bring something as a weapon.

132
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,630
What?

133
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,490
Are you laughing at me?

134
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,670
Hey, Seo Woo Yeon, switch seats with me.

135
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,220
I don't want to sit next to him.

136
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm going to drive now!

137
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,670
Hey, hey! Wait!

138
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,380
It's been some time. Okay, let's go!

139
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,030
Oh, no! Go slowly!

140
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,840
Did you wake up already?

141
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,950
What is this?

142
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,300
Who are you?

143
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,110
What do you mean by that?

144
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,130
You know who I am.

145
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,210
You!

146
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,040
You look surprised.

147
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,020
Why do you pretend not to know me when you know?

148
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,450
What the heck are you doing to me!

149
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,490
Untie me, now.

150
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm glad.

151
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,110
I learned how to tie the rope on the internet for this.

152
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,170
- Is this a dream? 
 - It's sad for me if you say it's a dream.

153
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,410
Today is the day when my dream comes true.

154
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,210
Why are you doing this?

155
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,820
What do you want from me?

156
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,710
Without these ropes,

157
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,170
I want you to stay with me.

158
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,790
That's what I want.

159
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,370
It seemed like you bought it for me but couldn't hand it over,

160
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,000
so I took it when you went to Hong Kong.

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,940
Doesn't it look good on me?

162
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,470
  It's casual but chic,

163
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,060
  - so it'll look good on her. 
 - Then, I'll take this one.

164
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,870
Did you...?

165
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,610

166
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,900

167
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,170

168
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,250

169
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,430

170
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,340

171
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,570

172
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,330
I heard that she's your live-in doctor.

173
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,080
That woman...

174
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,360
She has nothing to do with me.

175
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,330
Well, I don't care.

176
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,110
The one who's going to be with you forever from now on

177
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,920
is me.

178
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,150
What should I do?

179
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,960
I made it with everything you like.

180
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,420
- Don't you like it? 
 - Do you think I'll eat this?

181
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,080
Think wisely.

182
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,510
If the fact that you forcefully dragged me down here gets revealed,

183
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,090
how will you deal with that?

184
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,930
If you untie me at least now–

185
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,990
What do you mean I forced you?

186
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,520
You walked with your own feet and got in my car.

187
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,720
That will be on the surveillance camera as well.

188
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,810
It means you didn't go missing,

189
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,520
but you disappeared of your own will

190
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,590
with the woman whom you will soon be in love with.

191
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,390
Did you understand it?

192
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,560
I'll bring out the food again.

193
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,480
You surprised me! What is it!

194
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,410
Why did you stop suddenly?

195
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,730
I-I think I hit something just now.

196
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,550
What?

197
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,140
My gosh...

198
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,860
- What was it? 
 - There's nothing.

199
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,850
We're already very nervous, and you startled us for nothing!

200
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,270
- You don't even know how to drive! 
 - What?

201
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,240
Did you just call me "you?"

202
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,800
I think we are almost there.

203
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,110
Tae In, it's me.

204
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,910
How did you come here?

205
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,660
I'll untie this first.

206
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,160
It's dangerous in here. Get out, now.

207
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,640
Woo Yeon and other members are on their way, too.

208
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,720
I'm saying it's dangerous!

209
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,960
- I'll do it on my own– 
 - What do you mean by that?

210
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,540
You are tied up and can't do anything.

211
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,290
I almost untied myself!

212
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,140
What? Almost untied?

213
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,510
Also, be quiet! She'll hear us.

214
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,270
But how did you find me here?

215
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,070
I went to see you and saw it.

216
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,780
You got into a car with bare feet, so I thought it was strange.

217
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,970
Did you worry about me?

218
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,980
I heard it from my sister.

219
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,820
Why would you pay off my debt? Such a large amount, too!

220
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,500
Also, in the end,

221
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,990
you didn't actually get over your illness.

222
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,400
It's true that I got over my illness because of you,

223
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,080
and it's also true that this happened to me because of you.

224
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,100
It's because you weren't next to me.

225
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,180
I'm sorry.

226
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm really sorry.

227
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,750
I'm sorry to you as well.

228
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,290
I just got angry at you without hearing your story.

229
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,350
I know that your feelings for me

230
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,030
were sincere.

231
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,630
So you have the right to accept

232
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,530
that money from me.

233
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,910
That doesn't make any sense.

234
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,440
I...

235
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,210
I untied it.

236
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,940
Good job!

237
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,120
Which part did you untie it?

238
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,520
I untied one knot.

239
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,430
Persuade her well, and let her go out one more time.

240
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,370
Wait, wait!

241
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,180
She's a complete psycho!

242
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,490
I can't persuade her!

243
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,080
Is this the right place?

244
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,360
Is he here?

245
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,750
I think this is the right place.

246
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,810
But why can't I see Dr. Kang?

247
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,670
Are you crazy?

248
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,920
You're an idiot! Didn't you watch any movies?

249
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,690
If you call someone in this situation, the criminal catches them and they get killed!

250
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,310
Where are they? The door is locked as well.

251
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,760
Wait, wait!

252
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,300
Where are you going?

253
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,010
Focus on me.

254
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,110
Just look at me.

255
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,760
Who's the skinniest of us?

256
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,680
- Isn't it Yoo Chan Hyung? 
 - Me?

257
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,400
No, it's not me! I ate a lot of spicy rice cakes

258
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,810
and I got fat.

259
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,390
Hyung! Tae In Hyung and Dr. Kang might be stuck in there,

260
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,120
- but you're refusing it? 
 - When did I refuse it?

261
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,220
I'll do it. I get it...

262
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,840
It's okay. I'll do it.

263
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,290
Be careful, Shin.

264
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,220
I'm so happy.

265
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,940
I only heard those words in my imaginations.

266
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,820
I'm so happy right now.

267
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,560
Then, can you do me a favor?

268
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,030
What is it? Tell me anything.

269
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,300
Can you untie this?

270
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,380
I want to go to the bathroom.

271
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,830
I really need to poop.

272
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,360
- I think this place is abandoned. 
 - Shush!

273
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,780
Hyung, we came in here in secret.

274
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,190
Be quiet!

275
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,840
I'm scared. This place looks like a haunted house!

276
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,590
Okay, I'll trust you.

277
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,500
Oh, my stomach...

278
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,840
- Who is that? 
 - What?

279
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,150
Where are you? Come out, now!

280
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,590
Wait, wait!

281
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
One second, please!

282
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,510
No, it's not like that...

283
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,590
Can we... Can we..

284
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,960
Can we please talk for a second?

285
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,770
How dare you... !

286
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,710
Please let this go... !

287
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,210
Let me go!

288
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,450
Stop it!

289
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,900
Let her go! What the heck are you doing!

290
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,880
What is it?

291
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,680
Huh?

292
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,900
Hyung!

293
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,620
Please! Someone help us! It's here! Here!

294
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,000
  Dr. Kang!

295
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,140
Hey!

296
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,760
  Yoon Tae In!

297
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,300
- Tae In Hyung! 
 - It's here!

298
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,430
- Doctor! 
 - Tae In Hyung!

299
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,190
Are you okay?

300
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,420
- Did you get injured? 
 - No.

301
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,380
Thank you so much for coming.

302
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,480
Yoon Tae In, what happened? Who brought you here?

303
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,040
An employee of our company's promotion team.

304
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,610
- What? 
 - Who?

305
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,710
- Oh, my... 
 - Let's untie this first.

306
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,100
Why is this so hard to untie?

307
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,210
Guys! Look at this picture!

308
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,380
- It's freaky! 
 - Wow, it's insane.

309
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,040
This person was an insane stalker.

310
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,300
Are you okay? Did you get hurt anywhere?

311
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm fine. You saw it earlier.

312
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,840
I kicked her once big time.

313
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,340
It's so disgusting.

314
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,850
It's crazy.

315
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,600
Are you okay?

316
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,750
Doctor!

317
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,090
Wake up, please...

318
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,440
Wake up, In Yoon Joo!

319
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,190
In Yoon Joo... In Yoon Joo!

320
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,880
Dr. Kang!

321
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,090
Doctor...

322
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,790
What should we do?

323
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,140
What should we do? Doctor!

324
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,850
Please, open your eyes.

325
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,080
Call the ambulance. Ambulance!

326
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,560
- Please, wake up. 
 - What should we do?

327
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,780
A person got hit by a car here.

328
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,970
The address is...

329
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,380
According to the test, there was no internal injury

330
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,930
and her external injury isn't that bad either,

331
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,870
so she'll wake up soon.

332
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,400
Don't worry too much.

333
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,650
Thank you, Doctor.

334
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,240
Oh, my! Oh, my!

335
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,820
What on earth is going on?

336
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,970
Is she okay?

337
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,130
Yes, there are no big issues.

338
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,610
I didn't know she would be such a crazy person! Oh!

339
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,840
Are you guys okay?

340
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,680
We're fine.

341
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,600
We are all fine,

342
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,750
but I'm worried about Dr. Kang.

343
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,410
But why is her name written as In Yoon Joo?

344
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,350
That's right. Didn't Yoon Tae In also call her In Yoon Joo?

345
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,330
- Oh, that is... 
 - I'll tell them later.

346
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,210
Okay, that sounds better.

347
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,280
- What? What is this about? 
 - I don't know, either.

348
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,490
Let's go back to our team house for now.

349
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,100
- I'll tell you everything over there. 
 - That sounds good.

350
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,340
Soon Nam and I will be here.

351
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,890
Tae In, why don't you go home and have some rest, too?

352
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,740
I'm not leaving.

353
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,370
I'll be here.

354
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,810
What? Is that true?

355
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,270
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you guys earlier when I knew about this.

356
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,190
But the situation was like this,

357
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,630
so it didn't seem like hiding it would help anything.

358
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,120
I guess this was the reason why Tae In Hyung was acting weird lately.

359
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,100
Was that why she left abruptly with her stuff left here?

360
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,210
But why did she come back and save Yoon Tae In?

361
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,730
Is it because she felt bad that she lied to him?

362
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,140
Do you get hit by a car instead of him because you're sorry?

363
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,940
I think Dr. Kang was sincere to Tae In Hyung.

364
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,000
She was genuine to us as well.

365
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,070
That's true.

366
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:21,060
But did you see Tae In Hyung's face when Dr. Kang got hurt?

367
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,210
I was shocked!

368
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,260
- I never saw Yoon Tae In making that kind of face! 
 - Me, too!

369
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,570
I guess there's something going on between them, right?

370
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,010
What's going on?

371
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,500
Where am I?

372
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,730
Are you okay?

373
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,520
We are at the hospital.

374
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,860
Did that woman get caught?

375
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,280
- Yes. 
 - Are you okay?

376
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,030
Let me see.

377
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,390
How much did you get hurt?

378
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,490
In Yoon Joo...

379
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,740
- Yes? 
 - Worry about yourself, not me.

380
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,990
I'm glad you didn't get hurt more than this,

381
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,150
but you could've had a serious injury!

382
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,510
I mean...

383
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,730
Isn't it fine if both of us are okay?

384
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,580
Why are you so reckless?

385
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,800
Do you know how much I worried about you?

386
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,850
It's because I was worried about you!

387
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,590
Then, do you just do nothing when the person you love is in danger?

388
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,110
What did you just say?

389
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,550
I didn't say anything.

390
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,600
Also, you should go home now.

391
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,710
Thank you,

392
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,050
In Yoon Joo.

393
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,730
  Hong, a woman in her twenties, stalked the famous singer group LUNA's member Yoon Tae In for a long time,

394
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,160
  kidnapped him to her hideout,

395
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,470
  and now got arrested.

396
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,900
  According to the police investigation, Hong showed meticulousness

397
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,320
  by getting a job in Yoon Tae In's agency, MM Entertainment, to stalk him better.

398
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,580
 There's a live-in doctor in Yoon Tae In's team house!

399
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,980
  That woman is fake, and I'm the real one.

400
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,620
  I'm the only one who can fix his illness!

401
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,110
  Yoon Tae In is mine!

402
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,720
  You can't go anywhere!

403
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,520
Hey, we got on the first page of the news again.

404
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,420
Now we are on the social news section as well.

405
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,550
The entertainment news section is on fire, too.

406
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,270
Why?

407
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,150

408
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,160

409
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,900
Wow, what would we have done if my news also came out?

410
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,730
People would've said we already disbanded.

411
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm just kidding, just kidding.

412
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,990
Right. Let's not be bothered by those articles.

413
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,570
If it's not true, it's fine.

414
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,690
  I bought this since the clothes you were wearing got too dirty.

415
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,210
  I'll be back from going to the team house.

416
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,860
Mom, why are you doing this?

417
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,230
I can't leave you here.

418
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,250
Do you know how I raised you?

419
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,790
You should terminate the contract now, and let's sign a contract with Jang Entertainment!

420
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,920
Mom!

421
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,450
I can't stand this. I'll go and try to persuade his mother.

422
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,990
Mom!

423
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,770
Mom!

424
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,650
Mother! Yoo Chan's mother!

425
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,380
Can you please talk with me for a moment?

426
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,390
I have nothing to talk about with you guys. Get out of my way!

427
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,880
Mother, please! Wait!

428
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,040
Please! Yoo Chan Hyung says he doesn't want to,

429
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,920
so please don't do this.

430
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,450
Do I have to leave my son in this group of troublemakers?

431
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,080
- Mom, let's talk outside.  
 - Come out, now!

432
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,630
Mom, let's talk with me outside!

433
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,710
Hello.

434
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,460
Oh, it's great that I saw you, Tae In.

435
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,370
You tell me. Do I need to leave my son here?

436
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,440
Mom, stop it, please!

437
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,240
Why?

438
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,020
You only think of my son as a sidekick anyway.

439
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,120
Why do I have to leave Yoo Chan here when the team is like this?

440
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,930
Yes, what you told me is correct.

441
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,970
Yes, I knew you would understand.

442
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,350
Then let me take my son with me.

443
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,980
- Come out. 
 - Yoo Chan's mother, I'm sorry,

444
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,010
but I never thought of Yoo Chan Hyung as a sidekick.

445
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:36,340
I can't do anything by myself.

446
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:42,410
Forget about it. I know the best about my son.

447
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,330
He's not someone who should stay here like this!

448
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,980
Hurry up and follow me.

449
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,190
Mom, you're the one who thinks I'm your sidekick.

450
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,270
What? When did I?

451
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,270
Don't pretend you think of me.

452
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,240
You also don't care about what I like nor want!

453
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,000
What are you saying right now?

454
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,840
It's not the best decision for me to leave here.

455
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,350
It's the worst decision!

456
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,610
I tried my best to trust that you're doing this for me since you're my mom,

457
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,980
but this is not right.

458
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,020
I don't want to play the role of being your good son anymore.

459
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,550
This is our house.

460
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,620
Please leave now.

461
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,150
Yoo Chan! Yoo Chan!

462
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,520
What is it?

463
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,740
Your mother left.

464
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,210
I'm sorry.

465
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,430
I said rude things to you when I didn't even know your situation.

466
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,750
I should've done this earlier.

467
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,190
It was this easy.

468
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,470
As you said, I did hide on my mom's back.

469
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,730
When I do that again,

470
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,780
say rude things to me again. Okay?

471
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,580
Okay. That's my specialty.

472
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,280
  Right. What can I expect from you?

473
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,210
  You only think of us as your sidekicks.

474
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,790
  We are only here to play your music, am I wrong?!

475
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,210
  From tonight, let's practice again.

476
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,720
Unni, thank you.

477
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,830
Thanks to you, I could save Yoon Tae In–

478
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,820
If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have told you.

479
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,260
Please don't do reckless things for other people.

480
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,440
Protect yourself first, okay?

481
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,370
Okay.

482
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,630
How long are you staying in Korea?

483
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,550
I'm leaving soon.

484
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,020
You're going back to America soon.

485
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,810
What about you? What are you going to do from now on?

486
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,670
I have a lot of skillsets.

487
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,350
I can work as a tour guide again, and I can do some delivery work in between.

488
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm not asking what you can do.

489
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,600
What do you want to do?

490
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:14,380
I want you to live doing something that you really want to do.

491
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,630
Well...

492
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,240
I don't know what I want to do now.

493
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,480
Then, do you want to think about that in America?

494
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:41,420
I want to show you where I live as well.

495
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,000
Are you feeling better?

496
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,450
Yes. They say I can leave the hospital in a few days since I have no more issues.

497
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,790
  That's good to hear.

498
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,640
I'll come to the hospital right away when I'm done with practice.

499
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,060
Oh, my sister is here.

500
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,230
I'll stay with her tonight.

501
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,970
Okay.

502
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,580
I miss you, but I'll wait a bit.

503
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,950
  H-Hello?

504
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,690
Did it get hung up?

505
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,810
Then, good luck with your practice.

506
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:37,740
Also, I want to apologize to the other members in person.

507
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,020
I get it.

508
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,720
What? What did you just say, Yoon Tae In?

509
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,870
Let's make this album altogether.

510
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,660
If you're saying that because you felt bad about what my mom said, then just chill.

511
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,840
It's not because of what your mother said, but because of what you said.

512
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,720
Do you want to do it or not?

513
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,540
- I want to do it.
 - Okay.

514
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,980
If you want to do it–

515
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,300
- No, I want to do it, too.
- Okay.

516
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,440
Sure. Let's give it a try.

517
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:40,710
Then, I will start with the beat that I wanted to play.

518
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,720
♫   Paranoia  ♫

519
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,940
♫  Monday Feels good in the sun, it starts with D caffeine  ♫

520
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,730
♫  After a blood transfusion with coffee, only my head hurts  ♫

521
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:57,530
♫  Just like that I'm saying, I'm crazy and sick  ♫

522
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,820
♫  Like running on a treadmill, bang bang on a dizzying day  ♫

523
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,590
♫  Beyond the end of the sunset, all fatigue melts away  ♫

524
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:10,160
♫  Just like that I'm staying, in heaven and hell  ♫

525
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,460
♫  I need something, killing, healing, I have a feeling baby  ♫

526
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,950
♫  Something is missing, I just need some therapy   ♫

527
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,110
♫   Love Paranoia, two, love Paranoia   ♫

528
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,020
♫   Lift me up and drop me baby   ♫

529
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,040
♫   Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia   ♫

530
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,840
♫   It makes my heart flutter   ♫

531
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:40,040
♫  I'm delusional every time and sometimes I have a fantastic dream  ♫

532
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,880
♫   Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia    ♫

533
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,360
♫   I can never stop, Love Paranoia   ♫

534
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,590
What if we go funkier this time?

535
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,450
I want to make something chic like Brit-pop.

536
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,880
Retro is trendy these days. How about Synth-pop?

537
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,270
You're trying to play the keyboard a lot, aren't you?

538
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,030
We should make something that suits our band.

539
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
By the way,

540
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,550
why aren't Tae In Hyung and Doctor coming?

541
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,550
I'm more nervous than when I first came here.

542
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,640
Don't worry.

543
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,590
We made tonight's occasion because we missed you.

544
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,130
- We prepared this together to celebrate you getting out of the hospital.
 - Ah...

545
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,050
I bet all of you must be surprised.

546
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,590
I'm really sorry.

547
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,400
I should've known when your English pronunciation wasn't that good!

548
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,190
- Here, Doctor. 
 - Oh!

549
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,530
Thank you, Ga On.

550
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:30,630
Now that I think about it, you liked Korean food more than bread.

551
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,110
That's right. When she sang Amor Fati so well with me,

552
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,430
I did think it was a bit strange.

553
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,990
But then, can I call you Noona now instead of Doctor?

554
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,580
You are really...

555
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,920
Let's eat!

556
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,060
Please, go ahead and eat.

557
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,400
Thank you for the food!

558
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,270
Thank you for the food!

559
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,500
Noona, try this.

560
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,890
I said stop it.

561
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,540
Try this one, too.

562
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,130
Is this the place you wanted to come to?

563
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,440
Do you remember what I told you before?

564
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,350
I got consoled very much by listening to your music here before.

565
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:34,750
It was the day when I lost everything that I wished for in my life...

566
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:42,990
My sister, who I longed for my entire life, and the house that I really wanted to get back.

567
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,610
But do you know what?

568
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,750
What is it?

569
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,620
When I thought I had lost everything,

570
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,470
I met you here.

571
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,040
It's the same for me, too.

572
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:09,440
Now that I think about it, I met you here at the worst moment of my life.

573
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,610
Yoon Tae In,

574
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,400
thank you.

575
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:27,400
Thank you for liking me.

576
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,780
Out of all of my memories,

577
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:38,030
that's the happiest memory.

578
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:48,130
Is it just my feeling that it sounds like a past tense?

579
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:58,170
I'll go back to where I belong.

580
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,090
To the real In Yoon Joo.

581
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,200
What do you mean by that?

582
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:10,660
While I've been looking at you,

583
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,360
I also wanted to find what I really want to do.

584
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:19,200
Can't we find that together?

585
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:26,040
I decided to go to America with my sister.

586
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,290
I want to see where she lives, and I'll think about

587
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,770
what I really want to do with my life.

588
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,580
I think this is what I need the most right now.

589
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,340
How long?

590
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,810
Would it be okay if I wait for you?

591
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,640
I hope you have a nice life, Yoon Tae In.

592
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:46,770
Have a nice trip, In Yoon Joo.

593
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,400
- Hyung, wouldn't it be great if this part is like this? 
 - Oh, my...

594
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,400
You try so much to extend your part as much as possible!

595
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,660
It's not like that! I think it suits the song well.

596
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,480
- Do you think I'm like you? 
 - What?

597
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,990
My god, everyone, be quiet. For this part,

598
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,800
we should go like this.

599
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:32,460
How about putting a groovy base rhythm like this?

600
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,730
It brings up the mood, doesn't it?

601
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,360
Honestly, that's not the right rhythm for this song.

602
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,400
That's perfect! That's the best! I think I'm going to lose myself.

603
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,190
But stop doing what you individually want to do.

604
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,800
Let's think about it.

605
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
What would suit this song the most?

606
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,950
Let's think about what will be the best for this song, and–

607
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,520
Tae In, how about this?

608
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,030
Tae In!

609
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,360
Hyung, can't you just give this much to me?

610
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,310
Hey! Are you treating me as Hyung only in a time like this?

611
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,890
We should definitely go with this sound this time!

612
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,430
Honestly, that sound is not right for this song.

613
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,720
How can you say something that doesn't make any sense?

614
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,210
We should go with this rhythm!

615
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,820
We should go faster like this!

616
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,070

617
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,650
No, listen to this.

618
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,570
It should be simpler.

619
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,210
No, we should go more extravagant.

620
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,210
It should be like this!

621
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,310
This place doesn't taste like before.

622
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:55,460
I thought this was the only perfect restaurant in Korea.

623
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,560
What is perfect in this world?

624
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,030
What?

625
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:04,740
That's why you can only make that level of music.

626
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,550
Also, you go up and down on vulgar gossip every day.

627
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:13,960
If you had that much fun, it's enough.

628
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,130
Stop playing that tacky music

629
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:22,430
and come with me when I go back to Germany.

630
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:28,440
It's true that I started music because you liked it and said I was good at it,

631
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,760
but now I'm doing this because I like it.

632
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,970
That's what I'm saying. Why do you like such absurd music?

633
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:39,680
I'll send you my ticket instead of this one.

634
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,780
We're going to do a concert soon.

635
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,950
You don't have to come.

636
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,270
What are you doing here, Seo Woo Yeon? With Lee Shin as well?

637
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,870
What are you doing here?

638
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:25,200
We came here not that long ago as well.

639
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,350
What is up with you guys?

640
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,990
Did you hide something here?

641
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:31,720
I'm here because it's frustrating.

642
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:38,940
I thought if I came here, maybe I would get tons of ideas like before.

643
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,440
Now that I think about it, you played the first song you made for LUNA

644
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,350
from here, too.

645
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,610
  Did you write this song?

646
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:59,490
  Oh, it's amazing. It's good, Hyung.

647
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,620
  Wow, Yoon Tae In!

648
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,610

(Demo)

649
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,970
  Then, is this song going to be in our debut album?

650
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,400
  Well, maybe.

651
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,920
  But can't you step away from me a little bit?

652
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,230
  Seriously!

653
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:37,180
What is this unusual atmosphere?

654
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:43,290
Why? It's good. Let's call Yoo Chan Hyung and Ga On, too.

655
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,370
Then, shall we...

656
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,620
start again from here?

657
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,120
The song "Let Me Be Your Night" came out from here?

658
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,620
I'm a bit jealous! I wish I were there with you guys.

659
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,170
Hey! I wasn't with them at that time, either!

660
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,340
But why did you call us here as well?

661
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:12,960
I thought, what if we start this new album from here again.

662
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,570
We went through a lot,

663
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,640
but let's pick the concept from our beginning like when we first debuted.

664
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,840
How does that sound?

665
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,100
When we debuted...

666
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,350
The first debut stage was a stage in a club with ten guests.

667
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:36,380
I thought my heart would explode at that time.

668
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,190
- But that time was really fun. 
 - Oh!

669
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:43,810
Hey, Woo Ga On. You always went around big stadiums, so you don't know that feeling, do you?

670
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,820
Don't do that to him.

671
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,120
I want to play on club stages, too!

672
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,880
Wherever it is, I wish we could do a concert soon.

673
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,580
With my feelings right now, I could perform a hundred times.

674
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,860
Then we should do that.

675
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,290
Like the beginning, let's perform on small stages.

676
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,540
I love it! That's on my bucket list.

677
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,320
But wouldn't our fans be upset about that?

678
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,950
If we perform in small spaces, a lot of them can't come.

679
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:12,400
Then we can perform more like a hundred or two hundred shows.

680
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,780
That sounds great.

681
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,790
Even so, I hope you're joking about performing 200 times.

682
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,800
On that note, let's go.

683
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,740
- Where? 
 - To the practice room.

684
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,400
What?

685
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:28,410
Why do you make us go back and forth!

686
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,110
Are you coming or not?

687
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,410
Yoo Chan is coming!

688
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,680
Let's change it a little bit this way.

689
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,830
Should I go like this?

690
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,370
I think that's great!

691
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,880
How does this sound?

692
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,670
I think this will be good.

693
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,040
Are you all ready?

694
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,680
Then, let's start.

695
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,830
Okay!

696
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,150
♫   The heart-pounding night   ♫

697
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,840
♫   I want to give it to you   ♫

698
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:42,770
♫   Actually, I was stuck in the fear every day  ♫

699
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:48,760
♫   A great day felt like a vague dream   ♫

700
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,620
♫   Those days are in the past. I only need you   ♫

701
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:59,160
♫   I figured out what's important. The thing that doesn't come back   ♫

702
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,290
♫   The time that we were together   ♫

703
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,850
♫   Oh, baby  ♫

704
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:10,370
♫  Rock and roll tonight  ♫

705
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:16,340
♫   We ran for this moment. Forget about the tears  ♫

706
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,770
♫  Take us to a ride  ♫

707
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:28,200
♫   It's rock and roll for you and I   ♫

708
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,580
♫   Baby, rock and roll   ♫

709
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,210
Let's sing it together!

710
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,730
♫   The face you hid, the feelings that you covered   ♫

711
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,390
♫  I was frozen in my clumsy days  ♫

712
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:54,730
♫  I started changing after I met you  ♫

713
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:57,500

714
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:03,740
- Oh gosh, look at him.
 - Oh my god.

715
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:08,400
♫   The dream stage, we'll be your stars   ♫

716
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:14,250
♫   Now that I know you, in your warmth  ♫

717
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:19,200
Be careful.

718
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,300
♫   Oh, baby   ♫

719
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,780

720
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,300
Shin, let's go.

721
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:31,000
♫   We ran for this moment. Forget about the tears   ♫

722
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,010
♫  Take us through a ride. You and I  ♫

723
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,340

724
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,860
♫   It's rock and roll for you and I   ♫

725
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,510
  I opened my own studio. Come visit!

726
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:45,830
  Can I come today?

727
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:46,550
  Congrats.

728
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:48,060
  Do you need anything for your studio?

729
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,090
  But why is Yoo Chan Hyung quiet? It's unusual.

730
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,650

731
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,360
What are you going to say?

732
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,710
Are you going to slap Yoon Sung Ho, that bastard's, face?

733
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:02,560
Let's do it with me, the real relationship.

734
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,790
Let's cut.

735
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,040
Let's cut!

736
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,360
- Soon Nam Hyung! 
 - Hurry up.

737
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,080
♫   Tinted my nights with your light   ♫

738
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,500
♫   Please stay as you are right now   ♫

739
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,820
♫   Always smile and stay next to me all the time  ♫

740
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,660
Again!

741
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:22,160
♫  Rock and roll tonight  ♫

742
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:28,100
♫   We ran for this moment. Forget about the tears   ♫

743
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:32,550
♫  Take us to a ride  ♫

744
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:40,030
♫  Don't let anyone from stopping us from our rock and roll  ♫

745
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:45,200
♫   Baby, rock and roll   ♫

746
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,620

747
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,720
It was LUNA until now!

748
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,210
Thank you so much!

749
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,040
Encore! Encore!

750
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,070
Encore! Encore!

751
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,370
Hey!

752
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,760
Look at this.

753
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,200
Look! Isn't my Yoo Chan so cute?

754
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,570
What is this? He's not a human, but a fairy!

755
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:53,030
When did your favorite switch to Yoo Chan?

756
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:56,590
The favorite member is something that goes around.

757
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:06,540
But does Yoon Tae In know that you came back to Korea?

758
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,520
I said we should go to the concert together.

759
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:13,010
If I want to see him, I can search and look at him any time.

760
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,700
- I'll get going. 
 - Where are you going?

761
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,680
I have to go to a part-time job and register for a class.

762
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,670
I'm very busy today.

763
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:20,590
See you later!

764
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:22,150
Why don't you eat before you go?

765
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,170
I'll call you!

766
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,030
What? Are you also LUNA's fan?

767
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:10,020
Yes, I'm also Moonlight.

768
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,830

769
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:49,210

770
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:52,040

771
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,380
This painting is

772
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,590
by Danwon Kim Hong Do,

773
01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:00,920
and it depicts a boy and a deer meeting inside the mountain.

774
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,600
It's rare to see a human, animal,

775
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:08,300
and nature in one painting,

776
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,170
so this is considered a national treasure level piece.

777
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:12,810
Please follow me this way.

778
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:16,630
You can continue in that direction. I hope you enjoy the rest of the show.

779
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,380
Yoon Joo...

780
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,410
- Ms. Cho Rong! Did you finish your counseling? 
 - Yes.

781
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:24,990
How was it?

782
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:29,420
It wasn't that great. It's way more fun to play card games with you.

783
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:35,710
Are you going to do the work like people sitting over there?

784
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:38,810
Yes, but it's in the far future.

785
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,920
For you, I'll do it for free for the rest of your life.

786
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,430
You are saying something obvious!

787
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:48,460
You are very strong, Ms. Cho Rong.

788
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,590
Excuse me one second.

789
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:54,030

790
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,870
Yes, Unni.

791
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:00,880
  The green-gated house that we used to live in.

792
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,890
  The owner changed, so they are looking for a monthly renter.

793
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:07,360
  Will you go check out the place?

794
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,370
Excuse me.

795
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:17,170
I'm here to sign the rent.

796
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,170
It's ten million won  (~$10k)  for security

797
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,070
and monthly rent of 600,000 won  ($600) .

798
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,010
Why are you not saying anything?

799
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:36,430
Okay, okay, then what about 500,000?  ($500)

800
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,020
There's no place like this in Seoul.

801
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,170
I can't discount it for you anymore.

802
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:52,480
Yoon Tae In...

803
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,800
It's been a while, In Yoon Joo.

804
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:05,960

01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:30,990
 Thanks to all our subbers, both English and other languages

809
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:35,950

01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,130
♫  After a blood transfusion with coffee, only my head hurts  ♫

01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,220
♫  Like running on a treadmill, bang bang on a dizzying day  ♫

01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,000
♫  Beyond the end of the sunset, all fatigue melts away  ♫

819
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,530
♫  Just like that I'm staying, in heaven and hell  ♫

01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:23,690
♫  I need something, killing, healing, I have a feeling baby  ♫
