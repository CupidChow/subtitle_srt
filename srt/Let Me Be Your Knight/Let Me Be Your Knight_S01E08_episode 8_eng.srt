1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,270

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,020

3
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,660

4
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,980
Did you sleep well yesterday?

5
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,740
Am I able to get good sleep if I found my family?

6
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,400
You know, the problem.

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,550
You have told me to search for the underlying cause.

8
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,920
Yes, but

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,250
I didn't know that you were going to come so suddenly.

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,010
I wanted to solve this lifelong homework of mine.

11
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,650
Thank you for coming with me.

12
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,970
I appreciate it.

13
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,780
And I'm also glad that you're staying in Korea just in time.

14
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,100
I miss you.

15
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,080
I missed you.

16
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,930
Hey, what exactly is the difference between these two?

17
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:04,280
"I miss you," expresses the present longing as you haven't met them yet.

18
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,850
"I missed you," is a message of deep longing.

19
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,370
This is siad when people see each other after a long time.

20
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,120
You're right.

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,800
In that case,

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,390
all I have to do is to practice saying,

23
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,190
I missed you.

24
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,190
I missed you.

25
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,440
But this meeting might not be a cheerful one.

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,550
It seems like you have your hopes up. It worries me.

27
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,990
It's okay.

28
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,230
I don't care what type of person my mother is.

29
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,130
Dr. Kang Sun Joo

30
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,290
 Woo Yeon, I'm in front of the hotel now.

31
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,480
Where are you?

32
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,810
I'm right here.

33
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,490
I'm a little late, right?

34
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,570
It was good if you called me a little earlier.

35
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,850
What happened? 
  Did he find out that I was not in the hotel?

36
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,000
 Why is he looking at me like this?

37
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,240
You must be hungry.

38
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,890

39
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,450
You wanted to stop by here?

40
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,930
Yes. We always end up eating in the dorm.

41
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,240
I see. But is it okay to come to a place like this with me?

42
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,340
What if some malicious rumor starts from being with me?

43
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,170
It's alright since I know the owner of this restaurant.

44
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,590
No other customers will come except us.

45
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,440
I don't know if this will be to your taste.

46
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,280
This salad is made with our restaurant's specialty dressing,

47
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,370
so hopefully you will like it.

48
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,680
Yeah. Thank you.

49
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,290
Thank you.

50
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,690
Just let me know if you need anything.

51
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,940
What?

52
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,470
What did you just say?

53
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,610
Earlier,

54
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,930
I saw you, Dr. Kang.

55
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,700
When and where?

56
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,720
The day when it was raining.

57
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,610
At an old bookstore.

58
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,500
At the old bookstore on a rainy day?

59
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,950
I see. The bookstore my dad used to go to...

60
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,020
But you were there at that time?

61
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,750
 It's like I'm with my dad.

62
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,450
That's strange. I don't think I saw you though.

63
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,470
Maybe at that time...

64
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,810
did something happen between us?

65
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,500
No.

66
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,660
Nothing much happened.

67
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,230
Then...

68
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,840
why haven't you told me earlier?

69
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,540
I was hoping that you would recognize me first.

70
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,910
Please help yourself.

71
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,860
Yeah.

72
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,660
Is she still sleeping?

73
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,890
 The number you are trying to reach is turned off...

74
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,690
What is this?

75
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,290
Is this Hyatt hotel?

76
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,010
Do you know if Dr. Kang Sun Joo has already checked out?

77
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,200
Actually, I'm not able to contact her suddenly.

78
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,220
Yoon Tae In.

79
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,720
Are you going somewhere?

80
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,310
Where are you both arriving from with your phone off?

81
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,860
What?

82
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,510
Oh, it was turned off.

83
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,630
Have you called?

84
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,840
Did you forget that I asked you to come in early today?

85
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,970
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,640
Don't say anything to Dr. Kang.

87
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,260
I went to pick her up without telling her.

88
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,630
Why did you do that?

89
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,610
Do I even have to get your permission for that kind of stuff, too?

90
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
What?

91
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,390
It was no big deal. What's the problem?

92
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,540
Let's go in.

93
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,400
No big deal?

94
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,900
Yoon Tae In. Yoon Tae In.

95
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,060
I'm sorry for being late.

96
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,550
Was there something important in the morning by any chance?

97
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,960
You looked like you dressed up for an important meeting with Woo Yeon.

98
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,570
It's not like that.

99
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,550
Woo Yeon suddenly came to pick me up

100
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,720
so we had breakfast together. That's all.

101
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,340
Hey, Yoon Tae In. What do you want me to do?

102
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,210
Yoo Chan.

103
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,360
What's that?

104
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,950
Beats me. He never cooks.

105
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,860
He is neither eating it nor cleaning up.

106
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,460
Maybe he wanted to kill someone and changed his mind.

107
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,000

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,910

109
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,720
 In our sleep, our brains solve problems that we face during the day.

110
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,770
 In other words, sleep is the time for the mind to...

111
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,780
Dr. Kang Sun Joo.

112
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,560
 Hey, it's me.

113
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,580
Yes, Woo Yeon, what is it this time?

114
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,570
There's something I want to ask.

115
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,670
How did you first find out about Dr. Kang Sun Joo?

116
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,580
After Tae In fainted, Dr. Jung introduced her to the CEO.

117
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,590
At that time, the fact that Dr. Kang was in Korea had to be a secret, right?

118
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,160
Yes, and we requested to keep Tae In's condition a secret, too.

119
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,660
Why did Dr. Jung insist to keep it a secret?

120
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,310
 I'm not sure.

121
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,070
All I know is she only works with V.I.P. clients, which is probably why she's so hush, hush.

122
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,880
 Why did you want to know? Is there a problem?

123
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,460
Not at all, thanks for the information.

124
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,850
If this person is the real Kang Sun Joo, then...

125
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,510
Who is the Dr. Kang with us?

126
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,730
I added a spoonful of honey to the milk. I heard it will help you sleep better.

127
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,990
Alright, thanks... leave it and go.

128
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:17,200
I had no idea that you made me breakfast and were waiting for me.

129
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,300
Excuse me? I never made you breakfast.

130
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,210
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,460
I know the effort it took to make this milk is not as much as you making kimchi fried rice, but...

132
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,010
Wait a minute...

133
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,490
Kimchi fried rice?

134
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,760
Oh, that's not right?

135
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Then it must be kimchi jeon?  (Kimchi pancake)

136
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,100
Kimchi jeon?

137
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,210
Oh, I see... It wasn't kimchi.

138
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,760
But it looked like kimchi for sure.

139
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,880
Was it kimchi porridge?

140
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,200
Scrambled eggs! It was scrambled eggs.

141
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,440
Hey, how could you think...

142
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,580
How did they turn into kimchi?

143
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,120
Wow, those were scrambled eggs?

144
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,450
See, you did make me breakfast.

145
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,430
Go away, I'm busy.

146
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,730
Will you make me breakfast again sometime? I want to taste them.

147
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,790
I said I'm busy.

148
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,890
Okay, I'm going.

149
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,670
Hold on a second.

150
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,590
Make sure to shut the door on your way out.

151
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,590
What a relief to see he's sleeping so well.

152
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,540

153
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,670
We're shooting for the new album release date to be early next year.

154
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,990
When will the songs be ready? Do you have a concept yet?

155
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,890
I'm working on it.

156
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,800
To be honest with you... Eddie offered to work with us on a project.

157
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,400
Eddie... Do you mean Eddie Raymon?

158
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,320
Seriously?

159
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,470
Woah! I woke up to one of his songs just this morning.

160
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,780
Ga On, you listen to him in the shower all the time.

161
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,900
I'm so in!

162
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,660
He's the hottest producer these days, so I listen to his music... but that's it.

163
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,540
I'll take it into consideration.

164
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:26,850
Doctor, how is Tae In doing these days?

165
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,290
He really needs to get to work on his next album. Can you tell me his progress?

166
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,870
Oh...

167
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,470
He hasn't shown any symptoms since the Green Concert,

168
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,610
and he's been sleeping without issues lately.

169
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,640
Is that right?

170
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,250
You've worked with him for almost a month, as promised. I was concerned.

171
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,590
Will he be all right after you leave?

172
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,350
True, the month's almost over.

173
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,560
Yes, you're such a great doctor! A renowned one!

174
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,060
Come in.

175
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,450
Mr. Moon...

176
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,170
- Ta Da! 
 - Oh look who's here! It's Nina!

177
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,500
- Yes! 
 - My Goodness!

178
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,550
I missed you.

179
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,770
- Did everything turn out well? 
 - Of course it did.

180
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,420
That's great! Have you eaten?

181
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,260
Can't you smell kimchi stew all over me?

182
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,920
I just love Korean food. I had to indulge as soon as I landed.

183
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,750
Good job!

184
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,530
I see you have a visitor. Who is this?

185
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,950
Well...

186
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,920
I'm a new manager for LUNA. My name is Kang Sun Joo.

187
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,860
This is an artist from our company, Nina.

188
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,280
There's so much hard work to do if you're LUNA's manager.

189
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,340
Tae In is a picky one, isn't he?

190
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,960
Yes.

191
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,180
No, not at all.

192
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,070
Be good to her.

193
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,820
But where are they?

194
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,750
That's it for now.

195
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,950
I'll tell Eddie that we're looking positively toward the offer.

196
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,800
Thank you.

197
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,300
Thank you.

198
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,270
This way.

199
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,560
Hey, Yoon Tae In, I'm here. How dare you sit still and not get up?

200
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,340
You startled me.

201
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,280
Hey, you!

202
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,250
When did you come?

203
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,960
Just now. Have you all been well?

204
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,800
Yes. How about you? Are you preparing for your album in America?

205
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,690
Of course. This album is going to be insane.

206
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,860
You said that last time, too.

207
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,380
That's why it was good, wasn't it?

208
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,300
Of course. It was so good. Don't you have any presents for us?

209
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,310
You are going to love this! Obviously, I have some.

210
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,050
Wow. What is it?

211
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,520
I brought everything that was piled up in the corner in Walmart in America.

212
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,020
I did well, right?

213
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,800
This is such a good album.

214
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,870
I just couldn't watch them rotting away in the corner of a store.

215
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,130
Yoon Tae In,

216
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,240
of all the songs I've heard from LUNA, "Midnight Fantasy" is my favorite.

217
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,080
Can I make a cover and upload it?

218
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,620
As if!

219
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,210
Please let me do it!

220
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,310
- Don't do it. 
 - I'm going to do it! I will! I will!

221
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,140
Go now.

222
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,980
Do you also want to take one, Manager?

223
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,690
Of course. Thank you.

224
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,450
Manager.

225
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,700
Manager, can you also get us

226
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,100
3 or 4 cups of coffee, please?

227
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,850
Also, please close the door as you leave.

228
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,740
Why not?

229
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,330
I've never seen Yoon Tae In behave like this.

230
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,590

231
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,400
The weather has been great. Did you guys go on a vacation?

232
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,840
What vacation? We have to prepare for the next album.

233
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,940
You're crazy.

234
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,560
Seriously. Are you all born just to work?

235
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,410
Aren't you born to be happy?

236
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,130
You're starting again. The preacher of Happiness.

237
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,070
I'm going crazy.

238
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,720
Thank you so much.

239
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,020
You're really looking like a manager, Dr. Kang.

240
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,090
I'm going crazy. This must be a sign.

241
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,210
The sign that we have to go to the beach. Let's go to the beach.

242
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,140
We'll be happier if we go to the beach.

243
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,120
Then, the preparation for the next album will go even better.

244
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,000
Trust me on this, and let's go!

245
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,610
Huh?

246
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,700
♫  Paranoia  ♫

247
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,020
♫  Monday Feels good in the sun, it starts with D caffeine  ♫

248
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,900
♫  After a blood transfusion with coffee, only my head hurts  ♫

249
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,780
♫  Just like that I'm saying, I'm crazy and sick  ♫

250
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,830
♫  Just like that I'm saying, I'm crazy and sick  ♫

251
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,640
Yay, the beach!

252
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,920
♫  Like running on a treadmill, bang bang on a dizzying day  ♫

253
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,750
♫  Beyond the end of the sunset, all fatigue melts away  ♫

254
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,230
♫  Just like that I'm staying, in heaven and hell  ♫

255
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,800
Let's go!

256
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,010
♫  Just like that I'm staying, in heaven and hell, yeah  ♫

257
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,990
Aren't you even getting your feet wet?

258
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,970
No way, not happening!

259
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,290
I hate playing in water.

260
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,440
No! Don't do it!

261
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,010
- Don't you dare! 
 - Come here.

262
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,970
Come on... Grab onto anyone.

263
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,180
Tae In,

264
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,120
come play with us.

265
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,430
Not interested. Play by yourselves.

266
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,120
- Go, go, go.  
- Come on.

267
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,100
Come here.

268
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,510
- Come on.
 - Ready?

269
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,730
1... 2... 3! Get him!

270
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,160
Let's go!

271
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,150
Don't do it!

272
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,250
Seriously?

273
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,330
- Hey! 
 - You!

274
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,190
No!

275
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,900
You!

276
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,630
♫  I'm delusional every time   ♫

277
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,020
Woah!

278
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,540
- Your turn! 
 - Pick him up!

279
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,030
Get him!

280
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,770
Throw!

281
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,360
No, don't!

282
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,280
Wait, hold on!

283
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,860
Hey!

284
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,420
Get him! Get him!

285
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,560
Get him!

286
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,930
What's this?

287
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,770
I thought he didn't want to play.

288
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,960
♫  It didn't seem like a dream
it was a dream that felt like reality  ♫

289
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,930
♫  If everything comes true like this dream  ♫

290
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,300
What are you doing by yourself?

291
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,620
Now that I've dunked myself in,

292
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,640
the water is really cold.

293
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,790
We could catch a cold.

294
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,370
Dr. Kang!

295
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,580
No, don't do it!

296
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,970
- Don't! 
 - Get over here!

297
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,590
- Get her! 
- No!

298
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,270
- Don't do it! 
 - Come here!

299
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,630
No!

300
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,600
No way!

301
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,320
No... Not Dr. Kang!

302
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,570
I'm telling you I arrived.

303
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,230
What is it that you want today?

304
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,520
 It's not like that.

305
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,980
 Let's just have a meal together.

306
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,090
Oh, my son came.

307
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,450
I have a plan with the guys today.

308
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,490
CEO Jang?

309
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,940
Do it.

310
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,720
You go there.

311
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,810
What are you doing?

312
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,690
I got it!

313
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,250
Yeah.

314
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,790
Gosh.

315
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,930
Look at him!

316
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,160
Got it!

317
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,060
Yay!

318
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,860
Are you all right?

319
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,880
I didn't know there was a beach so close to Seoul.

320
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
Right?

321
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,820
It was all mudflats here in the old times.

322
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,440
Oh,

323
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,130
have you been before?

324
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,400
Oh.

325
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,080
When I was little.

326
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,000
It's nice to be out here though.

327
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,520
Right? We made a great decision to come here.

328
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,140
When will Yoo Chan come?

329
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,480
He'll come soon after running some errands.

330
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,580
There you go.

331
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,540
Because of the poor response to the last album,

332
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,090
I heard that Tae In fainted, so I changed my schedule to come back earlier.

333
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,660
But I'm glad the atmosphere isn't as gloomy as I expected.

334
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,040
Oh, I see. You come back early for a reason.

335
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,680
You must be so close to Tae In.

336
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,650
Of course.

337
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,340
We've been friends from the age of 15.

338
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,300
We studied music together in the States.

339
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,430
Wow.

340
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,690
You two

341
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,740
have been friends for a long time.

342
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,850
When I listened to a song composed by Tae In in class,

343
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,880
I was so moved.

344
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,150
At that time we didn't even know each other's names,

345
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,600
but I went up to him and said,

346
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,270
"You're a genius!"

347
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,350
I said that,

348
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,440
and we became close.

349
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
I'm probably the first fan of Tae In.

350
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,900
 How did you start your music?

351
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,760
 Because someone liked it.

352
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,030
 Someone said that it's good.

353
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,010
 Who?

354
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,990
 There is one person.

355
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,930
You must be

356
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,600
a special person to Tae In.

357
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,110
Is that so?

358
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,940
He came all the way here, and...

359
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,270
Really.

360
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,830
Gosh.

361
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,710
Is it your latest song?

362
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,980
I like it.

363
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,790
I can't get the lyrics right though.

364
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,000
When you can't write, think about the starting point.

365
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,580
What begins with ocean,

366
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,990
ends with ocean.

367
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,310
Starting point.

368
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,530
Yoo Chan takes after his mom.

369
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,820
Gosh, CEO.

370
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,210
Shall we toast?

371
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,170
- Yeah. 
 - Yeah.

372
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,440
Yeah.

373
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,320
I've been

374
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,620
thinking this for a while.

375
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,290
You are too handsome

376
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,010
to be behind the drum set.

377
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,170
You have an actor's face.

378
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,240
Exactly.

379
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,780
He was known as the nation's son,

380
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,170
and at that time he couldn't even get out of the house freely.

381
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,140
Mom, that was so long ago.

382
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,150
No,

383
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,130
so many people still remember and miss that young boy.

384
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,930
Now,

385
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,340
I'm Kim Yoo Chan of LUNA.

386
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,210
Oh, I'm not just saying this.

387
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,910
Now I'm going to

388
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,970
produce a film. You must know director Baek Jin Hyuk.

389
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,680
Director Baek is

390
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,800
very interested in you, Yoo Chan.

391
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,310
Director Baek is?

392
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,570
It's great.

393
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,410
I'm sorry, but I didn't know anything about this when I came here today.

394
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,080
I must first talk to our company about this.

395
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,410
For now,

396
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,950
just read this first.

397
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,950

398
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,780
You know well that I can't make a decision about this on my own.

399
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,080
Also, my schedule is busy because of the upcoming new album release.

400
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,710
It's hard for me.

401
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,350
I'm really sorry.

402
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,420
Until when do you think you can be in LUNA?

403
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,270
Yoon Tae In will become a producer after retiring.

404
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,940
What about you?

405
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,130
Everybody is racking their brains to find a way to survive on their own.

406
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,330
What if you try to be loyal all by yourself and then get left alone?

407
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,440
Even if you regret it at that time,

408
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,800
this opportunity will not come back.

409
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,030
Yoo Chan, take this with you and look through it.

410
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,990
We've rented the entire place,

411
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,540
so think of it as your long-awaited vacation and take it easy.

412
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,470
And

413
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,720
each person will get his or her own room.

414
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,180
If there's anything else you need, please let me know.

415
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,730
Hey, Yoon Tae In.

416
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,710
Your room is right next to mine. I'll go visit you later.

417
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,810
No need. Don't come.

418
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,420
All right, I'll come as soon as I can.

419
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,200
I'll see you a little later.

420
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,530
Okay.

421
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,540
Oh, hi.

422
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,760
You are next to my room.

423
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,650
Oh...

424
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,010
Come visit me later.

425
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,330
Okay.

426
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,010
Manager,

427
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,620
do you have a boyfriend by any chance?

428
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,950
Pardon?

429
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,810
No, I don't.

430
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,350
How about you, Nina?

431
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,820
Well, sometimes I do and other times I don't.

432
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,760
Should I introduce a guy to you?

433
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,880
Oh, no.

434
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,120
What type of man do you like?

435
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,950
Oh,

436
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,100
among the five LUNA members,

437
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,780
who is your ideal style?

438
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,670
Oh,

439
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,610
I'm not sure.

440
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,250
How about you, Nina?

441
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,560
My preference is Yoon Tae In.

442
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,690
That's why we dated briefly.

443
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,570
What?

444
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,820
You guys dated?

445
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,760
Oh...

446
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,250
W-When?

447
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,150
Just briefly when we were young.

448
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,580
We're just friends now.

449
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,690
Why?

450
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,100
Do you also like Yoon Tae In's style?

451
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,780
Oh, no! I am...

452
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,640
Well, I...

453
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,190
like a nice guy! A nice guy.

454
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,020
A nice guy...

455
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,390
What are you doing here?

456
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,320
Are you writing lyrics?

457
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,010
Well, yes.

458
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,420
Since we came all the way here, you should have a break.

459
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,510
Don't push yourself too much.

460
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,400
I'm not pushing myself.

461
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:10,200
By the way, Tae In. How is your condition these days?

462
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,180
Don't worry about me. I don't have any symptoms and can sleep pretty well.

463
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,920
Is that so?

464
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,780
Then the Doctor helped.

465
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,410
I guess so since she's the professional.

466
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,180
Then, is everything okay without any trouble?

467
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,980
What are you talking about?

468
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,610
What?

469
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,700
It's nothing.

470
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,600
It's been almost a month since the Doctor came, and you said you're almost cured.

471
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,820
I thought it was a relief.

472
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,440
I have something to ask you.

473
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,520
What is it?

474
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,490
Am I completely cured?

475
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,650
- Excuse me? 
 - When you diagnose as a doctor,

476
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,340
is my disease completely treated?

477
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,860
Don't you feel a lot better?

478
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,430
But I don't think it's okay for you to leave right away.

479
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,950
Why? Did sleepwalking happen again when I wasn't around?

480
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,870
It's not that.

481
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,130
I'm asking if you can stay by my side even if I don't need your treatment anymore.

482
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,820
  Please stay by my side

483
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,380
What do you mean by that?

484
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,190
I mean... That is...

485
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,230
It's something like...

486
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,470
an after-service.

487
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:17,750
We don't know when my symptoms might come back. This illness doesn't get cured completely.

488
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,350
Also, what is it? The activities for the new album.

489
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,860
I can't affect that with my symptoms.

490
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,170
You're saying "stay by my side" habitually.

491
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,250
Did I? When did I do that?

492
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,580
Forget about it.

493
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,520
Tell me. When did I say that?

494
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,200
I'll get going. I don't want to stay next to you anymore.

495
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:46,970
What's wrong for a patient to ask the doctor to stay by my side?

496
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,340
- You're my doctor. 
 - Forget about it!

497
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,340
I'm going to leave right when the contract ends.

498
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,390
Excuse me?

499
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,360
What was I expecting?

500
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,580
Did I do something wrong just now?

501
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,180
Hyung! Over here!

502
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,170
Why did you come so late?

503
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,020
Oh... I just had to go somewhere.

504
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,460
Did you meet up with someone?

505
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,080
Yes, just somebody.

506
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,690
What were you doing to come late?

507
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,740
I just did something!

508
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,350
Hey, Woo Ga! I got your favorite beef-thin skirt!

509
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,400
It's amazing!

510
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,430
Hyung,

511
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,470
did you change your perfume?

512
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,090
What?

513
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,800
It smells like an old guy's perfume scent.

514
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,440
Let's go!

515
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,150
Come quickly!

516
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,870
You want to be in the movie with no pay?

517
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,020
Yes. I heard they don't have that much budget since it's an independent movie.

518
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,840
But I like the script so much, so I really want to be in it.

519
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,430
As a side character,

520
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,370
not even the main character? In this independent amateur movie?

521
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,740
I know that I can't be the main character in TV series anymore.

522
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,360
So I decided to give up the eagerness to be the main character and go back to my original intention

523
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,270
and rebuild my career again.

524
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,090
You're really funny.

525
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,930
When you were getting married, you acted as if you would retire from acting.

526
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,280
But now that you got divorced, you're acting like an actor now.

527
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
It's not like that.

528
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,160
Sure. It's fine.

529
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,490
I heard that musicians break up on purpose to make great music.

530
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,760
I bet you did something like that.

531
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,240
- CEO. 
 - Hey!

532
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,040
If I let you do the radio show comfortably until now,

533
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,400
then don't you need to go out and make some money now?

534
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,070
In your situation now,

535
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:01,270
this is suitable. How dare you talk about an independent movie?

536
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,690

537
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,700
I'll get going now.

538
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,510
- We have more meat, right? 
 - Yes, there's a lot more.

539
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,050
  Where are you? It looks amazing.

540
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,070
  We're at Ansan Glamping place.

541
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,700
  Let's come here together next time.

542
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,760
Ga On, come here.

543
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,570
Have a seat.

544
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,200
Come here.

545
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,110
It smells delicious!

546
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,030
It is. I guess they are grilling already.

547
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,270
Hey, what is up with your unhappy face?

548
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,270
Was this seat taken?

549
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,950
No.

550
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,920
Oppa, why did you come so late?

551
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,500
Since you weren't here, it was so quiet.

552
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,990
Hey, it's because I'm tired right now.

553
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,940
I'll fill in my stomach and fill in the audio for you.

554
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,800
It looks great!

555
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,080
That's right! Did you hear from Jimmy? I heard that he's back in Korea.

556
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,580
Is that so? But why did he not call me?

557
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,170
I bet he's busy. Before he goes back to New York, let's hang out, the three of us.

558
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,810
Sure.

559
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,340
Why are you not eating?

560
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,900
The meat is very juicy!

561
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,180
It's good, right? It's delicious!

562
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,710
- Let's do cheers! 
 - Yes!

563
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,120
What do you want to drink?

564
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,430
Soju.

565
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,770
Oh, you're going strong.

566
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,450
You guys are beaming...

567
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,410
 Yes, let's drink and die today.

568
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,380
Lasers out from your eyes.

569
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,030
I really don't like Tae In Hyung dating someone,

570
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,120
but if it's Nina Noona, then I might be able to understand.

571
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,910
I think they are just friends.

572
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,060
Don't you think so?

573
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,630
No.

574
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,890
Did you get stronger with alcohol?

575
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,020
I can keep up with you.

576
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,810
They look great together.

577
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,090
I think you, Doctor–

578
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:41,200
He looks better with you, Manager.

579
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,300
That's not true!

580
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,970
That's totally not true!

581
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,850
Never ever would she be Tae In's type!

582
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,800
Is that so? What's Yoon Tae In's type, then?

583
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,900
That's...

584
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,770
My Ga On doesn't know anything about dating yet. Right?

585
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,930
I don't know anything about it, either.

586
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,940
You got so skinny. Here.

587
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,020
Why don't you sit down and rest? I'm a bit steaming right now.

588
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,750
I think I need to grill in front of the fire.

589
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,400
You don't need to do this, Doctor.

590
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,600
I'm fine, so please have a seat and enjoy the food.

591
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,410
Just let me do it.

592
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,350
Manager! Oh, gosh!

593
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,370
Can I have some more meat..?

594
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,380
- Hey. 
 - What?

595
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,440
Woo Yeon doesn't have a girlfriend, does he?

596
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,450
I don't think so.

597
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,980
They look cute together, don't you think so?

598
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,430
Should I connect them?

599
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,030
- What? 
 - I heard that Manager's type is a kind man.

600
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,220
Who's nicer than Seo Woo Yeon?

601
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,950
- A kind man? 
 - Yes!

602
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,420
It means you're definitely not her type.

603
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,350
If I do something like this, can I become a kind man as well?

604
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,910
Stop it.

605
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,750
Don't do something like this. Hey!

606
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,880
Here's some meat.

607
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,870
Excuse me?

608
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,130
It's lamb. Tae In can't eat lamb.

609
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,490
He's very picky.

610
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,250
Is that so?

611
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,760
I didn't know about that.

612
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,310
What are you saying?

613
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,740
I love lamb the most.

614
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,410
Look.

615
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,120
Did you just see me? It's delicious. Do you want some?

616
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,530
- I'll eat it on my own. 
 - Try it.

617
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,860
I'll eat it on my own!

618
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,210
- No, you just eat it. 
 - Shall I?

619
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,210
Shin Oppa!

620
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,140
How did she come here?

621
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,530
Hyo Bin's manager was asking about our schedule, so...

622
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,410
I didn't know she'd really come!

623
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,280
What's going on?

624
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,450
Am I an unwelcome guest?

625
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,780
Why are you asking when you know already?

626
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,080
Unni, when did you come to Korea?

627
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,410
Yesterday.

628
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,870
It seems like nobody's welcoming you,

629
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:41,090
but eat before you go since you're here.

630
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,320
What is it? How can you eat delicious food by yourself?

631
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,800
Let me have some, too!

632
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,770
Come out for a second.

633
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:21,670
What is it? Did you want to be alone with me?

634
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,900
Why did you come here?

635
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,860
I came here to see you. We should see each other often to get close to each other.

636
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,510
Now you saw me, so you should go.

637
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,210
Where's your car?

638
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,780
Do you know how hard it was for me to come here?

639
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,750
I'm not joking around.

640
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:40,130
I'm pretending to look fine, but I'm not.

641
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:44,710
I know you're not. That's why I'm saying it more bluntly.

642
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,100
I really like you.

643
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,250
My feelings for you are so serious that I even changed my company to see you once more!

644
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,980
What should I do?

645
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,490
What should I do to make you like me?

646
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,630
Hyo Bin, I have someone that I like.

647
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,860
You know about it, too.

648
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,080
As much as you like me, I'm serious about that person, too.

649
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,790
Are you still dating her?

650
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,270
That kind of woman?

651
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,390
"That kind of woman?"

652
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,810
How did she trick you in?

653
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:18,540
- This is why you can't ignore the time and experience–
 - You better shut up.

654
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,470
Please, just go.

655
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,650
You're going to break up anyway!

656
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,570
Are you going to love her forever?

657
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,500
But why is Shin Hyung not coming back until now?

658
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,810
Did you see Lee Shin's face earlier?

659
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,760
It made me feel like I got dumped.

660
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,090
But it's better to tell your feelings and get rejected

661
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,190
than not saying anything and staying as nobody.

662
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,410
I guess so.

663
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,870
Cheers.

664
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,850
It's so good!

665
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,230
Do I have something on my face?

666
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,880
Yes. I mean, no.

667
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,760
Doctor,

668
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,410
can we talk later?

669
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,300
What about it?

670
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,860
It won't take that long.

671
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,440
Okay, I get it.

672
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,270
Everybody! Look over here!

673
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,820
Nina!

674
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,930
If you brought something like that, you should've taken photos of me first!

675
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,050
I will! Here you go.

676
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,440
Okay, make a pose!

677
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,980
I want to be in the photo, too!

678
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,120
Hyung first.

679
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,520
Okay, Hyung's photo first. One, two, three!

680
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,510
How is it?

681
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,040
It's cute. One, two, three!

682
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,980
Oppa!

683
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,000
- Okay, that's great! 
 - One more!

684
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,890
Oppa! There is not that much film left.

685
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,670
- Just one more, then. 
 - What?

686
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,990
- I want to be in it, too! 
 - One, two,

687
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,790
- three! 
 - Hey!

688
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:52,120
Oh, no!

689
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,910
Oh, no! What happened?

690
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,260
Are you okay, Yoon Tae In?

691
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,060
Is he drowning?

692
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,490
- Should I jump in?
 - Woah, woah, woah, woah!

693
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,200
Didn't you know? Tae In's a good swimmer!

694
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,440
It's okay.

695
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,600
But still...

696
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,960
Where are you going?

697
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,310
Go back and enjoy yourselves. I'll go check on him.

698
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,570
He'll be fine.

699
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,390
Why is he going over there?

700
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,080

701
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:36,540

702
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,490
  Can you guess where I'm at?

703
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,500
What is it? Where are you?

704
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,040
Okay, I got it.

705
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,770
Mom, please stop it!

706
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,120
I understood it. I'll think about it, so stop it.

707
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,800
Don't contact the director separately.

708
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,900
I get it.

709
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,790
I didn't know you were here, Hyung.

710
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,590
What are you doing here?

711
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,400
I was just taking a walk.

712
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,720
- I'm going this way. 
 - I'm going that way.

713
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,930
  Hyo Bin, where are you?

714
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,630
  You didn't go there for real, did you?

715
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,590
Here.

716
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:51,540
- Are your hands okay? 
 - Yes.

717
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,610
Hey, did I look really lame earlier?

718
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,800
No, forget about it. Don't tell me.

719
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,960
It's embarrassing.

720
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,380
- To whom? 
 - What?

721
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,240
I mean, think about it.

722
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,370
If it's only your members and me, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

723
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:18,250
You don't care at all usually.

724
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:24,610
Then, is it Kang Sun Joo?

725
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,490
Hey, are you drunk?

726
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,260
I was drunk, but now I'm fine.

727
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,670
I got sober after seeing Yoon Tae In throwing his body for someone else.

728
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,850
I just did that on the spur of the moment.

729
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,900
Using your hands that are most precious to us?

730
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:46,400
Do you really not know, or are you pretending not to know?

731
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,600
What are you talking about it?

732
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,200
Is she really just your manager?

733
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,750
You have feelings for her, don't you?

734
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,650
Why would I like her?

735
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,400
She's not even my manager!

736
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,370
Is she not? Then who is she?

737
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,260
She's my attending doctor!

738
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,760
She's someone who came here to work for money.

739
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,020
So stop talking that nonsense!

740
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,670
I did come here to make money.

741
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,420
He said it correctly, but why?

742
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,930
She's someone who'll leave soon.

743
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,520
- Is that so? 
 - But...

744
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,480
Strangely, she bothers me.

745
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:07,870
Strangely, when I look at her, melody comes to my mind.

746
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:12,140
- That's what you call love, you idiot. 
 - What?

747
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,530
You want to do anything for her, so you do something you don't normally do.

748
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,970
You don't feel like the time you spend for her is a waste, do you?

749
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:21,950
You want to be with her no matter what as well.

750
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:31,160
The song that you played to me at the beach. Didn't that start from her?

751
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,960
  A song that's started from the ocean gets finished by the ocean in the end.

752
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,630
  The song that you played to me at the beach. Didn't that start it from her?

753
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,700
  Sun always rises and sets,

754
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,960
  but I wonder why it makes me look more closely when I'm at the beach.

755
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:05,220
  The sun was always there, but it's as if the sun was only at the ocean.

756
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,340
  Why would I like her?

757
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:24,600
  She's not even my manager! She's someone who came here to work for money.

758
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,400
  Are you sleeping?

759
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:51,510
  You read it. It means you're not sleeping.

760
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:57,170
  Come to that forest path from earlier.

761
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,780
  Why?

762
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,660
  I have something that I have to say to you.

763
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,770
  I'll be waiting.

764
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:22,690

765
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:46,740
What are you doing here?

766
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:52,990
It's because...

767
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:57,580
I made a song, and I want you to listen.

768
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,970
Do you want me to hear it here now?

769
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,560
I thought you needed to hear it now.

  - Excuse me? 
 - I hate playing games.

813

  I'm saying you're not my type.

814
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,320
  What's wrong with my style?

815
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,970
  How do you start a relationship?

816
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:54,680
  Style. Men look sexy in suits.

817
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,140
  - Being considerate is being kind. 
 - Oh, you startled me!

818
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,420
  Understanding and adjusting to the other person's point of view.

819
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,720
  It's my job to sit here and protect you.

  What is the definition of a kind man that you like? I like you as you are.

821
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:08,320
  I'm afraid he'll be disappointed in me.

822
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,710
  Please spare her. Please forgive Yoon Joo.

823
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,870
  - How long are you going to date her? 
 - It's my privacy.

824
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,580
  People will all know about that private life of yours!

825
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,070
  I won't harm LUNA.

826
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,390
  I have something to tell you.

827
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,380
  It's uncomfortable.

828
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:24,210
♫   All I need   ♫

829
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,350
♫   is your smile   ♫

830
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:31,750

831
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:36,230
