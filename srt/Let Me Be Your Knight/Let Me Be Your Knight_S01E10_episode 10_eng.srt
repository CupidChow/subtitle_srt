1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,940

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,060

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,120

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,140

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,910

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,570

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,150

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,640

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,930

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,710

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,810

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,890
Yoon Tae In,

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,150
I need to tell you something.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,270
I...

15
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,400
am not the person you think

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,130
I am.

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,480
The thing is...

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,780
I know what you're going to say.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,520
Huh?

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,130
"You don't know me well at all, Yoon Tae In."

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,100
You're going to say something like that to reject me, aren't you?

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,790
That's not it.

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,620
I never expected for you change your mind with something like this.

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,900
Well, it's true that I was hopeful just a little bit.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,660
I am really thankful for the birthday wishes,

26
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,750
but Yoon Tae In,

27
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,140
I...

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,860
I...

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,250
cannot accept that.

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,320
You're going back in about a week, right?

31
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,990
Maybe until then,

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,880
would it be possible to reconsider your feelings toward me?

33
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,880
I don't think I can live without you,

34
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,870
but if you still have to leave,

35
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,560
give this back to me then.

36
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,440
Yes, Mr. CEO.

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Dr. Kang,

38
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,450
 are you with Tae In by any chance?

39
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,300
 Tae In has turned off his phone.

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,210
Yes,

41
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,730
I am with him right now.

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,000
What?

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,890
Shin did?

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,470
Yes, understood.

45
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,050
What did Lee Shin do?

46
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,360
Did something happen?

47
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,640
Shin was

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,300
at the radio broadcast, but the news broke that he is seeing Chae Ji Yeon.

49
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,220
What did you just say?

50
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,840

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,870
Why aren't they coming out?

52
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,600
We managed to finish today's recording,

53
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,860
but I'm worried about what will happen next.

54
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,990
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,550
Unni,

56
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,730
the journalists are all waiting outside.

57
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,450
What do we do?

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,570
Yes, I got it.

59
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,620
Security is downstairs now. Let's hurry!

60
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,340
Sure, let's go quickly.

61
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,450
How can I leave alone?

62
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,520
I won't go alone.

63
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,920
Then, what?

64
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,120
Are you planning to grab her hand and go?

65
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,480
Shin.

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,340
I am okay,

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,720
The agency will send over someone for me.

68
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,690
You get going first.

69
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,750
I will wait until that person comes, then.

70
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,930
Let me do that, please.

71
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,870
Hey, Lee Shin!

72
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,520
Shin,

73
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,140
I'm really okay.

74
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,820
You will be helping me out by leaving first.

75
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,910
I'm sorry for getting you in trouble.

76
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,720
Oh, no.

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,560
Someone really is coming from the office,

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,030
right?

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,640
Let's go.

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,210
Then, call me when you get home, okay?

81
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,500
You get that?

82
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:50,020

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,010
Hyung!

84
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,160
Oh, wait a minute.

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,400
What's wrong with Chae Je Yeon?

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,860
Can she not live without a man?

87
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,870
It hasn't even been that long since she divorced,

88
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,130
and with an idol who is 10 years younger than her at that!

89
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,130
Does she really want to do that?

90
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,210
Why not?

91
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,410
She's having fun! I'm jealous of her.

92
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,820
I didn't have coffee, so I'm really feeling sleepy.

93
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,990
 Did you hear about

94
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,910
 Chae Je Yeon's comeback news?

95
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,610
 She was making such a fuss to get married, and I knew it would turn out this way.

96
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,280
 Does she have any conscience?

97
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,130
 I know right? If it were me...

98
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,300
 I'm jealous. A divorcée dating an idol!

99
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,780
You are not all right at all.

100
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,890

101
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,180
Hi, Mr. PD.

102
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,430
Did Shin come back here by any chance?

103
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,150
He didn't come here.

104
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,530
What about Ji Yeon?

105
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,860
She just left, too.

106
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,620
- What's going on?
- Where are they?

107
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,870
Wait, is that the car?

108
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,260
- Oh, It's Chae Ji Yeon!
- Ms. Chae Ji Yeon!

109
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,920
- Please open the door. 
 - How long have you been together?

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,310
Since when and how did you start dating?

111
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,390
Did you know him before the divorce by any chance?

112
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,270
Please tell us something.

113
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,140
- Please say something! 
- When did it start?

114
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,010
Hello! Ms. Choi Ji Yeon!

115
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,250
Say something, please!

116
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,550
Can you please move aside?

117
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,910
I'm just going through.

118
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,900
- Who's this? 
 - She's not Chae Ji Yeon.

119
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,160
- She is not? 
 - Gosh, It's not her.

120
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,430
- Isn't not her? 
 - What's the license plate number?

121
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,570
Jeez! What a waste!

122
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,160
It's all right now.

123
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,750
Get up.

124
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,010
Thank you.

125
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,120
 What?

126
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,420
 He disappeared?

127
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,730
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,070
Gosh.

129
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,840
We were going down in the elevator and he just ran out of there.

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,070
He's really gone crazy.

131
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm sure they are together right now.

132
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,130
I can't believe that he's with her when the dating scandal broke out.

133
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,540
He's really...

134
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,980
Isn't he answering the phone?

135
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,080
What are you going to do now?

136
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,690
Mr. CEO.

137
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,480
Oh, yeah. First, we should

138
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,310
try to get all the articles taken down.

139
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,270
And you,

140
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,170
hurry and find the places where you think Shin might go.

141
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,380
Yes, I got it.

142
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,200
He said he won't put LUNA in jeopardy.

143
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,150
What's this now?

144
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,240
Hold on.

145
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,900
Isn't this where we went for our glamping trip?

146
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,930
Who took this photo?

147
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,860
That's true.

148
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,770
This wasn't even in our official schedule.

149
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,320
Who knew this and took the photo?

150
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,660
It could've been a passerby or a paparazzi who took the picture!

151
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,730
Even I would take photos of celebrities walking with someone at night.

152
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,240
Gosh, my head hurts.

153
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,480
How can he disappear with her?

154
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,700
What if they write something about them disappearing together? What will we do, Tae In?

155
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,250
Are you all right now?

156
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,330
But this is not on the way to my house.

157
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,960
There must be journalists outside your home.

158
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,940
How can we go there?

159
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,450
Then?

160
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,090
I haven't thought about that yet,

161
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,130
but let me do it now.

162
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,040

163
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,330

164
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,220
Where should we go?

165
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,540
Left or right?

166
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,990
Choose one.

167
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,260
You didn't give the answer so let's go to the left, as I like.

168
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,470

169
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,230
Don't pick it up.

170
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,580

171
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,690
 Not able to connect. Please leave a voice message after the beep.

172
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,770

173
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,890
You scared me! Jeez!

174
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,580
What are you doing?

175
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,070
Then, what are you doing?

176
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,790
Why were you in there?

177
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,160
I was looking...

178
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,290
for clues to where he might be.

179
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,930
What about you?

180
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,030
Me?

181
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,110
I'm going to get some air.

182
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,990
Hey, Yoon Tae In.

183
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,880
I don't think we'll be sleeping tonight.

184
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,810
Want to grab a drink?

185
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,720
Why not.

186
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,560
Come to think of it,

187
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,020
it's been so long since just the two of us drank.

188
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,070
Is that so?

189
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,160
When we first debuted, we used to have drinks together at the street wagon bar in front of our dorm.

190
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,320
We had to do all sorts of things to make sure Shin wouldn't tag along.

191
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,790
That's right.

192
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,810
That time you were,

193
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,600
18 years old, right?

194
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,990
He never listened to us, remember?

195
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,490
He learned to behave himself after the debut.

196
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,740
When it was just the three of us living together before... Ugh!

197
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,360
But at that time,

198
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
even if we didn't want to know about each other,

199
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,680
we had no choice but to know.

200
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,980
Is it because we live in a bigger house now?

201
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,430
I didn't know he was seeing someone.

202
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,110
Did you know about that?

203
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,300
I didn't know, either.

204
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,350
From a certain point,

205
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,550
we stopped talking about private matters.

206
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,270
I thought that was comfortable,

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,480
but at a time like this, it's a bit frustrating.

208
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,220
Because I was only thinking about music,

209
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,320
I feel like I didn't take good care of anything else.

210
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,390
Yoon Tae In,

211
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,340
do you know you changed a bit?

212
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,480
What about it?

213
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,900
I'm just saying.

214
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,420
It's better this way.

215
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,100
  Until then,

216
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,850
  would it be possible to reconsider your feelings toward me?

217
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,560
  I don't think I can live without you,

218
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,740
  but if you still have to leave,

219
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,360
  give this back to me then.

220
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,340
  Ms. In Yoon Joo, we're informing you that you passed your interest payment due date.

221
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,850
  Can you handle the enormously increasing interest rate as each day passes?

222
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,570
  Don't think about not paying back,

223
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,260
  and don't think about running away, either.

224
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,310
What's going on?

225
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,430
Why is this not opening?

226
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,760
Give that to me.

227
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,750
I'll do it.

228
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,620
I did it once before,

229
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,780
but it's been so long.

230
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,300
But there's nobody around here. It's a bit scary.

231
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,830
Since you were scared of people, we came here to avoid anybody.

232
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,780
But now are you scared because there's nobody?

233
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,200
If you're not terrified,

234
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,770
do you want to take a walk with me?

235
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,120
What are you thinking about right now?

236
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,370
Let's...

237
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,120
openly date from now on

238
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,820
so we can see each other comfortably.

239
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,930
If we openly date,

240
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,310
do you think we can see each other comfortably?

241
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,120
I bet a lot of people will watch us,

242
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,240
but at least we won't have to hide around.

243
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,750
Shin, it's not something that simple.

244
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,630
I know that well,

245
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,120
but compared to pretending that we are nothing,

246
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,670
I think this will be easier. (Switching to Informal speech)

247
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,270
  The phone is off. After the beep, you can leave a voice message...

248
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,760
Did he turn off the phone on purpose?

249
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,410
I think Ji Yeon Sunbae turned it off on purpose as well.

250
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,840
Where did they go with both of their phones off?

251
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,580
Did they really run away for love or something?

252
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,820
It's driving me crazy...

253
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,220
Don't worry about them too much.

254
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,990
I knew he was selfish,

255
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,180
but isn't this too much?

256
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,020
He'll come back when the situation settles a bit.

257
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,370
- Don't say it like that. 
 - What did I do? He's the one being too much!

258
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,840
Everybody has something they gave up for the team.

259
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,800
Gave up?

260
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,930
Did you give up something?

261
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,990
I don't want to talk about it!

262
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,190
Bread and coffee. What else?

263
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,640
Chocolate?

264
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,530
Okay.

265
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,440
I'll be back soon.

266
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,710
  Wow, Chae Ji Yeon has a great ability.

267
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,550
  How can she date a guy way younger than herself after getting divorced?

268
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,450
  That guy's even an idol.

269
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,530
  Would they be dating seriously?

270
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,750
 They were probably just having fun and were going to break up, but then got caught, so it got complicated.

271
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,540
  He's a very popular idol right now. Isn't it a loss for him?

272
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,460
  Didn't Chae Ji Yeon spill the rumor on purpose?

273
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,320
  Oppa, you really don't know anything.

274
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,050
  Whatever the reason, when a rumor for a relationship comes out, it's only a loss for the woman.

275
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,000
  I bet Chae Ji Yeon will be the only person who gets blamed.

276
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,370
  Is that so?

277
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,610
  Oh, I want the fried noodle cup-noodle.

278
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,280
  Should I get one with soup?

279
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,200
  Should I get this one or that one?

280
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,180
  Should we share it?

281
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,160

282
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,150

283
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,530

284
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,310
Yes.

285
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,180
  Are you with Lee Shin right now?

286
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,650
Well, that's not important.

287
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,850
His company is blocking the news right now,

288
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,330
and I think we should release an article admitting the relationship first.

289
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,740
Excuse me?

290
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,550
What do you mean by that?

291
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,570
With this, let's get rid of your divorced woman tag and let's rebrand your image

292
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,380
as a popular idol's girlfriend.

293
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,050
  How does that sound?

294
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,010
CEO...

295
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,680
That's a bit...

296
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,260
  I don't think you understand the situation.

297
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,820
You did a great one.

298
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,330
CEO Moon is outrageous right now, but as you know,

299
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm very open-minded.

300
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,380
  Whatever others say, I support you guys' relationship.

301
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,980
Is this support?

302
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,140
I'll hang up the phone now. I'll see you tomorrow.

303
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,560
  Wait, one second.

304
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,050
  The photo that you guys got shot is a bit plain.

305
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,090
  Do you guys have any other provocative photos?

306
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,630
  If you send me a few, I'll--

307
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,700
I couldn't get anything here.

308
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,100
Let's go somewhere else.

309
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,270
There's nothing delicious here.

310
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,530
Okay.

311
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,380
Let's do that.

312
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,790
Yes, Reporter Kim.

313
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,480
Please drop the unconfirmed speculative article right now.

314
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,530
We will announce our official position by tomorrow.

315
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,050
Yes.

316
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,080

317
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,510

318
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,890
  Why are you asking for this suddenly?

319
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,920
  Did your symptoms get worse again?

320
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,180
  No, I just want to know the exact contract period.

321
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,210
  CEO.

322
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,140
  Oh! You didn't have to bring any food.

323
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,910
  Why did you bring out so much?

324
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,450
  I thought you might like it.

325
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,340
  Okay. Then, enjoy.

326
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,070

327
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,500

328
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,040
Contract for Live-in Doctor?

329
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,750
Is our Tae In sick?

330
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,350
What are you doing here?

331
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,460
Oh, Yoon Tae In...

332
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,880
Why did you come out not sleeping?

333
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,490
I came out to wake up from sleep

334
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,510
and alcohol.

335
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,250
Did you drink?

336
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,700
I had a drink with Seo Woo Yeon.

337
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,280
I guess...

338
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,170
you didn't hear from Shin yet, did you?

339
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,640
Are you worried a lot?

340
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,920
I'm worried about Lee Shin and LUNA as well,

341
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,740
but there's nothing I can do.

342
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,150
Also...

343
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,350
I might get awkward with you, Dr. Kang Sun Joo, because of this incident.

344
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,390
I'm worried about that as well.

345
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,760
Yoon Tae In,

346
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,360
I didn't know you were so honest with your emotions.

347
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,180
It's because of you.

348
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:34,450
I also didn't know that I could be so honest with my emotions like this

349
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,440
until now.

350
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,240
If that's the case,

351
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,070
sleepwalking is not necessarily

352
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,730
a bad thing.

353
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,740
Why?

354
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,460
Thanks to that, I met you.

355
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,170
Sleepwalking is...

356
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,840
not necessarily useless.

357
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,490
Aren't you sleepy?

358
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,700
I said I'd drive now.

359
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
I'm okay.

360
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,250
I know you're sleepy, too.

361
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,660
You didn't sleep because of me.

362
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,250
Then, let's listen to the radio.

363
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,150
  Hello.

364
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,940
  I became a new host of "Walking in the Dawn" from today.

365
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,250
  I'm DJ Kim Bo Young.

366
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,500
I guess this person is doing it for the first time as well.

367
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,180
Yes, I think so.

368
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,250
It reminds me of when we first met.

369
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,740
  Hello.

370
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,620
  I became the host of "Sleepless Night of Chae Ji Yeon."

371
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,830
  I'm Chae Ji Yeon.

372
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,120
  Actually, it's my first time doing a radio DJ, so I might be very awkward.

373
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,730
  I'll show you my best from now on,

374
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,690
  so please kindly watch me grow.

375
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,580
  - Okay, then before we start-- Oh! 
 - Hello!

376
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,120
  Since it's my first time hosting,

377
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,040
  the person with a phone number ending 6049 sent me a cheering message.

378
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,550
  Hello, Ji Yeon.

379
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,890
  I'm a guy in my thirties who lives in Seoul.

380
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,280
  I came down to my hometown for the first time in a while and am drinking beer by myself right now.

381
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,540
   Since I couldn't sleep, I turned on the radio,

382
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,150
  and I was glad I heard your voice...

383
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,100
  Okay.

384
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,420
  Commercials after part one are coming out now.

385
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,380
  Hello, Sunbaenim!

386
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,230
  Hello.

387
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,990
  Hello.

388
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,350
  They will be our regular guests, who I had a hard time bringing.

389
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,350
  They are Yoo Chan and Shin from LUNA.

390
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,560
  Hello, it's so nice to meet you.

391
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,010
  Also, thank you so much for coming.

392
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,660
  Oh, no. It's our honor to be here.

393
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,570
  Oh, he's a real fan of yours!

394
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,610
  Since our debut, he always said you are his ideal type!

395
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,530
  Really? Did you really say so?

396
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,050
  Yes.

397
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,220
  What's up with you, Lee Shin?

398
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,430
  I didn't know you could be embarrassed.

399
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,550
  Stop it.

400
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,540
  Thank you.

401
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,580
  And this is...

402
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,230
  Sunbaenim, I'm at the broadcasting station. Can I see you on the rooftop for a moment?

403
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,360
  Oh, you're here!

404
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,270
  I came here for my schedule. But on the way here, I thought of you and got this.

405
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,670
  I heard that you like this flower.

406
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:22,590
  Shin, thank you for your thoughts, but we have to work together from now on.

407
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:28,550
  That's not the answer to what I had confessed to you before, right?

408
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,640
  Even if we start dating, you know that we won't last for long.

409
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,660
  I feel positive that you thought about something like that.

410
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,760
  It means that you thought about how it'll go if you dated me.

411
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,520
  No, I didn't think that...

412
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,690
  I... have to go now.

413
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,130
  You told me this before,

414
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,630
  that you don't want to be in an unhappy love anymore.

415
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,210
  Then, why don't you tell me after going out with me?

416
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:10,560
  If you feel unhappy even a little bit, I'll let you go.

417
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,660
I don't think it's okay.

418
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,390
Let's stop the car around here and have a rest first.

419
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,640

420
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,100
Were you waiting here?

421
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,630
Did you sleep okay?

422
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,180
I think this is a botanical garden.

423
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,900
- A botanical garden? 
 - Yes.

424
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,140
I want to go inside,

425
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,160
but I don't think it's open yet.

426
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,060
Why don't we go inside?

427
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,760
What are you doing? Please come out.

428
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,530

429
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,040
♫   Because of the passing wind sound   ♫

430
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:36,990
♫   The doodles that I drew   ♫

431
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,310
♫   The day goes by again and again   ♫

432
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,680
♫   It left as memories now   ♫

433
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,640
What is this flower?

434
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,940
- Whoa! 
 - You surprised me!

435
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,020
Seriously! I thought it was a bee.

436
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:05,180
♫   Oh, I'm dreaming   ♫

437
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:13,570
♫   The name gets forgotten, and the memories are faded   ♫

438
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,970
♫   If it stops as it did right now   ♫

439
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,040
Do you know that?

440
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,770
It's our first time having an outdoor date when it's this bright.

441
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,820
That's true.

442
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,090
This is how it feels.

443
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:56,980
We should've done this before. Should I rent this entire place next time?

444
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,440
Shin, let's end it here.

445
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,880
Let's end what?

446
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:19,590
When we go outside, let's go back to our previous relationship as work colleagues.

447
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,900
What are you talking about?

448
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,470
We were going to go to Europe together and see the meteor shower together.

449
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,140
Don't you remember it?

450
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,660
You said you'd let me go when I feel even a bit unhappy.

451
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:47,580
♫   Even if we are too far away from the time we passed   ♫

452
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,390
Are you...

453
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,120
unhappy being with me?

454
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:00,530
Yes.

455
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,350
Then, what can I do for you–

456
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:08,380
Can you let me go now?

457
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:17,690
♫   The name gets forgotten, and the memories are faded   ♫

458
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,360

459
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,570

460
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,310
Yes.

461
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,750
  Where are you right now?

462
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,060
I'm at the group's house. Where else I would be?

463
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,110
  That's true, isn't it? About Lee Shin and Chae Ji Yeon.

464
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,580
  I couldn't sleep at all last night!

465
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,330
What do you want to say to me?

466
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,660
  I'm on my way to your company right now.

467
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,150
  I'm going to ask CEO Moon to terminate your contract.

468
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,420
What? Mom, are you crazy?

469
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Seriously!

470
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,700
Mom!

471
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,120
How can you go around like this when you're a celebrity?

472
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,800
- I'm scared that someone will see you. 
 - What are you doing here, Mom?

473
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,750
Are you really going to see the CEO?

474
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,170
It's good that you're here. You should come with me and say goodbye to him,

475
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,540
and tell him all of your complaints until now.

476
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,770
Yoo Chan!

477
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,940
What's wrong with you?

478
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,020
That's what I should say! Why are you always acting as you please!

479
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,500
Tae In is sick and Ga On has a school violence issue.

480
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,860
And now Lee Shin has a relationship rumor. I'm trying to save my son from this sewage!

481
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,810
Mom, please!

482
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,130
I'm saying all this for you.

483
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:21,300
So why don't we terminate the contract from here now and go to the CEO Jang's company?

484
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,420
Let's take back Director Paik's movie, too!

485
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,880
They offered a lot of money for you!

486
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,410
Is this for me? Aren't you doing this for money?

487
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,420
I'm not doing this for money.

488
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,180
It's fine.

489
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,140
I'm going to keep working as LUNA, and I'll be able to keep providing you with money!

490
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,220
So please stop interfering with my work!

491
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,140
Yoo Chan!

492
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,450
Hey, Lee Shin!

493
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,110
Where the heck have you been?

494
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:46,120
Hey, can't you hear me?

495
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,590
You were with Ji Yeon Sunbae until now, weren't you?

496
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,490
Do you have any thoughts?

497
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,880
I'm here now, so it's fine, isn't it?

498
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,940
Hey. What's up with your attitude right now?

499
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,690
What did you do well? Can't you at least pretend to be sorry?

500
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,400
Let's talk later.

501
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,430
Right, he hasn't come home yet.

502
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,330
I'll immediately let you know when he comes home.

503
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,910
Okay.

504
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,750
The CEO hasn't heard anything from him yet, either?

505
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,310
- Hyung! 
 - Hey, Lee Shin!

506
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,600
Where have you been until now without picking up the phone?

507
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,970
We were worried about you! You even turned off your phone.

508
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,300
What's wrong with your face? Did something happen?

509
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,760
I'm exhausted. Let's talk later.

510
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,350
Hey! What? Exhausted?

511
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,320
What did you tell me yesterday?

512
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,290
You said you wouldn't hurt LUNA!

513
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,650
I said stop it!

514
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,000
I said I'd talk to you later.

515
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,070
Hey, Yoon Tae In! Say something to him!

516
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,950
That bastard doesn't even know what he did wrong!

517
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,390
Have some rest first.

518
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,330
Hyung, aren't you a bit too angry at him?

519
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,390
Hey, didn't you see Lee Shin's attitude?

520
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,810
He was so shameless and didn't even look sorry at all!

521
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,230
Also, what's up with Yoon Tae In?

522
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm the only bad guy here.

523
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,580
That's enough.

524
00:43:53,580 --> 00:44:00,080
Oh, right. Our manager sent me this article that came out.

525
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,970
What about it?

526
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,000

527
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,080

528
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,540
Hey, Chae Ji Yeon. I told you to admit your relationship, but what the heck is this?

529
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,670
I treated you well even after you ruined your reputation after getting divorced.

530
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:44,560
I'm sorry, but I don't have any memory of you treating me well.

531
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,580
What?

532
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,420
If you keep being rude like this, I'm going to take my hands off you.

533
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,280
I'm going to give up all the contacts I made to get you a role–

534
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,580
Are you laughing right now?

535
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,720
That's good. All those roles that you worked so hard for me,

536
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,380
I really didn't want to play them.

537
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,340
I'll terminate my contract with Jang Entertainment.

538
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,470
Are you really out of your mind?

539
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,370
I don't know what you have in mind,

540
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:19,580
but I can make you never be able to come back in this industry!

541
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,150
You can do what you want to do.

542
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,440
Send me the terminated agreement in a week.

543
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,940
Hey, Chae Ji Yeon. Come over here.

544
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,020
Chae Ji Yeon, come over here! Hey!

545
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,220
Chae Ji Yeon!

546
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,360
Oh, my goodness! It's crazy!

547
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,150
It came out so great!

548
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,110
Doesn't he look like a sculpture?

549
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,430
Hey, did you see that?

550
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,630
Apparently, Shin and Chae Ji Yeon are not in a relationship.

551
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,790
I saw an explaining article from Chae Ji Yeon.

552
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,740
How can you trust that so naively? They're just saying it's not true.

553
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,990
That's true, but it's fine with me.

554
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,480
As long as it's not my Tae In, I'm fine.

555
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,110
That's right! If my Tae In is also saying he's dating a weird woman,

556
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,420
then I'm really going to give up on LUNA.

557
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,460
I'll do that, too.

558
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,820
Oh, the bus is here.

559
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,600
Bye, Tae In!

560
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,370
Let's go.

561
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,560
Hello!

562
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,020

563
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,670
Oh, yes!

564
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,480
Hello, Doctor. Welcome.

565
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,420
Please have a seat.

566
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,410
Why did you want to see me?

567
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,840
It's because...

568
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,650
I know we have a few more days of the contract,

569
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,420
but Tae In is now better.

570
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,220
So if it's okay with you, would it be possible

571
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,610
for you to leave the group's house a bit earlier?

572
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:09,440
Thankfully, we could gloss over Shin's scandal,

573
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,370
but if LUNA has more bad rumors from now on...

574
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:19,170
Just thinking about that makes me terrified.

575
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,170
Right.

576
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:28,860
Thanks to you, I'm glad Tae In recovered from his illness,

577
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:34,440
but if the fact that you stayed as a live-in doctor gets revealed,

578
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,790
it would harm Tae In a lot.

579
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,360
Will you understand my position?

580
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,230
Of course, I understand.

581
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,810
  I won't say anything, so don't worry,

582
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:08,770
  but you also have to keep a secret that I know about this.

583
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,210
Nothing happened, right?

584
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,200
I guess something happened.

585
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,870
Did you tell the truth to Yoon Tae In?

586
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:34,010
No, I couldn't tell him yet.

587
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:41,970
I don't want Yoon Tae In to get hurt by me anymore.

588
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,840
So what are you going to do, then?

589
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:57,540
I'm going to bring it back to its original state.

590
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,620
♫   Because of the passing wind sound   ♫

591
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:15,490
♫   The doodles that I drew   ♫

592
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:23,220
  Are you unhappy being with me?

593
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,920
  Yes.

594
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,580
  Then, what can I do for you–

595
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,750
  Can you let me go now?

596
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,330
♫   Oh, I'm dreaming   ♫

597
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,510
If you're not sleeping, let's talk.

598
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,310
What happened to you yesterday?

599
00:49:55,310 --> 00:50:00,210
We broke up. You don't have to worry anymore now.

600
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,850
I'm not talking about that–

601
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:07,010
If it's not about that, what do you want to know?

602
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,540
I'm just wondering if you are okay.

603
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,210
But still, don't do any more unexpected behavior.

604
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,500
Have some rest. You look tired.

605
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,230

606
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,400
Hey, what's up, Jimmy!

607
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,120
How long has it been?

608
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,400
I heard from Nina that you came to Korea.

609
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,420
Dinner tonight?

610
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,680
Somehow, she looks like she's doing better.

611
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,100
Wait.

612
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,170
We don't know where she lives.

613
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,010
Don't you think we should find that out now?

614
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,380
What is she doing in this rich neighborhood?

615
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,660
It's crazy! How did they find this place?

616
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,930
My god!

617
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,190
Ms. In Yoon Joo!

618
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:31,150
You've been ignoring our calls.

619
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:34,700
I didn't know you were living in this wealthy neighborhood.

620
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,340
Don't you dare think of running away from us.

621
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,430
I'll be back soon, okay?

622
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,760
Let's go.

623
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:16,710
How long have you known about this?

624
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,820
It hasn't been that long.

625
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:28,150
Then, did you stay quiet while knowing everything?

626
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:33,160
I thought you would have your reason.

627
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,610
I'm sorry.

628
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,010
I told you this before,

629
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:48,810
the fact that you're a good person won't change.

630
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:58,370
I'm not a good person like you think.

631
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:07,200
While living in that house briefly, I forgot what I did

632
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,650
and thought it might be understandable.

633
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:20,200
I'm such a shameless and bad person like this.

634
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:27,050
Tae In will understand.

635
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,610
Tae In changed a lot, thanks to you,

636
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:38,390
so he'll understand you as well.

637
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,230

638
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,500
Yes.

639
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,790
  Yoon Tae In, where are you right now?

640
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,840
I came out for dinner with a friend.

641
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,550
Then, when will you come back home?

642
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:50,190
Why? Did something happen?

643
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,830
There's something I have to tell you.

644
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,820
I'll come home soon, right after dinner.

645
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,590

646
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,070
- Hey, man! 
 - Hey.

647
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,090
How are you doing?

648
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:41,440
What's up? I'm good.

649
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,300
You're looking good, man. What is that?

650
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,350
It's a necklace.

651
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,840
You look great, bro.

652
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,890
Let's go, man.

653
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,930
I thought you came to Korea for the tour.

654
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,540
Why haven't you reached out to me?

655
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:58,130
Well, I came to Korea for something more important than a tour.

656
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,000
What is it?

657
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,890
No way...

658
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:06,710
- Is it? 
 - Yeah.

659
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:09,030
I found my mom.

660
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,760
So I'm planning to stay here for a while, man.

661
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,580
- That's great news, bro! 
 - Thanks.

662
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,190
We can catch up more easily, then.

663
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,830
Is Nina coming, too?

664
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,870
No, she's too busy now.

665
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,580
I'm also on the waiting list, too, man.

666
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:30,220
But I brought someone else instead. I hope you don't mind.

667
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,910
Suddenly?

668
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:32,820
Who is it?

669
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:36,520
Someone very important, who means a lot to me.

670
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,410
So I wanted to introduce her to you.

671
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,070
Okay.

672
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,980
This is Doctor Kang Sun Joo.

673
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,770
She's been my psychiatrist for years, and she's als helped me find my mom.

674
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:57,410
Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Sun Joo.

675
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,270
Kang Sun Joo?

676
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,670
What do you mean by "Nice to meet you?"

677
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:08,210
In the end, we meet each other like this.

678
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,020
Is it already a month ago?

679
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,830
I'm so sorry that I couldn't come to the meeting without any notice.

680
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,950
Did you find another doctor?

681
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,760
Wait.

682
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,520
Are you Doctor Kang Sun Joo?

683
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,010
It's my fault, man.

684
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,670
I came to Korea all of a sudden without even contacting her, so...

685
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:42,410
It must have been her busy day, too.

686
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,770
Tae In?

687
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:45,400
Are you all right?

688
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,490
What's going on?

689
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,200
Sorry.

690
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,740
I'll call you.

691
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,540
Tae In? Tae In!

692
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,450
  I'm not going to get treated by someone like you.

693
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:16,250
  I think there was some misunderstanding. Excuse me.

694
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,450
  I got adopted.

695
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:23,230
   I have a twin sister, but she's very different from me.

696
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,680
  Who is In Yoon Joon?

697
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:46,000

698
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:50,280
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

699
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,390

700
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,890
♫  Feel so cold, so cold, it feels so cold, so cold  ♫

701
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:04,040
♫  The reason why everything has stopped  ♫

702
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,600
♫  You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you're gone  ♫

703
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,840
  Tae In Hyung says he won't come to practice today.

704
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,140
  The one who strictly keeps the practicing time?

705
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:14,620
  There's a rumor that Yoo Chan is moving to Jang Entertainment.

706
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,710
  You talked to me about protecting LUNA, but you're a born-to-be actor.

707
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,360
  Tell me straight-forwardly.

708
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,000
  You pretended to protect the team the whole time.

709
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,990
  Who do you think you are! Shut up!

710
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:27,000
  Then, did our Yoon Joo get kicked out with nothing?

711
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,700
  Ms. In Yoon Joo.

712
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,040
  Who are you?

713
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,140
  Don't even cry. I can't even trust that.

714
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,930
  She was sincere to you, at least.

715
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,670
  Stop it!

716
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:41,720
  I was the one who trusted and relied on such a person for a month. I can never understand her.

717
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:47,160
♫  Like your words full of contradictions  ♫

718
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,190
♫   Maybe a wonderful end would come  ♫

719
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:55,750
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

720
01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:00,200
♫  Feel so cold, so cold, it feels so cold, so cold  ♫
