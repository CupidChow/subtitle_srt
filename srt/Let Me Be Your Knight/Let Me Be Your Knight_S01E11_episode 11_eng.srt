1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,890

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,540

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,660

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,960

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,710

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,600

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,070

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,680

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,660

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,250

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,850

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:51,080

13
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,110
Did you just get back?

14
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,270
Did you have a good time meeting your friends?

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,200
Get to the point. What do you want to say?

16
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,090
Yoon Tae In,

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,830
I'm sorry...

18
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,330
I can't...

19
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,530
accept this.

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,370
Honestly, I'm not...

21
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,860
Why not?

22
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,350
Is it because you aren't Kang Sun Ju?

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,900
How did you...?

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,020
To tell you the truth...

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,190
My name is In Yoon Ju

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,200
Kang Sun Ju is my older twin sister.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm really sorry...

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,270
I wanted to tell you...

29
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,400
I was going to tell you, but...

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,690
Don't you dare say you didn't have the opportunity to tell me!

31
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,890
You had so many chances when you could have told me the truth.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,270
Why did you do it?

33
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,080
Why?

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,510
Money...

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,090
I desperately needed it.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,590
So... It was about money the whole time.

37
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,590
You're just the same as everyone else.

38
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,530
Anything I say right now will sound like some excuse. I know that it's all my fault...

39
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,730
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,320
I'm so sorry, Yoon Tae In...

41
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,460
I told you everything about myself.

42
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,940
But you!

43
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,430
You!

44
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,300
You didn't even tell me your real name,

45
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,430
and now you want me to believe

46
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,990
you're sorry?

47
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,680
Don't you cry.

48
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,580
I can't even trust that.

49
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,140
I ended up here again...

50
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,160
 Don't you cry.

51
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,450
 I can't even trust that.

52
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,890
I really don't deserve to cry.

53
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,290

54
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,290

55
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,730
 Episode 11

56
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,790
What are you saying?

57
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,940
Wait, so...

58
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,040
you are saying

59
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,890
you are not

60
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,570
Dr. Kang Sun Joo?

61
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,160
I'm sorry, Sir.

62
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,950
Come on, Dr. Kang.

63
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,900
Why are you doing this?

64
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,520
Why are you pranking me before you leave?

65
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,710
Dr. Kang Su Joo

66
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,010
is my twin sister.

67
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,120
To tell you the truth,

68
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,200
when we met at the hotel,

69
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,390
I was there to see her.

70
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,020
 Dr. Kang Sun Joo?

71
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,500
 Thank you so much for coming! I was afraid you wouldn't meet me.

72
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,710
 I think you're mistaking me...

73
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,890
 I'd like to you be the live-in doctor, Dr. Kang.

74
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,220
 Wait a second! I'm not Kang Sun Joo! I'm...

75
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,290
So then why

76
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,880
did you pretend until now

77
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,270
to be your twin sister?

78
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,400
I'm...

79
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,780
So sorry!

80
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,870
Does the real Dr. Kang know what you did?

81
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,950
Not at all!

82
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,580
She has no idea!

83
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,950
I...

84
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,140
I really needed money.

85
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,770
So I've done this on my own.

86
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,700
Oh my gosh!

87
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,420
How in the world...

88
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,760
could this happen!

89
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,710
I will do whatever I have to to pay you back the 50 million won  (~$50k) that I've already received .

90
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,700
Even if you call the police now, I have nothing to say.

91
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,710
I'll accept any punishment you want me to take.

92
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,490
This incident!

93
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,900
I'll just let it slide.

94
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,540
What?

95
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,990
No matter what happens,

96
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,800
I have to protect LUNA from this kind of fraudulent publicity.

97
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,600
Wait...

98
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,830
Tae In...

99
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,270
doesn't know about all this, right?

100
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,040
Dr. Kang,

101
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,060
would you like some breakfast?

102
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,230

103
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,300

104
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,890

105
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,900
In Yoon Joo, is that you?

106
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,230
Ms. Cho Rong!

107
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,530
Here you go...

108
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,570
Have some.

109
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,270
Seriously, I'm fine...

110
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,900
Was that thunder I hear?

111
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,230
This red bean bun is

112
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,100
so much better than the ones you bought me before,

113
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,670
so next time get them only from this bakery.

114
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,170
It is delicious...

115
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,430
Bread tastes good

116
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,680
even in a situation like this.

117
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,770
Why did you ignore me

118
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,740
the last time I saw you?

119
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,390
What happened with your older sister from the States?

120
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,170
Did you get to see her?

121
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,120
Oh gosh...

122
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,890
I think these may be your size.

123
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,120
Gosh, wear them if you want to...

124
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,220
or not.

125
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,960
When you have too many thoughts, it's best to just sleep.

126
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,920
If you're finished eating,

127
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,540
go take a nap.

128
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,390
Gosh...

129
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,790
And if you have nowhere to go,

130
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,440
stay here as much as you want to... Gosh.

131
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,630
 Are you saying she just left like that?

132
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,230
And without saying goodbye to us?

133
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,220
I haven't seen her since yesterday.

134
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,730
She may have some urgent work.

135
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,480
Anyway, the contract is going to be over.

136
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,160
How can you say that?

137
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,450
It's fine. It's okay.

138
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,090
It's a little sad,

139
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,790
but Tae In is also better now.

140
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,120
If the conversation is over,

141
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,260
then I would like to go up first.

142
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,220
CEO, does Tae In also know

143
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,240
that Dr. Kang is gone?

144
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Yeah, he knows.

145
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,620
 She came to my office this morning, kneeling and begging me to forgive her.

146
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,190
 She said that she needed money

147
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,890
 and said that she will return whatever money she has taken.

148
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,890
Tae In!

149
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,510
Did anything happen between you and Dr. Kang yesterday?

150
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,050
What are you curious about?

151
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,650
Did you hear

152
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,670
everything from Dr. Knag?

153
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,270
So you knew everything?

154
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,450
You knew that she was fooling me for money and you pretended to not know?

155
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,610
I didn't want to take her chance

156
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,930
of telling the truth and asking for your understanding.

157
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,550
Understanding?

158
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,310
Everything was a lie and you want me to understand?

159
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,850
Do you really think like that?

160
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,220
Everything that she did for you...

161
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,250
- You know the best. 
 - If a con artist did her best, does that does make her not a con artist?

162
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,980
Tae In, you know that she's not that type of person.

163
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm the one who trusted such a person for a month.

164
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,700
You will never understand how I feel.

165
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,630
- Tae In said that he's not going to practice today. 
 - What?

166
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,980
When he's a stickler for the rules?

167
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,670
He's a little strange. Is it because Dr. Kang left?

168
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,710
Right. Dr. Kang just left without saying a word

169
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,280
and Yoon Tae In is also being weird.

170
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,080
Did something happen between them that we don't know about?

171
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,010
Hey, Shin.

172
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,200
Do you know anything?

173
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,110
Anyway, we are not practicing today.

174
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,850
He's openly ignoring me now.

175
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,220
We should just rest up today.

176
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,030
- Bro! 
 - Gosh, you scared me.

177
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,130
Knock before entering.

178
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,150
It's a habit now.

179
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,080
What happened? Why are you here?

180
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,620
I'm going to sleep here today.

181
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,850
What a surprise. You were dying to get your room back.

182
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,440
It suddenly felt a little strange to be alone.

183
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,300
Something is weird.

184
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,160
What's weird?

185
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,040
I went to the room, and Dr. Kang's suitcase was still there.

186
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,150
- Did she leave without her suitcase? 
 - Yes.

187
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,480
I feel like she may come back, so I can't stay in that room.

188
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,590
How urgent was it that she left without her suitcase?

189
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,520
Even without saying a word.

190
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,470
- Something is weird. 
 - Exactly! I told you.

191
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,470
Should we text her?

192
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,850
 Come to think of it,

193
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,720
 sleepwalking is not necessarily a bad thing.

194
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,740
 Thanks to that, I got to meet you.

195
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,550
 I have told you everything about me.

196
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,060
 But you, you!

197
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,250
 You didn't even tell me your real name.

198
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,630
   Please contact us. Is everything all right?

199
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,200
   Have you arrived in the States?

200
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,470
   Why did you just leave without even saying goodbye? When are you going to take your suitcase back from my room?

201
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,220
   Are you going to come back?

202
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,370
   We are sad because you suddenly left, but

203
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,020
   I will contact you when we go to the States for the tour next time.

204
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,350
 Yoon Tae In,

205
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,040
 where are you going again instead of sleeping?

206
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,630
 What happened to your expression?

207
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,580
 Is something not working out?

208
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,010
 Didn't you mention about your sister

209
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,060
 - you left in Korea?  
  - Yeah.

210
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,230
My twin sister.

211
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,610
Twi...Twi...?

212
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,880
- Twins. 
  - Okay.

213
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,800
Right.

214
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,490
You should be catching up

215
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,330
with your twin sister.

216
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,830
I'm sorry.

217
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,240
- I have taken up too much of your time. 
- It's okay.

218
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,910
We used to be sisters, but not anymore.

219
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,820
I have a new family. So...

220
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,920
What? This is...

221
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,610
This is you in the photo?

222
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,840
Do you know me?

223
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,670
Do you know my mom?

224
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,970
Oh my goodness!

225
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,820
Hyun Woo has grown up so much and come back.

226
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,240
Just wait a minute.

227
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,160
This...

228
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,800
How do you have this?

229
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,060
Hyun Woo's mother gave me this before leaving this place.

230
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,290
She left? Where did she leave to...?

231
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,500
She told me to give this to

232
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,210
her son if he comes back sometime.

233
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,060
 Here.

234
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,910
This is the address where your mother is now.

235
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,280

236
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,260
It rarely happens to people of her age.

237
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,740
She got dementia early.

238
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,050
She has no family to come for her, either.

239
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,600
Ever since she came here, she has been looking out of the window all day long like that.

240
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,490
Maybe she is waiting the whole time.

241
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,070
Excuse me.

242
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,910
Your son arrived.

243
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,340
Mom.

244
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,470
I'm your son.

245
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,290
Please, have some. (Using formal speech)

246
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,570
My son used to like this.

247
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,360
I missed you.

248
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,880
I told you

249
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,880
it may not be as you expected.

250
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,710
Yeah. But I've never expected this.

251
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,680
I thought of

252
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,640
tens of cases that could have happened when I met my mom.

253
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,330
But there was not a case

254
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,760
where I was forgotten.

255
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,940
To be honest,

256
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,960
an adoption agency reached out to me when I was 16

257
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,360
saying that

258
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,810
my mom wanted to see me.

259
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,840
So, why didn't you meet her then?

260
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,380
I didn't have courage to see her.

261
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,960
I guess I was being afraid

262
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,840
of being abandoned again by my

263
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,390
step parents if I met her.

264
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,560
So I rejected their offer.

265
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,530
You've told me,

266
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,850
she doesn't mean anything but a sister in the past to you, right?

267
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,340
Sister is just a sister.

268
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,330
Not from the childhood moment.

269
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,170
Don't make anything to regret,

270
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,220
like me.

271
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,220

272
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,900

273
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,740
 Mom, Dad!

274
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,310
 We will be back.  
  Bye.

275
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,110
 Good bye.

276
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,660
Gosh, you came again!

277
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,240
- What? 
- I feel bad about what happened.

278
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,400
I have told you this earlier, too. This is my home.

279
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,260
I don't know anything.

280
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,370
- What are you talking about? 
 - Gosh!

281
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,260
This young lady is acting like she's hearing all this for the first time.

282
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,000
Did being conned mess with your head?

283
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,660
Conned?

284
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,680
Why can't you just stay still? You're making me uneasy.

285
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,700
I wanted to do it.

286
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,640
- Is there nothing else to do? 
- No, there's nothing to be done.

287
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,570
I have a meeting with my friend.

288
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,970
Make lunch for yourself.

289
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,110
Have fun then.

290
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,200
I like it.

291
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,090
It's nice to have someone to tell me that.

292
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,500

293
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,630

294
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,270

295
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,420

296
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,220

297
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,030

298
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,970
Yes, Yoo Chan's mother!

299
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,050
I have received something strange right now.

300
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,510
 It must have arrived then.

301
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,070
 - Have you seen it?  
- What is this?

302
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,410
Has Yoo Chan also agreed to the cancellation of the contract?

303
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,040
 It is just as it's written.

304
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,240
 I have already talked to Yoo Chan about everything.

305
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,180
  - So, you've been notified.  
 - Ma'am please, hold on.

306
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,020
- Mr. Moon. 
 - Oh, Reporter Min.

307
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,600
I'm glad I caught you.

308
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I came by while I was here for Hyo Bin's interview.

309
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,400
Do you have some time?

310
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,440
I'm a little busy today.

311
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,870
- Let's talk later. 
- I have heard something strange.

312
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,130
- Strange talk? 
 - I heard

313
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,220
Yoo Chan is going to sign with Jang Enterprises.

314
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,330
What nonsense are you talking about?

315
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,410
Who's going around

316
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,810
spreading those ridiculous rumors?

317
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,990
Are you sure it's a ridiculous rumor?

318
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,700
I saw Yoo Chan at the Jang Enterprises not long ago

319
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,310
and got worried about the rumor being true.

320
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,350
 - Do you want to do something else? 
 - Acting.

321
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,480
 I was thinking of acting again if I got a good project.

322
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,990
 I was wondering how it would be.

323
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,220
Yoo Chan! Yoo Chan, are you here?

324
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,490
- Yoo Chan! 
 - CEO.

325
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,040
You... Let's talk a little.

326
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
What?

327
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,870
- What happened? 
- Are you doing all this because

328
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,990
I'm not letting you do acting?

329
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,050
- What are you talking about? 
 - Your mom sent

330
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,130
the contract cancellation documents to the office.

331
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,600
- What? 
 - If you weren't happy with the company,

332
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,340
you should have come and talked to me first.

333
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,190
 You. Are you really going to Jang Enterprises?

334
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,670
 - No, it's nothing like that.   
  - I heard you were offered an acting role,

335
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,160
 and you have gone to Jang Enterprises.

336
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,290
 Hey, Woo Ga On, why are you going through my stuff?

337
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,940
 Let's go together and talk to your mother.

338
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,560
No, I thought I had left something in the room.

339
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,910
CEO, let's talk outside.

340
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,730
I have not done it.

341
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,390
It's true that I got an acting offer from CEO Jang and met him.

342
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,960
But I went to Jang Enterprises

343
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,610
to reject the offer.

344
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,680
I also didn't know that mom

345
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,590
sent those kinds of documents to the office.

346
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,200
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,920
It's just that recent events

348
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,500
have put me on an edge.

349
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,550
I'll take care of my mom.

350
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,770
You don't have to stress about this.

351
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,780
Also,

352
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,380
I don't have any thoughts of leaving LUNA.

353
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,160
When did you come to Korea?

354
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,330
I was actually in Korea the whole time.

355
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,530
Are you saying you didn't go back to America at that time?

356
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,130
I had urgent work, so I had to stay.

357
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:04,250
Also, the house you told me you bought.

358
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,410
I went there.

359
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,790
Is it true that you got scammed?

360
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,560
Yes.

361
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,380
I bragged to you to come by,

362
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,690
but I got scammed.

363
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,420
That house is not worthy of this...

364
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,980
I tried my best to forget about everything, but why do you still live like this?

365
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,600
What's so precious about that house?

366
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,720
It's because that time was the happiest time of my life.

367
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,030
That time was everything to me.

368
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,230
You might have forgotten everything,

369
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,210
but to me, our family, the house we used to live in,

370
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,090
and the happy times we spent there,

371
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,720
I couldn't erase all that.

372
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,650
I'm sorry.

373
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:34,010
Also, I didn't forget,

374
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,880
but I tried to forget that time.

375
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:49,270
I tried hard to survive where I am and not get neglected.

376
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,130
That's why I pushed you away as well.

377
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,190
I thought you were so content

378
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,200
and that's why you forgot everything.

379
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,420
How can I forget all of our past?

380
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,830
Unni, I'm sorry.

381
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,450
Actually...

382
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,010
Actually, I...

383
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,840
Welcome.

384
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,090

385
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,850
  The person you're trying to call is not available right now...

386
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,830
Where did she go without even letting me know?

387
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,440
Then did our Yoon Joo get kicked out with nothing?

388
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,590
That is...

389
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,720
That's terrible.

390
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,710
You told me you liked her.

391
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,900
You said Yoon Tae In also liked Yoon Joo.

392
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,920
I believe Tae In is having a hard time, too.

393
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,430
He trusted Doctor that much.

394
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,110
But still, this is not right.

395
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:30,740
I know Yoon Joo did wrong, but if his feelings for her were genuine,

396
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,970
I thought he would've tried to understand her even if he might not be able to.

397
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,810
But how can he just kick her out like this?

398
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:53,160
  Hyung, where are you? It's practice time, but why haven't you come yet?

399
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:01,120
I think nobody's coming. Let's just go.

400
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,840
Wait, Shin Hyung.

401
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,970
What is it?

402
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,590
Do you know about that, too?

403
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,380
About what?

404
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,720
Let's persuade Yoo Chan Hyung together, shall we?

405
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,340
Let's keep working as LUNA together.

406
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,460
What are you talking about it?

407
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,440
The thing is...

408
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,550
CEO came by earlier and made a scene.

409
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,020
I guess Yoo Chan Hyung is going to terminate his contract and go to Jang Entertainment.

410
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,500
What? He's doing what?

411
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,720
I think he wants to do acting again.

412
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,970
Actually, I found a script in his room recently.

413
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,110
  Mom, please stop it!

414
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,430
  I got it. I'll think about it, so please stop it.

415
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,800
  Don't contact the director separately.

416
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,460
So let's try to persuade him not to go. Okay?

417
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,710
Why is my mom not picking up the phone?

418
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:06,010

419
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:09,190

420
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,430
Hyung!

421
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,920
You didn't pick up the phone, so I was worried about you.

422
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,180
You didn't come to the practice as well.

423
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,750
That can happen.

424
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,430
Now everything's revealed, so you don't even have to pretend,

425
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,660
is that what it is?

426
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,910
What? What are you talking about?

427
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,570
You were talking about keeping LUNA, but weren't you putting on a show the whole time?

428
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,310
Hey, are you saying that to me right now?

429
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,610
You are a born-to-be actor. You pretended to protect the team the whole time.

430
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,270
What the heck are you saying right now?

431
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,920
Say it straightforwardly.

432
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,040
Hey, Woo Ga On. What's going on with him?

433
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,480
That is... You're not, are you?

434
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,330
You're not going to leave LUNA, right?

435
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,860
What?

436
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,720
I overheard your conversation with the CEO.

437
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,540
I'm sorry.

438
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,320
- It's not like that. 
 - What's not like that?

439
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,090
Hey, Woo Ga On, why are you sorry?

440
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,850
If you didn't hear that, we might have gotten stabbed in our back.

441
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,570
Hey, Lee Shin!

442
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,670
I don't know what you heard,

443
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,370
but even if I left the team, I wouldn't run away like you without telling first!

444
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,360
You couldn't even take the responsibility until the end.

445
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,320
You are thinking of running away by hiding behind your mom!

446
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,600
How dare you!

447
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,880
Did you just hit me?

448
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,130
How dare you hit me!

449
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,480
Let me go!

450
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,450
Both of you, stop!

451
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,220
Seriously.

452
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,670
Let me go!

453
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,220
Stop it!

454
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,340
Seriously!

455
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,110
Jerk!

456
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,420
You should stop it, too!

457
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,570
Hyung!

458
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,130
What the heck are you doing?

459
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,150
Hey, you!

460
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,110
Who do you think you are? Shut up!

461
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,980
Hey!

462
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,430
- Hyung! 
 - Let me go!

463
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,410
Stop it!

464
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,660
What the heck are you guys doing?

465
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,390
Hey, you!

466
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,150
If you are going to fight, do it outside. It's noisy.

467
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,330
Hey, Yoon Tae In!

468
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,090
- Can't you say it better than that? 
 - How do you want me to say it?

469
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,720
You don't even care why we are fighting, do you?

470
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,770
Do I have to know the reason why you two are having a fist fight?

471
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,420
Why?

472
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,670
Right. What can I expect from you?

473
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:57,490
You only think of us as your sidekicks. We are only here to play your music, am I wrong?!

474
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,500
- What? 
 - Am I wrong?

475
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,740
You think you're the best, and we are all less than you.

476
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,690
Don't you all agree with me?

477
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,560
Sure.

478
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,440
If that was the issue, you could leave the team.

479
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,070
If you're going to be like this, just leave now.

480
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,370
- Hyung. 
 - Hey!

481
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,570
Fine! Let's give up.

482
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,570
Do you know why I–

483
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:44,200
Sure. I'll leave now as you wish.

484
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,030
I don't know why I wanted to stay in LUNA.

485
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,750
Sure.

486
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,590
We can do what you said.

487
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,630
- Hyung! Where are you going? 
 - Get out of my way!

488
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,780
Are you really going to leave like this?

489
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,910
I'm sorry for everything I did wrong.

490
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:20,920
I don't want to see you, either, so get away from me!

491
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,300
Hyung!

492
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,880
Did you really mean what you said?

493
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,130
Do you seriously want to give up LUNA?

494
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,030
If you were going to do this, you should've not let Doctor go!

495
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,610
- What? 
 - You're doing all this because of her.

496
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,190
Stop it.

497
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,630
Do you really not know?

498
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,670
Everyone could tell that she was sincere to you.

499
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,210
I said, stop it!

500
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,420
Why do I have to do more?

501
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,760
She was chased by private debt collectors not that long ago!

502
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,830
She knew things might get dangerous, but she gave up everything

503
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,160
and tried to tell you the truth.

504
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,430
But do you still not know?

505
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,010
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

506
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,330
Fine. You only care about yourself.

507
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:26,170
You only look at your wound, so you don't see or care about other people's wounds.

508
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:35,400
I thought you had changed a bit,

509
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,630
but I was mistaken.

510
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,000

511
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,140
The kids fought with each other?

512
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,220
Yes, I think they had a bit of a conflict.

513
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,190
Everyone left the team house last night besides Tae In.

514
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,750
Why? What was the reason?

515
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:06,720
It was because of the reason why you went to their house yesterday.

516
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,630
I think they had some misunderstanding because of Yoo Chan's case.

517
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:16,090
So, where is everybody?

518
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,880
Ga On just contacted me to let me know that he's with Yoo Chan at a hotel.

519
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,280
And Woo Yeon and Shin said they want to take a break.

520
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,510
Let's just let them have some rest.

521
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,380
I was taking care of Tae In too much

522
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,080
that I didn't care enough about the other members.

523
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,540

524
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,940
I'll contact them separately.

525
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,830
Okay.

526
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,070
Also, Soon Nam, since Tae In is by himself,

527
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,480
go take care of him.

528
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,660
Yes, I will.

529
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,440
I said I didn't want to eat.

530
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,520
Have a seat.

531
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,790
Even if you don't have any appetite, let's eat a bit.

532
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,910
You were stuck in your room and barely ate the past couple of days.

533
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,470
Hyung, I ordered a spicy rice cake that you like!

534
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,390
Let me sit next to you!

535
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,390
Gosh! Why are you clinging to me so much?

536
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,440
Come on! Let's eat.

537
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm hungry.

538
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,340
Spoon for you.

539
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,370
And chopsticks.

540
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,150
Let's eat.

541
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,800
Hyung, what should we do after eating this?

542
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,530
Do you want to play a game?

543
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,420
Or do you want to watch a movie?

544
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,740
After eating this, you should go.

545
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,710
- Why? 
 - Why do you keep following me?

546
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,910
I just thought you might be lonely.

547
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,310
That's ridiculous.

548
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:40,750
Why don't you go stay next to Yoon Tae In, whom you like so much?

549
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,650
I'm sorry about yesterday.

550
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,470
I misunderstood you without hearing your story.

551
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,250
I was scared that you might really leave the company.

552
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,830
It's my fault.

553
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,460
Shin Hyung is sorry to you as well.

554
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,770
Hey, forget about it!

555
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:03,710
I'm more upset about Yoon Tae In than Lee Shin right now.

556
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,160
That jerk will only care about himself forever.

557
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,310
Even if I quit the team, I will do it on my own terms!

558
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,210
Hey, Yoo Chan Hyung.

559
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,090
You quitting LUNA is not the best decision.

560
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,640
It's the worst decision.

561
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,840
What are you saying?

562
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:38,320
That's what Tae In Hyung told me when I said I'll quit the team.

563
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,710
Did he say something like that?

564
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,170
I think that's Tae In Hyung's true feeling.

565
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,570
I want to do LUNA for a long time with all of you.

566
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,010
So let's stay here for a bit and go back to the team house. Okay?

567
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,710
Let's go back!

568
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,570
Let's go back together!

569
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,460
Forget about it! I'm going to eat the rice cake here. I'm not going.

570
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,940
Come on! Let's eat together and go back together!

571
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,120
You go back by yourself! I'm not going!

572
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,690

573
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,890
  Where are you? Do you want to have a drink with me?

574
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,170
Do you remember this place?

575
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,410
Of course, I do.

576
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:15,790
This is where you older members came to drink without me.

577
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,280
I finally came to this place.

578
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:31,270
Did you hear about Yoo Chan Hyung from CEO?

579
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:36,390
Yes. I should say sorry to Yoo Chan Hyung.

580
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:41,560
I got angry at the time and didn't want to hear his story properly.

581
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,180
I'm sorry.

582
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,220
About what?

583
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:51,970
When you got someone you loved, I couldn't say anything

584
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,680
or encourage you as an older brother.

585
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:01,150
There's nothing wrong with what Yoo Chan Hyung said yesterday when I think about it.

586
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,860
I made a scene and broke up in the end.

587
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,050
I bet you are still having a hard time.

588
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:15,080
I'm trying to forget about her, but it's not easy.

589
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,230
Are you okay?

590
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,210
What about?

591
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,740
Are you okay with Dr. Kang leaving?

592
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,810
I know you had feelings for her, too.

593
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,630
I'm trying to get over her as well.

594
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,110
What?

595
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:03,440
You did what?

596
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,680
I'm sorry, Unni.

597
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:10,310
I told the CEO of MM Entertainment that I did this on my own,

598
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:14,120
so it won't harm you.

599
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,500
That's why Yoon Tae In made that face when he saw me...

600
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,770
Did you meet Yoon Tae In?

601
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,680
He knows one of my patients.

602
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,280
So what are you going to do now?

603
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,630
If they try to make a legal case out of this–

604
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,930
I'll... I'll do what I can do.

605
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,590
Do you know what you have done?

606
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,010
- What were you thinking– 
 - I had to live.

607
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,670
I really...

608
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,630
I really wanted to find a way to live.

609
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,970
So I'll...

610
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,310
I'll take responsibility no matter what.

611
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,750
You said you pretended to be me.

612
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,210
Then, it's my issue as well.

613
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,550
Yes.

614
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:45,870
Yoon Tae In, can we talk for a moment?

615
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,780
What is it about?

616
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:40,230
I'm here to apologize to you for what my younger sister did.

617
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,370
I'm sincerely...

618
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,060
I'm sincerely sorry.

619
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:56,700
I know I can't correct all of my sister's faults, but if it's okay with you,

620
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,410
I would like to offer you my treatment.

621
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,290
I don't need it.

622
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,380
Please, just go.

623
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,160
It's all because of me.

624
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,430
I always ran away,

625
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:20,220
and this all happened because I let Yoon Joo take care of everything by herself.

626
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,620
I want to compensate you in any way.

627
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:49,180
If you wish legal compensation, I will take every responsibility for that as well.

628
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,860
There's nothing to be compensated.

629
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:01,120
I'm recovered now.

630
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,590
I actually got over my illness.

631
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:13,590
If you don't have anything else to say, please leave.

632
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,770
  You always only care about yourself.

633
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,340
  You only look at your wound,

634
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,790
  so you don't see nor care about other people's wounds.

635
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:57,550
  Everyone could tell that she was sincere to you.

636
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,380
♫   I can't hide it   ♫

637
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,840
  How can that be okay?

638
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,760
  When I lost everything I built up,

639
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,840
  I felt like my entire world was collapsing.

640
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,440
  So what did you do after that?

641
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,270
  I couldn't...

642
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,490
  do anything.

643
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,970
  I just...

644
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:02,180
  I didn't want to do anything after that.

645
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:08,430
♫   You are my soul   ♫

646
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:13,830

647
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:21,740

648
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:29,160
♫   You are my love forever   ♫

649
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,510
♫   If I can be with you   ♫

650
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:40,830

651
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,160
  Where are you? Yoon Tae In!

652
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,670
♫   I'll only love you forever   ♫

653
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:52,060
  Yoon Tae In!

654
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,360
  Are you okay?

655
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,670
  Oh, no! How long have you been here like this?

656
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,000
  Yoon Tae In!

657
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,110
♫   Even if this world will disappear   ♫

658
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,640
  Yoon Tae In! Are you okay?

659
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,880
  Are you coming back to consciousness?

660
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,590
  Yoon Tae In, please wake up!

661
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:10,590
  Yoon Tae In, please wake up.

662
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:28,970
I'm sure she lives somewhere around here.

663
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:32,170
We should've figured it out at that time.

664
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,040
Ms. In Yoon Joo!

665
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,590
Who are you?

666
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,810
If you are hungry, you should eat, sleep when you're sleepy,

667
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,130
and pay back the money if you borrowed it.

668
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:12,700
I bet you ate well and slept well.

669
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,840
Why don't you pay back our money?

670
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,370
You guys are–!

671
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:24,900
What's up with your eyes?

672
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:31,100
I guess we look like pushovers to you.

673
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,280
Who the heck are you guys?

674
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,500
Who the heck are you?

675
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:48,900
Did you bother her like this until now?

676
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,600
Do you know this woman?

677
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,460
Leave it. You are a very pretty boy.

678
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:58,220
I guess she's your girlfriend, but this is nothing compared what we did before.

679
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,120
Isn't that right?

680
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,180
Isn't money all you need?

681
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,380
Include the money for this, and tell me.

682
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,860
How much do you need?

683
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:39,500
Why are you doing this much?

684
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,290
I told you.

685
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:47,310
I got over my illness thanks to your sister.

686
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,930
It's instead of my treatment fee.

687
00:58:56,350 --> 00:59:01,170
If my sister knows about this, she'll suffer more.

688
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,570
Is she...

689
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,380
Is she doing okay?

690
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:21,770
Then do you know...

691
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,610
where she is now?

692
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:29,660
I don't know where she is, either.

693
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:44,190
Why don't you call her directly?

694
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:17,590

695
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,720
  Don't even cry.

696
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,370
  I can't even trust that.

697
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,590
Yoon Tae In.

698
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,340
I missed you.

699
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:09,990

700
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,370
I missed you as well.

701
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,960
I'll protect you from now on.

702
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,310
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

703
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:48,630

704
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:52,950
♫  Feel so cold, so cold, it feels so cold, so cold  ♫

705
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:59,170
♫  The reason why everything has stopped  ♫

706
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,710
♫  You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you're gone  ♫

707
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:05,550
  Without these ropes, I want to be with you.

708
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,450
  That's what I want.

709
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,970
  What? Why is our house door unlocked?

710
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:11,030
  Something seemed wrong, so I followed.

711
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,050
  Is this the right place?

712
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,730
  I'm scared! It looks like a haunted house!

713
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:15,610
  Where are you?

714
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:17,530
  Come out right now!

715
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:19,230
  What was it just now?

716
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,120
  Let's just talk for a second.

717
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,680
  Please! Someone help us!

718
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,100
  I know you were sincere to me.

719
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:33,170
  Thank you for being the happiest memory of my life.

720
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:36,530
  Please wake up. In Yoon Joo!

721
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:42,290
♫  Like your words full of contradictions  ♫

722
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:44,140
♫   Maybe a wonderful end would come  ♫

723
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:49,780
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

724
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:54,270
♫  Feel so cold, so cold, it feels so cold, so cold  ♫
