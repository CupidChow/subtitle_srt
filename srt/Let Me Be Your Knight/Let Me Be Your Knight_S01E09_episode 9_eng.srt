1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,910

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,280

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,810

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,740

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,570

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,580

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,040

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,590

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,790

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,310

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,780

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,730

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,220

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,260
 Happy birthday, Sister.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,900
 Happy birthday to you, too.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,880
 Let's make a wish.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:07,140

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,130
 What wish did you make?

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,340
 If you tell your wish to someone else, then it will not come true.

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,090
 Is that so?

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,690
 If it comes true sometime, I'll tell you then.

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,560
 Okay.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,250
 Let's eat now.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,020
 It looks delicious.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,430
 Sister,

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,290
 if I think about it, then maybe

27
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,300
 I was not really curious what your wish was.

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,970
 Because I assumed that

29
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,960
 your wish would be the same as mine.

30
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,020
 To live in this home again,

31
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,270
 where we lived together.

32
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,690
"Sister," you say.

33
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,150
You still haven't moved on.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,970
 But

35
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,350
 I realized too late

36
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,870
 that your wish was different than mine.

37
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,180
 In a place where wishes have vanished, there was no one left.

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,210
 It was that time when

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,640
 that person came in my life.

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,120
 But...

41
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,850
♪ My confession to you

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,770
How was it?

43
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,060
Oh,

44
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,770
that is...

45
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,160
You inspired me to write this song.

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,320
What?

47
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,240
I like you.

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,790
Please continue to stay by me.

49
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,560
Yoon Tae In,

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,700
are you going to forget everything again like the last time and...

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,370
♫  I'm afraid  ♫

52
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,170
♫  It feels cold  ♫

53
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,900
♫  The world looks like  ♫

54
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,670
♫  A black and white street with the lights off  ♫

55
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:42,630
♫  The sound of piano that has lost  ♫

56
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,260
Whatever it is,

57
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,400
I don't think this is right.

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
What?

59
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,330
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,260
Wait.

61
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,250
Dr. Kang!

62
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,270
What are you doing, Yoon In Joo?

63
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,920
Snap out of it.

64
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,380

65
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,190

66
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,060
- You?
- I eat eggs.

67
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,050
I eat it with 3 eggs.

68
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,370
I never eat them with egg.

69
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,680
Ga On

70
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,840
grabbed Tae In like this...

71
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,580
Eat together.

72
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,510
Isn't that the point?

73
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,800
No thanks.

74
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,780
Let's talk a little.

75
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,070
A-About what?

76
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,150
I have to confirm something because I'm a little confused.

77
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,200
Today's our

78
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,930
first day as a couple, right?

79
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,140
- What?  
 - Yesterday's kiss...

80
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,830
I mean we kissed after midnight.

81
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,220
I'm asking you in case you thought of it as a second day.

82
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,560
We have to be accurate with the date.

83
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,600
Yoon Tae In,

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,730
it seems like

85
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,000
you misunderstood something.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,630
What's that?

87
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,530
That day,

88
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,110
because of the atmosphere,

89
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,040
I made a mistake

90
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,580
unconsciously.

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,250
You don't have to be like this.

92
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,720
I hate playing games,

93
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,780
so let's not waste our energy like this.

94
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,820
I'm not playing games.

95
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,400
So...

96
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,680
I'll leave soon anyway, and–

97
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,660
I did think about that, too.

98
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,280
A direct flight from Seoul to L.A...

99
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,080
takes 13 hours.

100
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,430
This may sound long but all I have to do is to watch Queen's concert at Wembley in 1986

101
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,670
just seven times, and I'll be in LA.

102
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,040
The distance doesn't matter.

103
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,550
That...

104
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,570
Well, the thing is,

105
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,530
I never date my patients.

106
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,270
When the contract is over,  I won't be your patient anymore.

107
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,080
I can wait until then.

108
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,400
Well,

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,140
it's just that...

110
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,850
you're not my type.

111
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,210
Why am I  not her type?

112
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,920
What's wrong with me?

113
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,650
 The manager's ideal type is a nice man.

114
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,520
 Where can you find a nicer guy than Seo Woo Yeon?

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,490
 Nice guy?

116
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,620
 Yeah. You're definitely not.

117
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,080
Nice guy. Nice guy.

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,440
Hey, take a look at this.

119
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,910
- Lee Shin is the #1 idol guy that girls want to date. 
- Wow!

120
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,840
And,

121
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,420
the idol guy who girls want to marry the most is

122
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,390
Seo Woo Yeon.

123
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,140
I agree.

124
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,270
Shin, you're not even on the chart.

125
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,260
I knew it.

126
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,110
Everyone wants to marry a nice guy.

127
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,830
Is that so?

128
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,370
What? You're not on the chart, either.

129
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,580
Well, that's not my charm.

130
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,280
But it's strange that Tae In is also not here.

131
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
Strange!

132
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,290
Here he is.

133
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,770
The idol

134
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,500
who seems to be the "bad guy" type while dating.

135
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,080
- He's number one! 
 - What?

136
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,350
You're right!

137
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,810
I'd rather not be on this list.

138
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,780
What's this?

139
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,690
What did I do?

140
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,870
How am I?

141
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,850
You scared me.

142
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,680
Well then...

143
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,100
How on earth are you supposed to act while dating to be considered nice?

144
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,640
I'm not angry.

145
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,420
I'm just curious to know.

146
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,730
Okay. All right.

147
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,310
To me, a nice guy is

148
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,130
someone who compliments me often.

149
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,460
Compliment?

150
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,000
Not like that. Give him some practical tips.

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,900
But still,

152
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,060
everyone likes it when they get compliments.

153
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,770
Do you know the song I just played?

154
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,480
What?

155
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,120
What was it?

156
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,250
The note I used to describe you, "Re,"

157
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,520
passed "Do,"  (expression for "gone too far")

158
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,620
and is about to reach "Mi." (expression for "going crazy")

159
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,870
Are you really crazy?

160
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,570
 Gosh, that's too literal of a translation.

161
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,050
First of all, improving your appearance might

162
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,980
show your kindness.

163
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,180
These days, men need to take care of their appearance as well.

164
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,880
Personally, I think the most important thing...

165
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,600
is your fashion.

166
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,440
This is

167
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,550
what's most important, I think.

168
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,500
Style.

169
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,030
- Style. 
 - Oh, come on!

170
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,000
 After all, men look the most handsome

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,980
 Suit.

172
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,910
Did...

173
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,170
someone pass away?

174
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,700
 Scratch that.

175
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,710
 Maybe something more masculine.

176
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,270
Oh, right. Hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) is trending these days.

177
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,550
What do you think?

178
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,870
Something traditional...

179
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,310
is the most global.

180
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,930
It's me.

181
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,020
Gosh, I thought you were the Grim Reaper!

182
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,480
What's wrong with you? Seriously! Geez!

183
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,250
 Hyung.

184
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,760
 It's not about how you talk or dress.

185
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,880
Put the other person...

186
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
before you...

187
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,770
and being considerate is being nice.

188
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,870
Understand their perspective and respect it.

189
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,290
Understand?

190
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,820
Gosh, you scared me!

191
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,780
What are you doing here?

192
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,270
I will stay here today

193
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,540
so you can go to my room and sleep comfortably in my bed.

194
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,140
What?

195
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,340
It must've been uncomfortable for you.

196
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,730
I want to be considerate.

197
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,750
It's my job to sleep here and protect you, Mr. Yoon Tae In.

198
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,620
If you really want to be considerate...

199
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,040
then don't steal my job...

200
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,320
and come out of my tent.

201
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,300
You said you like nice guys.

202
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,950
I threw some cheesy lines to compliment you, dressed differently, and just now...

203
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,260
right now, I was even considerate.

204
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,410
What's the kind person you're talking about?

205
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,820
Then...

206
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,180
everything you've been doing up until now...

207
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,750
Yes.

208
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,580
I tried super hard to be the man you like.

209
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,790
I like you exactly as you are.

210
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,370
But why do you not like me?

211
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,310
Well...

212
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,370
You see...

213
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,430
Tell me ten reasons why you don't like me.

214
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,190
Right now.

215
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,500
I'm not kidding.

216
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,180
I'm serious.

217
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,200
Well...

218
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,640
But...

219
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,440
how can I

220
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,370
say to your face

221
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,000
all the reasons why I don't like you?

222
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,170
Okay.

223
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,830
Then by tomorrow,

224
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,080
put it in writing and submit to me.

225
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,420
What?

226
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,000
Written form?

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,010
Until then, I can never believe that you dislike me that much.

228
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,850
Are you saying it's completely one-sided?

229
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,310
I clearly

230
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,880
felt our hearts for each other.

231
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,600
When does the filming begin for this?

232
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,460
This film?

233
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,770
I don't think I will be doing it.

234
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,890
Why?

235
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,810
You really wanted to do it.

236
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,310
CEO is telling me to do things that are profitable.

237
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,350
He told me

238
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,240
to stop acting like an actress all of a sudden.

239
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,370
Did he say that?

240
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,490
I really don't like him at all.

241
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,940
I also got angry at first.

242
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,150
Then I thought about it,

243
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,320
and it's true that my passion for acting has really fizzled out.

244
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,780
I didn't nitpick my roles in the past and I did my very best.

245
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,050
I actually want to write the script myself

246
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,630
and make my own movies.

247
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,390
Writer Choi Ji Yeon.

248
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,190
Director Choi Ji Yeon.

249
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,040
Both are good.

250
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,210
I wonder if I can do it at this point.

251
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,880
How about you, Shin?

252
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,670
Is there anything else you wanted to do other than music?

253
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,980
No.

254
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,960
I like performing on stage the most.

255
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,310
Normally,

256
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,860
I would be busy with concerts.

257
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,970
Well,

258
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,580
we can work twice as hard when we release our next album.

259
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,550
When you talk about music,

260
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,490
your expression really changes. Do you know that?

261
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,340
I do?

262
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,760
Is that so?

263
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,660
Have I drunk too much coffee today?

264
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,500

265
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,820

266
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,450
Wow!

267
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,410
Wow!

268
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,720
Amazing!

269
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,370
Who are you?

270
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,240
How did you come here?

271
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,970
Let go.

272
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,890
I said let...

273
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,640
Maybe not like this.

274
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,920
I'm telling you, let go. Let go.

275
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,680
Who's here?

276
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,230
Are you okay?

277
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,000
Hey!

278
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,160
You have to at least knock first to come in the washroom!

279
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,130
Gosh, you scared me.

280
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,740
I was just passing by,

281
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,720
and heard a voice.

282
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,530
I thought someone sneaked in here.

283
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,020
It's not like that. Go, now.

284
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,500
Then you were talking to yourself?

285
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,750
What happened?

286
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,740
Just when Tae In is recovering,

287
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,790
this is happening to you.

288
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,550
It's not like that.

289
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,800
Go, now. Just go.

290
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,390

291
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:32,860

292
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,880
Oh, right!

293
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,790
 Don't talk to me and just stay out of my sight.

294
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,750
 You being here already makes me stressed out.

295
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,530
He is rude

296
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,700

297
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,230
when he talks.

298
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,830
 I didn't think you'd be this mean.

299
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,840
 You two were estranged for a long time.

300
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,960
  You didn't watch your younger sister's life, but you say her life was pathetic.

301
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,250
  How can you speak so thoughtlessly?

302
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,820
But then again, he sometimes

303
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,300
says good things, too.

304
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,750
The first one is done.

305
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,460
The next one,

306
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,000

307
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,400

308
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,470
He doesn't know anything

309
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,350
except for work.

310
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,250
♫   Nothing's different. Time goes by busily   ♫

311
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:55,450
♫   Didn't even know the sun was rising and setting   ♫

312
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,380
He was cool.

313
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,380
  10 reasons why I don't like Yoon Tae In: 1. He is rude when he talks. 2. He doesn't know anything except for work. 3. His fashion style isn't good. 4. He has a bad temper.

314
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,280
 5. His legs are so long that it looks disgusting. 6. He only knows himself. 7. He's too busy. 8. He's a bad drunk. 9. It's overwhelming because he's a celebrity.

315
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,730
 10. I just hate it all.

316
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,630
I didn't know that you hated me this much.

317
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,160
I now know your heart well.

318
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,400

319
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,220
Looks delicious.

320
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,490
Oh, Dr. Kang.

321
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,980
Yoo Chan.

322
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,630
I just made Spicy chicken tteokbokki. Would you like to have some?

323
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,100
Everyone is saying this dish is to die for.

324
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,130
No, thanks.

325
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,740
You go ahead and dig in.

326
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,470
Dr. Kang,

327
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,320
why do you look so down?

328
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,030
It must be so hard to do treatment for Tae In.

329
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,440
Gosh.

330
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,180
It's all right.

331
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,320
Enjoy your meal.

332
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,410
Oh,

333
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,480
it doesn't taste good when eaten alone.

334
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,080
You must like tteokbokki a lot.

335
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,000
I might be oversharing,

336
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,640
- but my mom never let me eat it when I was young. 
 - Why?

337
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,190
Because my face would look chubby on TV.

338
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,790
Oh.

339
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,830
Yoo Chan, you were a child actor, right?

340
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,680
You were doing it from a young age.

341
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,490
That's amazing.

342
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,120
But why did you suddenly decide to do music?

343
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,170
Because my mom told me to try being an idol.

344
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,970
I...

345
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,340
looked like a mama's boy just now, didn't I?

346
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,140
No, you didn't.

347
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,490
It's your mother who suggested it,

348
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,870
but the person who did it is you.

349
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,150
Besides, when I watched the home concert,

350
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,250
I noticed that you have an expressive face when playing drums.

351
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,410
I think you have a lot of talent.

352
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,540
Seriously?

353
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,130
Yeah.

354
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,190
You could also continue acting.

355
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,440
Don't you act anymore?

356
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,620
Well...

357
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,040
Excuse me.

358
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,190

359
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,070
Thank you for the meal.

360
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,720
Yes?

361
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,020

362
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,260

363
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,390
Hey!

364
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,900
In Yoon Joo, hop on.

365
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,920
In Yoon Joo?

366
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,310

367
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,310
What?

368
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,710
Yoon Tae In!

369
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,610
He was supposed to be making music.

370
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,270
He said he likes you?

371
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,710
He doesn't even care about the Moonlights who are waiting for his new album without blinking.

372
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,690
This is just disrespectful of his fans.

373
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,140
So,

374
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,050
how do you feel?

375
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,000
I like him, too.

376
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,310
What I just said

377
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,320
was my opinion as a LUNA fan.

378
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,680
As In Yoon Joo's best friend

379
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,330
who'll go into senior care center with you when we get old,

380
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,580
I approve of this relationship.

381
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,210
But

382
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,700
I'm lying about my identity.

383
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,240
That's right.

384
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,370
That could be a problem for our Tae In's sharp personality.

385
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,890
He said he'll understand if I write ten reasons why I hate him.

386
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,950
I thought I'd have written it quickly,

387
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,980
but all those reasons why I don't like him

388
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,540
are actually the reasons why I came to like him.

389
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,290
Seriously, what's happened to me?

390
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,220
I guess...

391
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,210
he really wanted to hold on to you.

392
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,130
So, what do you want to do?

393
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,600
I want to tell him the truth even if it's too late,

394
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,940
but I'm afraid he'll get disappointed in me.

395
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,400
If his feelings for you are sincere,

396
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,340
why don't you tell him the truth?

397
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,900
Honestly,

398
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,030
if he knows that you got scammed and almost died,

399
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,770
he will understand.

400
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,400
I don't think you would've come here because you suddenly missed me.

401
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,130
Right? What is it?

402
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,510
Did something happen?

403
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,740
CEO,

404
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,320
we're on a break right now,

405
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,800
and it'll take some time

406
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,260
for Tae In to make the album,

407
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,160
so...

408
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,470
would it be okay if I do personal activities?

409
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,950
Oh...

410
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,560
Personal activities.

411
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,620
As long as it doesn't interfere with LUNA's work.

412
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,690
You've already done some radio shows

413
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,680
and variety shows.

414
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,670
Why? Do you want to do something else?

415
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,590
Acting.

416
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,950
I want to act.

417
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,660
If there's good work,

418
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,060
I thought it might be nice to try it again.

419
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,290
Acting?

420
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,150
Oh...

421
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,730
Did someone suggest something

422
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,080
to you separately?

423
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,180
No, no!

424
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,870
It's not like that.

425
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,510
I just wanted to try it while the team is on break.

426
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,600
I won't make the team suffer because of me.

427
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,310
Well...

428
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,610
Yoo Chan.

429
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,910
The previous album's score was a bit low

430
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,940
and the next one is taking some time,

431
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,340
so I understand you're worried.

432
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,210
But you know right now is

433
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,820
a really important time for all of us, right?

434
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,180
Right.

435
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,290
For Tae In to focus

436
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,350
on making the next album,

437
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,880
you know?

438
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,000
Right?

439
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,060
Our next album is really crucial.

440
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,350
I just said it. Please don't mind what I said.

441
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,930
I feel bad for you.

442
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,300
But for acting,

443
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,740
I'll look for good timing next time

444
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,160
and look for an opportunity for you.

445
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,590
Okay.

446
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:56,610

447
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,090
Oh?

448
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,790
What brings you here?

449
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,160
I wanted to ask the CEO something.

450
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,660
What about you?

451
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,250
I...

452
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,950
I came by since I was in the office.

453
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,230
Is that so?

454
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,000
Why do you want to see this all of a sudden?

455
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,900
Did your symptoms

456
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,390
get worse again?

457
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,320
No, I just want to see it.

458
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,020
I want to know the exact contract period.

459
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,220

460
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,180
CEO.

461
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,200
Oh! You didn't have to bring any food.

462
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,960
Why did you bring out so much?

463
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,030
I thought you might like it.

464
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,320
Ah...

465
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,720
Thank you for the food.

466
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,250
Okay.

467
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,440
Then, enjoy.

468
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:18,020

469
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,670
Excuse me.

470
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,860
I'm sorry, but we're closed now.

471
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,750
Seo... Seo Woo Yeon!

472
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,570
I was wondering if you're Dr. Kang Sun Joo's friend.

473
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,070
Pardon?

474
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,950
No, I'm not.

475
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,890
Then, are you a friend of In Yoon Joo?

476
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,780

477
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,710
Please spare her. Please forgive my Yoon Joo.

478
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:15,590
I'm not saying this because I'm her friend, but she's not that kind of person.

479
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,730
She always worked very hard to make money and never cheated her way,

480
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,520
but she got scammed by a trusted boss and got chased by private loan sharks.

481
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,970
She had no choice since she got into the danger of death.

482
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,780
- Private loan sharks? 
 - Yes!

483
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:37,210
She got kidnapped and got a death threat to pay back the money she didn't even borrow!

484
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,920
I'll beg you for her. Please overlook this once.

485
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,210
Then, Dr. Kang Sun Joo, I mean...

486
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,380
In Yoon Joo. What is the relationship between her and the real Dr. Kang Sun Joo?

487
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,070
She is her twin older sister who got separated when they were young.

488
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,800
Does Yoon Tae In know about this as well?

489
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,600
- No. 
 - Please! Oh, I'm sorry.

490
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,010
Please don't say this to Yoon Tae In.

491
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:19,670
You can give her a chance to tell the truth to the person she likes and ask for forgiveness.

492
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,220
The person she likes?

493
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,100
I won't say anything, so don't worry,

494
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,290
but you also have to keep a secret that I know about this.

495
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:04,140

496
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,670
Boss!

497
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,770
You surprised me! What... Do you want to buy a book?

498
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,880
You're funny... Oh, well.

499
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,760
What is going on?

500
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,140
If you're going to drink without saying anything, you should've drunk by yourself at home. Why did you come here?

501
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,400
Boss.

502
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,520
Yes? What is it?

503
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,460
There's a woman that I have feelings for.

504
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,210
A woman that you like?

505
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,820
But does she not have feelings for you?

506
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,270
That's right.

507
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,770
Oh, you...

508
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,670
It's not easy if the person I like also likes me.

509
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,350
But...

510
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,700
She has another person she has feelings for.

511
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,140
Is it a love triangle?

512
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,340
Even worse, the one she likes is my friend.

513
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,680
Oh, no. That's a tough one.

514
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,040
Also, she has a secret

515
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,190
and I'm the only one who knows about it.

516
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,470
A secret?

517
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,070
If I tell the secret,

518
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,170
my friend might leave her.

519
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,700
Should I just say it to him?

520
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,390
It's up to you.

521
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,910
Whatever it takes, you should win your love, shouldn't you?

522
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,320
Right?

523
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,570
I never knew I would be thinking such a mean thing.

524
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,380
Hey!

525
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,660
Love is not something as noble as you might think.

526
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:05,130
People become mean and petty. Even the most generous person can turn petty.

527
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,090
That's what love does.

528
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,560
Don't you think so?

529
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,150
Woo Yeon, have another glass.

530
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,560
Here.

531
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,720
Where are you going at this hour?

532
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,280
I'm going to the practice room in the basement.

533
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,020
Are you doing that because you feel uncomfortable because of me?

534
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,740
If that's the reason, I'll leave.

535
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,710
I'm not being considerate to you. I have things to do in the practice room.

536
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,510
Don't even think about coming down to the practice room.

537
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,970
I think he is feeling uncomfortable around me.

538
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,510
I feel like he's not coming back because of me.

539
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,130
Should I go downstairs?

540
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:54,930
You don't have to guard in front of my room like this anymore. You can sleep in your room comfortably.

541
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,810
It's okay. It's my job.

542
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:03,410
I'm not okay. It's uncomfortable.

543
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,690

544
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,280

545
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm sorry. I thought about it a lot, but I don't think I can do it this time.

546
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,130
Please say that to the director as well.

547
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,350
Why? Was the script bad?

548
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,810
- No! The script was really great, but– 
 - Right?

549
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,560
I read this entire script in one sitting. It's really fun.

550
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,420
I think it's a great piece.

551
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,490
But I want to focus on Luna's activities now.

552
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,300
Also...

553
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,990
from now on,

554
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,060
please don't see my mom.

555
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,560
It's perfect for misunderstanding if someone hears this!

556
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,410
I never tried to see her. Your mother was the aggressive one.

557
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,920
Also, I see anyone who can bring money to me.

558
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,780
Even if they might not be worth it at the moment, but if there's potential.

559
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,830
Don't you think we might work together in the future, Yoo Chan?

560
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,110
Anyway, I said everything that I needed to say.

561
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,170
Okay.

562
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,540
Just take this with you as a memory.

563
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,710
Your name is printed on the top. Where else can I use this?

564
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:38,230

565
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,780
  Let's finish our interview here. I'll write you a great article.

566
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,830
  Thank you! Please write it well for us!

567
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,170
Yes, thank you.

568
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,790

569
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,180
I just grabbed it because the phone was ringing...

570
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,390
Yes, did you check the email I sent?

571
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,620
I guess he doesn't even want to talk to me anymore.

572
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,550
Is there one for me?

573
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,300
At that time, I told you nothing happened in the used book store.

574
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,530
But actually, something did happen.

575
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:38,030
Pardon? What happened?

576
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,420
That time we talked a little bit...

577
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,920
I pretended that I was the bookstore owner

578
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,800
because I wanted to talk to you like just now.

579
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,800
Is that so?

580
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,040
But I really don't remember that moment.

581
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,560
It's okay. We didn't know each other then.

582
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,880
But we're close now, right?

583
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,340
Of course.

584
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:19,410
At some point in our lives,

585
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,960
when you feel more comfortable about me,

586
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,360
I hope you can tell me what you can't say right now,

587
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,100
because the fact that you're a good person will never change.

588
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,350
I will.

589
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,590
I think we got it.

590
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,160
Do you know this person?

591
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,750
Excuse me?

592
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,640
He's looking for his mom, who he lost when he was young.

593
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,330
Do you know this woman by any chance?

594
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,680
She seemed to live here a long time ago.

595
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,420
I'm not sure.

596
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:32,420
My mother lived in this neighborhood for a long time.

597
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,740
Her mother lived in this town for a long time.

598
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,730
Then, can we meet your mother?

599
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:45,490
She went out today. Can you come back tomorrow?

600
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,230
- Tomorrow? 
 - Yes.

601
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,850
I'll be back tomorrow.

602
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,540
Okay.

603
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:14,190
I think I had something just like this when I was young, so I bought it.

604
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,150
Thank you.

605
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:24,530
I have also, this.

606
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,440
What is it?

607
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,470
It's your birthday today.

608
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,920
Ah... Thank you.

609
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,360
I almost forgot.

610
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,150
You said you're a twin, right?

611
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,730
Today must be your sister's birthday, too.

612
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,110
I'm curious how do you guys blow the candle when you're twins.

613
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,930
The elder one goes first, and the younger one goes next?

614
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,140
My sister always let me do it first.

615
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,350
She's very thoughtful.

616
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,430
  Happy birthday.

617
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,740
Here.

618
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,080
Yoo Chan, Shin! I'm here!

619
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,210
Hyung, welcome.

620
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,540
Why did you come so early?

621
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,610
Today you have a radio show.

622
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,350
Wasn't that at night?

623
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,320
Today we're pre-recording it.

624
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,940
Hyung, I'll come down after getting ready to go.

625
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,730
- Okay. 
 - That's right. I'll get ready fast as well!

626
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,820
Get ready and come out! I'll wait for you guys in the car.

627
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,600

628
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,650
Hey, Woo Ga! Why are you looking at someone else's thing?

629
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,360
What is it? Why are you hiding that so much?

630
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,240
It's my script for today's radio show.

631
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,830
Why is a script for radio that thick?

632
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,200
Is it going to air until tomorrow?

633
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,250
  Yoo Chan Hyung! Are you not ready yet?

634
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,600
I'm coming!

635
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,240
I'll get going.

636
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,450
Hey, let's go!

637
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:56,190
Hyung, what is that?

638
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,900
This?

639
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,120
It's nothing. What is that on your hand?

640
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,010
It's nothing as well.

641
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,390
- Shall we go? 
 - Let's go.

642
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,400
Hello, Sunbaenim. Are you here for your schedule?

643
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,370
Yes, I have a recording for the radio show.

644
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,600
Is that so?

645
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,580
Good luck with your recording.

646
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,890
Here's your coffee.

647
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,760
Thank you!

648
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,580
They moved their recording space, so it takes a bit longer to prepare.

649
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,780
Is that so?

650
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,160
Where's Shin?

651
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,110
I don't know. Maybe he went to the restroom.

652
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,230
Did he?

653
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,060
I'll go and see.

654
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,780
I have to rush to go and get ready.

655
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,210
Take this. Drink this while you're getting ready.

656
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,080
What is this?

657
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,710
You told me yesterday you felt like you're getting a cold. It's ginger tea.

658
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,590
Did you make this on your own?

659
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:37,260
I wish I could say that, but I can't lie to you.

660
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,770
The tumbler is mine, and I got the tea on the way here.

661
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,020
Thank you. I'll drink it.

662
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,940
I need to go now.

663
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,790
I'll go downstairs, so you go out that way.

664
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,710
I'll see you later.

665
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,980
I was wondering where you went.

666
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,330
What are you doing here?

667
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,810
I was...

668
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,540
Are you out of your mind?

669
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,680
If another person opened that door at that time, what would you have done?

670
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,610
That's enough.

671
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,160
Were all those rumors real?

672
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,070
- Since when did this start? 
 - It's a private matter.

673
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,460
Sure, it's your private life

674
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,900
- that everyone will know in a matter of time! 
 - I won't let that happen.

675
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,740
I won't harm LUNA.

676
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,020
I don't need to know when it started,

677
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,280
but how long are you going to date her?

678
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,220
What?

679
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,900
Honestly, she's not somebody you should date for a long time.

680
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,920
Why not?

681
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,130
It's because she's much older than you

682
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,210
and she was married before.

683
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,750
Seriously... Hey!

684
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,480
Do I even have to say something like this?

685
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,910
- Are you really asking me because you don't know? 
 - Yes.

686
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:06,890
I really don't know.

687
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,900
I really don't understand why everybody's saying that!

688
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,060
What? Everybody?

689
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:18,790
Are you saying more people know about this besides me?

690
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:22,680
Look at this. Already so many people know about you doing this!

691
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,670
Hey, guys. Let's go now.

692
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,930
They said they were ready.

693
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,990
- Yoo Chan, did you eat already? 
 - Ah, yes.

694
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:46,250
You look a bit down. Did something happen?

695
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,660
I'm just a bit tired.

696
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,770
I guess you're really busy these days.

697
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,690
Then, let's do this again today.

698
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,940
♫   It's my confession to you   ♫

699
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,100
 If his feelings for you are sincere,

700
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,100
 why don't you tell him the truth?

701
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,660
  If he knows that you got scammed and almost died,

702
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,050
  he will understand.

703
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,690
Do you have time?

704
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,820
Yoon Tae In.

705
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,330
Even if you don't have time, follow me.

706
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,990
It's something I can't do by myself.

707
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,890
I'll wait for you in the car

708
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,350

709
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,060
So beautiful.

710
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,030
When we came to this beach before, you told me

711
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:37,300
the sun always rises and sets, but you wonder why it makes you look more closely when you're at the beach.

712
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,630
I think you were like that to me.

713
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:46,360
Now I can see it.

714
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:57,010
I thought maybe if we came here, you might look at me as well.

715
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,550
That's why I brought you here.

716
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,050
I came here because you said there's something you can't do by yourself.

717
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,280
It's ready.

718
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,170
Thank you.

719
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:33,210
If I want to celebrate a birthday, I need the birthday person.

720
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,730
I prepared this for you.

721
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,510
Happy Birthday!

722
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,120
I get that you don't like me much,

723
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,350
but at least I can celebrate your birthday with you.

724
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,530
You might not even have anyone to celebrate your birthday with in Korea.

725
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:11,100
How did you know?

726
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,900
  Why do you want to see this all of a sudden?

727
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,150
  I want to know the exact contract period.

728
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:24,040

729
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,500
  Are you doing that because you feel uncomfortable because of me?

730
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,620
  I'm not being considerate to you, I have things to do in the practice room.

731
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,770
  Don't even think about coming down to the practice room.

732
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:45,320
♫   Stay in, stay by my side   ♫

733
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,760
♫   Stay by my side   ♫

734
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,960
♫   We could be love one day. I'll be honest now   ♫

735
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,020
♫   Don't cry before...   ♫

736
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,990
♫   We could be love one day. I'll be honest now   ♫

737
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:10,340
♫   Don't cry before your heart. I won't be afraid   ♫

738
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,420
  I just grabbed it because the phone was ringing.

739
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,190
♫   Even when the darkness comes, will you hold my hand?    ♫

740
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,170
♫   I won't let it go   ♫

741
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:23,150
 Yes, did you check the email I sent?

742
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,770
♫   We could be love one day   ♫

743
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,510
 Will it be possible to make that design?

744
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:32,790
♫   Will you feel it? The wind that's blowing to you   ♫

745
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,880
  I need that a bit urgently.

746
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,580
♫   I'll wish for us to love each other   ♫

747
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:44,410
♫   I'll say my feeling that I'm taking out gently now   ♫

748
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:52,670
♫   It's unforgettable dream to me  ♫

749
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:56,400

750
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:07,570
♫   It's my confession to you   ♫

751
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,220
You told me women like small and shiny things,

752
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:32,080
but I thought if it's just small and shiny, then it might not be interesting,

753
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,410
so I put the song that I sang for you in it

754
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,200
because that song is for you.

755
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,430
What are you waiting for? Blow out the candles quickly.

756
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,630
It'll melt away.

757
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,170
What wish did you make?

758
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:29,850
  I made a wish for you to stay next to me, even if you know that I'm In Yoon Joo.

759
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,350
I heard that if you tell the wish, that wish won't come true.

760
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:47,380
It makes me more curious if you don't tell me. Can't you just say it?

761
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,280
Mr. Yoon Tae In... I need to tell you something.

762
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,990
The person you think I am...

763
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,160
I'm not that person.

764
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,600
Why are they not coming out?

765
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,670
The two of them are here, right?

766
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,420
Yes. I think they'll come out soon.

767
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,860

768
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:32,030
The story I'm going to read is from a phone number ending with 8868.

769
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,760
I caught a cold recently and went to the hospital.

770
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,350
I went into the injection room and got a shot,

771
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,950
and the nurse said to me, "Please move,"

772
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,790
so I got confused and shook my butt left and right.

773
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:47,050
But then, she was like...

774
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:50,750
Mr. Manager... all the reporters are outside. What should we do?

775
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,400
Reporters?

776
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,340
    World-star idol Lee Shin from Luna is in a relationship with 10 years older actress Chae Ji Yeon]

777
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,060
Oh, my! What is this?!

778
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,170
I'm sorry.

779
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,040
Yoo Chan, do you have any embarrassing stories like this?

780
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,770
I do have one.

781
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,200
When I was doing a live stage show,

782
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,180
I hit the drum hard, and suddenly the lighting went off on the stage.

783
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:17,030

784
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,770
What about you, Shin?

785
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:22,590
Well, I don't think I have one.

786
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:29,970

787
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,360
What did you just say?

788
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:40,350
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

789
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,100

790
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:46,420
♫  Feel so cold, so cold, it feels so cold, so cold  ♫

791
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:52,530
♫  The reason why everything has stopped  ♫

792
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:56,380
♫  You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you're gone  ♫

793
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,430
  Are you in a relationship with Lee Shin? Is this true?

794
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:02,880
  Shin, you leaving now is helping me.

795
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,370
  I know you're not okay at all.

796
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:09,190
  Both of their phones are off! Where did they go? Did they really run away for love?

797
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,720
  That day wasn't our official schedule. Who knew and took that photo?

798
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,760
  I didn't know Shin was dating someone.

799
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,650
  At a certain point, we didn't talk about our private lives anymore.

800
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:23,710
  I'm saying let's get rid of your divorced-woman title by making your image as a famous idol's girlfriend.

801
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:27,590
  Let's just openly date each other.

802
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,780
  It's crazy! How did they find this place?

803
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,150
  I don't think I can live without you.

804
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,570
  I'm going to put it back to the original state.

805
