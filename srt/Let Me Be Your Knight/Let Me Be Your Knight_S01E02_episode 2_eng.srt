1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,410

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,590

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,700

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,970

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,850

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,400

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,860

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,500

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,510

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,100

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,510

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,800
What am I, a herbervoire?

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,610
Gosh, seriously.

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,790
Do you want this?

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,220
No, you can't. You have to eat healthy food for a while, right?

16
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,420
I haven't said anything!

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,070
Sorry.

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,760
Where's the CEO?

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,800
The CEO went to meet your in-house doctor...

20
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,560
I'm saying...

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,570
Say it clearly. My in-house doctor? I thought we were going to forget about all that.

22
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,440
How could we forget about this?

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,710
You're not well and can't go to the hospital...

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,120
Don't do that and listen to the CEO this time, okay?

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,900
Look at this, Dr. Kang Sun Joo. I heard that she's very famous.

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,560
She's the best for sleepwalking problems.

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,220
Why does she look so familiar?

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,470
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,140
Really?

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,170
Hey, what's wrong Tae In? Are you all right?

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,080
Where's the CEO now?

32
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,430
- An in-house doctor? 
 - Yes.

33
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,920
No, I guess there's some misunderstanding.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,040
Dr. Kang, if you can fix the sleepwalking problem of Tae In

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,940
then we can give you as much money as you want.

36
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,550
- One million or two million won? 
 - No.

37
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,460
We can also give you a blank check.

38
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,200
- Blank check? 
 - Yes!

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,090
Please, I beg you.

40
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,650
No, wait a minute. I think there's some kind of misunderstanding.

41
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,190
I'm not Dr. Kang Sun Ju.

42
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,210
Who are you to decide?

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,710
I'll never get any treatment from someone like you,

44
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,420
so forget everything you heard today.

45
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,340
- Yoon Tae In. 
 - I said I'm fine.

46
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,680
I told you, I'll do it on my own.

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,870
Oh boy!

48
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,300
Oh, Dr. Kang, let me explain.

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,190
- I think it's some misunderstanding here. 
 - What?

50
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,690
- I'll be leaving then. 
 - No.

51
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,770
- No, wait, Dr. Kang. 
 - Goodbye.

52
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,020
Dr. Kang.

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,430
The Chollima guy is actually sick?

54
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,400
Sleepwalking, at that!

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,150
Do you know that woman is a bit strange?

56
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,760
How do you know Doctor Kang?

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,110
You know the photos from a few days ago? That's all because of her.

58
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,690
Then, this? Oh, this is surely fate.

59
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,030
No, it's not fated. It must be ill-fated.

60
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,220
Forget it. Don't talk about in-house doctors anymore.

61
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,850
My condition is nothing serious. I can handle everything on my own.

62
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,940
What can you handle by yourself, punk?

63
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,570
You don't even remember what you did while sleepwalking.

64
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,020
You fell asleep on stage and woke up on the streets.

65
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,050
What after that? Will you get treatment only after a bigger accident?

66
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,180
No need to talk about it more. Before it gets more serious,

67
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,350
get some treatment.

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,890
CEO, I don't have time to care about these trifling treatment,

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,110
and I don't want to think about this, either.

70
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,890
Hey, please.

71
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,100
Please listen to me this one time.

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,630
Can I...

73
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,590
Is your meeting already done, Dr. Kang?

74
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,700
I guess there is some misunderstanding. I'm the younger sister of Dr. Kang.

75
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,260
Oh, very sorry.

76
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,920
You two are very alike.

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,780
Well, can I know Dr. Kang's room number?

78
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,290
Because I'm not able to contact her.

79
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,400
Let me first check if she's in her room.

80
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,510
Well...

81
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,740
Dr. Kang checked out early in the morning saying that she has to leave the country urgently.

82
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,810
Leave the country?

83
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,570

84
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,520

85
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,830
You got to change your bit.

86
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,780
You're not funny. You should change your bit.

87
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,820
Look at you now. Who will think you're a celebrity

88
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,400
when you look like a jobless loafer and lounge around at my store every day?

89
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,940
I've seen how happy you are to see me.

90
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,100
Also, I'm technically a freelancer right now so, yeah, you can say jobless.

91
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,120
That's not something to brag about!

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,790
Want some rice?

93
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,340
Here.

94
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,090
Why are you always here when you have a palace-like house?

95
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,730
I told you. There is no quieter place than this.

96
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,270
And I like the smell here.

97
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,990
It feels like father's smell, too.

98
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,720
Then's not good.

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,510
This is all the smell of mold and dust.

100
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,140
I'm not saying this is how my father actually smells.

101
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,340
I'm just saying it feels that way.

102
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,730
I'll say it's a smell of history.

103
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,720
That's why it feels secure and I feel quite safe here.

104
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,900
It feels like I'm with my dad.

105
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,140
It's a figure of speech.

106
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,320
You don't have the emotional sensitivity to feel it.

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,920
You are so particular!

108
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,530
There is no one in this world who thinks like you.

109
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,340
Just leave the plates outside when you're done.

110
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,140

111
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,980
Could I look around here?

112
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,430
Yes, you can.

113
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,900

114
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,020
 - Daddy.
 - Yes?

115
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,000
 Play with me.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,560
 - Really? 
 - I'm bored.

117
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,640
 But I have to do this...

118
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,020
 Ah, really. All right. So what should we do?

119
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,480
 - Read me a book.. 
 - Book? Okay!

120
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
  Shall we read this book, "Showing off Peacock?"

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,050
 - Yeah. 
 - Okay.

122
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,480
 Here you go. "I hate whispering."

123
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,580
 "I hate whispering the most..."

124
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,150
This is a very nice place, sir.

125
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,510
Yes.

126
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,360
I feel that I'm with my dad.

127
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,810
Your father liked books?

128
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,910
No, not that.

129
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,590
Just...

130
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,670
Because I'm here, I feel that I'm safe.

131
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,240
  Come to the member house right now! It's an emergency.

132
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,000

133
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,290
 No way!

134
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,730
I hate it so much. I'm totally against it!

135
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,170
Why? Why are you totally against it?

136
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,060
You know why we don't even use a housekeeper.

137
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,560
The old one colluded with the crazy fans and stole my stuff!

138
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,310
She even let fans go into our rooms in secret!

139
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,730
If I think of that time, it still makes me freaked out!

140
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,680
- At that time that was...  
 - I'm against it, too.

141
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,340
- You too? Why? 
 - It's uncomfortable.

142
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,290
You said it was a woman.

143
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,930
It's not comfortable at all.

144
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,710
What do you mean woman? She's a doctor.

145
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,790
- Hate that, too. 
 - What?

146
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,960
I want to relax when I'm here.

147
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,710
Guys, it's not about being against it or something,

148
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,480
but for Tae In's health condition.

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,260
What about my condition?

150
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,840
I say that I'm the most normal one here.

151
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,140
- CEO, you always overreact. 
 - My gosh.

152
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,940
Yeah, I guess it's temporary because of the stress.

153
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,260
CEO, you're really overprotective.

154
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,070
He's 25 years old, not 5 years old.

155
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,120
What about you, Woo Yeon? Are you against it, too?

156
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,650
It will be a little uncomfortable.

157
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,640
But thinking about Tae In, it feels like we need her.

158
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,030
So?

159
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,040
So,

160
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,570
half and half?

161
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,880
Are we talking about half fried and half seasoned chicken or something?

162
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,590
Okay. It's half. That means 4.5 of us are against it,

163
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,380
So we're rejecting an in-house doctor.

164
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,260
It is not permissible! Bang, bang, bang!

165
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,710
- Let's go. 
 - You guys, think more carefully.

166
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,410
This shouldn't be taken so lightly, okay?

167
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,180
Yeah, got it.

168
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,920
We are still against the in-house doctor.

169
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,840
Hey, you guys!

170
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,580
Don't worry, CEO.

171
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,220
Nothing's going to happen.

172
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,400
I love you.

173
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,640
I said I love you.

174
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,410
Brother, Tae In. I'm bathing right now.

175
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,150
Tae In, seriously. Gosh, it hurts.

176
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,850
I said it's hurting. Don't do it.

177
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,080
Tae In, it hurts!

178
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,580
Hyung, stop. Hyung!

179
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,770
Please save me. I'm sorry.

180
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,040
What are you doing?

181
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,510
Yoon Tae In, what are you doing? Get lost.

182
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,220
He's mad, I guess.

183
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,080
Hey, hey, stop it!

184
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,400
What's wrong with you?

185
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,360
It hurts.

186
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,950
Stop it! I'll practice it more.

187
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,710
I'll practice more from now on. It hurts.

188
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,750
Wait! It hurts.

189
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,740
Hey, someone save me.

190
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,580
Someone save me.

191
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,730
Somebody save me.

192
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,760
Hey, what are you doing?

193
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,820
Yoon Tae In...

194
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,950
Get him!

195
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,980
Geesh!

196
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,310
Is this really just sleepwalking?

197
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,560
I bet he's doing it intentionally!

198
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,230
Oh, it hurts.

199
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,120
Tae In!

200
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,120
I think my arm is broken!

201
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,040
It hurts...

202
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,290
What are you doing here?

203
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,830
Tae In has sleepwalking, and what do you have? Is it narcolepsy?

204
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,960
How can you fall asleep anywhere?

205
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,270
How can you not be able to guard the door!

206
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,790
I was guarding–

207
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,510
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,960
Anyway, I can't live with Yoon Tae In.

209
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,250
He definitely has some grudge over me.

210
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,780
I'm freaked out about him. I can't sleep.

211
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,140
I was scared, too.

212
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,490
CEO, I think Tae In has a big problem.

213
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,480
Yes, he said he loves me.

214
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,240
CEO, do something about him!

215
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,290
You guys said I was overreacting!

216
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,060
Why didn't you listen to me before?

217
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,910
- What are you going to do now? 
 - That...

218
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,340
That live-in doctor... How about if we bring her in?

219
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,960
You said you don't like that idea!

220
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,920
I like it! I totally agree with that idea!

221
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,740
What about you guys? You're not objecting to it, are you?

222
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,450
- Hey! 
 - Yes, I agree.

223
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,680
Me, too.

224
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,110
Soon Nam, call Doctor Kang right now.

225
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,940
Right now!

226
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,630
Yes, sir.

227
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,020

228
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,320
  Hello?

229
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
Yes, Ba Reun. Did you go to the address I gave you?

230
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,900
  Hey, it's crazy here. It has seizing stickers all over the place.

231
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,740
  I think Nam Jin Sang, this b*stard, ran away with tons of debt!

232
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,360
  You can't hide forever. What should we do now?

233
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,430
I came to his office, but nothing's here, either.

234
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,670
Anyway, thank you.

235
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,780
Ms. In Yoon Joo? You were here!

236
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,630
Me? I'm just a guest.

237
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,030
Owner! What room did I have?

238
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,920
I forgot the number of the room.

239
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,890
Where was it?

240
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,340
Wait, wait...

241
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,620
♫  A-yo  ♫

242
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,490
♫  She's coming in  ♫

243
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,010
♫  Introducing her. Let's go  ♫

244
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,470
♫  What do you want me to do  ♫

245
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,950
♫  I don't know what to do  ♫

246
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,160
Did I fall asleep? 
 ♫  I-I-I don't know  ♫

247
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,690
Hey, Chief Park! Do you think it's time for you to dance?

248
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,630
- Did you give out all of the business cards today? 
 - Yes, sir.

249
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,390
Wake up.

250
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,080
I can tell that you're awake.

251
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,540
Last month, customer In Yoon Joo borrowed 100 million won

252
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,900
from our "50 Million Capital."

253
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,950
What?

254
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,650
That's not true!

255
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,320
The maturity of repayment is in three months.

256
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,580
Interest is 30% per month.

257
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,850
If I calculate it all,

258
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,840
it's about 200 million won.  (~200,000 USD)

259
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,570
You crazy bastards!

260
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,690
You crazy bastards!

261
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,620
Has the boat that will take them arrived?

262
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,280
I'm going to meet up with them this midnight.

263
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,200
A boat? Where are we going?

264
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,810
I really don't know anything about this. I didn't see that money.

265
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,890
It's all done by Mr. Nam by himself!

266
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,250
He said he'd get a house loan for me–

267
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,060
That's none of our business.

268
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,150
This document is the fact.

269
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,590
Isn't this illegal?

270
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,530
How can you process things without checking the personal information–

271
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,530
I hate saying the same thing over and over again.

272
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,790
I'm telling you this one last time. In three months, okay?

273
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,930
If you disappear like Mr. Nam, we'll see what will happen to you.

274
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,160
  We want to have you as a live-in doctor, Doctor Kang Sun Joo!

275
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,510
  A live-in doctor?

276
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,270
  If you can fix our Tae In's sleepwalking,

277
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,390
  I'll pay you as much as you want!

278
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,150
  100 million won? 200 million won?

279
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,880
  No, I can even write you a blank check!

280
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,110
  Did you already finish the meeting, Doctor?

281
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,340
Kang Sun Joo...

282
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,540

283
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,890
  Yes? It's Daniel Moon.

284
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,830
Hello?

285
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,190

286
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,530
  In my case studies with sleepwalkers,

287
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,310
  I found that patients could avoid

288
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,870
  dangerous situations when supervised.

289
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,030
  In addition, with counseling, the cause of the mental illnesses,

290
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,620
  such as stress and trauma, could be found

291
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,210
  and treated precisely.

292
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,650
  Being on 24-hour standby,

293
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,530
  we analyze–

294
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,160
What is she saying?

295
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,160
 Have you gone mad?

296
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,990
Why did it have to be you?

297
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,350
  If you're okay with it, I want you to move in as soon as possible.

298
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,680
  As you said, let's just try it for a month for now!

299
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,010
  Just help us out for a month.

300
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,380
Right, just one month!

301
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,430
Let me try it somehow.

302
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,510
I'm Kang Sun Joo.

303
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,760
I'm psychiatrist Kang Sun Joo from America.

304
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,240
Why does it have to be my room?

305
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,130
It's for your favorite Tae In Hyung!

306
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,090
Just endure it for a month.

307
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,540
It's a good chance for you to build a friendship with Yoo Chan.

308
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,750
Why don't you build that friendship with him?

309
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,410
He can stay in your room! Why are you putting this on to me!

310
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,560
Or Lee Shin! You can take him.

311
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,210
You know your room is twice the size of ours, right?

312
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,010
It's not twice the size.

313
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,520
Do you want to use my room with me, Ga On?

314
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,610
If you do Instagram Live with me in my room together,

315
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,570
fans will love it.

316
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,890
- Instagram Live? 
 - Yes!

317
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,610
Woo Yeon Mom and Baby Ga On!

318
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,810
That's going to be a good picture.

319
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,430
That's a good idea, Ga On.

320
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,300
- Let's go. 
 - Hey, wait!

321
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,100
Eldest and youngest members' chemistry is the best!

322
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,230
Give that to me!

323
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,600
Give it to me! It's fine!

324
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,010
Woo Ga On, let's go! Follow me!

325
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,760
When did I say I'll do Instagram Live with you guys?

326
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Hurry up and come!

327
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,020
Do you have any other things for me to carry?

328
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,680
Should I go and bring it for you?

329
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,360
Yes!

330
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,050
We couldn't get in touch with you, so we thought you had left the country already.

331
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,650
We were going to call your contact in America,

332
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,880
but you called me at that time!

333
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,740
I thought this was an irresistible destiny.

334
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,500
That's what I thought.

335
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,780
But...

336
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,840
as I told you before,

337
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,860
the fact that I'm in Korea and I'm Mr. Yoon Tae In's doctor

338
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,820
is a secret to the public.

339
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,530
Of course!

340
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,900
That's what I want as well.

341
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,910
The members' house is very nice.

342
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,320
Right.

343
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,490
Our Luna is such a worldwide idol,

344
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,460
so we spent a lot of time finding

345
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,390
a suitable house for them.

346
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,120
There's no other place

347
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,940
that has perfect security than this place.

348
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,890
Please think of this place like your house,

349
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,160
and take it easy.

350
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,250
But,

351
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,470
wouldn't they feel uncomfortable if I moved in when only guys were living together?

352
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,220
No, you don't have to worry about that.

353
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,850
They are very kind kids.

354
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,890
Also...

355
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,350
if you're going to take care of Tae In 24/7,

356
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,890
you have to be right next to him!

357
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,680
24/7, right next to him...

358
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,410
Right next to him!

359
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,160
Yes, of course.

360
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,700
By the way,

361
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,430
do the members get along well with each other?

362
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,470
Our boys?

363
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,080
They love each other so much!

364
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,260
The five of them are like real brothers!

365
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,740
Why don't you come inside?

366
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,950
Let's go!

367
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,280
I'll carry that!

368
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,300
Don't worry about it!

369
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Hey!

370
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,130
You can't bring that here because it's fishy. Bring that back to your room.

371
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,160
What's wrong with it? It's my precious Marimo!

372
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,570
I said, you can't bring that to my room!

373
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,600
It's fishy!

374
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,530
Give it back to me! It's my Marimo!

375
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,960
- Let this go! 
 - You let this go!

376
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,730
Give it to me!

377
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,880
- Let this go! 
 - Stop it! My Marimo!

378
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,540
Hey! Let it go!

379
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,840
I said, give it to me!

380
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,360
- Let it go! 
 - Come inside, please!

381
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,210
I said, let it go! What's wrong with you?

382
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,570
Give it to me!

383
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,030
You guys– !

384
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,540
You cute little boys.

385
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,450
Were you playing with water in the house?

386
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,350
You guys are so close with each other!

387
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,950
I told you they are!

388
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,250
Right.

389
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,740
Everyone seems to get along well with each other.

390
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,630
Don't forget this spot.

391
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,640
They are the members of LUNA.

392
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,180
Everybody!

393
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,460
She is the one I told you about before.

394
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,640
She's the Doctor Kang Sun Joo.

395
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,560
I'm Kang Sun Joo.

396
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,000
It was a very cool first impression.

397
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,180
Right, our boys still have

398
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,900
pureness like a child.

399
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,880
But where's Tae In?

400
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,610
He didn't come out of his room today.

401
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,750
It's quiet, so I think he's sleeping.

402
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,470
He's not sleeping! He's not coming out because he doesn't like it!

403
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,160
Is that so?

404
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,700
  If you have a sleep disorder,

405
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,740
  you can face difficulties in your daily life.

406
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,220
  Today, most of the sleep disorders are attributed to mental problems.

407
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,500
  It's coming from minor stress to trauma and PTSD.

408
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,390
  So it is significant to find the main cause and–

409
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,750
Even I can say that.

410
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,710
So, in the end, he hired a live-in doctor.

411
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,610
Let her work hard.

412
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,560
I'm going to do whatever I want to do as well.

413
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,220
Then, why don't you meet Tae In a bit later?

414
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,090
I have a meeting, so I'll get going.

415
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,110
Okay.

416
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,370
You guys have a nice time introducing yourself to her...

417
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,340
and be nice to each other.

418
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,820
Then, I'll get going.

419
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,500
Okay.

420
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,540
What kind of rude behavior is this when we just met her? What will Doctor think about us?

421
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,870
I'm sorry, Doctor.

422
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,160
I apologize.

423
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,500
Why don't you apologize to her now?

424
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,150
I said don't touch my hands.

425
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,870
It's okay! You didn't do it on purpose.

426
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,080
I'm Lee Shin.

427
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,250
Nice to meet you.

428
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,180

429
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,050

430
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,700

431
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,530
  Look at him smiling! He looks sweet and nice.

432
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,710
Yes, nice to meet you, too.

433
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,340
I'm Kim Yoo Chan.

434
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,710
I want to apologize for what happened today,

435
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,150
and I'm looking forward to the time with you.

436
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,270

437
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,190

438
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,130

439
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,670
  He's so polite, not like kids these days!

440
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,460
Yes, I'm looking forward to it, too.

441
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,370
Take good care of our Tae In Hyung.

442
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,050

443
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,820

444
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,250

445
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,980
  I heard he's the youngest. He's cute.

446
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,320
I'm Seo Woo Yeon.

447
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,670
I'm sorry our first impression is a mess.

448
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,400

449
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,760

450
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,870

451
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,480
No, it's okay.

452
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,280
  They are all celebrities but pretty down-to-earth.

453
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,360
Oh, Mr. Yoon Tae In!

454
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,470

455
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,050

456
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,530

457
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,970
It's good to see you again so soon.

458
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,140
I'll look forward to working with you!

459
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,560

460
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,700
Where will my room be?

461
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,340
Don't open this.

462
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah, okay.

463
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,390
Don't open this, either.

464
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,480
That. Don't play that, ever.

465
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,100
Don't go up with your socks on, if you can help it.

466
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,550
Do not ever touch this one, either.

467
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,530
This is my room, right?

468
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,940
This is my room.

469
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,820
Lending to you just for one month, for the sake of Tae In.

470
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,590
I'm leaving then.

471
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,820
I'm already tired.

472
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,980
So, I'm here now.

473
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,140
But what should I do from now on?

474
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,980
How big is this!

475
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,940

476
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,490
Look at this world sometimes from upside down.

477
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,860
You need to change your perspective.

478
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Find the most extreme stimulus and feel it.

479
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,610
Yoon Tae In!

480
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,690
Let's talk a little.

481
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,380
I'm so sorry for that what happened in the playground that time.

482
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,580
Let's forget bad memories from the past and get along well.

483
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,410
Not get along well, but silently.

484
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,520
- What? 
 - Don't stay well, but stay silently and leave.

485
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,460
Just act like you're caring enough for me.

486
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,770
What are you talking about?

487
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,750
I have no desire to get any treatment.

488
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,230
I just let you in so that our CEO could put his worries to rest.

489
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,060
So, just make him believe that you are doing your job well.

490
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,630
Let's not exhaust each other.

491
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,100
Even though, I...

492
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,660
If you can't compromise with this, then I think I'll be able to come up with ten ways to get you out of this house right now.

493
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,530
 He said he will kick me out of the house.

494
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,630
 That's not going to work!

495
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,770
Then, I take it that you agreed to it.

496
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,840
Oh, let me give you a piece of advice.

497
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,090
Yeah.

498
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,790
Including myself, there's nobody who is welcoming you in this house, so just stay like a piece of furniture,

499
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,070
as if you are invisible.

500
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,200
Okay?

501
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,240
He's so rude.

502
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,090
What? A tip? Furniture?

503
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,660
I'm going to do that even if he didn't say it.

504
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,080
I'm already very nervous, but he's so obnoxious!

505
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,450
Well, I'm glad you said I should just pretend to treat you!

506
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,870
What was that? What's this ominous feeling?

507
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,040
Excuse me.

508
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,270
Yeah?

509
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,770
I have to ask you something.

510
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,400
- What is it? 
 - You're good at English, right?

511
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,260
English? I don't...

512
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,700
of course.  I'm very good at it.

513
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,680
I came back from America. I'm a native speaker.

514
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,380
Then, just let me know how this can be pronounced.

515
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,830
 What to do? What to do?

516
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,440
This.

517
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,410
- What are you doing? Are you not going to read it? 
 - Yeah, I'm...

518
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,550
Can you first read it, Ga On?

519
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,700
"That's maybe the best compliment in my life."

520
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,940
Wow! Great! That's perfect!

521
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,920
For speaking good English,

522
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,230
it's about if you can communicate or not.

523
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,160
But your pronunciation right now was...

524
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,430
perfect enough for me who is a native speaker.

525
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,680
I understood everything you said.

526
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,330
Okay?

527
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,230
But, CEO told me that my pronunciation is not good.

528
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,820
Excuse me.

529
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,310
Oh, Yoo Chan.

530
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,460
I'm just curious about where you live in the US.

531
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,770
Oh, yeah. I...

532
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,460
- I lived in Los Angeles. 
 - Wow, seriously? 
 - Yeah.

533
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,600
You lived in Los Angeles? I did a concert there last year.

534
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,040
Then, have you also been to Staples Center?

535
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,340
No. I'm busy, so let me go.

536
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,760
Oh, then are your other family members all in US right now?

537
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,110
 Stop it. Stop it.

538
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,290
That's right.

539
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,200
Doctor, what was the name of the hospital that you worked? I remember it before...

540
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,700
It was May...

541
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,790
- May... 
 - That's right! It's Mayon!

542
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,080
It's Mayon, right? I heard it's really prestigious!

543
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,190
You must have gotten very good grades in school.

544
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,980
But why did you become a psychiatrist? It would've been better to be a dermatologist.

545
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,770
Dermatologists get so much more money.

546
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,980
But, why is Tae In like that?

547
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,770
No, never mind. Do you have siblings?

548
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,300
Do you have a boyfriend? Do you have anyone you're dating these days?

549
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,890
Oh, really? Then it would be lonely.

550
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,270
What the f*ck?

551
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,610
It's already 7 pm. You should eat dinner.

552
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,850
Really?

553
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,820
Is it that late already?

554
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,300
I was chatting, so I forgot the time was passing!

555
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,900
Thanks for the chat, Dr. Kang.

556
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,540
Excuse me, Dr. Kang.

557
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,730
- Yeah? 
 - You should go for dinner, too.

558
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,210
Oh, no. I'm good.

559
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,770
Well, do you like ramyeon?

560
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,510
We have to eat this ramyeon fast without eating.

561
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,610
- Then it will be more delicious. 
 - What?

562
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:19,810
I'm saying we shouldn't talk and just focus on eating the ramyeon.

563
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,570
Oh, okay.

564
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,840
Here you go. Eat it fast.

565
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,070
Thanks for the food.

566
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,600
It's really delicious.

567
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,540
I'm glad.

568
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,180
What are you looking at?

569
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,090
Nothing.

570
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,180
 Feels like I'm with dad.

571
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,890
Dr. Kang, I guess you had some chat with Tae In, right?

572
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,010
How was it?

573
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,990
What to do?

574
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,560
It can't get any worse than this.

575
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,510
 You will be paid 50 million won  (50,000 USD) in advance.

576
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,780

577
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,720
I can take care of the urgent matter first with the advance payment.

578
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,060
After one month I'll be able to able to pay the principle, too.

579
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,980
But what should I do with the interest?

580
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,610
What should I do now?

581
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,750
Okay. Let's protect it like this.

582
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,790
What are you doing here at this time?

583
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,920
Can't you tell? I'm setting up a tent!

584
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,630
That's what I'm saying. Why are you making that in front of my room?

585
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,390
Think of me as a piece of furniture. Don't pay any attention.

586
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,980
I'll be here as furniture protecting you, so you should sleep comfortably.

587
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,060
If you do something weird while sleeping, I'll be here, so don't worry.

588
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,570
Do you usually do your therapy this idiotically? When do you know I'll be sleeping?

589
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,930
How can you stay there like that when you don't know when I'll be sleepwalking?

590
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,530
Whenever it starts, I have to do my work.

591
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,710
Are you worried about me right now?

592
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,570
Why would I be?

593
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:57,760
♫   When I'm looking at you, even if I wasn't feeling good   ♫

594
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,210
♫   I start smiling without knowing it   ♫

595
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:06,940
♫   The day without you feels empty   ♫

596
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:13,100
♫   Everything of you becomes my everything   ♫

597
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,230
♫   A wound in my heart, a feeling of liking someone   ♫

598
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:25,000
♫   It sounds so remote from me   ♫

599
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,340
♫   Whenever I miss you   ♫

600
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,050
♫   I just grumble for no reason   ♫

601
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:35,520
♫   and talked to you like that   ♫

602
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,680
♫   You're my sunshine   ♫

603
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,390
  Doctor, was our Tae In okay last night?

604
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:46,870

605
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:52,410

♫   I'm happiest right now, more than ever   ♫

607
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,430
It hurts! It hurts!

608
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,560
It stings!

609
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
You surprised me.

610
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,290
♫   I think about you while I'm eating as well   ♫

611
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,840
Ack!

612
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,870
What should I do?

613
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,950
♫   Even on the day when we fought    ♫

614
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:17,160
♫   I miss you, and those days   ♫

00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,190
♫   There are more days like that   ♫

616
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,240
  Doctor, was our Tae In okay last night as well?

617
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,850

618
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,180

619
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,400
  Doctor, do you know that

620
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,390
  if a person can't sleep...

621
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,740
Are you a pervert?

622
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,770
What is it? Did he curse at me when I wasn't doing anything?

623
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,570
Who are you?

624
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,790
Are you a new manager?

625
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,380
Who is he?

626
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,800
  It makes you lose your judgment.

627
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,150
Everybody, food is here!

628
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,430
Nice! I'm so hungry!

629
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,560
I'm so hungry!

630
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,740
Cold noodle soup!

631
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,480
Hey, what is going on here?

632
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,680
Don't you know that I like regular tteokbokki?

633
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,440
I like Hamheung cold noodles,

634
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,600
but this is Pyongyang style.

635
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,870
How can you eat a warm pineapple?

636
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,160
Why did you order pizza with pineapple?

637
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,460
What's wrong? You asked me to order cold noodles!

638
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,020
You asked me to order pizza and tteokbokki!

639
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,760
My goodness, Woo Ga On.

640
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,550
Hey, Woo Ga On! Are you insane?

641
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,380
How can you make me eat mint chocolate chip ice cream?

642
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,810
What's the deal?

643
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:11,870
Wait, are you discriminating against 30 million people who love mint chocolate chip?

644
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,700
Just eat anything, guys.

645
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,580
  It makes you speak anything.

646
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,150
So are you guys not going to eat these?

647
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,080
Sure! I'll eat everything.

648
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,400
Hey!

649
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,640
You did this on purpose!

650
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,810
How dare you try to get my food?

651
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,420
Let it go!

652
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,930
I said, let it go!

653
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,620
I got this as a present!

654
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,320
It got spattered because of you!

655
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,890
Why is it because of me? It's because of you!

656
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,140
Do you want to die!

657
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,390
It's all because of you!

658
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,400
Stop it!

659
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,520
You silly young childish b*stards!

660
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,580
Are you children?

661
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,050
Even a kid wouldn't talk at the dining table!

662
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,670
I'm going to flip this table if you keep acting like this!

663
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,880
  In the end,

664
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,280
   you can't distinguish between reality and imagination.

665
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:43,600
  It means there's nothing that can stop you.

666
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:50,050
Since it came to this, let me just cut to the point.

667
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,660
Don't call me, "Excuse me," or "Over there."

668
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,700
I'm not an invisible person.

669
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,130
My name is Kang Sun Joo.

670
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,180
Okay?

671
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,260
From now on, call me "Doctor."

672
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,420
- Got it? Did you understand? 
 - Yes...

673
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,420
Also, Yoon Tae In!

674
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,940
Including him, every one of you.

675
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,050
You all have to trust me completely.

676
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:22,960
If you don't, it won't work. You don't want to live in fear as well.

677
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,920
Then for a month, from now on,

678
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,810
you all have to obey what I say.

679
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,700
Okay?

680
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,850
- Yes! 
 - Then, you're all dismissed.

681
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,230
Dismiss!

682
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,610
What should I do now?

683
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,380
What should I do now, Doctor?

684
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,950

685
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,270
For sleep disorders, the first thing you have to do is relax.

686
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,230
Sleep is caused by three interactions.

687
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,650
It's sleep pressure, time, and situation.

688
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,270
You have to control these three well.

689
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,260
Pardon? Sleep pressure, did you say?

690
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,370
"Pressure?"

691
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,120
It's "pressure."

692
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,350
"Pressure."

693
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:34,470
But why are you asking about that?

694
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,620
It's nothing.

695
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:41,080
I understand all that, but it's still not comfortable.

696
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,640
The mind controls the body.

697
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,000
I think your sleepwalking is caused by stress.

698
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,260
Is there something that might have been trauma to you?

699
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,360
I'm not sure.

700
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,930
Think about if there's something, even a small incident.

701
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,830
Trauma can be created even when you're not aware of it.

702
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:02,030
Trauma...

703
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,960
I think I have to ask about that.

704
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,350
Right.

705
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,430
Wait, to whom?

706
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,180
I'm sorry? Ah.

707
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,000
I meant I'm going to ask myself.

708
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:23,690
I was going to ask myself, "Did you get traumatized without knowing it?"

709
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,760
Right.

710
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,840

711
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,880
  Adult sleepwalking can come out in more threatening forms.

712
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,590
  For example, the person might get violent,

713
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,870
  drive while sleeping, or hurt themselves.

714
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,370
  Like these examples.

715
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,530
  Why does that happen?

716
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,030
  There will be a hundred reasons,

717
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:51,750
  but usually, these symptoms appear when the stress and sleep disorders get combined.

718
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,450
  That's why it's better not to leave the patient alone.

719
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,220
♫  After you leave  ♫

720
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,830
♫   My time seems like   ♫

721
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,170
♫   A day without a sun   ♫

♫   Such a beautiful...   ♫

736
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,220
Woo Yeon Hyung, shall we order fried chicken for dinner?

737
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,790
That sounds good.

738
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,810
Let's ask Doctor Kang to eat with us.

739
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:38,700
Sure.

740
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,790
I don't think she was at our house.

741
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,130
She didn't run away, did she?

742
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,120
But isn't that Doctor a bit strange?

743
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,460
She doesn't feel like a doctor.

744
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,800
Right? You saw her earlier!

745
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,360
"You silly young childish b*stards!"

746
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,040
Right, that was so freakish. I never saw a person like that.

747
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,610
That's because she was up all night guarding Tae In.

748
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,200
How about you, Hyung?

749
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,680
You don't like her, either, do you?

750
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,440
Stop talking nonsense. If you're done tuning, let's play it again.

751
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,620
What are you doing? Are you not going to practice?

752
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,160
I can do this.

753
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,630
Trauma. I have to ask him about the trauma.

754
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,730
Trauma, and...

755
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,160
  Adult sleepwalking can come out in more threatening forms.

756
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,770
  For example, they drive while sleeping.

757
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,250
Is he...?

758
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,910
Excuse me, can you follow that car? Hurry up, please!

759
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,150

760
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,360
Where is this place?

761
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,990
  Did you make this song?

762
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,380
  Wow, it's an amazing song!

763
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,530
  Oh, Yoon Tae In!

764
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,540
♫  To you  ♫

765
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:07,530
Mr. Yoon Tae In!

766
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,430
Mr. Yoon Tae In...

767
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,150
Mr. Yoon Tae In!

768
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,680
Are you okay?

769
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,170
Are you coming back to consciousness?

770
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,390
What the heck are you doing right now?

771
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,380
I was worried about your sleepwalking.

772
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,910
Are you even stalking me now?

773
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,970
Why were you standing at the edge of the roof? It's dangerous!

774
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,720
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

775
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,570
I told you to mind your own business.

776
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,940
I said you should just stay quiet until you leave.

777
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,440
Don't talk to me, and don't even show in front of me!

778
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,280
Your existence is stressful to me.

779
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,340
I can't listen to this anymore...

780
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:06,520
Excuse me. Everybody's saying "yes" to you and looking up to you, so you think you're the only one in this world, don't you?

781
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,490
Do your fans like you even knowing that you're like this?

782
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,770
- What? 
 - Right now, you don't need therapy for sleepwalking,

783
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,890
but you need to fix your personality first!

784
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,450
I can't do this!

785
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,030
  In Yoon Joo, are you doing okay?

786
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:44,800
  Where are you?

787
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,010
  Why are you not telling me?

788
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,130
  Are you in some weird place in secret to me?

789
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:52,910
  You're not in a shrimp boat for cash, are you?

790
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,250
  Don't worry about me. I'll be back with a lot of money.

791
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:13,320
No matter what you do to me, I have to stay here.

792
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,240
Yoon Tae In...

793
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,690

794
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:37,780
I can tell white is paper, black is writing.

795
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,510
It's already this hour.

796
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,820
What was that?

797
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,170
You surprised me!

798
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,000
Where are you going–

799
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,220
Is he sleepwalking?

800
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,020
  In the state of sleepwalking, the first thing you have to do

801
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,740
   is prevent them from going outside or getting into dangerous situations.

802
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,830
  But, if you try to suppress them by force

803
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:52,520
  or touch them unexpectedly, they might get violent,

804
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,230
  so please be careful.

805
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,390
It's driving me crazy!

806
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:48,210
Mr. Yoon Tae In, wake up.

807
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:51,180
Mr. Yoon Tae In?

808
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:58,940

809
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,140

♫   I can see your heart   ♫

816
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:38,120
♫   It's precious   ♫

817
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,570
♫   Even this wait   ♫

818
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,630
  That was an accident.

819
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,620
  He wouldn't remember that, would he?

820
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,890
  I don't, but it's bothering me!

821
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:52,770
  Start from the kiss!

822
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,640
  Should I dig in about Yoon Tae In?

823
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,230
  I think we both have something to protect.

824
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,150
  I don't have anything.

825
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,990
  I saw it.

826
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,330
  It's crazy!

827
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,970
  You don't know what will happen between man and woman.

828
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,440
  Mr. Yoon Tae In, it's not going to resolve by avoiding it!

829
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,380
  You have to take responsibility.

830
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:14,570
  Responsibility? Just because of what happened, I have to take responsibility for you?

831
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,920
♫   All the time that's coming   ♫

832
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,030
♫  The reason why everything has stopped  ♫

833
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:27,180
♫  You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you're gone  ♫

834
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,650
♫  lt was a beautiful break up,  All broken   ♫
