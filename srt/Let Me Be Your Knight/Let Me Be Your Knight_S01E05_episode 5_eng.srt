00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,210
Oh, oh. There's a signal here.

17
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,230
The phone number of Moon CEO is...

18
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,500
- Hello? 
 -  In Yoon Joo! You are finally answering the call.

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,880
 I haven't been able to get in touch with you since last night,

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,390
 so I kept getting the answering machine.

21
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,240
 You know that your interest due date is soon, right?

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,010
 - You should answer the call quickly.  
 -This Dr. Kang Seonju's phone.

23
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,130
You have called the wrong number.

24
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,120
What's this?

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,550

26
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,990

27
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,390
Yoon Tae In.

28
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,970
Oh no, what to do!

29
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,190
Yoon Tae In,

30
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,120
are you up already?

31
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,220
You scared me. I thought that you were gone again.

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,200
In Yoon Joo?

33
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,290
Yeah.

34
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,390
What?

35
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,550
Who is In Yoon Joo?

36
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,110
No. Why are you

37
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,670
looking at my phone?

38
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,810
A call kept coming in.

39
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,600
That's what I mean!

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,700
I always get her calls.

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,940
She must be the previous owner who used this number.

42
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,560
I've told them I'm not her, but they keep calling and texting.

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,330
- But did you answer the call?  
  - Yes.

44
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,800
He asked you to pay interest or something.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,960
Interest, my foot!

46
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,920
Why didn't she

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,480
pay the interest in time

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,870
to give many people a hard time?

49
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,410
I'm talking about that person, In Yoon Joo.

50
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,090
 What to do?

51
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,720
 Did he find out?

52
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,270
 Why is he looking like that?

53
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,760
There's something strange.

54
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,440
 Strange?

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,590
What is strange?

56
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,830
I heard you are the attending doctor for famous musicians overseas.

57
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,540
How did you treat them?

58
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,120
That...

59
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,270
Oh!

60
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,880
Hello, Mr. Woo Yeon!

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,760
Dr. Kang?

62
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,220
Where are you now? Are you okay?

63
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,250
Are you together with Tae In?

64
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,530
Yes, yes. We both are safe.

65
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,980

66
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,620
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,620
I should have protected him well.

68
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,880
Dr. Kang, Tae In is

69
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,000
someone who will yield hundreds of photos

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,070
even when he just goes to the convenience store.

71
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,250
When he has a meal with his female cousin,

72
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,020
there's a rumor of him getting married the next day.

73
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,060
Yes, I am fully aware of it.

74
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,920
How can you do that if you know it?

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,680
We came through safe although.

76
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,710
Isn't that enough?

77
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,150
You brat! You haven't done something good!

78
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,320
I'm sorry. From now on,

79
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,770
something like this will never... 
 - Why are you sorry for?

80
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,410
It was me who couldn't stay awake even for just a few minutes when Dr. Kang went to the restroom.

81
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,660
At any rate, Dr. Kang found me,

82
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,860
so I came back safe and sound.

83
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,880
Isn't that enough?

84
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,160
Why don't you leave now?

85
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,670
I want to work now.

86
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,210
What? Work? Oh?

87
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,040
Really?

88
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,460
Even at a moment like this, all he thinks about is working. Tae in is seriously...

89
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,190
Well, let's get our stuff and leave.

90
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,030

91
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,730

92
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,940
Aren't you hungry? Let's split a ramyun later. Deal?

93
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,240
Don't do that.

94
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,590
You are mean!

95
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,470
Excuse me...

96
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,950
Yoo Yeon Hyung didn't get any sleep last night.

97
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,680
- Pardon? 
 - He was the most worried.

98
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,650
It was hard stopping him from going out

99
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,530
to look for you.

100
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,310
I'm really sorry.

101
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,040
There's no need to feel sorry to me.

102
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,170
I gave you 50 Million Won  ($50k) . Why do you keep calling me?

103
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,130
 Did you enjoy your date?

104
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,590
- Why are you keep calling me when I'm not even late in payment? 
 -  I already told you.

105
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,600
 That there aren't many days left to pay the interest.

106
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,950
So, what did you talk about with that man earlier?

107
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,610
 What else would I talk about, other than money?

108
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,980
 It seemed like your boyfriend has a temper.

109
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,000
 But a man should be mellow...

110
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,320
Maybe I'm not caught.

111
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,500
 In Yoon Joo.

112
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,600
 No...

113
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,260
 something is off.

114
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,450

115
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,800

116
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,670
Music. Muse?

117
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,150

118
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,230
 Schumann and Brahms both had someone special in their lives.

119
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,870
 For Schumann, it was his wife who inspired him to write music .

120
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,110
 His muse, Clara.

121
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,380
 In the first year of their marriage,

122
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,380
 he composed more than 130 songs.

123
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,730
You can't fall asleep if you don't finish your song.

124
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,000

125
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,160

126
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,540
 A woman who shares the same artistic vision with me.

127
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,410
 A woman I can grow with as an artist.

128
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,330
 Yoko was that woman for me.

129
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,480
Gosh, no way!

130
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,250
Is that woman my muse?

131
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,580

132
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,800
I need to check for myself.

133
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,410
But what do I say?

134
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,270
No, there's no way he figured it out. I just need to act naturally.

135
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,420
What brings you here, Yoon Tae In?

136
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,710
 That's right. I need to stay by her to see if she really inspires me.

137
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,750
When does today's session start?

138
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,660
Sorry?

139
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,720
Session?

140
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,380
You came here to treat me, Dr. Kang.

141
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,630
But you said you didn't want my help

142
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,270
and we should just pretend.

143
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,910
I changed my mind.

144
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,780
Don't tell me

145
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,210
you want to be paid for not doing anything.

146
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,050
 I knew it. He's suspicious. Why does he want a treatment session all of a sudden?

147
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,670
Oh, and there's one thing I am curious about.

148
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,420
Sleepwalking is the condition that results from the central nervous system's active non-REM sleep and REM sleep states

149
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,350
disturbing each other, right?

150
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,640
 And now he's even testing me?

151
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,090
Yes, that's right.

152
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,480
That means that even while I am asleep, my brain is constantly awake but

153
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,920
does this mean that these abnormalities within the brain can also cause things like hallucinations or optical illusions?

154
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,730
 Damn it! What on earth is he saying?

155
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,700
Woah,

156
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,640
this is nice. I am glad to see that you're so driven.

157
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,270
That's the beginning of all treatment.

158
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,210
It's a very positive sign.

159
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,070
But, as you can see, I have something to do today,

160
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,200
so I will answer you when I come back.

161
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,500
What do you need to do?

162
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,020
As a doctor, I need to do more research.

163
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,240
Since you're  not showing any improvement with your symptoms,

164
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,150
I need to work out if I should continue with this treatment plan or not.

165
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,950
I'll be back soon.

166
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,320
What do I do?

167
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,950
Hello, Mr. CEO.

168
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,490
 Oh, hello, Doctor.

169
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,620
Considering what happened yesterday at the Green Concert,

170
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,970
I don't think Tae In is showing any improvement.

171
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,430
I just called to ask if the treatment is going well.

172
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,670
Why?

173
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,670
Did Yoon Tae In mention something to you?

174
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,390
What? No, he didn't say anything.

175
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,860
It will be a month soon,

176
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,990
so I was a bit concerned.

177
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,200
That's right. I am doing my best...

178
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,990
It's not about doing your best, but please show some results.

179
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,960
Yes, understood.

180
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,950
Really?

181
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,640

182
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,160
Which floor?

183
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,400
No, should I not press any button?

184
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,240

185
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,220
Why aren't you answering your phone?

186
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,500
I waited for a long time that day, too.

187
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,600
Shin,

188
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,980
we should take a break to think about this.

189
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,960
♫  If I had known when I got lost  ♫

190
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,600
♫  If I had known when you passed by  ♫

191
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,330
Shin.

192
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:22,170
♫  Even when tomorrow comes today  ♫

193
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,330
♫  I will find you, no matter where  ♫

194
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:35,430
♫  Oh, I'm dreamin'  ♫

195
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,860
♫  Oh, I'm dreamin'  ♫

196
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,300
Are you doing this because of that mere tabloid?

197
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,050
Shin,

198
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,830
I am...

199
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,560
Oh, Oppa!

200
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,500
Oppa, what are you doing here? Did you eat?

201
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,800
If you didn't, should we go to my room and order room service?

202
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,720
You and I got a commercial offer together this time.

203
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,950
Should we rehearse together in advance?

204
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,690
You should do this to your boyfriend.

205
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,790
Why? I'm just practicing my pose.

206
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,420
Oh, Shin is here, too.

207
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,230
Aren't you hungry?

208
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,580
Let's go eat something.

209
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:32,970
♫  Even your name and memories grow faint  ♫

210
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,030
♫  If everything stops right now  ♫

211
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,450
 When you said to take some time to think yesterday,

212
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,870
 you meant that we should divert the reports temporarily, right?

213
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,560
 You didn't mean anything else, right?

214
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,250
Gosh, do I sound too childish?

215
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,020
So,

216
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,040
a sleepwalking condition means your brain is awake.

217
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,140
So REM sleep... No,

218
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,330
non-REM sleep state is disturbing

219
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,920
the central nervous system. So can you hear something...

220
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,030
and can optical illusions occur?

221
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,360
So, you are saying that you are still experiencing somnambulism, right?

222
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,770
Yes.

223
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,360
What kind of work do you do?

224
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,910
I compose music.

225
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,000
So you are creative.

226
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,870
Is your working coming along well?

227
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,040
Well...

228
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,220
Then, what are your hobbies or things you enjoy, other than music?

229
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,280
 That's my job and my everything. What would I need anything else?

230
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,070
 But still, you can get stressed out.

231
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,220
 Wouldn't it be good to have at least one other hobby at times like that?

232
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,940
No, I don't need it.

233
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,810
No.

234
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,530
I think that's all he is.

235
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,910
Pardon?

236
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,130
I am saying that that's my everything.

237
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,080
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

238
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,920
You ordered Americano today.

239
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,300
- Please come this way. 
 - Sure.

240
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,420
Ms. In Yoon Joo? You can pay the bill here.

241
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,000
- Wow, that's great. Have an awesome day! 
- Thank you.

242
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,730
In Yoon Joo?

243
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,360

244
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,880
 At times like this, you should not just stay home during the daytime.

245
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,950
 You should go for a walk and enjoy plenty of sunshine.

246
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,850
 Composers work in a dark room without any windows.

247
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,390
He has to listen to me

248
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,150
so he can go for a walk and enjoy some sunshine.

249
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,350
What's wrong with her?

250
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,210
Is she... homeless here?

251
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,930
 Having hobbies and exercise also helps with stress relief, so make sure to do those, too.

252
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,620
 I've tried those.

253
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,490
 Other than those, are there any methods that might be from a doctor?

254
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,450
 Something a bit more professional?

255
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,560
 The most basic things are the most important things.

256
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,570
You are doing well.

257
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,580
I'm only doing the basic things, so that's why he is getting suspicious.

258
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,730
What? What is she doing? You'd better not jump in!

259
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,890
Oh, geez! I am doing all sorts of things because of you!

260
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,070
Oh, man! What was that?

261
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,510
Where is she going?

262
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,690
Geez!

263
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,220
Where is the hell she is going?

264
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,220
What is she doing in this neighborhood?

265
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,360
Hey, In Yoon Joo! What are you doing? You!

266
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,820
Are you working here as a housemaid by any chance?

267
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,710
What? LUNA?

268
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,070
The LUNA which I know?

269
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,650
Yes.

270
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,770
I'm scared jealous.

271
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,970
What?

272
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,130
Yeah. Okay.

273
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:26,290
So, they are misunderstanding you as your older sister, right?

274
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,540
Yeah, I'm totally mad, right?

275
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,180
Yes, you're totally mad! This is so bold.

276
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,340
And now I'm being doubted.

277
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,640
I should tell the truth and come out of that house, right?

278
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,710
What if you come out? What are you going to do with the debt?

279
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,440
You almost died because of that money.

280
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,890
Gosh, just...

281
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,420
Isn't it okay as long as you don't get caught?

282
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,850
It is what it is now. Let's just make this a perfect crime.

283
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,410
- What? 
 - You said the term is almost over anyway.

284
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,870
You only have to prevent Yoon Tae In from sleepwalking.

285
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,880
But that somnambulism, how do you fix that?

286
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,400
I don't know.

287
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,450
They say stress is the biggest problem.

288
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,840
That's it!

289
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,470
What about that one time.

290
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,440
You are the one who made the elderly forget all about their worries and laugh and dance instead.

291
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,960
You're the In Yoon Joo who even cured the curved spine of a 90-year-old grandmother.

292
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,930
But still... Is that the same as this?

293
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,320
What's so different?

294
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,360
What's so special about a doctor? A doctor is someone who cures a sick person.

295
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,220
It's not like you're holding a scalpel to perform heart surgery.

296
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,010
As long as you can take care of Yoon Tae In's stress, you said somnambulism will be cured.

297
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,260
That is

298
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,180
something you'd be much better at it than your ice-cold sister.

299
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,670
In that big house,

300
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,730
from LUNA,

301
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,410
you are being called a doctor by them!

302
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,550
Hey, you are like the heroine from a web novel.

303
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,090
I'm more like a spy who will be killed once caught.

304
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,050
I feel like I'm shooting a spy movie, not a romantic drama.

305
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,210
If you are the web drama female lead,

306
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,820
you should end up with someone in the end.

307
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,040
Hey. Who do you like the most there?

308
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,750
Personally,

309
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,640
I like Wu Ga On the most!

310
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,060
I'm being so silly!

311
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,500
How is he?

312
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,650
Is he nice?

313
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,610
He is kind.

314
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,520
No wonder! I thought he would be. His eyes are so clear.

315
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,590
♫  In delusion   ♫

316
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,150
♫   Every time  ♫

317
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:47,050
♫   I can never stop, love paranoia  ♫

318
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,530
Stop it!

319
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,320
What the hell?

320
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,250
Why are you all like this?

321
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,690
Can't you guys concentrate?

322
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,920
We're really sorry.

323
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,050
Hyung,

324
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,210
my fingers are not well.

325
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,930
Really? Let me see.

326
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,650
That's because you don't practice enough, so your fingers are stiff.

327
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,960
Hey!

328
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,730
You know that Ga On works the hardest among us.

329
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,640
Why are you doing this?

330
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,860
Go again.

331
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,740
It's good to work hard, but let's do it with good vibes.

332
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,110
It seems like everyone feels that group practice is obligatory these days.

333
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,270
But they should feel obligated, don't you think?

334
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,160
I heard the other group also practices 3 hours a day.

335
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,020
And they do it with the same intensity as if they are on stage each time.

336
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,800
Okay.

337
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,490
But what are you doing here?

338
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,050
Just getting some fresh air.

339
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,540
Are you waiting for Dr. Kang by any chance?

340
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,660
Why would I wait for that woman?

341
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,960
Be good with Doc

342
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,320
and cooperate in your treatment.

343
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,240
You're nagging a lot today.

344
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,960
I want to do more, but

345
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,620
I'm only doing this much because you're not well.

346
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,060
I can't get better because I'm so afraid now.

347
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,780
- Why are you coming now? 
 - Gosh, you scared me.

348
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,350
I told you that I'd be late.

349
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,410
Wait.

350
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,350
You said you'll come back after doing some research.

351
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,660
Yes!

352
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,410
W-Why?

353
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,750
But you didn't, right?

354
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,080
On what grounds are you saying this?

355
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,530
You smell like alcohol.

356
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,940
 You have to be more shameless at times like this.

357
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,050
 Put on a steel mask on your face and finish it off!

358
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,710
Yes.

359
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,200
I had a drink.

360
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,350
Is there a law that doctors can't drink or something?

361
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,390
Move over!

362
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,360
When and where are we doing the treatment today?

363
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,500
It's late.

364
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,080
Let's start from sleeping early.

365
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,690
Then what and where are we going to do tomorrow?

366
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,930
Hey, wait!

367
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,640
The alcohol smell.

368
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,840
After that...

369
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,310
Why is he so proactive today?

370
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,400
What's this?

371
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,180
What is it?

372
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,330
Were you trying to open this?

373
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,700
We're only one wall away.

374
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,280
Let's just leave the door open.

375
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,670
 So he now wants to monitor me.

376
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,800
Is that okay?

377
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,340
Yes.

378
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,240
♫  When I'm watching you  ♫

379
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,830
♫  Even if I feel bad, A smile  ♫

380
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,120
♫  Spreads across my face  ♫

381
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,380
Lower the book a little.

382
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,980
♫  A day without you feels empty  ♫

383
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:37,090
♫  Your entire being is becoming my everything  ♫

384
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:42,650
♫  You are my sunshine ribbon in the sky  ♫

385
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:48,260
♫  Your delightful smile is above the clouds in the sky  ♫

386
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:54,020
♫  I meet you every day of my life  ♫

387
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,750
♫  More than any moment  ♫

388
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,680
♫  Than any other moment  ♫

389
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,050
Why is he sleeping so uncomfortably?

390
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,980
♫  I think of you even as I walk  ♫

391
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,820
♫  I think of you even while I eat  ♫

392
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,410
♫  While I listen to music and even in the early morning  ♫

393
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,460
Excuse me...

394
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,600
♫  The days that I miss you  ♫

395
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,440
♫   Are getting more and more  ♫

396
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,110
♫  Like the first moment I saw you  ♫

397
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:30,610
♫  You are my sunshine ribbon in the sky  ♫

398
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:36,300
♫  Your bright smile is above the clouds  ♫

399
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,070
♫  After I met you  ♫

400
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,930
He looks the best when sleeping.

401
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,870
♫  More than any moment  ♫

402
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:51,150
♫  I am the happiest now. With you  ♫

403
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,180
You're up early.

404
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,010
Do you want some breakfast?

405
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,660
It smells nice. Wow!

406
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,770
It's soybean paste stew!

407
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,500
I bet breakfast wasn't comfortable for you since you're from LA.

408
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,190
Please, have some.

409
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:39,400
Do you have any foods that you want to eat or restaurants that you want to go to?

410
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,560
I don't know...

411
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,680
We went to LA for concerts a lot.

412
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,020
The restaurant called "Sideway" is a very famous place.

413
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,740
Oh, that's right.

414
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,830
Their American breakfast is amazing.

415
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,020
I thought that was a Vietnamese restaurant.

416
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,520
That's what I'm saying.

417
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,360
The Vietnamese chef at that place was very kind.

418
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,320
I think the chef was Korean.

419
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,830
Oh, that's right. The chef was a Korean man.

420
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,660
The chef was a woman.

421
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,740
I barely slept today.

422
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,950
I really miss local food from America today.

423
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,100
Then shall we go eat tonight?

424
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,800
Yes.

425
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,100
Ah, it's good.

426
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,810
There is no problem with your bones.

427
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,910
Also, it's not tendinitis or the morning stiffness that we were worried about,

428
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,080
so don't worry too much.

429
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,480
Is there no issue?

430
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,940
But my fingers

431
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,140
are in pain and not moving well.

432
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,850
Did you get severe stress recently?

433
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:03,180
Can that make fingers not move as well?

434
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,420
It doesn't seem to be a neurosurgery problem.

435
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,400
So why don't you take psychotherapy?

436
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,420
And also,

437
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,200
if it's okay with you, could I get an autograph, please?

438
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,320
I keep running away subconsciously.

439
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,010
My goodness...

440
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,610
But why is he so quiet today?

441
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,890
What if he talks about therapy again,

442
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,660
then what should I do?

443
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,420
  How's my Ga On in the member house? What does he do normally?

444
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,680
  What does he do? He's always practicing.

445
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,850
Are your hands okay?

446
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:09,310
I'm sorry. I heard the piano sound.

447
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,170
But are you okay now?

448
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,530
I wonder if you have to go to the hospital.

449
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,630
It's nothing.

450
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,000
Please don't tell the other members what you just saw.

451
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,820
Okay.

452
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,080
By the way, Doctor.

453
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,990
Yes?

454
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,850
You're a psychiatrist, right?

455
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,000
You moved your Marimo moss ball to here.

456
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,390
I was going to take good care of it,

457
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,770
but I was always staying in front of Tae In's room, so I couldn't do it that well.

458
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,290
Right.

459
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,510
Those Marimo balls are cute the more I look at them.

460
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,910
How did you start raising them?

461
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,920
Because they are strong.

462
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,670
Those small things are strong?

463
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,160
Yes.

464
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,920
I heard that they will survive even if you put them in a fridge for a few months.

465
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,990
Even if you don't feed them for 100 years,

466
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:37,980
they'll live fine in the ocean or lake, or wherever.

467
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,750
I guess you like something strong.

468
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,860
You said that when you were doing Judo.

469
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,740
You started Judo because it's the strong overcoming the strong.

470
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:01,950
If you know about me, you'll get disappointed.

471
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,720
It's the same for me.

472
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,380
You know about it since you're a Doctor.

473
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,680
About what?

474
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,780
There's a saying that if you can't avoid it, enjoy it.

475
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:25,450
But what do you have to do when you can't enjoy it?

476
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,180
I heard that people use that phrase backwardly these days.

477
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,900
If you can't enjoy it, avoid it.

478
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,340
Sometimes, avoiding is the way to go.

479
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,700
There's also a saying, one step backward for two steps forward.

480
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,300
Is that so.

481
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,700
Thank you.

482
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,750
Excuse me?

483
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,480
Did something happen to him?

484
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:07,100
  What kind of therapy are you going to do today from what time?

485
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,860
It's late.

486
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,430
Why did she read it and not reply right away?

487
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,100
Yes, come in.

488
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,280
Hyung, do you have an extra phone charger?

489
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,880
I don't have one. Get out.

490
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,080
- Get out, right now. 
 - Okay.

491
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,190
This won't do.

492
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,840
I have to be with her today no matter what!

493
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,080
What should we do?

494
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,890
We did that already. Should I try this one?

495
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,840
  Doctor Kang!

496
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,910
Y- You're going to break the door!

497
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,900
I sent you a message. Why aren't you replying back?

498
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,310
I was thinking about it!

499
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,350
Here!

500
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,880
Why don't you

501
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,340
choose on your own today?

502
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,100
Excuse me.

503
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,670
Let's do that one. Number 20.

504
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,210
The new place?

505
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,450
Is there a place where you haven't been to?

506
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,340
Why don't we go for now?

507
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,930
A new place? Where do we have to go now?

508
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,840
What are you doing now?

509
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,700
Aren't we going anywhere?

510
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,150
You said you wanted to go to a new place.

511
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,940
Isn't there anywhere you haven't gone?

512
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,580
Perhaps we can go to a place you wanted to visit instead?

513
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,290
Outer Space.

514
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,600
Excuse me?

515
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,950
Or the Bermuda Triangle!

516
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,050
Stop joking around!

517
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,630
And the desert.

518
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,110
Sure, we can go to the desert. Shall we go now?

519
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,340
I'll take you there.

520
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,830
TA DA!

521
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,160
What? This is... like the desert, right?

522
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,120
Exactly how does this look like the desert?

523
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,700
Well...

524
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,380
It differs depending on how you see it.

525
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,770
Although it's not a dry and desolate desert,

526
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,040
it's a different kind of desert.

527
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,090
A sparkling, moisture-laden desert.

528
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,390
Well.

529
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,050
That's pretty good.

530
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,180
Right?

531
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,460
And as luck would have it, you got me as your tour guide.

532
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,810
This way, please!

533
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,890
See that island?

534
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,270
Since it's shaped like a silkworm,

535
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,150
it was coined, "Silkworm Island."

536
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,030
The water subsides twice a day and opens up the path.

537
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,840
Then, it isn't an island.

538
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,380
If the path opens up,

539
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,070
then you can't very well call it an island... technically.

540
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,840
Is that what's important?

541
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,900
You're the one who stated it's my point of view, right?

542
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,320
When you lived in the USA, how did you even know about this place?

543
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,320
Ah...

544
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,790
I came here once when I was just a kid.

545
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,140
How old were you when you moved to America?

546
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,570
I was eleven.

547
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,430
Did you immigrate with your entire family?

548
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,110
No,

549
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,980
I was adopted.

550
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,880
So, that must mean

551
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,280
you have no family in Korea.

552
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,120
My younger sister lives here.

553
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,880
But we are very different from each other.

554
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,890
What makes you different?

555
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,740
She's living a pathetic life.

556
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,650
 - Make sure the entire house is in the photo. 
 - Ok.

557
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,910
 She was scammed by someone she trusted.

558
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,910
 Sister?

559
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,490
 Why haven't you moved on yet?

560
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,770
 She still fantasizes that I'm a part of her family.

561
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,780
 I don't know why she chooses to live like that.

562
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,360
You are meaner than I thought.

563
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,200
You guys lived apart for a long time.

564
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:11,120
You haven't seen how your sister lived, but say how pathetic she is.

565
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,630
Why do you talk so carelessly?

566
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,800
That's true.

567
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,500
Now that I think about it,

568
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,060
I haven't seen how she lived, either.

569
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm sure she had her reasons.

570
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,190
Wait for me.

571
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,120
Gosh, how beautiful.

572
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,100
It's nice to be out like this.

573
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,980
The sun rises and sets every day.

574
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,080
Why does the sun always seem more interesting at the beach?

575
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,600
We see it every day, but treat it like it only exists at the beach.

576
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,620
Because when we're in the city, we don't have time to look up.

577
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,270
There's just day and night.

578
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,820
The fact that we view things differently depending on the location...

579
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,510
It's truly fascinating.

580
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,250
Yes, Woo Yeon.

581
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,360
Oh, right, the dinner.

582
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,500
But I'm out with Mr. Tae In–

583
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,960
What are you doing now?

584
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,030
Focus on the patient you're with.

585
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,590
Isn't all this a part of the treatment?

586
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,810
Come on!

587
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,790
Look the other way, for Pete's sake!

588
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,780
Geez, I'm sorry.

589
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,950
Don't do it.

590
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,710
- Aren't you cold? 
 - I'm not cold.

591
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:15,750
I'm feeling chilly.

592
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,480
What would you like on the menu?

593
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,400
Just the way we've discussed before?

594
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,250
Hyung.

595
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,500
I'm sorry but I think I have to bail today.

596
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,830
I'll come back some other day.

597
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,000
♫  Don't be out so late. Stay away from alcohol

598
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,720
♫  Why don't you listen like a 10 year old child?

599
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,090
♫  I can only laugh

600
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,420
♫  Who is calling whom a child?

601
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,960
♫  I can only laugh

602
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,610
♫  You don't understand why I'm nagging

603
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:13,690
♫  You don't know that I only want to have a good conversation. Should we stop?

604
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,910
♫  I'm saying everything for your own sake

605
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:24,430
♫  To you who don't want to listen to me, it may sound like nagging–

606
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,080
Hey!

607
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,850
What's up with you?

608
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,930
Can we just not perform at Inkigayo?

609
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,140
Special MC! Special stage!

610
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,700
It's a chance you and I can shine, so what's wrong?

611
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,610
Don't tell me you're nervous because it's just the two of us.

612
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:41,740
Hey, Woo Ga!

613
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:46,760
I am there. Don't worry and just do what you always do.

614
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,570
All right?

615
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,510
Let's try again from the hook.

616
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,500
Super Rookie!

617
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,270
Super Rookie. Hot debut!

618
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,650
Today, we will have Bluemoon that appeared like a fantasy.

619
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,560
What?

620
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,470
Blue Moon?

621
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,510
They revised the cue sheet earlier.

622
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,390
You didn't hear?

623
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,250
A rookie group wants to say hello.

624
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,210
Oh, sure. Come on in!

625
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,590
- Hello. 
- Hello, sir!

626
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,390
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

627
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,280
Two, three.

628
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,200
Hello. We are Blue Moon! We'll do our best!

629
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,580
Yes, hello.

630
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:28,520
We met last time, right?

631
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,820
Yes, sir. We respect you guys so much.

632
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,400
We're so honored we can stand on the same stage as you.

633
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,740
Gosh.

634
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,900
This is our album. Please listen to it when you have time.

635
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,810
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

636
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,700
Thank you.

637
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,280
Thank you, sirs.

638
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,360
Thank you!

639
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,540
All right, bye. Break a leg today.

640
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,150
- Yes, sir. Thank you!
- Thank you!

641
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:55,440
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

642
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,760
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

643
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,170
Aigoo, those cuties.

644
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,590
Thank you.

645
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,520
Are you okay?

646
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,780
Yes, I'm okay.

647
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,000
My throat was hurting a little so I thought of making some tea.

648
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,660
You're not okay.

649
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,740
- Pardon?
- I said you're not okay.

650
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:04,120
 Super Rookie! Hot Debut! We will be with Bluemoon that appeared like a fantasy.

651
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,340
 Hello.  We're Bluemoon! We will do our best!

652
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,920
They are overflowing with passion.

653
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,020
- Please tell us about Bluemoon's title song.
 - Yes.

654
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,010
The name of our title song is "Moonwalker."

655
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:21,360
It's packed with a strong, addictive drop in the chorus and many impressive themes.

656
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,470
The song is a powerful house dance song.

657
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,880
Could you show us one key dance move then?

658
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,860
Our key dance is the famous moonwalk dance.

659
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,070
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

660
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,190
5, 6, 7, 8.

661
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,560
The dance has a present for our fans too.

662
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,330
This, this, and this.

663
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,450
We have moves that gradually grow into a bigger heart.

664
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:51,450
Will you do it with me?

665
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,580
Like this, and this

666
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,440
and this.

667
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,810
We're excited to see what more you have in store for us.

668
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,960
Let's go check out Bluemoon's performance!

669
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,930
Music, start!

670
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,940

671
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,690
Hey, what's your problem? Get it together!

672
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,620
Hyung, I won't be able to do the special performance today.

673
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,510
Cancel it, please.

674
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,090
What is wrong with you, Ga On?

675
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,140
I really don't feel well.

676
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,110
Hey, are you sweating?

677
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,330
- Hey, Ga... Ga... 
 - You okay?

678
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,350
- Hey, Ga On!
- Ga On!

679
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,540
Will you be okay without going to the hospital?

680
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,180
I'm fine. You already gave me medicine.

681
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,440
For today, don't think about anything and get some good rest.

682
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,350
I'll tell Tae In about it, too,

683
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,740
so don't worry too much.

684
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,950
Thank you, Woo Yeon.

685
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,150
Why were you in there?

686
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,520
She's very sick.

687
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,500
Where? How is she sick?

688
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,410
Not being sick would be strange.

689
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,570
Has she been able to truly rest after she got here?

690
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:48,350
She had to camp in a tent every night because of you and... many times, she didn't get any sleep at all.

691
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:53,230
She got soaking wet and slept at the cabin during the Green Concert too.

692
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,600
And suddenly the beach yesterday?

693
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,600
Hey. Aren't you being too selfish?

694
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,820
Let her have some rest today.

695
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,030
 Yoon Tae In, where are you?

696
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:53,220
 Yoon Tae In! Mr. Yoon Tae In!

697
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,410
 Mr. Yoon Tae In!

698
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:58,010
 - Dr. Kang? 
 - Are you all right?

699
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:01,210
 Oh! What do we do? How long have you been like this?

700
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,650
 You aren't hurt anywhere, right?

701
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:09,910
 Please! Look the other way when you sneeze!

702
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,430
 I'm sorry.

703
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,390
 Stop it now.

704
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,340
 Ah, seriously!

705
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,080
 Aren't you cold?

706
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,480
 No, I'm not cold.

707
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,990
 Why am I feeling chilly?

708
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,930
You made this yourself?

709
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,060
It's hot, so eat it slowly.

710
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,990
Thank you.

711
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,350
It's delicious.

712
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,840
I told you to eat slowly.

713
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,130
It's so delicious.

714
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,650

715
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,900

716
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,760

717
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,680

718
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,740
 Ga On!

719
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,830
Is it Mr. Woo Yeon?

720
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,620
Yes?

721
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,420
Yoon Tae In?

722
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:26,080
 What the? Does he want me to pack up and leave?

723
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:30,610
Mr. Yoon Tae In, how about we do everything that we couldn't do today?

724
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,130
I guess you're very upset today.

725
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:35,300
It's not that. Today I'm not feeling well–

726
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:41,140
When I have a cold, I use this germanium heating mat

727
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,240
and listen to Chopin.

728
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,940
And this is our lightstick. (Every Kpop group has a lightstick for the fans to cheer the group during concerts.)

729
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,320
Fans shake this when they are having a hard time

730
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,810
and they feel better. That's what they say.

731
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:57,450
This is a dreamcatcher.

732
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,960
I bought this when I was on an overseas concert tour. Believe it or not,

733
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,020
it's supposed to shield you from nightmares.

734
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:16,110
You are really awkward when you deal with other people, Yoon Tae In.

735
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:17,680
Pardon?

736
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:23,200
But I can feel your sincerity.

737
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,800
Thank you.

738
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,890
Forget it if you don't need it.

739
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,690
Honestly, I don't really need them,

740
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:37,840
but you brought them with such sincerity, I'll accept them.

741
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,330
No thanks. It's too late.

742
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,040
Don't be like that. It is so pretty.

743
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,170
Hey! Woo Ga On!

744
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,550
You're seriously just going to leave?

745
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,750
What are you doing?

746
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,560
What's going on?

747
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,150
Tae In, this guy, today...

748
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:57,410
I want to leave LUNA.

749
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:07,030

750
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,790
♫  My cold heart  ♫

751
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:19,040
 ♫  Deeply freezes  ♫

752
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,380
♫  Feels so cold, so cold,  it feels so cold, so cold  ♫

753
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:29,520
♫  The reason why everything has stopped  ♫

754
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,880
♫  You're gone, you're gone,  yeah, you're gone  ♫

755
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,350
He's the one who left. We don't need him.
 ♫ You're gone, you're gone ♫

756
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,280
 Hey, Yoon Tae In!

757
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,070
 How can you even say that? Are you the only LUNA by yourself?

758
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,650
 Are you the decision maker?

759
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,250
 Does it really not affect you?

760
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,050
 You'd better not bring him back.

761
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,020
 - Hey, stop filming. That's enough.
- Why?

762
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,080
 It's nice to be out.

763
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,730
 People are bashing the entire group because of you.

764
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,680
 There is a victim who claims to have been bullied.

765
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,650
 I advised him to avoid what he can't enjoy.

766
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,390
 So, what happened?

767
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,900
 Ga On did this.

768
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:06,050
 LUNA won't be criticized too if I just leave.

769
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:13,990
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

770
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:18,400
♫  Feel so cold, so cold,  it feels so cold, so cold  ♫
