1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,220
   

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,960
  Segmented and Subbed by the Knight Team 

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,870
   

4
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,760
 You're a failure. 

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,620
 Failure. 

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,480
 Pathetic brat! You are a failure. 

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,360
 Pathetic, wretched... Loser! 

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,300
 You're a failure. 

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,710
 I am not pathetic! Don't call me a failure! 

10
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,470
 - Please!  
 - Yoon Tae In!

11
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,820
 - Please, please!  
 - Yoon Tae In!

12
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,440
Yoon Tae In!

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,280
 Don't call me a failure! 

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,300
 Leave me alone! 

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,300
Wake up.

16
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,230
Wake up, Yoon Tae In!

17
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,460
Don't tell me that I am a failure,

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,570
please.

19
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,000
Please, just... Leave me alone!

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,630
Don't tell me

21
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,740
that I am a failure.

22
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,640
You're right.

23
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,230
You're not a failure.

24
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,760
It's okay.

25
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,260
It's okay, Yoon Tae In.

26
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,900
It's okay.

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,520
It's okay, Yoon Tae In.

28
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,540
It's okay.

29
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,930
 Who are you? 

30
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,100
Yoon Tae In.

31
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,150
Woah... Ouch!

32
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,750
Why are you here?

33
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,640
This is my room!

34
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,120
Why? What is it?!

35
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,630
Thank goodness, it seems you're okay.

36
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,230
What's going on?

37
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,620
What?

38
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,160
It's nothing.

39
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,890
How is it nothing?

40
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,210
That's not it, Yoon Tae In.

41
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,320
What do you want from me?

42
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,720
- What did you just say? 
 - You think I don't know?

43
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,930
I have met a lot of people like you.

44
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,680
You come pretending to be nice and make me put my guard down.

45
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,330
But in the end you use my weakness as an excuse to stab me in the back.

46
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,440
Let's just get to the point instead of wasting time. What do you want from me?

47
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,190
So,

48
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,320
you think I will blackmail you with this?

49
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,860
If not, then what?

50
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,290
You were hysterical, crying and tormented.

51
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,920
I was going to act like nothing happened since you were obviously suffering.

52
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,540
Wow, this is beyond belief. You're making me want to do  exactly what you claim I'm doing!

53
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,360
How much will be enough?

54
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,280
What did you just say?

55
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,520
Yoon Tae In,

56
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,470
isn't the order all upside down and sideways?

57
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,630
Once you have realized what happened, shouldn't you be apologizing?

58
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,230
"I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you! Are you okay?" Why couldn't you just say that?

59
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,280
What is it you want?

60
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,400
Why are you bothering to...

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,640
Because I know you're hurting.

62
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,770
And I know that was just an accident.

63
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,550
Don't worry,

64
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,020
I am not someone who will blackmail you because of what happened.

65
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,120
If you feel bad about what just happened, follow through with what I ask... whatever that is.

66
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,450
I'll make amends... whatever it takes.

67
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,730
Good morning, Woo Young. Coffee smells good.

68
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,620
Would you like some coffee?

69
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,130
Sure.

70
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,400
Here.

71
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,170
Thank you.

72
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,190
Did you sleep in the tent last night as well?

73
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,360
No, I slept in Yoon Tae In's room.

74
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,500
Yoon Tae In's room?

75
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,070
No, in front of Yoon Tae In's room.

76
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,270
I didn't sleep very well, so I'm not thinking clearly...

77
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,080
Did you get hurt on your neck?

78
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,360
Ah, my neck...

79
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,410
My neck was a little sore, so I massaged it a bit too hard.

80
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,270
So, now it's all inflamed.

81
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,340
I'll drink the coffee well.

82
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,750
   

83
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,000
  Don't ever become the talk of the town for something disgraceful.  

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,600
 If you don't have the confidence to be perfect, then just quit everything now!  

85
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,300
 What a pathetic brat! 

86
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,050
In Yoon Jo, who are you worried about right now?

87
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,470
Get yourself together!

88
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,220
I'll carry on and he won't have a second to consider anything!

89
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,590
I'll make sure he has no strength left.

90
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:52,960
Oh!

91
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,280
Ga On!

92
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,210
Where are you going right now?

93
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,120
To work out.

94
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,290
That's perfect. Can you please help me out?

95
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,480
Why should I?

96
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,560
Not me, but for Yoon Tae In.

97
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,550
This is awesome! Woo Ga On, you're absolutely amazing!

98
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,640
Judo is the perfect sport to help train the mind and body!

99
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,490
I'll go easy on you today and teach you how to throw someone over your shoulder.

100
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,510
Toss someone over my shoulder? Are you serious?

101
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,470
I'm not going to do it. I won't do it!

102
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,730
Why do I have to do this?

103
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,740
He said it's to train your mind and body.

104
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,670
This is perfect! Perfect for Yoon Tae In!

105
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,470
Let's get started, Master.

106
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,980
Get off!

107
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,490
Relax or get hurt.

108
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,900
Is it hard?

109
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,780
What an uncultured sport...

110
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,980
Not at all! Judo is for the upper class.

111
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,240
With judo, you don't have to go after your opponent straight on.

112
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,660
Throw him around, flip him over, press down on him, and twist.

113
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,500
That's how you overcome the opponent.

114
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,990
I've never seen it before.

115
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,380
It's my first time seeing you talk so much.

116
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,930
When did you start practicing Judo?

117
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,550
Three years ago.

118
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,150
When I have a lot going on in my mind, working out helps me.

119
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,190
But why judo?

120
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,510
Why judo and not kendo, hapkido, taekwondo, etc.?

121
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,240
Bro,

122
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,800
have you ever heard of "Yesiyejong yuneungjegang?"

123
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,620
That is the core spirit of judo.

124
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,970
"Judo begins and ends with respect."

125
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,610
"The weak can easily beat strength."

126
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,560
I liked the idea behind that.

127
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,690
I wanted to be much stronger than the strong.

128
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,170
Become stronger than the strong?

129
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,450
Are you guys done? You must be thirsty.

130
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,110
Oh, look at all that sweat!

131
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,500
It looks like I should also learn judo properly next time.

132
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,250
You're super cool!

133
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,530
I saw your kicks earlier. I don't think you need any lessons.

134
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,740
That and this are different!

135
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,370
Please teach me properly next time too. Promise?

136
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,010
I need to use the restroom.

137
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,960
People definitely shine when they're doing things they love.

138
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,350
Uh!

139
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,090
Oh, should I try once, too?

140
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,840
Is this how you do it?

141
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,080
What are you trying to do?

142
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,010
Come on! I don't like it! Stop that, really.

143
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,840
I will try just once, okay?

144
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,760
   

145
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,020
   

146
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,140
Okay, it goes... Like this right? One?

147
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,110
   

148
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,260
   

149
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,180
   

150
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,080
Why isn't it working... Three!

151
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,930
- Ah, seriously! 
 - Oh!

152
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,720
Seriously!

153
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,160
I told you not to do it.

154
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,050
I'll get you next time... Let's go.

155
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,720
She is getting on my nerve.

156
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,620
Are you looking for a scarf?

157
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,700
Yes.

158
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,820
What kind of scarves are popular these days?

159
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,590
Is it for a gift?

160
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,910
For your girlfriend?

161
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,620
Absolutely not!

162
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,220
Girlfriend, what?

163
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,560
It's for a special employee that needs it.

164
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,810
Oh, okay.

165
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,230
Lately,

166
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,980
these kinds of scarves are popular.

167
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,370
This is elegant, sophisticated, and feminine.

168
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,470
But she doesn't have a feminine bone in her body.

169
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,310
Then, what is her age and style like?

170
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,520
Late 20's...

171
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,510
and her style is

172
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,320
so confusing.

173
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,720
But still, it's pretty.

174
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
If I'm being objective, that is.

175
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,880
Okay...

176
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,680
Then,

177
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,040
what do you think of this?

178
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,230
It is casual yet sophisticated, so it will look good on her.

179
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,460
I'll take this one then.

180
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,250
Yes, got it.

181
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,930
What is this?

182
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,040
Open it.

183
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,770
It's a present.

184
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,760
That's not it. My neck is...

185
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,880
I just thought it was missing something.

186
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,470
Huh?

187
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,980
I just thought your neck was missing something.

188
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,370
I thought a necklace would be... too much.

189
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,060
I thought a scarf would be perfect, so I chose it. What do you think?

190
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,380
You're right.

191
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,880
My neck was feeling a bit empty.

192
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,190
This is really pretty! I love it.

193
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,210
This must be expensive, though.

194
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,310
The thing is...

195
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,620
This is very, very

196
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,930
cheap.

197
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,580
Then why did you just get me one?

198
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,520
If something this pretty is cheap...

199
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,340
Mon, Tues, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, and Sunday.

200
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,190
You should have bought me 7 of these!

201
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,290
Should I have done that?

202
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,620
Next time I'll keep that in mind.

203
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,540
This is really pretty.

204
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,190
Is this how I do it?

205
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,580
You've got to be kidding me!

206
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,640
CEO!

207
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,280
What?

208
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,870
This isn't about Shin Oppa and that Chae Ji Yeon, right?

209
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,350
What now?

210
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,320
   

211
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,240
Does this even make sense?

212
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,010
Why is Shin Oppa is rumored to be dating this old divorced actress?

213
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,640
Shhh, shhh... keep it low.

214
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,430
How can you expect me to keep it low? Is this for real?

215
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,680
Oh, Hyo Bin.

216
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,550
Do you still believe this kind of tabloid news?

217
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,950
There must be a reason a rumor to spread!

218
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,230
Besides, I think you knew! And half the things in tabloids are true!

219
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,190
Can't you be quiet?

220
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,750
You'd better tell me now!

221
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,430
Is this true or not?

222
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,400
This is the first time I'm hearing this, too. How would I know?

223
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,380
Hey, Hyobin! Where are you going?

224
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,330
What are you doing here, not going after her?

225
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,890
Ah, yes. Hyo Bin!

226
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,150
Well,

227
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,230
don't you have anything to say?

228
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,440
- Actually...
 - Shin,

229
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,110
I want you guys

230
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,080
to date.

231
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,270
Yes, really.

232
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,150
I want you guys to date like everyone else.

233
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,650
But that

234
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,110
is just my personal wish.

235
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,840
I think of you as my nephew as I've known you for so long,

236
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,330
and that's why I'm rooting for you.

237
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,270
But I'm sure you know very well

238
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,080
what a critical blow scandals can be to idols.

239
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,600
Not just you or your partner, but the members, too,

240
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,520
will have a hard time.

241
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,580
I know.

242
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,290
So, let me ask again.

243
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,490
Do you have anything to say

244
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,470
about this?

245
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,410
No.

246
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,410
How could I be dating?

247
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,360
We are just close colleagues.

248
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,210
 Everything is okay, right? Should I pick you up later? 

249
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,870
   

250
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,060
Focus, please.

251
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,050
We have a 15-minute performance in the Green Concert at the end.

252
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,450
Which song do you guys want to go with?

253
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,650
Should we do "Beautiful Breakup" and "Midnight Fantasy?"

254
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,050
"Midnight Fantasy?"

255
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,830
Why would we do that one?

256
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,160
But still it's the latest song...

257
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,310
Forget it.

258
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,480
It's an outdoor performance and it doesn't fit into our concept anyway.

259
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,030
If we can't do it perfectly, then it's better not to do that.

260
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,840
That's right. Let's choose a song that fits into the season better.

261
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,800
Then, what should we do, besides "Beautiful Breakup?"

262
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,420
Let me deliberate it a bit longer.

263
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,450
I'll have to rearrange the songs anyway.

264
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,030
Well then, let's start practice starting tomorrow for the concert.

265
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,160
He said he'll rearrange the songs.

266
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,060
How is he going to mess up this time?

267
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,150
It's not a new song, he's just going to rearrange it. What's there to mess up?

268
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,730
Tae In's arrangements were already good.

269
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,170
No,

270
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,090
Tae In is not the same as before.

271
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,410
What do you mean he isn't the same as before?

272
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,560
Hear me out. He would have had 3-4 new songs ready by now.

273
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,790
He would talk about inspirations and rhythms in his ears and all.

274
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,870
Look at him now.

275
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,310
He doesn't have anything at all.

276
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,070
  
-This has been Chae Ji Yeon of "Sleepless Nights." 

277
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,180
Great work, everyone!

278
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,600
 Good work. 

279
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,880
 - Are you busy?
- Did you have had your dinner? 

280
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,790
 You are doing a live broadcast today, right? 

281
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,860
 I am here right now. 

282
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,100
 I'll wait where we always meet. 

283

♪ My heart

293
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,590
What are you doing now?

294
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,200
Ah...

295
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,710
I'm putting up a defensive wall.

296
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,370
Drink this.

297
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:51,090
The glucose in this will supplement liquid and will against fatigue.

298
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,080
Isn't it good?

299
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,290
Were you in there the whole time?

300
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,480
I came to protect you,

301
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,990
so I should fulfill my duties.

302
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,190
But...

303
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,100
I know you're under pressure,

304
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,610
but how can you stay in there all day and all night?

305
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,140
You are so tenacious.

306
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,780
Why?

307
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,800
Are things not going well?

308
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,960
No.

309
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,630
There are no problems,

310
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,090
because I'm that great.

311
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,200
True.

312
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,930
I don't know about anything else, but I agree to that.

313
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,060
Well, have you even heard my songs before agreeing to it?

314
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,790
I have heard. At the playground.

315
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,190
That night,

316
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,410
I was feeling really low,

317
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,410
as if the world had ended for me.

318
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,150
But that night, your music

319
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,600
gave me warmth.

320
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,730
My music?

321
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,340
You don't seem to remember.

322
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,900
You played guitar for me that day,

323
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,670
and that music

324
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,790
was really warm

325
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,490
and consoling.

326
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,960
What did I play that night?

327
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,020
Well,

328
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,010
It went something like this.

329
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,940
"Let Me Be Your Night."

330
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,010
Huh?

331
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,190
That's the title of that song.

332
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,240
This song was already released?

333
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
I need to find it.

334
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,910
It's the first song I wrote as a member of LUNA.

335
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,690
I see.

336
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,620
That's true though!

337
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,710
♫    The night when the prayer got delivered   ♫

338
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,570
♫   I go find you   ♫

339
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,860
♫   I was just looking at you, but I got closer   ♫

340
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,850
♫   To you  ♫

341
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,600
Although it sounds right,

342
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,580
the vibe is a bit different.

343
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,800
The one I heard that day was

344
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,020
a little, how should I put it...

345
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,650
Something like wrapping me in a comfy quilt?

346
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,550
- Quilt?
- Yeah.

347
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,820
It is a little similar, but

348
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,500
the feeling is slightly different.

349
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,920
I don't remember it very well since I only heard it once.

350
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,990

No, thanks!

446

454
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:16,280
- What will you have?
- Fried chicken skin.
- Fried chicken skin and... Hyung, I want to have ice cream.

455
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,820
- Sweet rice drink, Shikhye. Let me have Shikye, too.

456
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,400
- Be careful.

I would like--

459
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,820
What? I haven't finished ordering.

460
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,660
Aren't you getting late? We should leave! Let's hurry!

461

463
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,660

It's nice seeing you after a long time, Pil Soon.

470
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,780
It's Daniel, Choon Sik.

That's right, dude! I got my name changed. What will you do?

00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,050
Hey, why are you getting angry in front of people? Are you already having menopause?

474
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:09,860
- This jerk, really! 
 - What's with this color?

475
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:15,550
Oh, our LUNA is here.

476
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:20,750
Let's get ready.

477
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,410
Hello, CEO. Oh, Dr. K...

478
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,010
- Welcome.

479
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,860

 - Our company's newest manager.

480
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,080
It's been a while, Ms. Ji Yeon. You look so good.

481
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,560
Right? Since you both are such good looking,

482
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,590
you can't even eat together in peace. If you do anything, there's scandal and rumors.

483
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,150
Shin, are you still out here?

484
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,970
Please take Shin and go inside.

485
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,260
Yes, sir.

00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,650
Oh, wait. I heard my Chae Ji Yeon and you are very close.

487
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,270
I didn't know that.

488
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:11,490
Let's have a good relationship. You are so good looking.

489
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,720
Who, me? Thank you.

490
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,280
Let's go in and get ready! Ready, ready!

491
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,010
Come on in.

492
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,340

Oh, Oppa! Did you see my performance? How was it?

509
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,700
You worked hard.

Wait a minute, please.

517
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,470
Can you increase the volume of the keyboard and the bass?

518
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,410
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

519
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,210
Can you also increase the drum in-ear volume, please?

520
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,100
- It is a little low, right? 
 - Little low.

521
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,620
2, 3. Hello, we are Bluemoon. Thank you.

522
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,160
- What are you guys doing? 
 - We are a new group debuting at this time, called Bluemoon.

523
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,370
We are huge fans of the LUNA group.

524
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,180
Please take care of us.

525
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,460
- You may go now. 
 - Please take care of us.

526
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,670
- Can you kick the drum harder? 
 - Okay.

527
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,290
- We're all set. 
 - Are you all good to go?

♫  A fantasy that makes me feel like I've become the best 

534
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,510
♫  I love life, I love life, I love life, yeah 

535
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:32,560
Ga On, are you hurting somewhere?

536
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,720
I'll be okay if I rest up a little.

537
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,180
Get a grip.

538
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,520
Hey, Woo Ga On.

539
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,860
It's been so long, Ga On.

540
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,290
All right. You guys seem a little nervous performing after a long break.

541
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,050
It's okay. I loved the arrangement and the rehearsal went well.

542
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,440
We still have a few hours before the concert,

543
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,020
so you guys can rest for an hour or so.

544
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,950
I will take a nap in the car since I'm a bit tired.

545
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,390
Okay.

546
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,350
Oh, I will go along.

547
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,840
Where are you? Can I see you for a bit?

548
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,810
Excuse me?

549
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,970
- How can I help you? 
 - It's not true, right?

550
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:11,140
The divorced actress "B" in the tabloid. It's not you, right?

551
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,250
You seem a bit rude.

552
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:18,630
So answer quickly. It's not true, right?

553
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,760
It isn't.

554
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,090
Right? Thank, goodness. And here I thought you had no ethics.

555
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:32,070
An infamous divorcee, who had the wedding of the century, dating a much younger guy

556
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:36,310
and dating the hottest man in our country at that!

557
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:41,420
How unethical is that? Don't you think so, too?

558
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,150
I'm not sure. Isn't that something between the couple?

559
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:52,610
That is true. But you should know through your failed marriage

560
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,430
how tragic the end of a relationship between people from different levels is.

561
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:02,970
Hey, what are you trying to do now?

562
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:11,400
Just in case you have your hopes high. I'd feel really bad about that.

563
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,690
Anyway, please excuse me.

564
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,610
What are you doing?

565
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:42,430
Don't worry. Even if I end up embarrassing myself, I will stay by your side.

566
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,530
Go to the washroom if your stomach is hurting instead of fiddling here.

567
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,830
Would you like to go to the restroom with me?

568
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:53,850
Me? No, thanks.

569
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,830
It's because I am worried.

570
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:02,070
I have been given a huge responsibility. Also, you didn't get any sleep last night.

571
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,390
I won't fall asleep, so hurry up and go.

572
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:08,300
You will? I will be back in exactly 3 minutes.

573
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,520
Okay, so stop it and go quickly.

574
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,340
You should absolutely not fall asleep until I return. Okay?

575
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,160
Hello.

576
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,900
Excuse me,

577
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,950
can you please help me?

578
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,750
Sure.

579
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,270
Why is she taking so long?

580
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,140
Oh, why is this...

581
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:37,060
- Is it stuck? 
- Try it from the inside.
- Hang on.

582
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:41,920
Done... done!

583
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,530
Thank you so much.

584
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:49,150
No problem. We should help each other.

585
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,920
Actually, I'm your fan.

586
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,600
- Oh, thank you. 
 - Can I shake hands with you?

587
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,620
What?

588
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,590
Where did he go?

589
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,450
It's raining a lot.

590
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,390
Sorry, but the concert has been canceled because of the rain.

591
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,530
Please pack up.

592
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,620
What? Canceled?

593
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh, goodness!

594
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,190
What should we do? Moonlight would be disappointed.

595
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,330
By any chance have you seen Yoon Tae In here?

596
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,690
Wasn't he with you?

597
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,140
I went to the restroom for a bit

598
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,630
and Yoon Tae In wasn't there when I got back.

599
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,310
He didn't come here.

600
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,820
No way!

601
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,800
Is Tae In missing?

602
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,130
I...

603
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:14,470
I told him to not fall asleep until I returned.

604
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,570
While he was sleeping?

605
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,650
Isn't he Yoon Tae In?

606
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,770
Where is he going in rain?

607
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,810
Yoon Tae In!

608
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,770
Yoon Tae In!

609
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,380
Yoon Tae In!

610
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,230
Yoon Tae In!

611
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,730
Yoon Tae In!

612
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,920
Yoon Tae In!

613
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,860
Yoon Tae In!

614
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,840
Yoon Tae In!

615
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,880
Yoon Tae In!

616
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,070
Yoon Tae In!

617
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,030
Yoon Tae In, where are you?

618
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,610
Yoon Tae In!

619
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,650
Yoon Tae In!

620
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,650
Yoon Tae In!

621
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,100
Dr. Kang?

622
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,540
My goodness, Yoon Tae In. How long have you been like this?

623
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,910
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

624
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:51,930
How come you fell asleep in that short span when you are used to staying up all night?

625
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,170
What to do?

626
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,250
I am fine.

627
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,690
Okay.

628
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,110
But the concert...

629
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,570
it got canceled because of the rain.

630
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,180
Can you stand up?

631
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,260
Let's go.

632
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,970
Be careful.

633
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,020
Be careful.

634
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,990
I couldn't find him, CEO.

635
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,830
This will not do.

636
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,590
Call 911 before it gets dark and request help.

637
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,120
- And-- 
 - CEO Moon.

638
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,380
It's been so long, CEO Moon.

639
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,680
Oh! Reporter Min!

640
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,260
It's been so long, indeed! What brings you here?

641
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,010
This is Luna's first official schedule after that incident.

642
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,430
I obviously need to be here.

643
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:09,000
Haven't you heard that it was canceled, though? Aren't you going back?

644
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,580
It's raining a lot, so I am planning to go back early tomorrow morning.

645
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,930
But I don't see Yoon Tae In around.

646
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,660
Our Tae In,

647
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,050
he is resting in his room.

648
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,600
Is he? I didn't see him after the rehearsal.

649
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,000
You must have missed him, but he was there with the other members.

650
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,820
How's his health?

651
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,080
That's right. Thanks to your concern,

652
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:39,020
he has recovered fast enough to even be here today.

653
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,170
I see.

654
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,810
Let's drink some tea together later.

655
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,940
Sounds good! I will call you once I get back to Seoul.

656
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,450
Please go ahead.

657
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,820
We shouldn't call 911 now.

658
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,440
What about Tae In?

659
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,660
For now,

660
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,910
let's wait since he may be with Dr. Kang.

661
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:16,540
But let's keep it a secret that Tae In is missing.

662
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,340
Someone who came to find someone else got lost!

663
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,980
Does it even make sense?

664
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,410
Do you think I was in my right mind earlier?

665
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,230
Gosh!

666
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,400
I think I saw this tree earlier.

667
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,180
Could this tree be following us?

668
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,650
What are we going to do now?

669
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,850
It's already night.

670
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,430
Who asked you to fall asleep then?

671
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,420
This is driving me insane as well!

672
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,100
Why? Why? Why?

673
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,210
At this rate, we might get hypothermia

674
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,170
and end up as animal food.

675
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,810
Will we be able to survive until tomorrow?

676
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:14,050
Don't say something so dreadful.

677
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,440
Yoon Tae In.

678
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,810
There's something I need to tell you, Yoon Tae In.

679
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,460
No, you have nothing to tell me. Just don't.

680
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,350
No, I need to say it now.

681
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,880
I must say it right now.

682
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,990
Whatever that is...

683
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,640
I don't think I will open my eyes tomorrow!

684
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,240
Yoon Tae In,

685
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,710
actually

686
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,730
because of my house, I...

687
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,040
It's a house!

688
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,060
A house?

689
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,220
- House? 
 - It's a house!

690
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,590
Wait, let's go together!

691
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,950
Wait a minute. I can't see.

692
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,160
For God's sake, hurry up!

693
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,710
Wait for me.

694
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,820
Isn't there anybody inside?

695
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,340
Excuse me!

696
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,710
Here!

697
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,030
- Is it open? 
 -Yes!

698
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,690
Thank God!

699
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,930
Excuse me, sorry for intruding.

700
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,880
Excuse me.

701
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,470
My battery is running low

702
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:20,330
and there isn't any service, either!

703
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,050
This won't do.

704
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,380
You're too cold.

705
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:37,210
We should light the fire at least.

706
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,810
What?

707
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,900
I don't know how to do this.

708
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,280
I have never tried it before, either.

709
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,470
It's lit.

710
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,050
All right.

711
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,510
How can you do it like this?

712
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:06,130
Why don't you try it then?

713
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:15,930
Look at you,

714
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,490
after all that bragging.

715
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:20,940
This isn't the time to mock me.

716
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,400
We have one last match remaining.

717
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,190
Okay.

718
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,100
Light the match here and pass it on to me.

719
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,100
I will throw it in there,

720
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,790
then we have to blow on it.

721
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,510
- It's lit. 
 - We got this.

722
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,700
- Okay, start blowing.

723
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,420
Go.

724
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,170
- It's lit! 
 - Oh, it's cold.

725
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:41,620
Do we have to sit so close?

726
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:47,550
Then, should I not warm myself when I am still this much in pain?

727
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:02,130
Why are you looking at me like that?

728
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,540
- It doesn't suit you. 
 - What?

729
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,020
That scarf... it doesn't suit you at all.

730
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,460
My gosh!

731
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:17,500
Woo Yeon gave it as a present.

732
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,960
- What are you doing? Give it back. 
 - I don't want to.

733
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,330
Gosh, how stubborn.

734
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,570
Thank you.

735
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,420
Huh? What did you just say?

736
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,780
It's still cold.

737
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:08,070
I am sorry, too.

738
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:16,140
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you earlier.

739
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:24,290
You have protected me well until now.

740
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,550
So you do know that.

741
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:33,170
 The number you have called is switched off.  

742
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,980
Where are you going?

743
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,530
This will not do. We need to find Tae In and Dr. Kang.

744
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:52,420
Let's go together. What if Tae In got lost in some strange place alone?

745
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,290
I will go, too.

746
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:58,930
Where's Tae In Hyung?

747
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,250
CEO suggested we wait.

748
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,370
Why? What if something happens to the two of them?

749
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:10,150
Reporters are already snooping around since they felt something was off. We shouldn't cause more trouble.

750
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:13,450
CEO and I will find them, so the rest of you should stay here.

751
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:15,880
How can we not do anything?

752
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,190
I will also look for them.

753
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:23,890
Stop! What if something happens to you, too?

754
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:27,140
Let's just wait for a while. Okay?

755
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,310
Here.

756
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:38,280
You dropped it earlier.

757
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:49,930
It's broken. All the songs I worked on are here.

758
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,590
That's bad! What now?

759
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:58,860
It's all right. They were going to end up in the trash can, anyway.

760
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:08,630
What do mean, it's okay? Let's get it fixed first thing in the morning.

761
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:11,120
You must be upset.

762
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:17,210
You worked so hard on the songs without even sleeping.

763
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:22,060
How can it be okay?

764
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:35,420
When I lost everything I had worked hard for,

765
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,720
I felt like the entire world was collapsing.

766
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,340
What did you do after that?

767
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,280
I couldn't

768
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,240
do anything.

769
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,510
Just...

770
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:05,960
I didn't want to do anything after that.

771
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,200
It's the same for me, too.

772
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,470
Let's sleep now. I'm tired.

773
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,950
Wait a minute. Give me that.

774
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,510
What's this?

775
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:20,820
You never know. If you sleepwalk now,

776
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:24,520
I don't even have the energy to chase after you.

777
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:31,780
But if I do this, I will at least wake up when you try to leave.

778
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:37,410
So let's relax and sleep well.

Oh, no!

782
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:34,080
Yoon Tae In, are you awake already?

783
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,360
I was surprised and thought you went missing again.

784
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,590

It's fine as long as I act naturally.

- When does the treatment start today? 
 - Why a treatment all of a sudden?

791
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,260
Why won't you reply to my text, Dr. Kang?

792
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:32,330
So he wants to keep an eye on me now.

793
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:36,860
- If you get to know more about me, you'll be disappointed. 
 - Hello!

794
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:40,470
 When you said we should take some time to think, you didn't mean anything else, did you? 

795
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:44,270
 I'm an undercover spy who will get killed if caught. 

796
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:48,730
- Wait a minute. 
 - I knew he was suspecting me.

797

Okay, let's stay by her side and see if it's really because of her.
