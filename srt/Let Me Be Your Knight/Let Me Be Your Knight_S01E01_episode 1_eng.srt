00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,260
     

2
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,760
     

3
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,010
The best idol band, Luna, will hold a concert

4
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,150
at the Olympic Stadium today at 6 p.m.
      

5
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,570
A lot of people have already gathered here to see Luna.

6
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,340
That just means... 
      

7
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,960
 Hello, Moonlights. 

8
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,390
 l know that l'll be seeing you very soon. 

9
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,500
But l missed you, Moonlights. So this is my surprise to you! 
       

10
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,720
First off, Shin.

11
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,530
Can you give a sneak peek for our Moonlights? 
      

12
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,210
- A sneak peek? 
 - Yes.

13
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,150
Fine.

14
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,220
This is it!

15
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,100
- That was way too much. 
 - Okay.

16
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,720
You can check out the rest at our concert then.

17
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,690
Okay. Gosh. l think our fans will go crazy today.

18
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,940
So next up is...

19
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,030
- Woo Yeon. 
 - Yes.

20
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,750
l'm doing a live stream with our Moonlights.

21
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,740
Can you show them a sneak peek?

22
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,630
- Can you do that for us? 
 - Sure.

23
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,030
Let's stop here.

24
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,720
l'll see you soon.

25
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,060
All right. This is our youngest member, Ga On!

26
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,490
l'm talking to our Moonlights. Can you play the keyboard for us?

27
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,210
That's it?

28
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,270
You have nothing to say to them?

29
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,450
Nothing?

30
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,120
   

31
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,410
Tae In!

32
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,350
Tae In, Tae In!

33
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,690
- l'm talking to our fans. 
 - Get that away from me.

34
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,710
Oh, right! l forgot the most important part.

35
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,590
Moonlights,

36
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,150
l'm the heart of Luna.

37
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,060
l'm the oldest member, Kim Yoo Chan.

38
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,080
See you later, Moonlights!

39
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,200
Bye!

40
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,930
   

41
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,040
♫  After you leave   ♫

42
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,130
♫  My time seems like a day without a sun  ♫

43
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,200

47

♫  Why is this for us? This nightmare-like night  ♫

48
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,200
♫  One more time, can you explain me?  ♫

49
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,800
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

77
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,120
   
   

78
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,930
   

79
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,610
   

80
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,100
Can you delete everything except for the 2nd and 3rd tracks?

81
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,830
Yoo Chan, stay on the beat. You're falling behind.

82
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,100
Can you do better with your power chord?

83
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,970
Let's try again.

84
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,930
 Stop, stop. 

85
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,900
Everything was awful. Let's try again.

86
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,050
Again. Try with the slider. It's a bit unclear.

87
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,490
 Again. 

88
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,420
Yoo Chan, l want your rimshot to be stronger.

89
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,670
The kick is too strong. Again.

90
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,860
Again. l can't hear your snare.

91
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,720
Again.

92
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,220
Hey, Woo Ga On!

93
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,650
Focus, will you?

94
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,150
l want it to be more dynamic!

95
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,080
Again.

96
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,750
Woo Yeon.

97
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,990
This album won't be too incomprehensible. Right?

98
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,830
You were the one who told Tae In to do whatever he wanted.

99
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,110
When everyone was against Tae In's idea,

100
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,050
you said there must be a reason behind his confidence.

101
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,170
l did?

102
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,910
Right. l did say that.

103
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,810
l believe in Tae In. Of course, l do.

104
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,550
He's never disappointed me.

105
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,680
That should have been right on the beat.

106
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,780
All of his songs were hits.

107
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,520
But you don't think the listeners won't understand, right?

108
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,940
To be honest, it is experimental.

109
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,150
He's been producing all of our albums so far,

110
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,220
but he's never made all the decisions by himself.

111
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,070
Right? lsn't this way too experimental?

112
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,300
You said you liked it!

113
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,750
Come on.

114
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,350
Sorry.

115
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,910
   

116
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,550
   

117
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,940
No matter what, they  are going to win this time. Have you seen this?

118
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,740
Seriously.

119
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,550
   

120
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,170
 

121
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,320
 

122
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,550
 

123
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,520
   

124
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,210
   

125
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,380
 

126
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,710
 

127
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,860
 

128
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,330
     

129
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,440
 
  

130
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,500
  
   

131
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,230
 Yoo chan just uploaded a coming back post. It's tomorrow.  

132
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,010
- When are you going to meet?  
 - Amazing.

133
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,110
- We should come early in the morning, right? 
 - Exactly!

134
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,740
Oh my goodness!

135
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,280
-Tae in is so hot. Can't wait to meet him. 
- Right !

136
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,980
 

137
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,760

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,130
But how should you be when you go back?

141
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,020
Your hands must be full.

142
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,280
That way, my heart feels better.

143
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,670
All right. When we travel, our heart is fluttering but

144
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,890
our legs feel weak, right?

145
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,540
- Right. 
 - Exactly.

146
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,160
All right. We sing together.

Vitamin C, tocopherol, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, glutathione!

156

In other word, if you take just one tablet  per day,

our sisters and brothers can also plan to have another child!

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,360
Wait a minute. Let me get back some more.

164
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,730
- Get me two bottle. 
 - Two! All right.

165
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,930
- Give three bottles to me. 
 - Three bottles!  Got it.

166
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,000
Then, me five bottles.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,090
Give all the rest to me.

168
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,990
 - Really?  
- What, what?

169
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,390
All right, all right! I'll sell all that I have today.

170
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,590
Wait a minute.

171
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,290
- Oh, you worked hard. 
 - Worked hard, beautiful lady.

172
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,770
- Thank you for coming today, young lady.
 - Thank you for today.

173
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,870
- Meet you again. 
 -You worked hard today.

174
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,150
 Let's go together.  

175
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,350
What? Are you trying to start a fight or something with me?

176
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,310
Everyone on this tour knows that I and Hong Seok are a couple.

177
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,120
How dare you steal him when you came here later then me ?

178
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,750
Who cares what people on the tour thinks! Hong Seok's heart is for me.

179
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,950
What?

180
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,780
You ladies... What are you doing?

181
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,750
Hold it!

182
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,220
You said right that Cho Rong has a temper and is stubborn,

183
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,890
so you can't be with her.

184
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,800
 No, no. When did I? 

185
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,030
I just said that you were feisty, right?

186
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,540
Now I see you're pretty good at breaking people's relationships!

187
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,210
You fatso!

188
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,630
What? Fatso?

189
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,640
You look like you're going to die in couple of days.

190
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,170
Should I really find a nice funeral for you?

191
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,290
Oh my god!  Why are you doing this?

192
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,520
Hold it! Not this. Come with me to have something delicious.

193
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,700
Why are you only telling me to calm down?

194
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,380
It's because you look like a nasty boar, coming down from a hill.

195
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,410
- What? 
 - Oh, no no!

196
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,180
Oh no!

197
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,340
Myeong Ja.

198
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,200
Oppa!

199
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,590
They are full of it! This is really unbelievable!

200
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,570
This is a load of nonsense.

201
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,080
Wait, there. Cho Rong.

202
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,380
It's noisy!

203
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,660
Cho Rong. Ms. Cho Rong.

204
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,830
Cho Rong.

205
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,460
Let's eat something delicious and go for a date, can't we?

206
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,600
Let's go.

207
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,280
Whatever you try, but you know that I'm not going to come on this tour again.

208
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm not doing this because of the tour. Obviously I want to hang out with you, that's why, right?

209
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,710
Also, is Hong Seok the only man in this world?

210
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,730
Popular girls like our Cho Rong shouldn't worry. Okay?

211
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,820
On the next tour, I'll choose a rich and gentleman

212
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,580
for you. And I'll make sure he's romantic, too.

213
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,960
Looks matter to me!

214
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,810
Okay. So tell me your style.

215
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,560
What? Do you like Naam Jin or Na Hoon A? 
 (Famous old singers) 

216
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,780
I like Park Bo Gum. 
 (Famous young and handsome actor) 

217
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,490
Okay, Cho Rong. Let's go together.

218
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,360
 

219
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,370
 

220
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,740
Boss, wake up!

221
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,700
Oh, you came?

222
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,200
It was hard, right?

223
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,860
Why are you like this, seriously? Look at me, I have worked all day in the sun.

224
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,630
How was today?

225
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,370
Don't know.

226
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,730
Seriously. When you get to know how hard I work then you will be shocked.

227
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,550
Ta-da!

228
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,650
Wow!

229
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,180
 

230
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,740
You're a legendary saleswoman.

231
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,030
How could such a competent worker have come to work for my company?

232
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,760
You have work hard, In team leader.

233
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,770
Here, your cut.

234
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,430
This is all yours.

235
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,900
Thank you.

236
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,230
Well, there is one more 'thank you' I have to receive from you.

237
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,270
What is it?

238
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,760
Are you going to promote me like a team leader without a team

239
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,280
and a director without a headquarters?

240
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,630
Well... you know the house...

241
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,520
I think you can get it back.

242
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,160
What?

243
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,670
No way?

244
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,420
Yes! Team leader In, the green gated house

245
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,440
that you've talked about so much!

246
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,440
R-R-Really? When? How?

247
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,410
The house owner was never going to sell the house though.

248
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,820
That house owner must have changed her mind.

249
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,950
I heard through a close real estate agent

250
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:34,240
that they are selling the house.

251
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,590
Look, this is it right?

252
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,240
House number 777, Oksu-dong.

253
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,580
Right, this is my house.

254
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,320
Oh my god, thank you so much!

255
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,630
This is my house. How?

256
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,120
You are the best, boss!

257
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,320
- Jeong Bareun! 
 - You startled me!

258
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,340
You scared me.

259
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,050
Let's go in.  I have to tell you something.

260
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,700
Yeah, got it.

261
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,250
What? Is that true?

262
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,920
Yes. I can now go back to that house now.

263
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,820
How much is the house for?

264
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,390
Did you save enough money?

265
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,110
All the money? I don't have enough money yet.

266
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,290
I have been working so hard for 10 years since I was 18.

267
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,040
Why can't I buy a house of my own?

268
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,660
Thank you. Good bye.

269
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,980
Nobody at our age can buy their own house!

270
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,810
My friend, you really worked hard!

271
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,620
Nobody has worked so hard like you.

272
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,850
So, do you have to look for a mortgage loan from the bank?

273
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,020
President Nam has a close bank manager.

274
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,200
So later, he can look into this.

275
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,490
Really? It turned out well.

276
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,760
Give me a high-five then!

277
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,290
I can't wait for my older sister to find this out.

278
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,330
Has In Sun Joo contacted you?

279
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,700
Not yet.

280
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,470
She hasn't read your messages yet?

281
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,980
I don't think she has seen it. She must be busy!

282
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,020
Maybe she forgot Korean.

283
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,550
You sent it in English, too.

284
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,100
You used the dictionary, also a translator. No matter how busy she may be,

285
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,310
she must have the time to poop and eat.

286
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,100
How long would it take to check that and reply back?

287
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,240
There may be a reason. I also have my reasons.

288
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,760
What time is it?

289
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,130
It is so late. I'm going.

290
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,220
As if. Where are you going? Have lunch with me at least.

291
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,110
Have to go for part time delivery. I have to save money as much as I can.

292
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,870
Bye.

293
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,390
  
  

294
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,150
 

295
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,360
     

296
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,140
    
    

297
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,010
    
    

298
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,580
     

299
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,850
   

300
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,100
House number 777, the green gate.

301
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,030
It's this house, right?

302
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,340
Gosh. That was so easy.

303
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,350
 Mom! 

304
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,880
 Dad, when will you come back? 

305
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,310
 I'll come back soon, before my princesses go to sleep. 

306
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,790
 Can you get some chicken when you come back? 

307
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,460
 Okay. Make sure to keep the door locked. 

308
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,880
 Let's go,  Honey. 

309
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
 We'll back soon. 

310
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,430
 - Bye. 
- Bye. 

311
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,880
 Get back soon. 

312
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,960
 Okay! Now we can do whatever we want to. 

313
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,670
 How about doing a fashion show with Mom's clothes? 

314
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,350
 I will apply the lipstick. 

315
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:30,450
     

316
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,420
 What will happen to the kids now? 

317
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,120
 We don't have any other choice. 

318
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,800
 We need to send them to an orphanage. 

319
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,800
My gosh, it's pretty big.

320
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,120
Nice. lt gets so much sun.

321
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,200
lt's so warm.

322
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,150
Ms. ln, are you crying?

323
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,760
Now, if I can meet my sister,

324
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,240
I don't have any other wish for my whole life.

325
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,820
All right, all right.

326
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,100
Dreams...

327
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,290
come true!

328
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,330
Did you bring all the documents required for the loan?

329
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,330
Of course.

330
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,600
These are the documents for the loan.

331
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,340
This. Here.

332
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:33,180
And can you take a picture of me in front of the house?

333
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,930
Okay, okay.

334
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,680
It's a historical moment!

335
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,960
Okay!

336
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,650
Please make sure that everything shows up!

337
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,420
Okay!

338
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,540
3,2,1.

339
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,660
Where is Tae in? Why isn't he here yet?

340
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,890
It's his vocal lesson time now.

341
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,210
He should be coming soon. I've already told him about this.

342
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,150
Tae In is always a hard worker, isn't that right?

343
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,330
Oh, but why is my heart beating so fast?!

344
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,000
Well, well. Take a deep breath.

345
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,850
Inhale.

346
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,790
Exhale.

347
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,210
Breathe in and out.

348
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,740
No way! He isn't playing hooky, is it?

349
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,880
What's wrong with Tae In?

350
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,920
I can understand him though. Tae In is also a human being. He is probably anxious.

351
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,000
Why are you all being like this?

352
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,470
This album is really cool.

353
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,870
Great. I'm glad that at least one person likes it.

354
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,050
Woo Yeon, I still can't calm down even when I do this.

355
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,460
This album will be successful, even if it isn't a big hit... Right?

356
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,620
It won't be a complete failure, right?

357
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,690
CEO!

358
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,410
Oh, why?

359
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,000
Tae In! Oh my god, our Tae In came.

360
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,010
Tae In, this way...

361
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,090
Here, come this way.

362
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,960
Why do you like to get together this often?

363
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,140
I am busy  as hell.

364
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,260
Our Luna is doing a comeback.

365
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,810
We should celebrate this special occasion!

366
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,720
  
  

367
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,170
Our first idea is  a surprise live performance for your comeback,

368
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,460
where you switch your instruments with each other and play your new track, "Midnight Fantasy".

369
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,670
This is something your fans have always dreamed of seeing you do.

370
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,150
The second idea works with the song itself.

371
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,910
For five days, each of you would take a turn livestreaming

372
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,630
to talk with your fans, in bed at midnight.

373
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,320
How is that special?

374
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,650
This is exceptional!

375
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,390
It's Luna's COMEBACK event!

376
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,070
For me, no.2.

377
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,990
Video call with fans before going to sleep.

378
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,170
Boyfriend concept.

379
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,130
I think it will be okay.

380
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,140
That's sweet.

381
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,300
That's what we always do.

382
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,330
How about doing a video for each member? I want to do a cooking show.

383
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,510
Like a sexy chef concept.

384
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,430
For me... I will choose what Tae In hyung chooses.

385
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,440
Ok, so our Tae In, what will you choose?

386
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,330
I will choose no.4.

387
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,350
No.4?

388
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,410
Not doing anything.

389
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,550
My song itself is an event, isn't it?

390
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,550
Yeah that's right, but we all prepared this together...

391
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,810
Hey Tae In, Tae In!

392
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,150
Tae In!

393
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,140
That punk!

394
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,820
  
  

395
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,650
   

396
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,950
Just check quickly and leave.

397
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,830
I want to make sure that I'm not wrong.

398
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,150
What is it? Why are there so many people here?

399
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,020
What if they don't show up?

400
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,940
No way! I've been their fan, and they had never done that before.

401
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,820
This is our tradition, you know.

402
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,600
Counting down and listening to their newest song!

403
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,510
He is so cool!

404
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,650
What's with him?

405
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,540
Hey, look here!

406
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,220
Hey, Mr. helmet!

407
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,610
Are you leaving without even apologizing? So rude!

408
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,180
That jerk!

409
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,260
I need to see your face.

410
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,160
It's starting!

411
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,030
It's starting. Oh my gosh!

412
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,970
9...

413
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,080
8... 7...

414
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,130
6... 5...

415
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,220
4,... 3...

416
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,300
2... 1...

417
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:32,860
♫  A dark night where the moon is absent  ♫

418
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:41,600
♫  There's only darkness like a thick fog  ♫

419
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,020
♫  Blinking starlight from afar  ♫

420
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,890
  Did Tae In Oppa make this song? Isn't this song kind of disturbing?  

421
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,370
  I was expecting a lot!  

422
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:05,830
♫  Starlight,  ♫

423
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:11,090
♫  A soft blow could turn it off. It's dangerous  ♫

424
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,830
What is this?

425
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,310
♫  Starlight,  ♫

426
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,600
♫  Starlight,  ♫

427
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:27,270
♫  I can't reach it  ♫

428
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,270
It's Yoon Tae In!

429
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,800
Where? Where?

430
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,120
♫  Someone please tell me the way  ♫

431
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,270
     

432
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,230
   

433
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,240
   

434
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,740
I can't believe this, seriously. Look at this.

435
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,800
That was a terrible song! 
     

436
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,360
 What to do? 

437
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,740
     

438
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,540
Let's go.

439
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,420
Guys, it went down again.

440
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,720
   

441
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,200
   

442
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,970
     

443
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,180
   

444
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,110
You can sit here.

445
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,170
Hello, sunbae, are you doing well?

446
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,730
Ah, you are not doing well, right?

447
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,110
Sorry, Senior.

448
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,700
I was only saying hello, but look how he ignored me...

449
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,250
One moment, please.

450
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,210
Ah, yes.

451
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,410
I get it, though, how uptight you must be right now.

452
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,050
Why don't you ask another composer to write the songs?

453
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,940
You failed so badly because you try to do it all on your own.

454
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,770
You are being negatively impacted so badly.

455
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,950
I'm not interested in hearing this from someone who instantly forgets his own lyrics.

456
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,140
What did you say?

457
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,140
If you can't sing, you should at least practice.

458
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,570
If I were you, I would not be able to tell people that I am a singer

459
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,690
because of embarrassment.

460
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,170
Who do you think you are, lecturing me?

461
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,600
Everyone's talking about how you are a 'has-been." So obnoxious!

462
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,500
   

463
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,580
   

464
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,030
     

465
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,980
Why is Tae In not coming?

466
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,990
What is the matter?

467
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,180
Do we need to wait till Tae In comes?

468
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,120
I think it's best to remove the songs from this album

469
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,290
from the concert's repertoire.

470
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,010
The response is... very bad.

471
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,230
There is only one week left for the concert.

472
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,750
Midnight Fantasy is the title of our concert series. How can we change that now?

473
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,660
Perhaps we should stick to what's always worked for us before? We have so many hit songs.

474
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,320
What is wrong with this album?

475
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,650
Do people not understand our genius?

476
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,680
Will Tae In stand still?

477
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,030
Tae In isn't the problem.

478
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:19,450
The USA Billboard interview we had scheduled during our America Tour

479
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,760
is cancelled.

480
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,530
Why?

481
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,500
They want to wait and see...

482
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,310
What? Only because our album's response was bad this time?

483
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,410
We already have a special performance prepared for them!

484
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,430
Does this even make sense?

485
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,470
Tae In will be so disappointed.

486
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,170
Either way, let's turn this around with our concert, okay?

487
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,970
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes ♫ 

488
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,240
♫  Feel so cold, so cold, it feels so cold, so cold  ♫

- Tae In! 
 - Tae In!

503
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,150
- Tae ln! 
 - Hey!

504
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,700
Sorry? He fell asleep?

505
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,040
Tae ln said he got his headache pills and sleeping pills mixed up.

506
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,900
l had prescribed these sleeping pills to him.

507
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,250
What? Sleeping pills? When?
   

508
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,490
A while ago.

509
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:40,350
He practically begged me, saying he couldn't sleep.

510
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,020
l guess you didn't know. He said it was normal for him to stay awake for three days straight.

511
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,040
Three days?

512
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,070
- That's them! 
 - They're here.

513
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,520
Does Tae ln have a drug problem?

514
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,590
ls it true that the members aren't getting along?

515
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,140
- Was it due to the album's failure? 
 - Just a comment, please!

516
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,410
Tae In!

517
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,990
Hey, are you really okay?

518
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,190
Do you know how worried we were?

519
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,520
l'm not deaf, so will you please lower your voice?

520
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,660
l think he's fine.

521
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:26,290
So what? Luna is the target of gossip right now.

522
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,430
Hey, we're on the front page again.

523
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,180
What? Reporter Min went a little too far with this one.
   

524
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,240
He wrote that we put on an act to cover up how miresably the album failed...

525
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,120
The show's over, so just go home now.

526
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,260
l failed to stay focused and fell asleep during our concert. Don't be a fool like me.

527
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,880
No one thinks you're a fool.

528
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,350
So try not to think about anything and get some rest for the time being.

529
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:54,760
What do you mean? We need to redo our concert that we didn't finish today.

530
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,730
You'd better not slack off. Practice hard even if l'm here.

531
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,000
He's totally fine.

532
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,450
Of course, l'm fine.

533
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,800
CEO Moon, l want to go home.

534
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,700
We should talk to your doctor first before we make that decision.

535
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,230
And if it at all possible, stay here for a few days even if the doctor says you can go.

536
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,330
What would people think if you were discharged in a day?

537
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,610
- As if l was ever worried about stuff like that. 
 - Goodness.

538
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,150
Go home, guys.

539
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,680
- He seems fine, so let's go. 
 - All right, get going.

540
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,580
You should leave too, CEO Moon. l'm tired.

541
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,660
lf you need anything, ask Soon Nam to get it

542
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,750
for you.

543
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,570
Let's go.

544
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,560
Hey, aren't you leaving with us?

545
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,910
l want to stay here.

546
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,560
Come on. He wants you gone.

547
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,820
Can we really leave him alone here?

548
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,800
- Hey, l can take great care of him. 
 - Cut it out.

549
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,960
You heard him say he's fine. We'll only make him uncomfortable.

550
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,880
l can be a great caregiver.

551
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,100
CEO, Moon, what should we do with our unfinished concert?

552
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,130
Let's wait and see how Tae ln recovers. Don't worry. You guys just go home and get some rest.

553
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,600
Snap out of it, Yoon Tae ln.

554
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,610
   

555
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,420
Cho Rong!

556
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,650
What are you doing?

557
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,870
I brought some Korean melon!

558
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,650
Stop looking around and have a seat! It's not going to fall apart.

559
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,100
Cho Rong, your house is very neat!

560
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,430
I told you I'm not going on the tour! Why did you come here?

561
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,520
I'm not here to ask you to come to the tour. I'm just here to see you.

562
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,110
I want to hang out with you.

563
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,920
Sseul! 
 (T/N: The condition where all the open cards are matching and the player can take these cards.) 

564
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,410
Give me one Pi from you.

565
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,880
- Let's see. 
 - Here you go.

566
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,650
It's Pi-bak and Gwang-bak.

567
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,470
I'll do three-go! Even if I don't get it, it's a go.

568
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,990
I totally got deceived! A great gambler was here.

569
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,910
The good cards are just coming to me today!

570
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,090
Ah, wait a moment.

571
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,480
I'm looking at everything. Wait right there.

572
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,660
♪ Ms. Kim is doing great. 
      

573
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,560
Why? Did something happen?

574
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,940
Cho Rong,

575
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,950
is this person saying they want to meet up with me?

576
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,220
I can't see it! Who is asking you to meet up?

577
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,990
My older sister.

578
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:40,350
Your twin sister, who's a doctor in America?

579
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,980
That's right!

580
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,600
What should I do, Cho Rong!

581
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,770
Why are you hugging me? Stop it!

582
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,830
What should I do?

583
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,560
Ba Reun!

584
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,180
This! This! This!

585
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,240
I forgot about this one. This is the most luxurious-looking dress of what I have. How is it?

586
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,890
Are you going out on an arranged date?

587
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,240
- It looks a bit too much, doesn't it? 
 - Yes.

588
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,880
Seriously, what should I wear?

589
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,060
This one looks great!

590
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,790
This one?

591
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,700
But do you think my sister will recognize me?

592
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,470
Are you an idiot? You guys look exactly the same.

593
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,540
That's true.

594
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,490
Do you think my sister will be as excited as I am?

595
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,720
She must have missed me, right? That's why she found me, right?

596
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,270
Of course!

597
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:48,870
By the way, your sister is coming to Korea for a lecture. She must be very successful.

598
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,210
Then why don't you wear this? This one looks closer to success!

599
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,510
Right?

600
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,790
I'll try to balance with her.

601
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,840
Is this one better?

602
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,060
What is your reason for finding me?
 (Using formal speech form) 

603
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,620
What do you mean by that? There's no reason to find a family.
 (Using informal speech form) 

604
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,410
My family is in America.

605
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:01,140
And my name is not In Sun Joo, but Kang Sun Joo.

606
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,660
What are you talking about it, Unni?

607
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,670
Unni...

608
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,930
You're still living in that time.

609
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:20,420
Anyway, you didn't contact me for a different reason, right?

610
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,560
What do you mean by a different reason? Why would I have one?

611
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,070
Then...

612
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,060
can you stop contacting me from now on?

613
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,230
- What? 
 - I want you to stop sending me messages.

614
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:36,200
Stop asking for my contact information through the adoption agency,

615
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,670
and stop spreading the words here and there.

616
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,420
I came out today to say this.

617
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,730
Hey, In Sun Joo.

618
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,290
That's the hotel I'm staying in.

619
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,280
I thought about our past

620
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,380
and decided to help you out once if you need my help.

621
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,330
I'm leaving the country in three days.

622
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:13,150
If you need my help, then come to see me before I leave.

623
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,690
I don't need your help.

624
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,640
I'm doing fine in this country.

625
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,880
The house where I used to live with our parents will be my house tomorrow.

626
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,650
If you need my help, you should visit me.

627
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,320
I'll help you out once.

628
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,860
Have a nice life, Kang Sun Joo.

629
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,350
I'm going to live a good life on my own!

630
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,570
Yes, just forget about that kind of sister!

631
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,690
In Yoon Joo, the second chapter of your life starts from tomorrow.

632
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,300
Start a new life in this house, okay?

633
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,190
Of course, that's right.

634
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,740
How can she say that to me?

635
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,510
     

636
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,340
  Please move the bookcase first!  

637
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,260
Oh! Can you please take off your shoes?

638
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,510
I wiped the floor just now.

639
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,750
Excuse me, what are you doing?

640
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,380
Yes? Ah, we are in the middle of moving in.

641
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,180
Moving in?

642
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,260
What do you mean by moving in? I am the owner of this house.

643
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,310
What are you saying?

644
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:21,440
I have already signed the contract with the realtor.

645
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,460
I'm asking who you signed that with!

646
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,340
I never put this house on the market.

647
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,420
     

648
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,220
     

649
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,290
 The number you have dialed doesn't exist. 

650
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,900
 Please check it. 

651
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,620
What is this? Did I just get scammed?

652
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,260
     

653
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,780
     

654
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,380
  There is no real estate brokerage registration under this contract.  

655
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,800
  I think they scammed you together.  

656
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,250
  These kinds of people are usually professional con men, so it's hard to find them.  

657
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:16,340
  I've filed the case, so I'll call you later if you go home and wait.  

658
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:32,010
Please, pick up your phone!

659
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,300
  The person you're trying to connect is not available... 

660
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,860
What am I supposed to do now?

661
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,130
It was hard for me to save that money!

662
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:51,840
You con b*stard!

663
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,230
Did you really have to  take everything?

664
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:59,140
Did you have to do that!

665
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,910
Oh, god.

666
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,140
Did I fall asleep here?

667
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,590
Oh, my head hurts.

668
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,620
It's embarrassing.

669
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,520
Excuse me.

670
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,230
You can't sleep here like this.

671
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,980
Hey you, please wake up.

672
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,560
No way...

673
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,380
What is it?

674
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,710
Hey, who are you?

675
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,430
When did you come into my room? How did you get in?

676
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,750
Are you...

677
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,860
Sasaeng? 
 (fanatic fan) 

678
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,790
Your room?

679
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:37,170
Is this your room?

680
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,560
Is he a crazy person?

681
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,360
  Did she take a photo of me?  

682
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,920
Hey hey, stop right there!

683
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,140
Let me see your  phone.

684
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,330
Why are you being like this?

685
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,700
I have something to confirm so let me check your phone.

686
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,150
No... Why my phone?

687
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,720
I said, give it to me.

688
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,540
Hey! Excuse me!

689
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:19,180
Hey! That's my phone!

690
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,060
What?

691
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,740
What a crazy person!

692
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,740
Excuse me! Wait!

693
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,210
Talk to me! What's wrong with you?

694
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,840
Hey! Give it back to me!

695
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,760
I said to give me my phone.

696
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,200
Give it back to me!

697
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,940
Excuse me!

698
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,970
Are you really crazy?

699
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,340
I said give my phone back to me!

700
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,080
My goodness.

701
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,910
What kind of crazy person are you?

702
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,460
Are you crazy?

703
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,900
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

704
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,310
Why will Yoon Tae In be here? He's hospitalized right now!

705
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,280
It's him! He's wearing a patient's gown!

706
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,780
It is Yoon Tae In!

707
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,070
Let's go see him!

708
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,060
Let's follow him!

709
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,230
Oppa!

710
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,460
Yoon Tae-in? Who is Yoon Tae-in?

711
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,770
     

712
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,760
I'm still nauseous.

713
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,160
Yoon Tae In.

714
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,340
Luna?

715
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:06,030
Luna... I think I heard this somewhere before.

716
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,330
Luna... Luna...

717
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,450
  It's Yoon Tae In!  

718
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,970
  - Where? 
 - He's over there!  

719
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,780
Is it that bad-mannered Chollima delivery guy?

720
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,940
That was him?

721
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,170
It is sleepwalking.

722
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:35,070
What?

723
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,540
It's also called somnambulism.

724
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,270
Somnambulism?

725
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,690
Sleepwalking is rare to happen in adults.

726
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:45,520
Have you experienced this before also?

727
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,490
No.

728
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,810
Have some rest.

729
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,410
Oh, reporter!

730
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,970
Min...

731
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,160
Ahh that... That is...That-That...

732
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,670
Our Tae-in is practicing acting.

733
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,650
Tae In does everything 
      

734
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,170
as if it's real! 
      

735
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:18,370
No, Tae In is sleeping fine. 
      

736
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,260
Doctor, what should we do?

737
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,180
If we stay here in the hospital, there will be bigger issues.

738
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,580
How about getting a live-in doctor?

739
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,390
A live-in doctor?

740
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:36,440
In a situation like now, it's better for him to get treated in a familiar space.

741
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,190
It can help a lot.

742
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:45,620
There's one of the younger colleagues named Kang Sun Joo, whom I met during my time doing a Ph. D. in the U.S.

743
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,810
She's famous among foreign VIPs for intimate sleep disorder treatment.

744
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,880
What should I do to get that doctor's treatment?

745
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,640
I'll connect you with her since she's coming to Korea for a conference.

746
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,800
I don't want to.

747
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,070
You don't want to?

748
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:04,120
How can you say that after going through all this?

749
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,490
I'm already exhausted from living with members. Why would I want a live-in doctor?

750
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,070
If it weren't for practicing, I would've moved out and lived by myself already.

751
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,240
That doctor is a reliable, excellent doctor!

752
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,250
Angelina Jolina, Ariana Grete, and even Melon Musk! 
 (Using slightly different names than the actual celebrities) 

753
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,690
All these celebrities are lined up to get treated by this doctor!

754
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:21,460
Do you still believe people?

755
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:24,140
It's a world where you hate the people you know, and the people you don't know are scary.

756
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,410
Please think carefully.

757
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,790
If you keep being like this, it will become a big issue.

758
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,180
I think I went through enough big issues.

759
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,970
You might lose your advertisements!

760
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:35,150
I think that's up to your ability.

761
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,830
I don't know! Then just reveal everything!

762
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,210
Let's just reveal that Yoon Tae In has a sleepwalking disorder!

763
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:42,180
You can't do that! Don't do that, ever!

764
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,670
Why not?

765
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,150
It's because it'll ruin Luna!

766
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:54,210
People will think of my sleepwalking first when they hear the name Luna.

767
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,970
I don't want to hurt my career because of something insignificant.

768
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,810
Tae-in.

769
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,020
My goodness.

770
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,230
Jung Ba Reun. Jung Ba Reun!

771
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,420
     

772
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,150
I don't know about it.

773
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,240
What would that be?

774
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,900
I don't know anything.

775
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,570
Do you want some coffee, at least?

776
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,630
What's going on with her?

777
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,220
I really don't know anything about it!

778
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,280
I don't know anything.

779
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,570
Go, go away.

780
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:29,090
Run!

781
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,920
That girl!

782
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,410
What is all this?

783
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,010
I am going to go crazy.

784
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,440
Over there!

785
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,610
What is going on?

786
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,850
  Hey, Jung Ba Reun. What's going on?  

787
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,240
Hey, who are those people?

788
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,020
Hey you, are you okay?

789
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,140
- What did you do for Mr. Nam? Why did you get a private loan? 
 - What?

790
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,090
Why would I get a private loan?

791
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,710
  Those people were private loan debt collectors.  

792
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:44,010
They knew that I was your friend, and they knew all of your personal information.

793
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,110
They said you borrowed 100 million won  (100,000 USD)  through Mr. Nam.

794
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,750
- What? 
   - Did you prepare the documents to get the loan?  

795
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,220
  Yes, of course.  

796
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,480
  Here is the document.  

797
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,250
  Oh, your stamp.  

798
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,500
No way..!

799
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,250
For now, you should hide somewhere. I'll look into this more.

800
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,290
Okay.

801
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,760
  Correct your posture,  

802
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,540
  and empty out your mind.  

803
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,430
  And then say this.  

804
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,330
  I'm not angry.  

805
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,210
I'm not angry.

806
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,390
  - I'm not angry.   
 - I'm not angry.

807
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,320
  - I'm not angry.   
 - I'm--!

808
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,310
I'm not angry.

809
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:35,840
  I'm not angry.  

810
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,560
  - I'm not angry.   
 - I am angry!

811
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,370
But if you keep making me say that I'm not angry, it makes me more infuriated!

812
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:43,380
  I'm not angry.  

813
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:00,220
I wonder if the Han River's water is warm.

814
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:11,490
Are you here because of Shin Woong Bio?

815
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,090
Excuse me?

816
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,150
     

817
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:27,590
My 300 million won!

818
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,180
I know! What a horrible sh*tty stock!

819
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:39,620
Let's cheer up. Fighting!

820
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,800
Fighting!

821
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,370
     

822
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:11,320
  Thinking of our old history, I came back to help you once if you need my help.  

823
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:23,980
     

824
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,970
Hello, is Kang Sun Joo...

825
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,730
They have been waiting for you.

826
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:47,340
Please go to the VIP room on the 34th floor.

827
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,970
I'm sorry?

828
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:57,350
Excuse me.

829
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:59,340
Excuse me...

830
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,890
Are you Doctor Kang Sun Joo?

831
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,360
Pardon? 
 (In Korean, the word "Pardon?" and "Yes?" sounds the same) 

832
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,280
Thank you. Thank you so much for coming.

833
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,010
I was worried so much that you wouldn't come!

834
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:08,960
Please, help me!

835
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,840
I think there's a misunderstanding–

836
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

837
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:17,010
- I'm CEO of MM Entertainment, Daniel Moon. 
 - Okay.

838
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,090
Our MM Entertainment's pride–

839
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:22,020
Our MM Entertainment's pride,

840
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,430
the national treasure, Luna's Tae In!

841
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:29,770
He is very sick.

842
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,810
Did you say Luna? Yoon Tae In...

843
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:35,130
We already looked up about you, Doctor.

844
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:39,650
I heard that you specialize in intimate sleep disorder treatment that's customized for VIPs.

845
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:42,660
That's what our Tae In needs right now!

846
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,230
It's not that–

847
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,830
I'll just cut to the chase.

848
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:50,190
We were hoping you could become our live-in doctor.

849
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:52,950
- Live-in doctor? 
 - Yes.

850
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:55,380
I think you're misunderstanding something–

851
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,410
Doctor, please! Please, take care of our Tae In.

852
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:02,570
Wait! I'm not Kang Sun Joo–

853
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:04,900
Who said this is okay?

854
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:14,430
I'm not going to get treated by someone like you.

855

♫   You're gone, you're gone   ♫

862
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,010
  If you can treat our Tae In's sleepwalking,  

863
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:50,110
  we'll pay whatever you wish!  

864
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:52,910
  In the end, you hired a live-in doctor without my consent.   

865
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:57,320
  Look at him smiling! He looks so sweet and nice. He's cute!  

866
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,320
  I was scared, too.  

867
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,010
  - Is it really sleepwalking? 
 - Please, someone, save me!  

868
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,710
  Why is it you?  

869
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:07,170
  There's nobody who welcomes you. So please stay like furniture.  

870
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,450
  I'm saying, stay quiet until you leave. 

871
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:12,810
  Whatever you say, I have to stay here.  

872
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:17,590
  Adult sleepwalking often appears in more aggressive symptoms, like driving a car while asleep.  

873
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:24,350
  You have to fix your personality first before treating the sleepwalking!  

874
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,110
♫   Maybe a wonderful end would come  ♫
