1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,960

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,210

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,780
 In Yoon Joo 
as Jung In Sun

00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,740
 Lee Jun Young 
 as Yoon Tae In - Leader of LUNA

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,140
 Seo Woo Yeon

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,550
 Kim Jong Hyun

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,220

 Kim Dong Hyun

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,300

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,790

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,500
Don't go.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,400
Stay here with me.

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,010
Yoon Tae In...

15
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,790
You get weird when you're drunk.

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,850
I asked you not to leave.

17
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,730
I really need you.

18
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,330
♫  It reminds me of myself  ♫

19
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,500
♫  My Rainbow  ♫

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,910
♫  When the rain doesn't stop. No matter what you say,  ♫

21
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,020
♫  It doesn't comfort me  ♫

22
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,080
Tae In,

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,360
you're way too drunk!

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,130
Dr. Kang, are you okay?

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,420
You're right, Tae In is really drunk.

26
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,530
Wait, what? I'm not drunk yet.

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,360
Let's go in the house.

28
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,210

29
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,300
Now I'll never be able to sleep.

30
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,030
Yet, I see he can sleep just fine.

31
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:07,940

32
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,290
Hey, you...

33
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,680
Yoon Tae In...

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,820
You're... not sleeping?

35
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,270
Isn't it uncomfortable to sleep here like this?

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,100
You ask me that now...

37
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,370
all of a sudden?

38
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,660
I know, right?

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,140
It just started bothering me.

40
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,500
 Dr. Kang!

41
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,610
You scared me.

42
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,410
You scared me so much!

43
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,050
Did you see a ghost in your dream or something?

44
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,930
No, I didn't see a ghost...

45
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,660
I see... So, you were dreaming...

46
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,690
of Tae In, right?

47
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,440
What?

48
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,920
No way!

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,300
My guess was wrong, then.

50
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,590
Breakfast is ready.

51
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,350
I must be crazy!

52
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,910
Why would I have this kind of dream?

53
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,970
It's because of the crazy things he said yesterday!

54
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,870
Ugh! What do I do?

55
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,100
Here you go, Ga On.

56
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,660

57
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,470
This is delicious!

58
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,690
I'd even believe it if you say Mr. Baek Jong Won made this!  (Mr. Baek is a famous cooking show host.)

59
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,330
If I were a woman, I'd marry Woo Yeon Hyung.

60
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,480
Oh, Jeez. I hope our Ga On isn't still drunk.

61
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,020
Hey, you're not Woo Yeon Hyun's style.

62
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,630
What is his style?

63
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,650
Good morning.

64
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,180
Good morning, Professor.

65
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,090
Eat your breakfast.

66
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,410
Here.

67
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,660
Thanks.

68
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,000
Are you okay with eating Korean food for breakfast?

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,300
If you don't like it, I'll make some toast for you.

70
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,180
No, it's all right.

71
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,500
It's so delicious.

72
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,900
We'll proceed with the home concert we talked about right away.

73
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,310
I totally love it! Hyung, what about the song list?

74
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,050
Give me some time to choose from the list we had for Green Concert.

75
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,110
How about we have our Moonlights vote?

76
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,040
I don't think we have that much time.

77
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,700
Oh.

78
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,160
I'll come up with a theme we can do at home for the concert.

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,460
How should we tell our fans?

80
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,720
I want to make it special.

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,380
How about each of us giving out hints in our own way?

82
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,550
We could do that.

83
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,900
Ah...

84
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,650
I let you off yesterday, so we'll practice an extra hour today.

85
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,240
Are you a squirrel?

86
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,840
Why are you saving food when you are not finishing it?

87
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,100
You are more gluttonous than you look.

88
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,500

89
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,410
 Did you sleep well?

90
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,930

91
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,760
 The air pollution level seems low today. The sky looks clear.

92
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,860
 The BLT sandwich that you like along with warm Americano...

93
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,060
 I hope you wake up before the coffee gets cold.

94
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,850
 I'm a little worried.

95
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,730

96
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,200
 You're pretty regardless of what you do. So don't worry.

97
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,970

98
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,570

99
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,000

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,100
Thank you for the food.

101
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,210
Thank you!

102
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,590
Hey, hey! We have some rules in this house.

103
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,910
Pardon?

104
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,370
All right, everyone.

105
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,040
Loser does the dishes. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

106
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,010
Oh! Not me.

107
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,720
Scrub it clean.

108
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,350
- Yoon Tae In lost. Let's go. 
 - Yes. 
 - Quick.

109
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,840
 Why should I feel uncomfortable?

110
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,040
 Yoon Tae In is the one in the wrong.

111
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,240
I'm fine, just so you know.

112
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,160
With what?

113
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,890
About yesterday.

114
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,490
Let's be adults...

115
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,660
and be cool about it.

116
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,470
Okay?

117
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,020
How could I forget about that?

118
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,540
Out of tune, offbeat, and even the wrong lyrics! That's how you sang Amor Fati.

119
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,710
I can never forget it.

120
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,610
What are you doing now?

121
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,690
I'm getting the plate.

122
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,850
So...

123
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,140
is that all...

124
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,290
you remember from yesterday?

125
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,390
Oh, right.

126
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,720
About the drinking game with Woo Yeon...

127
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,700
Tell me.

128
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,880
Did I win?

129
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,230
You do the rest.

130
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,940
Hold on.

131
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,250
You should leave these.

132
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,650
Hold on.

133
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,010
What now?

134
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,300
Wipe it before you go.

135
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,310
Hi, Moonlight!

136
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,870
Today I will be styling Ga On. What do you think, Ga On?

137
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,210
Sure.

138
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,500
Okay! I took everything out of Ga On's closet.

139
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,540
Isn't this really pretty?

140
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,170
Not really. Do you want me to wear that?

141
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,660
Yes.

142
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,410

143
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,180
  - Yoo Chan has very good taste.
 - Try it on. 
 - You guys like this?

144
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,730
 - So Cute!
- It looks really good.

145
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,820
 So handsome!

146
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,020
 Put it on, Ga On.

147
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,300
Okay, everyone. I will wear this for the home con...

148
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,730
 Did anyone else catch this?

149
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,960
It must be meal time.

150
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,810
Did you guys eat?

151
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,300

152
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,580
Is this also preparation for the home concert?

153
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,040
Since we are opening up our house, I am concerned about this and that.

154
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,700
Just wait a minute.

155
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,670
Yeah, all right.

156
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,860
Here it is.

157
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,440
Let's do it.

158
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
By the way,

159
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,100
is Yoon Tae In always like that when he's drunk?

160
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,030
You must've been taken aback yesterday.

161
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,550
It was my first time seeing him that drunk.

162
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,020
I don't think he should be drinking outside from now on.

163
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,720
He will do that to other women, too.

164
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,200
So then,

165
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,130
is it okay for him to drink here and do that to you, Dr. Kang?

166
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,660
Oh,

167
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm his attending doctor.

168
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,530
I am someone who has to understand every aspect of Yoon Tae In,

169
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:59,250
but people outside will misunderstand. Image is everything for celebrities.

170
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,380
- Oh, hi, Hyung Joon. 
 - Seo Woo Yeon, I'm going to enlist in the military soon.

171
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,620
What did you say? Are you really going?

172
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,810
Here!

173
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,310
All right. Make some room for this.

174
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,310
This is for free.

175
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,050
Your mother told me to give you a lot of food for free when you came here.

176
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,180
Oh, that's okay. You already gave us a lot of cartilages, too.

177
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,030
If an elder adult gives you something, then a "Thank you" will be just fine for it.

178
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,870
That's true. I gave you a lot of plump mussels.

179
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,300
Just ask me if you need anything more. All right?

180
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,440
- Okay. 
 - That's good. Fighting.

181
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,920
- Thank you.
- No problem!

182
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,190
Nothing has changed here, including her generosity.

183
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,480
Everybody is the same except you.

184
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Remember? We were going to go busking in Hongdae when we were in high school. ( Hongdae is a  popular area for arts and Indie music)

185
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,560
We went to Seoul for the first time from the island, and you were the only one who became a big star!

186
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,670
How about a girlfriend? Do you have one?

187
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,610
No, I don't.

188
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,380
Oh, you have one. Yes, you have! Who is she?

189
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,970
She is a celebrity, isn't she?

190
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,620
Come on! You can just tell me.

191
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,230
No, I told you I don't have one.

192
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,750
I see. You are just developing feelings, right? When will you confess to her?

193
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,710
You see, it's not that simple.

194
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,340
I don't think I'm the only one who likes her.

195
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,670
What?

196
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,250
You see, that's the problem. You always have to be the nice guy and be considerate.

197
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,020
There are no concessions in love. You just have to go for it.

198
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,530
You got that?

199
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,840
Go for it.

200
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,510
Oh, you guys came.

201
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,190
You've become even better looking now!

202
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,820
Since Hyung Joon is enlisting, we finally get to see you!

203
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,400
- What are you saying? 
 - I'm really upset, you know.

204
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,490
- How come you only called him? 
 -  Alright, order the food now.

205
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,420
Here.

206
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,400
I feel good tonight.

207
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,540
- Hey, where should we go? 
 - Let's go for another round!

208
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,450
There's nothing to do. Should we just go home?

209
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,870
You weren't even that good...

210
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,260
-Hey...Be quiet! What do you know?
 - I'll tell you...

211
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,430
Gosh, really.

212
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,940
- I'm so sick of this, just stop. 
 - You should take good care of yourself.

213
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,660
Woo Yeon? What's up?

214
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,780
- Let's go.
 - Does he want to play the claw game?

215
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:49,360
- Are you a kid or what? What are you doing?
 - Should we try it?

216
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,450
Gosh.

217
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,710
- You have to see it from here. 
 - No... Go to the left.

218
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,890
- No! 
 - Come on! That wasn't it!

219
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,710
- It needs to go that way! 
 - No.
 - Ok, ok, I got it.

220
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,780
Hey, call that number.

221
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,700
- Something is wrong with this machine. 
 - Woah!

222
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,000
Hey!

223
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,380
- Do it properly! 
 - That side is my side!

224
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,860
Woah!

225
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,090
Ya! Ya!

226
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,170
Is this going to work?

227
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,790
Absolutely.

228
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,230
The vibration relaxes our cells and brainwaves.

229
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,210
It is good for stress

230
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,990
and it helps people sleep.

231
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,390
Just match your energy with this tone

232
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,360
and imagine a bright positive light spreading throughout your entire body.

233
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,450
Then you force the dark negative energy out of your body.

234
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,340
Dark negative energy?

235
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,640
That seems very abstract.

236
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,370
If I were to give you specific examples,

237
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,160
they are the behaviors that have aged for a long time inside of you,

238
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,090
such as stubbornness, gluttony, selfishness, arrogance,

239
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,570
and your terrible drinking habit.

240
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,890
I don't have a terrible drinking habit.

241
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,410
Most people are unaware of their behaviors.

242
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,040
For you... Do this 50 times before coming back into the house.

243
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,270
Where are you going, not staying by me?

244
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,330
 Don't go.

245
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,820
 Stay by my side.

246
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,790
Shouldn't you be here for my treatment? If you just leave like that, you are neglecting your duties.

247
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,740
Oh, bug.

248
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,300
Bug? Where? Where? Oh my, where?

249
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,430
No, no, no! Is it gone?

250
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,050
What should I do?

251
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,850
Hurry up and get it off me!

252
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,630
Where is it? Hurry, hurry!

253
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,730
Take it off quickly!  Hurry!

254
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,310
Ah, I really hate bugs! Hurry!

255
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,480
Just a minute.

256
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
But don't kill it on my face!

257
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,070
Oh, really.

258
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,750
It's gone.

259
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,410
Really?

260
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,820
Gosh... You.

261
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,620
Yes...

262
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,400
Tae In Hyung.

263
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,940
Do you want to try this for the home concert?

264
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,090
What is it? What is it...what is it?

265
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,960
Try this for your piano solo performance.

266
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,710
Me?

267
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,590
Why? Your hands are all okay now.

268
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,070
Good night.

269
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,920
Good night...

270
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,960
What's wrong with him? Did he eat something wrong?

271
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,510
But, where is the shoot happening?

272
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,120
We are shooting at the ice rink.

273
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,020
Huh? Then are you going to ice skate?

274
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,900
Can you skate well? I've never done that before.

275
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,750
It's for work.

276
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,170
What did you do growing up? How could you have never tried ice skating before?

277
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,040
Skating wasn't mandatory in school.

278
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,430
Life is busy and you can't do everything.

279
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,970
Hurry, hurry. Move it.

280
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,540
Next setting

281
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,750
That's not it.

282
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,260
Hey!

283
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,880
Is this really soy milk?

284
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,190
I got your regular order, sir.

285
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,110
- Then it's my tongue that's at fault, is that right? 
 - No.

286
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,950
Go get me another one!

287
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,520
Tom Black's muse, Tae In, has arrived!

288
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,190
Welcome! Welcome!

289
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,960
We're still setting up now, so please wait a little in the waiting room.

290
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,320
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

291
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,120
Please take care of me.

292
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,030
Hello.

293
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,100
Hey, I want that in the center!

294
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,610
How many times do I have to say it?

295
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,770
Looking good!

296
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,630
All right, good.

297
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,420
The view is nice!

298
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,470
- This shot looks great. 
- I agree.

299
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,740
Oh, handsome!

300
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,080
Okay. Oh, charisma! Good!

301
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,370
Okay!

302
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,710
I love that pose, too. Great!

303
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,790
Look to the side for me.

304
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,500
Yes! That looks so lovely.

305
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,280
Good! Okay.

306
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,120
So handsome.

307
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,190
Let's change it up a bit.

308
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,770
Look to the side.

309
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,950
Nicely done.

310
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,150
Okay.

311
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,950
Hey, you over there. (Using informal speech form)

312
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,210
- Who, me? 
 - Is there anyone else but you?

313
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,710
Stop playing around and

314
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,530
clean these up!

315
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,760
I said clean up!

316
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,770
Why are you so slow? Jeez!

317
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,790
Hey, come here.

318
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,420
Check this out.

319
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,890
It's too dark.

320
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,310
Can't you see? Are your eyes just for decoration?

321
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,540
You have eyes for decoration?

322
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,210
They need to be redone!

323
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,580
What the... You!

324
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,780
What is this?

325
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,350
I-I'm so sorry. Let me pay you for any damages.

326
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,340
You! How dare you touch me with your dirty hands!

327
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,580
Do you know how much these pants cost?

328
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,830
I'm really, really sorry.

329
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,940
How on earth did you get this job anyway?

330
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,120
Hey! How will you take care of my pants?

331
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,310
How will you take care of them?

332
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,440
I'll pay for the cost.

333
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm just... so sorry.

334
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,130
She's my manager, and I'll handle any damages.

335
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,400
Oh, so she's your manager, Tae In.

336
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,870
I didn't hear that during the introduction earlier, so I didn't know.

337
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,220
Then, I'll just go change my pants

338
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,480
Shall we take a break for now?

339
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,830
Shall we? (Using informal speech form)

340
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,320
Huh?

341
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,410
But, you should apologize before you go.

342
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,270
My casual way of speaking must have irked you, Tae In.

343
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,730
Are you angry? (Using formal speech form)

344
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,210
I'm sorry. (Using informal speech form)

345
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,230
I'm sorry. (TUsing formal speech form)

346
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,600
Not to me, but apologize to my manager. (TUsing formal speech form)

347
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,650
She apologized, but you pushed her over and screamed at her, right?

348
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,310
I thought she was my staff, that's why.

349
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,460
Staff members should be treated like garbage?

350
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,140
You've changed a lot, Writer Woo.

351
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,520
You didn't behave like this during LUNA's first shoot.

352
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,010
It's okay, you can stop now, Yoon Tae In.

353
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,690
I am not okay.

354
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,670
I'm sorry. (Using formal speech form)

355
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,630

356
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,070
Is the shoot over?

357
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,390
You wear size 230mm shoe, correct?

358
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,940
Yes.

359
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,260
Since you worked so hard today...

360
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,580
You said you wanted to try ice skating.

361
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,220
Is that why... here...

362
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,140
I rented the rink for myself.

363
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,330
It wasn't cheap...

364
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,620
Put these on and come out.

365
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,680
What the...

366
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,960
Just trust me and follow along, okay?

367
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,740
I'll take responsibility and show you how to do it.

368
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:52,490
Will you be teaching me how to fall?

369
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,490
It's just because it's been a while. All right?

370
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,600
I got it, so let's get up for now.

371
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,210
Here.

372
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,770
Can you get up?

373
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,360
Here, here. Oh, careful, careful, careful...

374
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,510
I'm fine now.

375
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,000
I-I'll go and watch at the bleachers, so have fun skating!

376
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,350
I'm not here to practice, skating alone isn't fun.

377
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,040
It's fun only if we skate together.

378
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,480
Here. Hold my hand.

379
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,390
Hold...

380
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,760
- Is this funny to you? 
 - Yeah.

381
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,400
Are you going to help me up or not?

382
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Hold my hand.

383
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,500
Now, one...

384
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,460
two... three...

385
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,910

- Catch me.
- I caught you!

409
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,540
I got you!

410
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,180
♪   Love Paranoia, I can never stop, Love Paranoia  ♪

411
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,330
Hyung,

412
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,330
wait a minute.

413
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,760
Look at you acting sexy.

414
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,650
Stop it! I never did that.

415
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,420

416
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,180
Hyung, aren't you going to answer?

417
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,800
When is Tae In coming?

418
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,190
He went to a photoshoot with the professor.

419
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,220
They are really late.

420
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,440
Our Tae In Hyung will never be late.

421
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,560
It's almost time to practice now.

422
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,000
So then, do we not have a practice session today?

423
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,490
Five, four, three,

424
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,140
two, one!

425
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,480
Time for a fun-filled practice time.

426
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,630
Let's go practice.

427
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,410
I told you so.

428
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,520
Be good, guys. You can do it!

429
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,840
Bye.

430
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,370
 Don't apologize to me, but apologize to my manager.

431
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:58,230
 Even when she apologized, you still pushed her and said harsh words.

432
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,850
What?

433
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,020
What are you smiling about?

434
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,380
Really!

435
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,560
Why is my heart beating so fast?

436
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,740
Get a hold of yourself, In Yoon Joo!

437
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,590
I should pack.

438
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,340
Okay.

439
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,740
I should clean this out.

440
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,850
What else should I do? Oh, right!

441
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:14,510
 ♫ A fantasy that makes me feel like I have become the best ♫

442
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,300
 ♫ I love life, I love life, I love life, yeah ♫

443
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,700
♫  Yesterday's repeated breathless day ♫

444
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:30,220
 ♫ It's like an addictive bad nightmare, no ♫

445
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,370
 ♫ Can you hear my heart? It's not a dream and even if it's a dream ♫

446
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,050
Are you nervous because of tomorrow's performance?

447
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,340
No, not nervous at all!

448
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,220
It's been a while since we've done this,

449
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,840
so I'm just trembling a little and my heart flutters a bit.

450
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,170
I'm just a little scared.

451
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,130
We call that "nervousness."

452
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,050
What do you do if you don't know your own heart?

453
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:12,420
But I didn't know that you could also be nervous.

454
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,480
Earlier today, you were like a true professional at the photo shoot.

455
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,480
I don't want anyone to see that side, so I always behave like I'm comfortable and unfazed.

456
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,280
I want to look like I was born with it.

457
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,610
Why? What's the benefit of that?

458
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,850
Just because...

459
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,930
that just looks cooler.

460
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,090
Is that so?

461
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,650
But I don't think you have to pretend. You're going to look amazing.

462
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,110
Stop talking to me. You're bothering me.

463
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,700
Sure.

464
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:14,790
Thanks to you, I'm having free time tomorrow. I'm going to sleep in until my back hurts!

465
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,670
I'm so excited about it!

466
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,400
- I'm also very excited that I can sleep without you watching me! 
 - Hmph!

467
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,930
Doctor, did you pack everything?

468
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,250
Yes, I did.

469
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,920
It'll be quiet tonight.

470
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,130
Then, good luck with today's performance. I'll make sure to watch it.

471
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,760
But where are you going to stay? You don't know that many people in Korea.

472
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,280
I'm going to stay in the hotel nearby.

473
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,680
The nearby hotel would be the Hyatt?

474
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,070
Yes.

475
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,740
- Ga On. 
 - Yes?

476
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,480
- You know about tonight, right? 
 - Yes.

477
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,790
Then, I'll get going now.

478
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,990
- I won't go out far for you. 
 - Bye, Doctor! 
 - Bye.

479
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,710
Wow.

480
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,440
Do you want to buy it? I'll give you a good price.

481
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,840
Yes. Can I have this one?

482
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,140
This one? It's 2,000 won  ($2)  per basket.

483
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,080
I guess you prepared it all by yourself.

484
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,000
Of course, I should do it.

485
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,050
Ma'am, if I get these as well, how much would it be?

486
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,680
This one as well? I'll give it to you for 6,000 won.  ($6)

487
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,240
Okay. I'll take these, too.

488
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,660
Thank you.

489
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,470
  Cho Rong, even if you don't go on the tours, don't forget to eat well.

490
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,950
She should've played cards with me, at least. Why did she leave without a word?

491
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,500
Let's do good work today!

492
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,370
Hello!

493
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,940
Did you finish the soundcheck here?

494
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,350
Okay. Oh, wait!

495
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,910
That shouldn't get in the shoot.

496
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,910
So please push it away, and put it there.

497
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,700
Hey! How can you put lighting in front of the LUNA?

498
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,140
- Is the center correct? 
 - Yes, it is!

499
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,220
Yes.

500
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,460
It's great!

501
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,820
Just do what you used to do!

502
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,600
But you guys know that this is a live show, right?

503
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,450
Don't get too nervous, and let's do it!

504
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,120
I think you are the most nervous, CEO.

505
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,340
CEO, you're making other people confused, so please sit down and rest.

506
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,530
Should I do that? Okay.

507
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,430
Soon Nam! I need some  Cheongsimhwan. (calming pill)

508
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,840
Oh?

509
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,180
Why did you come in here?

510
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,320
I'm sorry.

511
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,090
I thought you wouldn't put cameras in the bedrooms.

512
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:08,040
I'm like this when I'm at home.

513
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,600
Right.

514
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,800
I prepared this for you.

515
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,360
Did you even buy this?

516
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,610
Yes, I got one.

517
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,790
You're a real fan.

518
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,220
These days,

519
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,260
I'm really into Woo Yeon.

520
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,610
You should root for our Ga On.

521
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,470
You recently told me that your favorite is Ga On.

522
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,620
Today, it's Woo Yeon.

523
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,880

524
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,350
It's already over 2 million views even before it's started!

525
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,750
You're living with these incredible people! Do you understand now?

526
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,120
It's not me, but Kang Sun Joo.

527
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,890
If it were In Yoon Joo, I could've never met them.

528
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,470
I know about that as well.

529
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,320
Hey, stop talking nonsense and focus on the show. It's about to start.

530
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,500
♫  Paranoia  ♫

531
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,550
♫  Monday feels good in the sun, it starts with D caffeine  ♫

532
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,320
♫  After a blood transfusion with coffee,  only my head hurts  ♫

533
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,140
♫  Just like that I'm saying, I'm crazy and sick; Just like that I'm saying, I'm crazy and sick  ♫

534
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,330
♫  Like running on a treadmill, bang bang on a dizzying day  ♫

535
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,320
♫  Beyond the end of the sunset, all fatigue melts away  ♫

536
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:44,050
♫  Just like that I'm staying in heaven and hel. Just like that I'm staying in heaven and hell, yeah  ♫

537
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:50,050
♫  I need something, killing, healing, I have a feeling baby  ♫

538
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:55,560
♫  Something is missing, I just need some therapy   ♫

539
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,670
♫  Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia, lift me up and drop me baby  ♫

540
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:07,330
♫  Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia, it makes my heart flutter  ♫

541
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,390
♫  I'm delusional every time and  ♫

542
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,470
♫  Sometimes I have a fantastic dream  ♫

543
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,860
♫  Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia, I can never stop, Love Paranoia  ♫

544
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,550
♫  Paranoia  ♫

545
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,040
Ohh! Tae In!

546
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,290
I guess he would've had a million relationships! That's why he can write these lyrics.

547
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,570
Do you think so?

548
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,320
He didn't seem like it.

549
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,350
Are you joking with me? Look at his face!

550
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:35,230
I bet he started music because of women.

551
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:40,140
♫  My life will change like this dream. A memory that seems familiar and unfamiliar  ♫

552
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,440
  Why did you start playing music?

553
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,190
  Because someone liked it.

554
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,200
  And they said I'm good at it.

555
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,840
  Who?

556
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,400
  There's someone.

557
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,280
♫  I can get out of it  ♫

558
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,670
♫   I'm going to run after waking up from hypnosis like a lie   ♫

559
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,300
♫  Love Paranoia  ♫

560
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,700
♫  Yeah  ♫

561
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:18,740
♫  Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia, lift me up and drop me baby  ♫

562
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:24,540
♫  Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia, it makes my heart flutter  ♫

563
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:32,360
♫  I'm delusional every time and sometimes I have a fantastic dream  ♫

564
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,500
♫  Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia, I can never stop, Love Paranoia  ♫

565
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:54,760
♫  I'm delusional every time and sometimes I have a fantastic dream  ♫

566
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:01,850
♫  Love Paranoia, two, Love Paranoia, I can never stop, Love Paranoia  ♫

567
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,510
It's been a while since our last performance.

568
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,780
Can you share your thoughts, guys?

569
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,810
Well...

570
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,920
Let's start from the youngest, Ga On!

571
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,170
Everybody,

572
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,900
I missed you so much.

573
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,360
I also missed our fans so much.

574
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,170
I was so happy that I could perform in front of all of you, Moonlights.

575
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,470
Yes, I have also

576
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,820
missed you all so much and was happy to perform.

577
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,480
And our Moonlights!

578
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,260
I love you!

579
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,590
Then finally, let's hear from our Yoon Tae In!

580
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:55,940
Will you say something for our fans?

581
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,940
This is Yoon Tae In.

582
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,780
I got a lot better now.

583
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,700
I'm sorry for making you worry about me.

584
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,330
And we're preparing for a new album,

585
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,340
so please look forward to it.

586
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,460
Also, I won't make you worry about me anymore.

587
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,170
Then, unfortunately,

588
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,960
it's time to sing

589
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,070
the last song.

590
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,510
Somebody told me

591
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,770
that this song is like

592
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,670
a cozy blanket.

593
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,910
  What I heard

594
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,740
  was something like a cozy blanket.

595
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,400
Tonight,

596
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,940
I hope you put on this song as a blanket

597
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,570
and have a cozy night.

598
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,540
Then, can we say "I love you" to our fans

599
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,310
and then move to our next stage?

600
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,610
One, two, three...

601
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,800
I love you, Moonlights!

602
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,870
♫    The night when the prayer got delivered   ♫

603
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:33,740
♫   I go find you   ♫

604
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,020
♫   I was just looking at you, but I got closer  ♫

605
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,060
♫  To you  ♫

606
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,210
♫    You who has a sorrow   ♫

607
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,990
♫    I want to console you   ♫

608
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:57,360
♫    Beyond the distant moonlight, I whisper to you   ♫

609
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:05,240
♫    Every wound that you got until now, put it in the tears   ♫

610
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:12,680
♫    So we can let go of those as pieces of light   ♫

611
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:20,740
♫    After a long day passes; Even if I'm left alone  ♫

612
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,940
♫     To make you shine more and not to be lonely,   ♫

613
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,920
♫   Let me be your night   ♫

614
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,300
♫    After passing a strong tide   ♫

615
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,860
♫   Even if a cold wind blows   ♫

616
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:42,310
♫    I'll hold you tight and protect you   ♫

617
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:49,270
♫    I'll be with you forever   ♫

618
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:53,360
♫   When you are having a hard time   ♫

619
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,110
♫   Run to me and tell me everything   ♫

620
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:02,430
♫   I miss you today as well and engrave these words in my heart  ♫

621
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,780
♫  Love you  ♫

622
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,920
♫   In the middle of this long dark night   ♫

623
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,480
♫   You are shining like a star in the dark. Oh yeah   ♫

624
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,770
♫   I'll hug you softer than the morning comes   ♫

625
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,910
♫  For you   ♫

626

♫   I hope the dark night comforts you   ♫

631
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,970
♫   You are dazzling in my sky   ♫

632
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,610
♫   Your mere existence makes everything sparkle  ♫

633
00:47:54,610 --> 00:48:00,670
♫   The darker I become, the more brightly you shine my heart   ♫

634
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,620
♫   Even when I can't see you shining through   ♫

635
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,610
♫    I embrace you fully   ♫

♫    Even if I’m left alone   ♫

638
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:23,810
♫   For you to dream together with me, who's always with you   ♫

639
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,920
♫   Will you be my light   ♫

640
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,160
♫   After passing a strong tide   ♫

644
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:58,440
♫    I hope in my arms is a cozy night   ♫

645
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,180
Thank you for your work!

646
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,680
Thank you!

647
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,050
Thank you for your work!

648
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,170
You guys are so cool! So cool!

649
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,240
My ears indulged for a while!

650
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,900
Also, what Tae In said at the end of the show, that's true, right?

651
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,980
Pardon?

652
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,760
I'm talking about releasing a new album.

653
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,500
Yes.

654
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,220
Okay, all of you did great today.

655
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,820
Don't think about anything for now and rest well.

656
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,650
Don't come out for us!

657
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,080
Bye! Goodnight!

658
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,410
It was fun for the first time in a while. Wasn't it, Hyung?

659
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:02,010
At the end of it, I almost cried because I didn't want it to end.

660
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:08,520
But it would've been nicer if Doctor Kang was with us. Don't you think so?

661
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,500
Right, it would've been nicer.

662
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,990
When did you start caring about Doctor Kang so much?

663
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,480
What?

664
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,250
  Somebody told me

665
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:33,090
  that this song is like a cozy blanket.

666
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:38,650
  Tonight, I hope you put this song on as a blanket and have a cozy night.

667
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,720
Was this place this big?

668
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,530
I've so relieved.

669
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:18,350
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

670
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:21,550
- I'm going to sleep here tonight. 
 - Why?

671
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:24,120
Doctor Kang asked me to do so.

672
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,900
I have to protect you tonight.

673
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,030
What?

674
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:33,940
But can you just leave your door a bit open while you're sleeping?

675
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,620
No, I can't.

676
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,540
My goodness!

677
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,650
What should I do? It's really annoying.

678
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:40,420
Yoon Tae In.

679
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,860

680
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,340

681
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,680

682
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,060

683
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,960
  Hello?

684
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,770
Were you sleeping? It took some time for you to pick up.

685
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,100
No, I wasn't sleeping yet.

686
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,490
  What were you doing?

687
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,820
I was just...

688
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,500
doing something...

689
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,820
But why did you call me?

690
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,120
That is...

691
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,560
How can you leave me to Woo Ga On?

692
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,910
I can't sleep at all because of his snoring.

693
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,860
Is that so?

694
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,870
As I thought, me sitting out there is the best, isn't it?

695
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,570
Hello? Yoon Tae In?

696
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:08,420
Did it get cut off?

697
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,760
Hello?

698
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,420
Did you see our concert by any chance?

699
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,550
Yes, I did watch it.

700
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,320
Your song was great.

701
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,590
Specifically, which one was great?

702
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,490
What is it? Is the signal bad here?

703
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,380
I liked "Let Me Be Your Night" the most.

704
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,380
Me, too.

705
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:57,250
So are you having fun after getting away from the tent?

706
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,480
  I think I'm not the only one who has feelings for her.

707
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,430
  You see, that's the problem.

708
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:26,060
   You always have to be the nice guy and be considerate.

709
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:30,030
 There are no concessions in love. You just have to go for it.

710
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,800
  Is the room okay over there?

711
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,740
It's great.

712
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,410
Did you request breakfast as well?

713
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,620
  No.

714
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,900
Then, come back right away when you wake up.

715
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,220
As soon as you open your eyes, come right back without eating breakfast. Okay?

716
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,840
Okay, I will.

717
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,540
Then,

718
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,160
I'll see you tomorrow.

719
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,170
Yes, okay.

720
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,710
Are you not hanging up?

721
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,590
Why aren't you hanging up?

722
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,540
If you look at the screen when it's hung up, then it feels like you're looking at the back of the person who left first.

723
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,480
It feels a bit sad.

724
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,100
  So, go ahead and hang up first.

725
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,020
Why don't you hang up first?

726
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,000
I'll look at the back of you this time.

727
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,300
Okay.

728
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,590
Then, I'll hang up now.

729
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:54,350
♫   When I'm listening to a song or early in the morning   ♫

730
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,080

731
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,600

732
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,480

733
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,710
♫   It increases, like the time when I first met you   ♫

734
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:12,290
♫   You are my sunshine ribbon in the sky   ♫

735
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:17,330
♫   Your bright smile is above the clouds in the sky   ♫

736
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:23,660

737
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:29,640
♫   More than any other moment, I'm so happy right now   ♫

738
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,100
♫   With you   ♫

739
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,960
Hey, are you leaving already?

740
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,160
What? Yes.

741
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,870
Don't you need to get ready for your store?

742
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,130
I still have some time.

743
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,900
But why are you putting on so much makeup today?

744
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,250
What are you saying? I always do this much.

745
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,240
By the way, you have a lot of cute clothes.

746
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,610
Did you fall for them as well?

747
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,810
- What? 
 - I'm asking,

748
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:18,450
did you fall for LUNA after watching the home concert yesterday?

749
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,360
Right, yes.

750
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,350
Then you should've told me!

751
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,230
What kind of style do you want?

752
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,480
No, it's okay. I don't need to do that.

753
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,590
Today, let's go for the "lovely" concept.

754
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,010
What happened to my face? It's pathetically funny.

755
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,650
Put these in here.

756
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,090
It all got in there!

757
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,210
I forgot to put oil in it!

758
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,230
Is this enough?

759
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,190
I think this is the way to do it.

760
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,630
Ketchup.

761
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,900
What am I doing?

762
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,720
Yoon Tae In! What are you doing?

763
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,730
Don't touch it. It's not done yet. Wait.

764
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,690
Oh, my stomach! My goodness!

765
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,330
Just looking at it makes my stomach hurt.

766
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,040
Are you going to give this to a person you hate?

767
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,950
That's not me, is it?

768
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:54,050
I'm just going to eat some salad.

769
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,610
What is it?

770
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,380
So, who is your favorite?

771
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,450
Hey, it's not like that.

772
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:34,180
It's not possible for you to not have a favorite. A person's mind can't be evenly distributed.

773
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:39,280
Tell me who made you dress up like this from the morning.

774
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,800
No, it's not like that!

775
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,820
It's not like what you think.

776
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,610
What do you mean by that?

777
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,610
Wait, I'm getting a phone call.

778
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,490

779
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:50,670
I-I-Is this the real Seo Woo Yeon? Our Woo Yeon?

780
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,620
Hey, you should be quiet.

781
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,270
Yes, Woo Yeon.

782
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,190
  Doctor, you haven't left the hotel yet, have you?

783
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,530
Yes, I'm about to head out.

784
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,540
Then, get ready and come out. I'm in front of the hotel.

785
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,670
I'm sorry? Where are you at?

786
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,990
I'm at the main entrance of the Hyatt hotel.

787
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,530
I'm waiting here parked.

788
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,380
Oh, really? You don't have to do that.

789
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,710
Why don't we meet at the members' house?

790
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,890
I have somewhere to go with you.

791
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,580
I think it'll take some time for me to go down.

792
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,430
It's okay. Take your time.

793
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:37,080
  I'm worried that you might wait a long time. What to do!

794
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,100
Doctor Kang Sun Joo!

795
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,190
  Then I'll come down right now.

796
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,120
  Just wait a bit, please.

797
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,500

798
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,160
- What should I do! 
 - Run!

799
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,320
I'll call you later!

800
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,670
What should I do!

801
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:37,030

802
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:42,950
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

803
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,650

804
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:50,180
♫  Feel so cold, so cold, it feels so cold, so cold  ♫

805
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:56,250
♫  The reason why everything has stopped  ♫

806
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,430
♫  You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you're gone  ♫

807
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,820
  I saw you before.

808
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,420
  Where?

809
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:06,580
  Who is she?

810
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,480
  This is our company's artist, Nina.

811
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,850
  Let's go to the beach. It'll be helpful to prepare our next album.

812
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:15,780
  Your eyes are beaming lasers out.

813
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:18,890
  Those two look good together. Don't you think so?

814
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:22,230
  - Are you still dating that kind of woman? 
 - That kind of woman?

815
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,130
  How long do you think you can work as LUNA?

816
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:28,430
  Even if you leave, there would be no problem anymore!

817
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,060
  You have feelings for that person, don't you?

818
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,740
  Why would I like that woman?

819
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,410
  It's weirdly bothering me.

820
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:38,210
♫  Like your words full of contradictions  ♫

821
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:43,880

822
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:48,230
