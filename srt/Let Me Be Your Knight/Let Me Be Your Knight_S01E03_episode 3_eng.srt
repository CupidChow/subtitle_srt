1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,540
   

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,840
   

3
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,750
I'm going nuts!

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,830
Yoon Tae In... Wake up!

5
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,740
Yoon Tae In. Yoon Tae–

6
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,960
 What is this? It is strange. 

7
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,140
- Uh... Nuts! 
   - What happened? 

8
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,840
Is he sleeping after this major incident?

9
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,060
Relax! Calm down.

10
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,390
This is an accident. An accident.

11
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,390
Still this isn't right!

12
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,120
No... Anyway, Yoon Tae In won't remember it

13
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,990
and no one saw it, right?

14
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,560
Hey, Doctor!

15
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,370
Did you see it?

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,770
No... Not at all.

17
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,320
Shall I help you?

18
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,240
Can you please?

19
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,430
Shall we leave now?

20
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,580
You're leaving him here?

21
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,230
We should at least send him to his room.

22
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,370
Tae In doesn't like it when other people enter his room.

23
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,330
Also...

24
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,340
I think if you leave him there, he'll figure it out on his own.

25
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,020
But still! What if he starts sleepwalking again?

26
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,330
He'll be okay considering how well he is sleeping.

27
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,230
Tell me about it... He's sleeping a bit too well.

28
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,960
 This is crazy! 

29
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,850
 This crazy– 

30
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,300
This crazy?

31
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,140
Does she think I would've liked it? Why did it happen with that woman!

32
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,500
Why do I keep thinking about it?

33
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,550
I just bumped lips with bratty Yoon Tae In.

34
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,850
What's the big deal?

35
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,370
But perhaps he won't remember it, right?!

36
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,070
Not at all... I was asleep no matter what.

37
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,290
Yeah, he isn't supposed to remember anything

38
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,410
during his sleepwalking.

39
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,760
But it's annoying.

40
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,710
No way she'll threaten me to take responsibility, right?

41
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,630
Why do I keep getting involved with that woman? It's so annoying!

42
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,030
But maybe...

43
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,630
He's not going to do that every time he's sleepwalking, is he?

44
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,340
- This was an accident. 
 - An unexpected accident.

45
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,700
- Let's forget it. 
 - Just forget about it.

46
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,870
   

47
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,170
Good morning Yoon Tae In...

48
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,690
Good. It was natural, like usual.

49
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,520
He doesn't remember, right?

50
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,190
You woke up early?

51
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,000
I am trying to change my cycle.

52
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,580
Are you?

53
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,210
Did you sleep well, Doctor?

54
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,530
Yes. Good morning to you, Seo Woo Yeon.

55
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,550
Yoon Tae In, too.

56
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,830
Have some breakfast with us, Doctor.

57
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,360
Shall I get you some cereal?

58
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,990
Shall I do that?

59
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,740
Do you remember anything about last night?

60
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,230
No... not at all.

61
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,800
I think I fell asleep last night while writing a song.

62
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,590
You were sleeping in front of the front door last night.

63
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,630
I found that you were trying to get out of the house,

64
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,000
so I managed to stop you.

65
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,760
I don't know what you would have done without me.

66
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,610
Me? I did that?

67
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,890
They kissed last night!

68
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,340
I fell asleep and didn't see the ending!

69
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,670
- Don't give spoilers.
- Don't give spoilers.

70
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,650
I really can't watch that!

71
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,580
I told you to stop talking. Be quiet!

72
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,820
You should've seen it!

73
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,800
Do you have some time now, Doctor?

74
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,150
There is something I need to give you.

75
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,140
     

76
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,770
   -   

77
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,730
Why... did you call me here?

78
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,420
I put together a few things I thought you might need.

79
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,060
The last time I saw you,

80
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,820
I thought you might not be very comfortable in the tent at night.

81
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,720
Thank you. I will use it well.

82
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,060
Read the book when you're bored at night.

83
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,790
And this is for when you're hungry.

84
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,900
And this is when you're tired.

85
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,850
It's good for sleeping.

86
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,850
Thank you so much, Woo Yeon.

87
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,840
I will use it really well.

88
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,790
It must be uncomfortable for you to stay with all the guys here.

89
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,040
If you need anything, feel free to ask whenever.

90
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,570
As you can see, we have most everything here.

91
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,100
But... Why this?

92
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,860
Seo Woo Yeon, it has your name on it.

93
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,400
I wonder why it was there.

94
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,050
Anyway, thank you.

95
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,410
I'll really use well.

96
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,810
Yeah...

97
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,530
 Attention. 

98
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,550
Bow to each other.

99
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,430
- Start. 
 -  Let's go!

100
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,190
 Hey! 

101
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,910
   

102
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,950
   

103
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,470
Have you had lunch?

104
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,940
Which color clothes are you going to wear today?

105
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,210
I will match yours.

106
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,390
I want to see you soon.

107
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,650
- Hey, Shin! 
 - Let's talk later.

108
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,070
Let me borrow the green cardigan you bought last time.

109
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,290
Hyung, please knock on the door before coming inside.

110
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,140
- Where is the cardigan?
- You can't.

111
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,190
- Why? 
 - I'm going to wear it today.

112
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,400
- Let me borrow it. 
 - Go now.

113
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,730
  - It's my honor to meet you. 
 - Hello.  

114
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,720
Come in.

115
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,950
What's this about?

116
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,900
There's going to be the green concert this year also, right? 
    

117
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,290
Is it already that time of the season?

118
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,640
Can't we skip it this year?

119
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,380
Why? They've been doing it annually since their debut.

120
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,710
He had an issue recently, so if we don't participate in this, wouldn't people say more about him?

121
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,890
Is Yoon tae In's condition still not better?

122
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,210
The thing is... Tae In...

123
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,770
Nothing, I will think about it.

124
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,840
- Go out and do your work. 
 - Yes.

125
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,970
  Hello, I'm Pianist Yoon Ji Han.  

126
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,390
  It's my honor to be invited here today.  

127
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,160
  Excuse my words, but to the younger generation,  

128
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,340
  you're more famous as Luna's Yoon Tae In's father than Pianist Yoon Ji Han.  

129
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,600
  That's what I've heard as well.  

130
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,220
  Recently, Luna released a new album.  

131
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,640
Have you heard it?

132
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,090
I have been busy preparing for a concert,

133
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,570
so I haven't had the time yet.

134
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,760
By any chance, does Yoon Tae In ask for your advice

135
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,220
when he is working on an album?

136
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,170
Well...

137
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,470
  Am I going to get interviewed like parent counseling  

138
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,920
  all day today?  

139
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,150
Why is he coming back to Korea at this time?

140
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,400
     

141
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,860
     

142
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,540
So much going on each day!

143
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,720
     

144
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,880
- Yes, CEO?  
   - Ah,  

145
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,510
how is Tae In doing?

146
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,110
Is there any improvement?

147
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,270
I'm not sure.

148
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,800
It's not something that can be resolved in a day.

149
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,210
Also, it's not a disease where you can see the difference with your eyes.

150
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,830
 Okay, I got it. 

151
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,850
But why did you– ?

152
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,530
The thing is, there is a Green concert coming up.

153
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,120
He also has to work on the next album.

154
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,920
I was curious about Tae In's condition.

155
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
I see.

156
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,700
If you don't mind,

157
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,530
can I watch while Tae In is receiving treatment?

158
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,520
It's not like I don't trust you

159
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,530
or that I think of you as incapable.

160
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,740
It's just that I want to confirm if Tae In

161
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,940
is cooperating with the treatment or not.

162
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,780
I'm very curious.

163
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,550
So I request this of you.

164
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,430
Yes, I understand.

165
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,040
  Yoon Tae In.   Yoon Tae In.

166
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,280
Yoon Tae In!

167
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,300
Yoon Tae In!

168
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,080
Shall we talk about the future together?

169
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,230
Future?

170
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,250
Did she figure out that I was awake that time?

171
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,020
My goodness...

172
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,440
What is it? Something to say?

173
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,960
You remember, right?

174
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,360
What? What do I remember?

175
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,050
I have nothing to remember.

176
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,260
So this is how you're going to be.

177
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,790
After what you did, shouldn't you remember it?

178
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,800
That... How much...

179
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,850
Take responsibility.

180
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,090
Responsibility?

181
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,400
You are asking me to take responsibility of you for just a trifling matter?

182
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,270
It's not like we are in the Joseon Era.

183
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,790
     

184
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,920
     

185
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,240
We agreed to trick CEO Moon at least.

186
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,520
Take responsibility.

187
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,400
As I told you before,

188
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,680
we'll build up small accomplishments.

189
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,730
It could be just a fun activity,

190
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,550
but it would be even better

191
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,580
if it can be a new window of opportunity to make you energetic.

192
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,640
Am I 7 years old?

193
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,900
Why would I do such a thing?

194
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,710
The CEO is watching us.

195
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,690
So what do I have to do?

196
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,900
Haven't you heard about something like this?

197
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,730
It's called the beauty of simple labor.

198
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,650
I have never heard of it before.

199
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,380
Doing a repetitive activity

200
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,230
helps you forget about unnecessary thoughts

201
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,220
and gives you joy that's only coming from the simple labor.

202
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,410
For example, sewing, knitting, putting eyes on dolls,

203
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,040
and making envelopes.

204
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,160
You can do that by yourself.

205
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,060
Let's work together, please.

206
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,630
At least until the CEO leaves.

207
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,690
Shall we get started?

208
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,470
     

209
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,870
How will Tae In do the Green concert?

210
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,380
"Why are you uselessly asking that obvious question?"

211
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
That's what he said to me.

212
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,640
I don't know if it's useless or not,

213
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,660
but does that help to get him treated?

214
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,990
I looked it up, and that's very trendy these days for relieving stress.

215
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,170
Is that so?

216
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,890
At least he hasn't caused any accidents since then.

217
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,690
Right?

218
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,190
He said, "I hate it. I hate it."

219
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,660
Still,

220
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,290
he is doing it properly.

221
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,120
I know, right? At first, he was totally against it.

222
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,650
The doctor must be really good.

223
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,990
Tae In is quite obedient.

224
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,840
Obedient?

225
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,120
Why? Are you worried about a scandal?

226
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,770
I guess so!

227
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,640
You never know how the relationship between a man and a woman will turn out.

228
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,510
I'd actually be worry-free if he would date!

229
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,370
Does Tae In ever like anyone?

230
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,720
Why? He has dated a few times and there have been scandals, too.

231
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,070
Do you count that as relationships?

232
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,020
Is that considered "some" flirting then?

233
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,320
Not "some".

234
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,830
It's just an "seom" (island). 
 (TN: The words 'Flirting' and 'Island' sound similar in Korean. 

235
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,840
It's like a lonely island in the middle of the vast ocean.

236
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,990
The hometown of the birds, you know.

237
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,290
By the way...

238
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,840
Can I ask you a question?

239
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,180
What is something that you like the most, Yoon Tae In?

240
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,090
Other than music?

241
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,920
Then, what about something you hate the most?

242
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,220
This situation right now.

243
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,160
What about a hobby? Don't you have a hobby?

244
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,320
What about your favorite place or a favorite movie?

245
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,090
Didn't you say you'd only ask one question?

246
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,810
You didn't even answer it properly.

247
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,840
Was the place you were at yesterday your favorite place?

248
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,560
Is it a place like a little sanctuary?

249
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,310
Then, what is something that gives you the hardest time these days?

250
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,820
I think you're crossing the line.

251
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,580
I know I am,

252
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,410
but you're having trouble sleeping these days.

253
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,570
You looked tired yesterday as well.

254
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,270
There is nothing like that.

255
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,780
I think trauma or stress is the modern medical's limit.

256
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,520
Come on.

257
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,150
You can tell me.

258
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm good at keeping secrets.

259
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,240
Isn't the CEO gone yet?

260
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,720
No, he is still watching us

261
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,860
And this

262
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,780
is really good when you're stressed out.

263
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,360
So finish it up. Continue doing it.

264
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,230
It's all gone. I'll give you more

265
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,940
Here, I'll open this one for you.

266
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,380
Until when do I have to do this?

267
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,400
Oh, no!

268
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,620
Do you know what you just did?

269
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm sorry. I didn't do it intentionally.

270
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,670
I'll put it back on for you!

271
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,020
Leave it

272
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,380
How can you be so senseless!

273
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,890
I am really sorry about spilling these,

274
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,540
but I just sneezed once, and you're calling me senseless?

275
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,980
Whoever sneezes in front of you is becoming a senseless person?

276
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,560
Achoo! Achoo! Senseless! Senseless!

277
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,050
What kind of senseless person are you!

278
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,090
That's not what I mean...

279
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,090
Forget it!

280
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,440
It's useless for me to explain.

281
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,540
It's ridiculous!

282
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,660
Seriously!

283
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,880
Hello!

284
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,050
Hello! 
      

285
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,200
Hello!

286
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,140
Hello!

287
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,620
Please bring these in there.

288
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,270
-

289
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,780
Hello, Sunbaenim.

290
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,440
You're here, Yoo Chan.

291
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,500
Yes, I am.

292
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,000
Hello.

293
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,960
You're here.

294
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,790
I'm sorry that I suddenly changed to a pre-recording.

295
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,410
Don't say that.

296
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,770
In the week, the day when I see you is my favorite day.

297
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,700
This is from my heart.

298
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,120
I like your spirit.

299
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,740
Thank you. I will drink it well.

300
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,660
Please take care of me today.

301
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,910
 Only 2 cups of coffee a day. You promised. 

302
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,560
 I know you've already had 2 cups today. 

303
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,920
Sorry for changing the script all of a sudden.

304
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,560
You guys are wearing a couple look today.

305
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,400
Oh, that's right. Do you also like green, Sunbaenim?

306
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,250
Yes.

307
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,130
What's going on?

308
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,850
I should wear something green as well next time.

309
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,870
     

310
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,830
What now?

311
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,300
How can you say, "What now?" to your mom?

312
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,350
What's going on?

313
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,350
Call the credit card company now and ask them to extend the limit.

314
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,390
  That's why I told you to make the limit high in the first place!  

315
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,440
  Why do I have to do this every time?  

316
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,630
 Where are you right now? 

317
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,180
Will you come here? I am at a store in Cheongdam.

318
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,800
  Hey! Can you show me this in size 240?  

319
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Hm, you're here.

320
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,970
Did you already use all of the money that I sent you last month?

321
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,590
I went to a breakfast gathering, and everybody was only talking about Tae In.

322
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,200
How is Tae In doing? Will he be able to work well on the next album?

323
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,050
Since when were you so interested in Tae In?

324
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,580
Tae In has to be okay

325
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,980
for you guys to go back on schedule.

326
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,770
I will take care of it, so don't worry.

327
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,010
Okay.

328
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,020
Please pay for me.

329
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,810
Isn't he Luna?

330
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,510
Excuse me... you're from Luna, right?

331
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,730
Yes, that's right.

332
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,090
It's him!

333
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,150
Can we take a picture with you?

334
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,870
I am a huge fan of Luna.

335
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,060
Sure, why not! Come closer.

336
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,560
It's amazing!

337
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,480
1, 2, 3...

338
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,880
 We saw him by the luxury store. He must really like luxury brands. 

339
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,720
  Look at how great his skin is!  

340
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,460
  If I'm also shopping for luxury brands every day and hanging out all the time, I can also have great skin.  

341
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,260
 Is he in Luna? I don't know anyone but Yoon Tae In from Luna. 

342
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,310
♫  Baby, I'm ready  ♫

343
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,270
♫  It's my turn next time.  ♫

344
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,980
Aigoo!

345
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,390
♫  Bring it back, it's the time she won't have me.  ♫

346
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,070
Turn down the volume.

347
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,220
♫  Feel the dream. Let's make that  ♫

348
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,880
♫  Let everything go and have fun  ♫

349
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,380
Turn down the volume!

350
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,360
♫  I won't do it if it's not fun. But I will for good money  ♫

351
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,630
♫  It's fun making lyrics for money  ♫

352
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,900
♫  I'll make money with music  ♫

353
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,910
Woo Ga On!

354
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,750
What?

355
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,520
Are you living alone here? Turn down the volume!

356
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,760
Are you kidding me? You always listen to music!

357
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,440
What? *You*? 
 (TN: "You" is said in informal rude way) 

358
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,130
♫  Something prettier than this  ♫

359
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,400
Are you crazy?

360
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,000
So you want to fight?

361
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,800
Come here.

362
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,060
Come here.

363
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Wait a minute.

364
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,680
Okay!

365
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
I give up!

366
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,660
I give up!

367
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,020
   

368
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,010
The night sky is beautiful.

369
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,850
I know, right?

370
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,780
I got to see you during the day and now during the night.

371
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,010
I like it since I saw you twice today.

372
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,400
I still wish to see you anytime in the daytime.

373
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,560
Why? I like to meet you at night.

374
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,120
But I can't see your face well.

375
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,500
In Europe, there are countries where it's sunny in the middle of the night in the summer.

376
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,320
There are?

377
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,550
Let's see.

378
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,550
The earliest airplane to...

379
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,220
I am just kidding. I like it now.

380
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,830
Do you want to listen to some music?

381
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,670
♫   The sound of the wind passing by   ♫

382
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,550
♫   The doodles that I drew   ♫

383
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,460
♫   The days pass by again and again   ♫

384
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,690
♫   It only left as memories   ♫

385
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,370
♫   I'm dreaming   ♫

386
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,460
♫   I'm dreaming   ♫

387
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:39,400
♫   The name fades, the memories blur   ♫

388
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,590
♫   I wish everything stopped as it is right now   ♫

389
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,210
You crazy Yoon Tae In.

390
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,610
Have you lost it?

391
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,340
Were you just thinking about her?

392
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,020
    

393
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,590
Oh my, that scared me.

394
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,440
Ah.

395
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,560
I am going crazy

396
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,020
- You haven't slept yet, Woo Yeon?

397
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,880
No, I couldn't sleep.

398
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,230
Are you in the tent today as well, Doctor?

399
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,680
I just came down for a change.

400
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,630
Would you like to drink with me?

401
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:22,170
Just one can?

402
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,280
Beer at night is the best indeed.

403
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,430
It helps in calming you down.

404
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,010
You must be having a hard time with Tae In.

405
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,580
Yes.

406
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,380
I know I shouldn't say this, but sometimes he irks me.

407
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,560
You can talk to me at those times.

408
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,950
I am a good listener.

409
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,310
I will do it.

410
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,250
By the way, who do you talk to when something bothers you?

411
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,980
Me?

412
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,150
I...

413
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,010
You can also talk to me.

414
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,030
I am a good listener, too.

415
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,300
Sure.

416
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,770
Tae In is not a bad guy.

417
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,660
He is going through hard times right now.

418
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,710
It must be.

419
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,950
I finished it all already.

420
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,950
Shall I get one more can?

421
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,550
Just one more?

422
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,360
Okay.

423
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,640
 Seo Woo Yeon is definitely on my side. 

424
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,130
  Should I dig about Yoon Tae In?  

425
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,920
  But only being helped by Seo Woo Yeon is not enough.  

426
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:27,290
Where did you go this late at night, even climbing up a wall?

427
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,230
Walking. I went out for a night walk.

428
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,710
Alone?

429
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,050
Yeah, alone.

430
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,840
What's the lipstick mark then?

431
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,540
Damn, I got caught.

432
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,840
 I can totally use this to my advantage! 

433
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,790
Is it gone?

434
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,340
Yep.

435
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,790
Wait a minute. I am not done with what I wanted to say.

436
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,570
Wouldn't this be a top news in Star Patch with crazy viewing rate?

437
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,660
You will keep my secret, though?

438
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,060
Why would I?

439
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,750
Because you have a secret to hide as well.

440
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,530
I don't have anything like that.

441
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,990
Yes, you do.

442
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,910
No, I don't.

443
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,940
I saw it... you kissing Tae In Hyung!

444
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,280
When did I kiss...

445
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,910
So, let's protect each other's secret.

446
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,000
Okay?

447
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,530
When did you get here?

448
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,980
I didn't see you coming out.

449
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,440
Just now.

450
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,020
Right, Doctor?

451
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,870
Yes, it looked like he came from the gym.

452
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,970
Oh, did he? Why didn't I see him?

453
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,240
That's really weird.

454
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,310
Do you want a can, too?

455
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,380
I would love one.

456
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:10,780
I guess it's because Shin walks quietly like a cat.

457
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,130
Good night, then.

458
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,120
Hyung...

459
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,750
Usually, people like you more. You know that, right?

460
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,600
All of a sudden?

461
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,080
But Tae In Hyung is a good fighter.

462
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,600
He always takes everything away when it's a critical moment.

463
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,290
It's not like that.

464
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,610
I will support whatever you want.

465
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,420
My goodness...

466
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,800
Is he still working this late?

467
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,840
I'm going to die at this rate!

468
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,160
What am I supposed to do tomorrow?

469
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,730
You fraud!

470
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,560
What kind of a schedule is this?

471
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,530
This is a schedule for me.

472
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:03,410
Also, you need to send the CEO your picture at the top as an evidence.

473
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,010
How dare you make me wear these things!

474
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,020
It's a great camouflage suit, so you better wear the whole thing!

475
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,360
But why are you taking so long?

476
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,460
It looks great on you!

477
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,680
Nobody will recognize you even if I shouted 'Yoon Tae In is here!'

478
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,150
This looks good on you. How can you look good in this outfit?

479
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,420
What can I...

480
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,770
not be able to pull it off?

481
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,030
I will pick you up later.

482
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,910
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

483
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,110
Good luck!

484
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,030
Really?

485
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,770
Wait for me!

486
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,020
Is there no individuality or preference here?

487
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,100
That's why I told you it's a great camouflage suit!

488
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,050
Don't argue. Quickly, follow me.

489
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,080
Come quickly!

490
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:33,170
♫   When I'm looking at you, even if I wasn't feeling good   ♫

491
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,790
♫   I start smiling without knowing it   ♫

492
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,430
♫   The day without you feels empty   ♫

493
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:48,480
♫   Everything of you becomes my everything   ♫

494
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:56,530
Here.

495
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,540
It's not a big deal. Grab my hand.

496
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,840
Just think of it as a handle for support.

497
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,750
Think of it as a stepping stone.

498
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:11,230
♫   I just grumble for no reason   ♫

499
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:16,690
Why is he so stubborn?

500
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:22,610
♫   I'm happiest right now, more than ever   ♫

501
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,930
Here.

502
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,620
So exhausting!

503
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,670
Now take this off... It must be suffocating.

504
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,420
But what if someone recognizes me?

505
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,420
Why are you so overly self-councious?

506
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,230
Excuse me.

507
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,720
Can you please take a picture for us?

508
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,590
- I will just take one picture.
- Sure.

509
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,980
- I can't take more than one picture. 
 - Sure.

510
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,260
Here we go...1, 2, 3...

511
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,420
One, two.

512
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,730
Excuse me, what are you doing?

513
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,230
Take a picture of us.

514
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,120
Yes, that's what I am doing.

515
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,760
Not here, but down there.

516
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,140
Take a pretty picture for us.

517
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,990
Make sure the view is in the picture.

518
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,350
Take a good picture, young man.

519
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,710
Hurry up and take a picture! What are you doing?

520
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,010
Take a good picture of us!

521
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,650
- I will take one now.
- Okay.

522
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,160
1, 2, 3...

523
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,100
Thank you.

524
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,210
- See if it came out well.
- Alright.

525
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,710
It came out nice!

526
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,920
You're good at taking pictures!

527
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,230
Thank you.

528
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,060
Goodbye.

529
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,260
See, I told you. There is no one around who would recognize you.

530
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,330
So relax and enjoy the freedom.

531
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,220
It's so nice!

532
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,770
Why don't you make hiking a hobby?

533
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,450
It's good for building up your strength and getting over the depression.

534
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,940
You look good on the cover, but you don't have any physical strength.

535
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,800
It's because I use different muscles in the gym, so it took some time to adjust.

536
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,400
And I don't have time for a hobby.

537
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,360
Why?

538
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:39,610
Is there something you are interested in other than writing songs all day long, Yoon Tae In?

539
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,680
That's what I have to do, and it's everything to me. So why do I need other things?

540
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,570
No matter what, you are stressed.

541
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:51,150
Having a hobby is nice when stressed.

542
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,320
I don't need one.

543
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,480
Sure, sure.

544
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,190
You are really incredible.

545
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,250
But how did you get started with music?

546
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,020
Are you trying to interrogate me?

547
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,500
How is this an interrogation? It is just a small talk

548
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,830
and this much you reveal in interviews, too.

549
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,160
You can just search for yourself of what I said before.

550
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,530
Can't you allow me to hear it from you live?

551
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,470
How did you get started with music?

552
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,550
Because someone liked it,

553
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,430
and told me I was good at it.

554
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:36,750
Who told you that?

555
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,120
There was someone like that.

556
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,830
Your first love, by any chance?

557
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:48,720
How can a psychiatrist see stuff from such a rudimentary perspective?

558
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,270
Okay... Just say no if it's not the case. Why are you taking so seriously?

559
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:02,110
I wish I too had someone who would tell me I did a good job.

560
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,390
This is it.

561
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,000
So refreshing!

562
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,980
Why do you climb up on the mountain when you're going to come down again?

563
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,590
Positive energy brings a good mentality!

564
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,450
Go ahead, drink it.

565
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,040
Hey, it's here!

566
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,690
There are so many!

567
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:44,050
He's really handsome!

568
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:44,990
Oh, Oppa!

569
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,070
Will you go to the Green Concert?

570
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,330
Obviously. It's our Jay oppa's concert.

571
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,270
I also got the tickets already.

572
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,410
Annoyingly, Luna will also be there. They are going to steal the finale again!

573
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,810
But Yoon Tae In is sick. Will he still perform?

574
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,700
Sick? It's just for show since the album flopped.

575
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,850
You know what? Yoon Tae In took other's music

576
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,590
and pretended to be a genius.

577
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,850
I heard from someone I know that Yoon Tae In is a total club rat.

578
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,580
It seems so, too.

579
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,730
Yes, Reporter Kim. What?

580
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,340
A member from High End got completely wasted and pooped on the street.

581
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,710
And he's too embarrassed, so they're going to dissolve the group?

582
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,910
That doesn't make any sense.

583
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:31,890
Okay, blow up that article, now.

584
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,790
How was my acting?

585
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,710
I am auditioning as a reporter today.

586
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,120
Ahjumma, you did it intentionally, didn't you?

587
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,230
How annoying! How dare you bring up High End?

588
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:54,230
I'm going to report you for spreading false information!

589
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,870
Did you say spreading false information?

590
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,700
You guys were just gossiping about Luna and Yoon Tae In.

591
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,610
You said everything based on facts, right?

592
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,320
Have you seen it for yourselves?

593
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:08,160
What? Are you their fan?

594
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,490
Yes, I am their fan.

595
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:36,340
Let's all be careful from now on for spreading false information. Okay?

596
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,770
We need to go now.

597
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,320
Okay.

598
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,550
Let's go.

599
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,380
What the heck was that?

600
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,820
My whole body aches!

601
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,850
You said you have a lot of extra energy.

602
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,580
You said you're too sensitive to sleep in the car.

603
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:40,050
This is why people have to move their bodies. You were snoring while sleeping!

604
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,680
- D... Did I snore? 
 - Yes.

605
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,250
This is the first time I am hearing that.

606
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,920
What's wrong with snoring? You have such a weird personality.

607
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,130
What does that mean?

608
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,370
I never snore.

609
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,430
Sure, sure.

610
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,620
It's been so long.

611
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,470
   

612
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,260
My gosh.

613
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,860
His dad is so famous.

614
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,800
Interesting...

615
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,410
You pathetic bastard.

616
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:52,520
Why don't you answer my call?

617
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:55,980
What's going on?

618
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,130
You... are you weak?

619
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,120
You fainted at the performance

620
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,780
and you ran around on the street like a crazy guy!

621
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,650
What are you trying confirm?

622
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,240
Have you lost it because an album failed, and be the subject of a gossip?

623
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,030
If I allowed you to make that silly music,

624
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,430
then you at least shouldn't have ruined my reputation.

625
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:25,980
Have you even once listened to my music properly?

626
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,680
I am not interested in failed music.

627
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,870
 Again! 

628
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,020
  You missed the rhythm. Start it from the beginning again.  

629
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,540
 Again! 

630
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,670
  Play it smoothly without breaking the rhythm!  

631
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,640
 Start again. 

632
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,020
 Again, again, again! 

633
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,140
Don't ever become the talk of the town for something disgraceful.

634
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,890
If you don't have confidence to be perfect, then you'd better quit now!

635
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,000
What a pathetic brat!

636
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,940
You came back after many years,

637
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,150
and yet you don't have anything else to say but to criticize?

638
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,700
What?

639
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,190
Why is his dad is talking so harshly?

640
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,820
Did something happen between them?

641
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,980
Hyung... I saw Tae In's dad today.

642
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,020
Tae In's dad?

643
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,640
He came here?

644
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,670
I had never met him before, so I thought Yoon Tae In was lying to me.

645
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:49,620
I wish I had come earlier and asked him for his signature.

646
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,050
Today's practice will be chilling.

647
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:55,810
Why? Why, why, why?

648
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,940
As you all know, the Green concert is coming up. Let's practice twice as long starting today.

649
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,140
No complaints, right?

650
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:35,580
♫   After you leave, my time seems like a day without a sun   ♫

651
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:44,800
♫   A shallow of darkness is full of silence, it's swallowing me up   ♫

652
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,680
♫   Yeah  ♫

653
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,840
♫  Don't know what it is, l still don't understand  ♫

654
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,580
♫  What you told me  ♫

655
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:01,010
♫  Why is this for us? This nightmare-like night  ♫

656
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:05,810
♫  One more time, can you explain me?  ♫

657
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:33,620
 "I don't listen to failed music." 

658
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,680
  "Don't ever get yourself on to other people's mouths in disgrace."  

659
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,240
 If you don't have confidence to be perfect, then you'd better quit now! 

660
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,280
  What a pathetic brat!  

661
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,210
Yoon Tae In!

662
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,670
What!

663
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,740
You are bleeding.

664
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,020
You got hurt, punk!

665
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,580
Tae In Hyung.

666
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:02,940
Why is he so sensitive?

667
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,830
Is this the end of today's practice?

668
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,720
Let's stop it here today.

669
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,620
You guys worked hard.

670
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,370
Yoon Tae In.

671
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,960
Mr. Yoon Tae In, your hand!

672
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,210
How did this happen? Did you get hurt?

673
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,510
- It must hurt 
 - Why do you keep crossing the line?

674
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,160
No, that's not it.

675
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,180
Wait a minute. I will get the first aid kit.

676
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,660
Can't you understand what I say!

677
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,080
You just have to use up your time here and then get out of my sight.

678
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,800
What is he doing? It's so loud.

679
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,500
Yoon Tae In.

680
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,160
Is something wrong?

681
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:40,760
What is he doing inside to make such a sound?

682
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:44,580
Yoon Tae In...

683
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:48,450
I have told you mind your own business. How dare you enter my room!

684
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:50,800
Get out right now! Get out of this house now!

685
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,810
Get out!

686
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:58,850
That's right. Let me not bother.

687
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,780
What if it's nothing and he gets all mad?

688
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,990
He'll throw a fit about crossing line and no touching.

689
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,150
But what if he is really in some big trouble in there?

690
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,820
Yoon Tae In...

691
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:31,100
I'm coming in, Yoon Tae In.

692
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,490
This is crazy.

693
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,430
What are you doing.

694
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,810
No.

695
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,690
No.

696
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,810
What is he saying 'no' to?

697
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,580
No.

698
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:04,110
Yoon Tae In...Yoon Tae In?

699
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:13,770
Yoon Tae In... Can you hear me?

700
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,660
Yoon Tae In?

701
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:22,650
Yoon Tae In, wait a minute.

702
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,620
Yoon Tae In.

703
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,220
Let me go, please.

704
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,700
Yoon Tae In... wake up, get a grip.

705
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,820
Yoon Tae In.

706
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,010
Yoon Tae In. Please!

Where did he go?

715
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,000
  About Tae In disappearing,  

716
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,830
  don't ever say that to anybody else.  

717
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,650
  I think being an idol is not an easy thing to do.   

718
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,330
  Tae In isn't like before.  

719
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:31,650
He said he heard the rhythm.

720
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:34,040
 We are just close friends as sunbea and hoobae. 

721
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,400
  I can't afford a relationship.  

722
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,180
 Hey! Get a grip! 

723
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,900
 Can you help me, please? 

724
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,740
  Without hitting the opponent, attack them by twisting and pressing them down.

  She's in her late twenties,
