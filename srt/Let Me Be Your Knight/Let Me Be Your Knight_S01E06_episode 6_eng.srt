1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,280

2
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,650

3
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,800

4
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,010
Ga On, I'll drop you off in front of the company.

5
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,910
The CEO wants to talk to you.

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,120
Sure.

7
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,570
You...

8
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,420
Were you not feeling well?

9
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,510
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,430
Why are you sorry to me?

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,010
Shouldn't you apologize to the fans and what's his face?

12
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,800
Was it... No Sang Hoon?

13
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,820
Okay.

14
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,540
Let's upload your handwritten apology letter

15
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,330
to the fans

16
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,790
and to Blue Moon members.

17
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,950
I'm not going to write it.

18
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,220
Excuse me?

19
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,790
Even though I'm sorry to the fans,

20
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,240
I'm not sorry to No Sang Hoon.

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,760
Hey, will you be able to apologize only to the fans and omit No Sang Hoon's name?

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,840
Look at the internet comments. They feel so sorry for No Sang Hoon.

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,540
You're putting CEO Jang's new band in the limelight by creating noise marketing.

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,090
That annoying CEO Jang!

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,130
He infuriates me so much!

26
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,260
I'll do anything but that.

27
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,490
I won't apologize to him.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,810
Ga On...

29
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,670
What's going on?

30
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,470
I heard you went to the same high school as No Sang Hoon.

31
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,160
Did something happen with him?

32
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,140
Ga On.

33
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,310
People are bashing LUNA as a whole because of this.

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,150
You should apologize for the sake of the band.

35
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,210
Then...

36
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,200
I'll quit LUNA.

37
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
- What did you just say? 
 - If I'm not in LUNA,

38
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,500
no one will criticize LUNA.

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,340
- What, you punk?

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,430
Ga On... Hey, Ga On!

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,740
Hey, Woo Ga On!

42
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,440
What did the CEO say? Hm? What did he say?

43
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,460
I have a livestream later.  Do you want to say something there?

44
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,780
Just tell them you were really sick today.

45
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,960
I'll testify on your behalf. What do you think?

46
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,650
Do it by yourself.

47
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,440
So, you won't do anything after creating this mess?

48
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,900
Later,

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,100
talk to Mr. Moon.

50
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,870
What's going on? Just tell me now. Why did you do that?

51
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,140
Hey, Woo Ga On!

52
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,130
Woo Ga On...

53
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,800
Why are you packing?

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,750
I'm leaving.

55
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,640
This is mine.  Why would you take it? No.

56
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,200
I got that limited edition in Milan. Why would you take it? You can't.

57
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,710
I told you you can't.

58
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,750
Woo Ga On!

59
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,490
Hey, Woo Ga On!

60
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,920
Are you really leaving?

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,850
What are you doing now?

62
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,920
What's going on?

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,340
Yoon Tae In, today he...

64
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,610
I am leaving LUNA.

65
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,270
What do you think you are doing now?

66
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,390
I just said I am leaving LUNA.

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,230
I already talked to the CEO about it.

68
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,670
Woo Ga On.

69
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,960
Ga On.

70
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,690
Have a seat. Let's take our time and talk this over.

71
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,550
Did something happen?

72
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,040
Well, it did,

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,090
but it is not big enough to leave LUNA. Don't overreact, Woo Ga On.

74
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,560
Tell me...

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,620
why you are doing this.

76
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,410
I just...

77
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,830
don't want to be in LUNA anymore.

78
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,860
Is that the truth?

79
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,580
Yes.

80
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,740
Go, then...

81
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,430
- Hey, Yoon Tae In! 
 -Tae In!

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,190
Where are you going?

83
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,700
If he doesn't want to, then let him go.

84
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,400
Yoon Tae In, seriously!

85
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,660
I'll go...

86
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,820
I can go after him.

87
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,010
Ga On...

88
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,340
Ga On!

89
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,630
What happened?

90
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,320
I know you didn't mean that just now.

91
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,140
I'm sure Mr. Yoon didn't mean it, either.

92
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,790
You know his temper.

93
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,730
He is doing it because of his pride...

94
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,280
Let's go back in for now.

95
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,300
If you feel embarrassed to go right back in,

96
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,400
we can take a walk together and then go back in.

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,490
Dr. Kang,

98
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,780
I want to ask you for two favors.

99
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,120
Please take care of Marimo.

100
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,230
And please...

101
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,720
Help Tae In heal.

102
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,850
Wait... Ga On!

103
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,730

104
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,870
This isn't like him at all.

105
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,500
Mr. Moon called a lot.

106
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,150
Hyung, you were with him all day.

107
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,770
Was something off?

108
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,200
How would I know? I'm the one who is most impacted. Why are you cornering me?

109
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,870
You can all stop it now.

110
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,730
He left on his own.

111
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,220
There are over a thousand people who would love to join LUNA right at this moment.

112
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,080
We don't need someone who hates it and left.

113
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,020
Yoon Tae In!

114
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,550
How could you say that?

115
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,450
Can those thousand people replace Ga On?

116
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,020
This is about our band.

117
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,030
It's none of your business.

118
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,910
I get it! I should mind my own business.

119
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,890
But in this case, I can't.

120
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,370
Even in a regular company, when an employee hands in his notice,

121
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,400
the manager doesn't accept it immediately.

122
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,590
What's going on?

123
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,390
Would you reconsider? At least they pretend to care about them leaving.

124
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,400
Are you the only member of LUNA?

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,940
Do you make all the decisions?

126
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,550
- Are you the only important person here? 
 - Dr. Kang...

127
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,360
Please stop. You aren't feeling well.

128
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,520
He said he didn't want it.

129
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,230
If he's bad at something, he can practice. If he makes a mistake, he can fix it.

130
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,860
I can't make him want to be here.

131
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,260
You seem sad today.

132
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,730
 They say we should enjoy what we can't circumvent.

133
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,090
 What happens when you can't enjoy it?

134
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,540
 What do you do in those circumstances?

135
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,170
 These days people say it the opposite way.

136
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,110
 What you can't enjoy,

137
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,450
 steer clear of.

138
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,920
 Sometimes, avoiding it is the appropriate answer.

139
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
 Thank you.

140
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,500
No way...

141
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,050
Did he quit because of what I said?

142
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,560
 I just...

143
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,780
 don't want to be in LUNA anymore.

144
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,050
 Is that the truth?

145
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,260
 Yes.

146
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,540
Yoon Tae In, I am coming in for a bit.

147
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,350
Ga On didn't leave because he didn't want to do this anymore.

148
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,970
I think something did happen.

149
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,270
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

150
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,610
The thing is,

151
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,490
I think he came to me for advice yesterday.

152
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,950
I think he was trying to say something but couldn't finish it.

153
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,440
So let's find Ga On and talk about–

154
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,090
Stop it already!

155
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,620
You're here as my attending doctor, not his representative.

156
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,760
Okay...

157
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,560
Then as his representative, I'll say one last thing.

158
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,010
Why are you in a band?

159
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,960
If you wanted to be like this, you could've been a solo artist.

160
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,010
So everyone was here!

161
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,410
Mr. Moon is really upset!

162
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,190
He wants to find Ga On and ask him to come back no matter what,

163
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,930
but Ga On's not answering his phone calls

164
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,520
and Ga On's parents aren't answering, either.

165
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,950
So, I'm going to go to his house right now.

166
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,620
I'll go.

167
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,730
I'll persuade him and bring him back.

168
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,910
- I'll go, too! 
 - Me, too.

169
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,890
What exactly are you going to bring back?

170
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,150
What are you going to do forcefully dragging in someone who doesn't want to be here?

171
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,420
Aren't you worried?

172
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,460
Are you acting like this because you really think this is nothing?

173
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,020
Did you already forget when he said he didn't want to be a part of LUNA anymore yesterday?

174
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,860
You better not bring him back here.

175
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
Woo Yeon,

176
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,820
Where are you going?

177
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,690
Oh, Dr. Kang.

178
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,150
I am going to visit Ga On's home.

179
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,640
Really?

180
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,300
Can I come along?

181
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,600
No, you should rest.

182
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,720
You're still sick.

183
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,950
It's all right.

184
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,180
I'll go with you.

185
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,370
Honestly,

186
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,560
something's really bothering me.

187
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,450
What is it?

188
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,360
I had a talk with Ga On not long ago.

189
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,230
He asked me this then,

190
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,890
"When you can't avoid something, but you can't enjoy it as well, what do you do?"

191
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,890
So...

192
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,120
what did you tell him?

193
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,940
I told him if he can't enjoy something, avoid it.

194
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,030
I should have asked him what he was avoiding.

195
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,380
What if he's avoiding everything because of that?

196
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,790
Because I said something I shouldn't have.

197
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,170
No way.

198
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,670
He wouldn't have left just because you said that.

199
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,520
You know those times when you're not quite sure,

200
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,070
and you are right on the fence?

201
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,900
Ga On could have been on the fence,

202
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,470
but because of my one piece of advice,

203
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,720
what if Ga On was influenced to pick a side?

204
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,400
Even if that's true,

205
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,630
we are at a bigger fault for allowing that fence to exist in the first place.

206
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,040
So...

207
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,520
it's not your fault, Dr. Kang.

208
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,710
My husband and I just got back from vacation.

209
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,760
That's why we couldn't answer the phone.

210
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,540
Ga On sent us on vacation

211
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,980
as a gift for our wedding anniversary.

212
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,900
I see.

213
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,990
Thank you.

214
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,470
But...

215
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,270
why are you here, Woo Yeon?

216
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,760
I was just passing by

217
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,450
and thought of you, Mother,

218
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,450
so I stopped by.

219
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,910
Is that so?

220
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,860
I thought something happened and was worried.

221
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,420
But... who might you be?

222
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,690
I am the new manager.

223
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,430
Oh, really?

224
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,000
Please take good care of my Ga On.

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,770
Because he's shy,

226
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,410
he rarely opens up.

227
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,040
And even from a young age, if anything was wrong

228
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,750
he always tried to solve everything by himself.

229
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,710
Yes, don't worry about it.

230
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,940
I will take good care of him.

231
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,660
Thank you.

232
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,820
By the way,

233
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,230
since you guys look so good together,

234
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,840
I thought she was your girlfriend.

235
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,500
Please have some.

236
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,630
Where do you think Ga On went?

237
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,570
Judo.

238
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,890
When they try to push you, use their momentum against them.

239
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,680
Try again.

240
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,920
Excuse me.

241
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,580
Yes, what can I do for you?

242
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,550
You know Woo Ga On who attends here, right?

243
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,850
Yes, I do.

244
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,850
I am Seo Woo Yeon who works with him in LUNA.

245
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,980
By any chance, did he come here?

246
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,690
We haven't been able to reach Ga On.

247
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,940
Is Ga On

248
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,080
a minor

249
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,200
or has he been kidnapped?

250
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,100
- No, that's not it, but– 
 - What's our motto about respect?

251
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,560
It begins and ends with respect!

252
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,080
Ga On understands how to be respectful,

253
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,670
so he will go back when it's the right time.

254
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,300
All right?

255
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,470
Again. Let's continue.

256
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,920
The same scenario.

257
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,460
When he tries to push inside,

258
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,290
don't kick too low.

259
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,260
If you go too deep, it can be dangerous.

260
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,030
I'm sorry, I really thought he'd be here.

261
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,260
This is the right place.

262
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,770
Sorry?

263
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,070
Ga On's shoes

264
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,150
were on the Judo school's shoe rack.

265
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,190
They were his first gift from our fans with his name written on it, too.

266
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,380
Really?

267
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,990
Then we have to go catch him right away.

268
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,920
Dr. Kang,

269
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,600
since we know where he is

270
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,700
and that he is doing okay,

271
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,710
what about giving him some time to think?

272
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,340
That's true.

273
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,180
If we try to force him

274
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,480
he could really disappear.

275
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,400
But I wish I could see his face at least.

276
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,860
You don't think

277
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,880
he is unable to eat anything at all and starving himself, do you?

278
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,400
Slow down, you'll get indigestion.

279
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,780
Drink this, too.

280
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,740
Thank you so much, Master.

281
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,160
What are you talking about?

282
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,880
I bought this with your money.

283
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,230
Not that,

284
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,130
because you never asked me why I came here

285
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,910
or why I needed to hide.

286
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,840
I figured you came here to avoid those questions.

287
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,270
Sir...

288
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,270
Either cry or eat.

289
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,430
Do one or the other, not both.

290
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,200
Why didn't you bring him with you?

291
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,040
You should have dragged him here with a leash or something!

292
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,190
He knew we were there, but he still hid.

293
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,210
He even asked his instructor to lie for him.

294
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,480
To that extent?

295
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,940
For now, since we know where he is,

296
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,790
let's give him some time to think.

297
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,810
That might be for the best.

298
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,900
But,

299
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,260
where is Tae In?

300
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,440
You did this yesterday, too! Wait for me to answer after you knock!

301
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,590
What are you doing seriously?!

302
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,810
I had no idea you were... undressed.

303
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,340
I'm done.

304
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,250
Come in.

305
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,170
What is it?

306
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,750
I wanted to talk about Ga On.

307
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,160
You still insist on talking about him?

308
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,990
We found out

309
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,990
where he is.

310
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,130
I don't want to know.

311
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,010
I think you do.

312
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,390
♫  I need something, killing, healing, I have a feeling baby  ♫

313
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,640

314
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,270
♪  Love Paranoia, two  ♪

315
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,230
 We make a heart like this which keeps getting bigger.

316
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,050
 Would you like to try this with me?

317
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,860
 Like this. Like this and this way.

318
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,570
 Hello, we're Bluemoon. We'll do our best.

319
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,630
Tae In, my finger is not well so...

320
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,710
Yoon Tae In, are you okay?

321
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,310
Wake up!

322
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,810
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,560
I also fell asleep again.

324
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,480
I, I'm...

325
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,430
Tae In, wake up!

326
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,370
I'm not sleepwalking.

327
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,670
- Sorry? 
 - I'm wide awake now.

328
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,250
You scared me.

329
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,420
Then, what are you doing here at this hour?

330
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,840
The video just popped up because of an unknown algorithm.

331
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:05,310
You should go and stop him from leaving if you care for him this much.

332
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,600
He's at the Judo school.

333
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,370
Making others stay...

334
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,280
I don't know how to do that,

335
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,200
nor have I ever done anything like that.

336
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,520
Is it something you have to learn to do?

337
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,780
If you want to hold onto someone in your heart, then you can just use words to say it.

338
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,410
Just like you say that you are hungry when you are.

339
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,570
You always seem to only show your strong side,

340
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,300
so it's hard for you to express your honest feelings.

341
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:59,640
Maybe that's why Ga On likes you,

342
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,820
because he looks up to strong willpower.

343
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,170
But I doubt he wanted to see your strong side

344
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,840
when he said that he was leaving.

345
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,760
Don't talk nonsense and go in now.

346
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,840
Even when Ga On was leaving, he asked me to

347
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,460
make sure to treat and heal you.

348
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:39,430
I believe that that's the real strong willpower.

349
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,300
 It seems like it's some history between Ga On and No Sang Hoon in high school.

350
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,700
 There's a rumor that Ga On dropped out of school because of bullying.

351
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,750
 I called CEO Jang, but he keeps playing dumb.

352
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,710
 - What should I do? 
 - Hello!

353
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,360
- Hello, Sunbaenim.
- Hello.

354
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,030
I'm a huge fan of yours!

355
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,330
 He's so handsome.

356
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,340

357
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,490
One, two, three, four.

358
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,780
♫  Slowly start  ♫

359
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,490
Hello, sir.

360
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,420
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

361
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,640
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

362
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,900
Hello, sir!

363
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,890
But, what brings you here?

364
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,780
Can we talk outside for a moment?

365
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,110
I can't believe I'm talking to the Yoon Tae In from LUNA that I respect so much!

366
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,200
It's an honor, sir!

367
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,230
You should know this is not the time to exchange frivolous formalities.

368
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,810
Isn't it? Then what is it that you are here for?

369
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,310
What happened between you and Woo Ga On in high school?

370
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,210
I just wanted to forget all about it and make peace,

371
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,710
but it doesn't look like Ga On wants that, too.

372
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,010
So?

373
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,350
what happened?

374
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,210
Do you see this?

375
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,050
Ga On did this.

376
00:25:55,050 --> 00:26:01,430
Even so, I respect LUNA and want to be at peace with it.

377
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,100
I guess Ga On still doesn't like me.

378
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,000
You're way too generous for a victim.

379
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,030
I knew you wouldn't believe me

380
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,940
since Woo Ga On's image has become too good.

381
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,180
I would've been in big trouble if I didn't have this.

382
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,630
  - Die. 
 - Woah. Woo Ga.

383
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,340
 Ga On!

384
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,420
Hey, Sang Hoon.

385
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,130
What took you so long?

386
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,050
I waited so long.

387
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,130
Hey! Open the door.

388
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,570
Am I hearing things?

389
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,170
Hey, Woo Ga On!

390
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,220
I said, open the door.

391
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,170
Tae In?

392
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,490
Did you eat?

393
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,270
I ate.

394
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,030
But, how did you know to find me here?

395
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,600
Woo Yeon and Professor told me.

396
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,890
I thought I lost them.

397
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,270
If you really wanted to avoid them, you should have hidden your shoes better as well.

398
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,840
Why did they just leave then?

399
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,410
They wanted to give you more time.

400
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,590
Then why did you come?

401
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,210
To hold on to you.

402
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,950
I heard everything from No Sang Hoon. So, now you tell me everything honestly.

403
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,800
What did he say?

404
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,790
That's not important.

405
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,710
I want you to tell me your story.

406
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,890
 Oh, please!

407
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,380
 - Ouch! 
 - Oh, man!

408
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,500
  At first, we got along pretty well.

409
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,580
 Hey, stop insisting!

410
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,230
  But when I became a trainee at the company that he got dropped out of,

411
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,270
  he started to bully me.

412
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,500
 A great trainee of SJ Entertainment is cleaning here!

413
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,230
 What are you learning today? An ending pose?

414
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,920
 Do it sexy!

415
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,410
 I'm sorry.

416
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,260
 Stop it.

417
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,570
 Beethoven is here.

418
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,970
 What a great pianist is here!

419
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,080
 Hey, just pick one.

420
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,190
 Hand, face, where do you want to get hit?

421
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,900
 But if you're going to be an idol, isn't the hand better than the face?

422
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,700
 You're cleaning so vigorously.

423
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,490
 Is an ability to clean in the gene as well?

424
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,300
 I heard that your mom is cleaning restrooms in the subway station for your lesson fee.

425
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,540
 Oh, wow!

426
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,560
 Hey, how did you know about that?

427
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,910
 It's because his mom looks exactly like him!

428
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:06,230
 But I thought her job was too easy,

429
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,330
 so I went there

430
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,020
 and did this.

431
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,520
 Ga On!

432
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,080
 Guys, hold him down!

433
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,160
 Why did you make this a bigger problem?

434
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,500
  Thankfully, my hand got healed,

435
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,120
 Jerk!

436
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,350
 and I got okay after dropping out of that school.

437
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,490
  But then I saw that disgusting face again,

438
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,130
  and I saw him on the stage where I'm the happiest.

439
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,610
 It's been a while, Ga On.

440
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,450
 Why did you ignore my calls?

441
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,560
 Why are you doing this to me?

442
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,570
 We're going to see each other often.

443
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,360
 Don't we need to stay friendly to each other?

444
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,460

445
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,710
 That's why I did that.

446
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,180
My hands will be like this if I keep seeing him on the stage.

447
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,160
Then it'll harm LUNA.

448
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,500
So I thought it was best for me to disappear.

449
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,400
Why is that the best solution?

450
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,690
All of you guys are amazing.

451
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:07,400
I joined the group late and am just riding on the other members' coattails.

452
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,710
Hey, Woo Ga On. Don't you know how I am?

453
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,140
Do you think I would've picked a member who'll just ride on our coattails?

454
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,680
Then, why did you pick me?

455
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,210
Your feet.

456
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,830
- My feet? 
 - I picked you because of your feet.

457
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,360

458
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:40,790
♫   I want to play this for you, who has become everything to me   ♫

459
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:46,590
♫    The hidden stories in my heart    ♫

460
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,580

461
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,740
♫   I'll play it for you now   ♫

462
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:59,200
♫   Maybe to meet you   ♫

463
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,230
♫   I might have spent all these long nights   ♫

464
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:11,390
♫   You lit my dark heart up like a star in the night sky   ♫

465
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,570
♫   Maybe this feeling is love   ♫

466
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,810
Good job!

467
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,630
Get home safe.

468
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,740
What's going on?

469
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,970
I'm sorry! I'm used to turning off the light.

470
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,830
Sorry.

471
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:51,410
You were that nervous, but I wondered how you could get the rhythm with your feet,

472
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,670
so I thought it'd be fun if we got on the stage together.

473
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,020
Do you know something?

474
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,500
The first day when you brought me,

475
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,250
you told me, "Now, you're LUNA, too."

476
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,660
That day was the best day of my life.

477
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,520
That's right.

478
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:35,940
Ga On, you giving up LUNA

479
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,290
is not the best solution.

480
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,330
It's the worst solution.

481
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,040
Geez! He's total trash!

482
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,440
I didn't have a good impression of him from the beginning!

483
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,950
What do you think, Ga On? What do you want to do?

484
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,740
I don't know.

485
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,870
What do you mean you don't know?

486
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,430
Ga On, you already ran away once.

487
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,250
Exactly!

488
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,910
Ga On, you said you like something strong.

489
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,360
The one who beats others has strength, but the one who triumphs over himself is the strongest.

490
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,180
Don't run away this time, but face it.

491
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,800

492
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,800
I'll go alone from here.

493
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,010
What? Let's go in all together!

494
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,810
Right?

495
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,650
Do you think you can do it alone?

496
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,670
Fighting, Ga On!

497
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,150
Why did you call me out this early in the morning?

498
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,650
Did you hide a camera somewhere?

499
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,190
I'll give you one last chance to apologize to me.

500
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,600
Apologize for what?

501
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,450
I didn't do anything wrong.

502
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:50,270
I have a video for proof and have a doctor's note that I got at that time.

503
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,680
How are you going to prove it?

504
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,800
You need to have facts and proof these days.

505
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,280
Nobody will trust your words.

506
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,740
 Hold him!

507
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,610
 Ahh!

508
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,900
  Be quiet!

509
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,520
   Be quiet, Woo Ga On!

510
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,230
  - Hey. 
 - Stop it!

511
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,850
No Sang Hoon!

512
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,380
Why did you come so late?

513
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,270
Hey.

514
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,280
Do you want a cigarette?

515
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,190
How are you?

516
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,430
This is why you have to use your brain.

517
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,250
Do you think I didn't prepare for this and become an idol?

518
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,020
He's not just anybody, but a member of LUNA.

519
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,190
Hey, I have the original video of that day. You better be good to me.

520
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,410
I get it.

521
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,100
I'll introduce you to a trainee for a girl group.

522
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,830
You better make that happen for real!

523
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,770
I said, I will!

524
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,890
What the–

525
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,200
Hey!

526
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,810
Are you out of your mind?

527
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,910
Roll down your window!

528
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,810
I said, roll it down!

529
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,460
Wait, it's Yoon Tae In!

530
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,390
That original video...

531
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,940
Can you hand it over to me?

532
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,140
What video? I'm not sure what you are talking about.

533
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,010
I'm really busy at the moment.

534
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,160
Just tell me how much you want for it. The video.

535
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,280
You!

536
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,450
You're going to set the record straight

537
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,560
about this... particular rumor.

538
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,760
You think you are a big shot now.

539
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,210
You...

540
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,970
 Woo Ga On!

541
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,950
 Just do what you did to me at the Judo school

542
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,160
 You're definitely not weak.

543
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,960
This punk!

544
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,310
Ga On,  please!

545
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:22,140
I worked really hard to make my debut! You know that, too!

546
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,740
Please, don't post that video to the public.

547
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,530
You actually think that I'd behave like you do?

548
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:32,940
But, you punk!

549
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,390
How dare you talk informally to your Sunbae!

550
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,080
What's taking so long?

551
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,130
This isn't good. Let's go in.

552
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,750
Let's go.

553
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,750
Oh! He's coming out!

554
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,750
Hey, Ga On!

555
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,130
- Look! 
 - What?

556
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,940
- What happened to you? 
 - It hurts.

557
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,310
Did he punch you?

558
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,730
How many times?

559
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,320
It looks as though Ga On

560
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,370
has beaten his fears today.

561
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,430
And I can see

562
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,590
that you did a good job, too.

563
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,910
You said you don't know how to hold on to people,

564
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,980
but it's clear that you're a true leader.

565
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,260
Ah... Well...

566
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,090
So, about Ga On...

567
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,460
He just wasn't feeling well the other day,

568
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,900
and now all these ridiculous rumors are going around.

569
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,250
He's having such a tough time at the moment. Help us out here, please?

570
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,220
Just write something really nice, please.

571
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,640
I got a tip...

572
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,300
A tip?

573
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,010
- But it isn't about Ga on. It's about No Sang Hoon. 
 - What?

574
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:03,370
Someone's making claims that he was bullied by No Sang Hoon when he was in school.

575
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:07,170
This person stated that Ga On went through the same thing.

576
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,910
I knew it!

577
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,220
See, I told you! Ga On would never do something like that!

578
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,260
Okay,  instead, set up an exclusive interview with Yoon Tae In

579
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,250
for me.

580
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,380
Wow, so smart...

581
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:46,400
 Total Lunar Eclipse

582
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,740

583
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,890

584
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,470
- Reporter Kim. 
 - Oh!

585
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,530
Hi, Ji Yeon.

586
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,290
What are you so absorbed in? Don't run into anything.

587
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,440
Eonni, did you read this?

588
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,330
Blue Moon's No Sang Hoon's Bullying scandal?

589
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,340
I was going to try to get an interview with him on my radio show. That was a close call!

590
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,370
He's the reason there was terrible gossip about LUNA's youngest member!

591
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,320
LUNA?

592
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,620
You're talking about Ga On?

593
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,340
You haven't heard yet?

594
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,370
No...

595
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,110
By the way...

596
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,360
Did you, perchance...

597
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,550
think about it?

598
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:38,230
About what?

599
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,080
Meeting my brother.

600
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,320
You're asking again?

601
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,770
It isn't just because he's my brother.

602
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,230
He's really a great catch!

603
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,200
And since you're both divorced, it wouldn't be an issue.

604
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,130
It's his ex-wife who's at fault.

605
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,500
He's a Dermatologist and has his own clinic in Gangnam

606
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,970
and he's the same age as you.

607
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,820
You'd be perfect together!

608
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,510
All right, I'll think about it.

609
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,100
Okay...

610
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,640
So much better now.

611
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,190
Oh, too hot.

612
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,200
Hey, Woo Yeon.

613
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,510
All that running around in the morning

614
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,240
made me hungry.

615
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,920
You should be eating a real meal.

616
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,940
Did you want some?

617
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,750
Let's put together

618
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:34,890
a party tonight.

619
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,770
We can have a barbeque.

620
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,160
A barbeque?

621
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,040
To celebrate the return of Ga On?

622
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,770
Ahh... That, too.

623
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:49,340
We never celebrated or had a welcome party for you as well.

624
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,790
That's okay.

625
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,120
How about we prepare this together?

626
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,270

627
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,940
 BBQ party tonight to welcome Ga On back and properly welcome Dr. Kang.

628
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,640
     Everyone should come. 
   Sounds like fun!

629
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,010
   Let's have a talent show. Be ready for it!

630
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,410
   I want skirt steak.

631
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,150
   We're giving her a welcome party? She's leaving soon.

632
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,960
   Shouldn't we give her a farewell party?

633
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,140
Hi...

634
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,400
Get away!

635
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,330
- Where should I put this? 
 - Right there.

636
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,390
One second...

637
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,520
Why, thank you.

638
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,270
Here you go.

639
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,550
Hey, guys,

640
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,480
everything looks delicious!

641
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,940
Cheers, everyone!

642
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,570
Remember this.

643
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,880
We're letting it all go just for tonight.

644
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,740
Starting tomorrow, we will enforce a stricter diet and harder training.

645
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,060
- Gosh... 
 - Sheesh...

646
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,220
Oh wow, look at the tyrannical leader! You talk like an old man.

647
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,520
I mean,

648
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,250
on such an awesome day,

649
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,320
must you talk about work?

650
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,840
Here! Let's Cheer! Here, here.

651
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,020
This time for real!

652
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:55,490
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers! 
 - Yeah... Cheers!

653
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,160
These skewers are fantastic!

654
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,950
All Right!

655
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,330
All right!

656
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,110
No celebration is complete without singing!

657
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:13,330
You're all singers here. Shouldn't each of you sing something?

658
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,830
Sure! I'm in!

659
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,200
- Oh yeah? 
 - So, then,

660
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,000
I'll go first.

661
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,610
Awesome! I know you'll be great!

662
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,550
Indeed!

663

yet you look totally sober.

763

What's this? You think you're better than me at holding liquor?

765
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:34,500
Of course. I am not drinking, not because I can't hold it, but because I don't want to.

766
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,780
Then you should settle it today.

767

Daebak, Woo Yeon!

768

01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,910
Don't go.

827
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:39,800
♫  My rainbow, the rain is not stopping   ♫

828
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,930
Please stay by my side.
♫   No words  ♫

829
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,640
♫  will comfort me  ♫

830
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:55,250
♫  When a day changes and I become your light  ♫

831
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:01,390
♫  When you say, "It's okay."   ♫

832
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:07,810
♫  You are my  ♫

833
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:09,830

834
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,510
♫  My rainbow  ♫

835
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:20,970

836
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:24,990
 Yoon Tae In.

837
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,650
 I'm starting to worry about you now.

838
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:29,090
 Why is my heart beating so fast?

839
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,470
 Get a grip, In Yoon Joo.

840
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,790
 Is this also a part of home concert prep?

841
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,040
 How about we give a small hint in our own ways?

842
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,170
 - Hello!
 - Our home concert–

843
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,970
 Do you get it now, the huge stars you live with?

844
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:44,610
 I wouldn't have met them as In Yoon Joo .

845
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,180
 Moonlight.

846
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,210
 You're not going to hang up?

847
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:49,670
 Are you not going to hang up, either?

848
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,510
 I don't think I'm the only one who likes her.

849
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,120
 I don't want to get caught, so I act relaxed.

850
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:58,370
 You'll be cool even if you don't do that.

851
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:01,590
♫  Won't wake up  ♫

852
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,810
♫  Every day  ♫

853
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:10,210
♫  My cold heart deeply freezes  ♫

854
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:14,700
♫  Feel so cold, so cold, it feels so cold, so cold  ♫
