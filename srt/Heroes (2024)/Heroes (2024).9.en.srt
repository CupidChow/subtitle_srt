1
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,039
Why should I tell you the whereabouts

2
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,359
of Zhuo Bufan and his fellows?

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,000
Because they are
the criminals I'm after.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,320
Because I am a constable from Dagu.

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,480
The murder case has been handed over

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,440
to Zhili Prefecture
by Ministry of Justice.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,640
No one but the Department
is allowed to intervene.

8
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:30,839
I've already told you.

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,079
Why won't you listen?

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,479
What for?

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
The documents of the Ministry.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,799
How would I have their documents?

13
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,679
How could you not?

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,280
Mr. Wang,

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,920
there you go again?

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,560
It's quite a coincidence today.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,280
I do actually have an official letter
from the Imperial Household Department.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,920
Look carefully.

19
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:06,400
All the yamens

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,959
must provide full assistance

21
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,920
for the guard holding this letter.

22
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,680
You see it now, don't you?

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,280
Yes.

24
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,000
But this letter

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,879
only states all local yamens
should cooperate with you.

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,640
It doesn't mention

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
the murder in the Dagu Inn.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,319
It doesn't even mention

29
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,680
what case you're handling.

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,239
Sorry, I can't comply with your order.

31
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Wang,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,120
are you going to exterminate everyone
from Rongtian Ridge

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,879
or get yourself killed

34
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,040
before you give up?

35
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,840
I don't intend to exterminate them all.

36
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,599
I only want to arrest

37
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,159
the six culprits of the Dagu case.

38
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,840
Among these six, including Tang Yu,

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
four were killed by me

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,599
because they resisted arrest.

41
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,640
Now only Yu Huanjie
and Qin Tuo are left.

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,079
Zhuo Bufan, as their Sect Leader,
cannot shirk his responsibility.

43
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,120
He must be apprehended too.

44
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,640
I am only arresting those three.

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Others are not involved,

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,120
so I won't pursue them.

47
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,680
Just you?

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,599
Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo

49
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,599
are the senior disciples
of Rongtian Ridge.

50
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,680
They are already well-known masters.

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
Moreover, behind them

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,200
is the unparalleled sword master,
Sect Leader Zhuo Bufan.

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Just you alone.

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,799
Whom can you take down?

55
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,319
I admire your relentless vigor
in chasing down

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,280
the criminals.

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,879
But

58
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,879
your reckless attack
against overwhelming enemies

59
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,159
is truly laughable.

60
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,400
The other day, in the Concession,

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,680
if I hadn't rescued you,

62
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,479
you would have died
under Zhuo Bufan's sword.

63
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,280
Thank you very much.

64
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,080
But I have said

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,759
as long as I still have a breath,

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
I will definitely continue.

67
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Have you gone mad?

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,879
What did you say?

69
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,000
Rongtian Ridge is a sword sect, a gang.

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,919
Moreover, behind them

71
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,319
there is also a huge force.

72
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,919
If you keep being so stubborn

73
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,360
and they turn around to deal with you,

74
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,240
what would you do?

75
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
Aren't you in pursuit of them too?

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,159
What do you have to compare with me?

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,719
I am from the Department.

78
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,000
I have connections above.

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,319
I have ways and a solid backing.

80
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,919
What does it have to do
with one's backing?

81
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,840
Of course, it does.

82
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,360
The Department has got my back.

83
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,759
If you get in trouble,
who will help you?

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,248
I handle cases and eliminate evil

85
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:57,800
for justice.

86
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,759
I don't need any backing.

87
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,599
Pedantic.

88
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,439
As a petty constable,

89
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,319
what you should do is to maintain order.

90
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,039
Order and justice
are two different things.

91
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,639
Truly unreasonable.

92
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,360
A mere commoner thinking
of eliminating evil.

93
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
I've told you long ago

94
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
if you really want
to chase after Zhuo Bufan,

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,280
come work for me.

96
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you very much.

97
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,800
I have already answered you.

98
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,080
Only after I completely resolve
the Dagu murder case

99
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,479
can I make other plans.

100
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,319
Mr. Wang!

101
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,479
No wonder you're still a constable.

102
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,919
You are so rigid.

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,479
Why must you be so stubborn?

104
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,439
Can't you learn to be flexible
in your dealings?

105
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,280
Right or wrong, integrity and duty.

106
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,479
Why do I need to be flexible?

107
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,000
I just carry out official duties
with impartiality.

108
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,560
Why should I heed
the so-called flexible ways?

109
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,960
I appreciate you,

110
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,319
but you deny it.

111
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,759
What good does it do you to offend me?

112
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,319
Mr. Muqing,

113
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm not afraid to do it.

114
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,680
Yes, of course, you're not.

115
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,400
What do you fear?

116
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Nothing.

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,319
I'm not afraid to offend you

118
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,319
because you are a gentleman.

119
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,919
You're a fourth-rank imperial guard,

120
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,360
while I'm just a lowly constable.

121
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
My life

122
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,000
is but nothing to you,

123
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,520
but you saved me.

124
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,800
So it shows

125
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,759
there is justice in your heart.

126
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,040
One would rather offend a gentleman

127
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,319
so gentlemen become fewer and fewer.

128
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,240
They don't offend a villain

129
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,560
so villains become more and more.

130
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,759
A gentleman
has to strive and be tolerant.

131
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,399
What's so great about being a gentleman?

132
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:24,920
I...

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,879
It's Rongtian Ridge.

134
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,639
They aren't so bold.

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,199
These aren't from Rongtian Ridge.

136
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,399
Japanese?

137
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,519
Nor are they from Japan.

138
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:18,010
=Heroes=

139
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:22,138
=Episode 9=

140
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,040
Thank you.

141
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,879
Sir.

142
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,639
Why did that person want to kill you?

143
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,240
You need to get
your wounds treated soon.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,000
You aren't supposed to fight
for three months.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
It's only the second day now.

146
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,919
It's fine.

147
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,879
Here.

148
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,879
You are too seriously injured.

149
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,879
Already beyond help.

150
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,039
The red lotus flowers leaning
against each other like they're drunk.

151
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,000
The silent white bird
is surely sorrowful.

152
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,399
Gu Muqi,

153
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,679
you can finally fulfill your wish

154
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,879
to see your wife and children
you've been missing.

155
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,039
Come.

156
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,752
Okay.

157
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,240
Sir,

158
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,399
do you know where I can buy a ticket?

159
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,879
Where do you need to go?

160
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
Shanxi.

161
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,080
I've just been to the station.

162
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,000
They said tickets
for the next three days

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,799
were all sold out.

164
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,200
You should change to a different train.

165
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,720
Just leave in a couple of days.

166
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,759
I have an emergency.

167
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,639
It's urgent.

168
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,279
Don't worry.

169
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,080
There are many people around here
who deal with tickets.

170
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,759
They might just have tickets on hand.

171
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,720
How about this?

172
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,679
I'll go ask around for you in a bit.

173
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,919
- Okay?
- Yes.

174
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,720
Thank you.

175
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,679
You're welcome.

176
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
If you keep moving around,

177
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,240
you won't be able to save your arm.

178
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,080
Lie in bed and don't move.

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,240
Otherwise,
even a miracle-working physician

180
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,840
can't save you.

181
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Young man,
go to sleep early and eat well.

182
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,399
Eat lots of fruits.

183
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,600
Apples, bananas and grapes are fine.

184
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,799
Don't eat any seafood.

185
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
And no soy sauce.

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,559
Fresh vegetables.

187
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:56,559
Quack.

188
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,440
Zhuo Bufan and his fellows

189
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,960
left last night.

190
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,240
They went west.

191
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,840
We sent our men to follow them.

192
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,240
They left the city and entered a forest.

193
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,559
They were heading west.

194
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
So that means they are now...

195
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,799
Louder, sir, louder.

196
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,799
So that means

197
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,720
they should have already
left Shanghai, right?

198
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,799
Almost.

199
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,679
I guess

200
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,240
they have reached Jiangsu by now.

201
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
Alright, he's gone.

202
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,639
Muqing,

203
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,360
do you think Mr. Wang
will find Zhuo Bufan?

204
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,120
He could chase them all the way
from Dagu County, Tianjin

205
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,360
to Shanghai.

206
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,639
He killed four out of six criminals.

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,480
Even I may not be able to do that.

208
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,639
Can he be underestimated?

209
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,399
Yes, it's astonishing.

210
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,600
Although there are techniques
in pursuing criminals,

211
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,080
talents matter most.

212
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,240
That constable has his unique strengths.

213
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,720
Let him give it a try.

214
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,000
I believe he can find Zhuo Bufan

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,279
and catch up with them.

216
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,279
So

217
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,960
I'll just need to send
someone to follow him.

218
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
That's right. Let him go after them.

219
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,320
We will rest up and regain our strength.

220
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,080
Have you found their whereabouts?

221
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,039
Yes.

222
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,720
I promised you

223
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,039
I would tell you if I found a clue.

224
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,200
You promised to take me
with you when you found it.

225
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,200
I want to take you,

226
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,840
but...

227
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,720
But...

228
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,480
Just very inconvenient.

229
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,480
You found it inconvenient again?

230
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,360
If you don't take me,
I will go by myself.

231
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,600
Since it's inconvenient for you,

232
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,360
we'll each go our own way.

233
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,360
I don't need you to take me along
because you pity me.

234
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,879
I...

235
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,840
It's convenient.

236
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,879
Okay, then I'll go pack.

237
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,519
Come in and wait for me.

238
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,559
I'll wait for you right here.

239
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,879
Miss Lin,

240
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,159
we have an agreement.

241
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,360
I take you with me to chase them,

242
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,320
but once I find their trail

243
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
and make the arrest,

244
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,480
you must follow my arrangements.

245
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,639
Okay.

246
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,159
(Mr. Wang and I will head west)

247
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,120
(to Jiangsu to track Zhuo Bufan.)

248
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,928
(The 5th day of the 4th month, 1911)

249
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,586
(Mangzhong is 35 days away)

250
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,240
Mr. Zhuo,

251
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,120
there's an inn
just a little further ahead.

252
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,440
After riding all day,

253
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,960
we can finally take a break.

254
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,759
Keep going. Don't stop.

255
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
But there's a long way to go

256
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,519
before there's a place to rest.

257
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,120
Let's go.

258
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,480
Fine. We might as well
die from exhaustion.

259
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:26,720
Bufan,

260
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,720
my insects

261
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,559
smell a strange scent around here.

262
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,039
It must be someone tracking us nearby.

263
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:31,559
Stop.

264
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,480
Huanjie,

265
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,480
you take others to rest.

266
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,840
Qin Tuo, Huang Xing,

267
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,960
follow me.

268
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,200
Let's go.

269
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,440
Great, we're just in need of horses.

270
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Those horses cannot be kept.

271
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:42,440
Come on,

272
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,680
keeping their horses

273
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,279
will just leave them a clue.

274
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,200
Mr. Zhuo,

275
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,440
these are Japanese.

276
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,160
Tell Huanjie
and the others to come over.

277
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,440
Let's rest at the inn we passed by.

278
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,680
Why?

279
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,240
The Japanese sent people to track us.

280
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,720
There must be someone to relay messages.

281
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,640
If they haven't received any by night,

282
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
they'll surely come.

283
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,240
Upon seeing these corpses,

284
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,119
they'll conclude that we moved forward.

285
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,000
They will never guess

286
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,079
we actually have returned

287
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,599
to the inn we just passed by.

288
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,000
By doing so,

289
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,640
we can completely shake off
their pursuit.

290
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:23,200
(Guangju Hotel)

291
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,119
Here you are.

292
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,599
(From Shanghai to Fenzhou)

293
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,720
The day after tomorrow?

294
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,519
Yes.

295
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,160
Aren't there any for tomorrow?

296
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
I've asked several scalpers.

297
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:41,240
It took a lot of effort to get this one.

298
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,039
If you want it, you better hurry.

299
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,880
If you wait a bit longer,

300
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,480
I'm afraid even this one will be gone.

301
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,400
I'll take this one.

302
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,240
Sir,

303
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,599
think of another way.

304
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,200
If you can find a ticket for tomorrow,

305
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,759
I'm willing to pay ten times the price.

306
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,240
Muqing,

307
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,480
this is sent by the yamen
of Xundao Street.

308
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,240
Have a taste.

309
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,599
What's wrong, Muqing?

310
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,480
Muqing.

311
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,079
What's wrong?

312
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,400
Too neat.

313
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,000
What's too neat?

314
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,720
The wound on Tan Xian's hand.

315
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,559
(I thought it was an accidental cut.)

316
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,759
But now that I think about it,
it's too neat.

317
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,839
What does that imply?

318
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,319
We need to go to that hotel again.

319
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,160
How old?

320
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,880
15.

321
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,119
What the heck?

322
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,240
Who do you think you are?

323
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,920
Do you know who I am?

324
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,160
How dare you enter my room?

325
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,279
Get out of here!

326
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,759
It's you.

327
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,079
You?

328
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,119
Aren't you that guy?

329
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,319
Why are you here?

330
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,839
It's me.

331
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,119
Lucky.

332
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:32,799
Bro.

333
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,079
Dude.

334
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,519
Sir.

335
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,480
Please hold tight and don't let go.

336
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,920
Be careful.

337
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,680
Why are you here?

338
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,359
I'd also like to know

339
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,720
why I am here.

340
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
Why am I here?

341
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,559
Why did I end up here?

342
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,240
But here I am now.

343
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:58,839
Bro.

344
00:20:59,119 --> 00:20:59,759
Dude.

345
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:00,640
Sir.

346
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,759
Could you pull me up

347
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,480
and then we talk, please?

348
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,920
I was just having some fun.

349
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,799
I wasn't going to dodge payment.

350
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,599
Do you have to?

351
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Why are you here?

352
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,359
I...

353
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,039
Sir,

354
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,200
I'm not a local.

355
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,400
Shouldn't I stay here?

356
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,039
Should I sleep on the street or what?

357
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,000
I am in the business of dealing
with antiques and jewelry overseas.

358
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,799
My store is in Southeast Asia.

359
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,960
Do you want to see my passport?

360
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,839
And my boat ticket?

361
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,440
They're all in my suitcase.

362
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
Go ahead and take a look for yourself.

363
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,559
When did you move in?

364
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,839
Last night.

365
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,000
Where were you before?

366
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,240
I'd been staying

367
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,519
at a hotel on Xiafei Road.

368
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,319
Why did you change to this hotel?

369
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,000
This morning,

370
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,680
I had to show products to the wives

371
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,759
of officials from the Public Council
of the French Concession.

372
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,519
This place is closer to it.

373
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,839
So I moved here.

374
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,799
I've been busy all day.

375
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,279
I just finished work

376
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,240
and found myself a girl.

377
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
And then you came in.

378
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,920
Why did you move into this room?

379
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,759
Sir, it's a hotel.

380
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,839
I stay in whichever room
they assign to me.

381
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
I would prefer a room number
that includes an eight.

382
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,559
They said

383
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,359
Rooms 108, 208 and 308

384
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,720
were all occupied.

385
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,039
I can't possibly share
a room with others, can I?

386
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,359
If you don't think I should stay here,

387
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,720
I will move to another room.

388
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,400
No. Why should I do it?

389
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,839
I am leaving tomorrow.

390
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,400
I still need to visit a few places

391
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
to see if there is
any newly unearthed good stuff.

392
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,160
I need to stock up.

393
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,440
Bad luck.

394
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:52,290
(Passport)

395
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,200
The woman was brought by him.

396
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,279
Nothing wrong with her.

397
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,960
The day before last on Maiqi Road,

398
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,720
I saw you two wielding swords.

399
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
Are you

400
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,160
the legendary imperial masters?

401
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,880
I know people from the palace.

402
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,039
I visit the imperial city
once or twice every year.

403
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,359
Many wives and concubines

404
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:27,599
of officials from that city

405
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,200
buy from me.

406
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,160
Even the princesses
from the royal mansions

407
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,920
are among my regular customers.

408
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,319
If in the future,
your wives and concubines

409
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,759
want to buy jewelry,

410
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,759
come to me.

411
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,599
Unique goods, fair prices

412
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,559
and an honest shopkeeper.

413
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,480
None of us are strangers anymore.

414
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,920
What are you here to investigate?

415
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,640
I did hear about something.

416
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,440
What have you heard?

417
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I've heard

418
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,039
something happened
in this hotel a few days ago.

419
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,200
The Concession Police Station
sent quite a few people over.

420
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,200
They prowled
and kept watch outside all night.

421
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,720
This is all you've heard about?

422
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,759
There was a homicide
at this hotel the night before.

423
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,279
Someone died?

424
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,200
That's really bad.

425
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,160
Where did they die?

426
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,799
Right here in your room.

427
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,480
What?

428
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,559
Right where you just fell.

429
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,440
Oh, no.

430
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,240
How can I do business?

431
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,319
This awful hotel.

432
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,240
They let me stay in this bad room,

433
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,519
thinking I was gullible.

434
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,920
They're malicious, heartless

435
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,160
and poisonous snakes.

436
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:47,720
No.

437
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,480
I want another room.

438
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,839
No.

439
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,519
I'll go to a different hotel.

440
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,359
How can anyone stay here?

441
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,599
I need to go have a word
with their manager.

442
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,599
How could they?

443
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,920
Giving me a room where someone died.

444
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,680
I have to ask them for compensation.

445
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,400
For my fortune.

446
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,920
For my luck.

447
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,319
Here you are.

448
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:10,799
(10 taels)

449
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,519
W-W-What is this for?

450
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:13,839
Take it.

451
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,160
I pay for your hotel stay.

452
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,880
How could I accept this?

453
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,160
Just leave.

454
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,119
Don't say more words.

455
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,880
Don't go to the hotel manager.

456
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,920
Bro,

457
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm doing you a favor.

458
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,079
Otherwise, I would go to the manager

459
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,400
and make a big fuss.

460
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,599
What are you looking for, Muqing?

461
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:04,920
Do you still remember?

462
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,279
The night before yesterday,
when we were examining Tan Xian's body,

463
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,039
there was a wound on his finger.

464
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,160
Yes, I do.

465
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,519
I didn't pay much attention,

466
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,920
thinking it might be a cut
he accidentally inflicted on himself

467
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,400
or maybe he got injured
while confronting Huo Qin.

468
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,279
But then I realized later

469
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,440
I was negligent.

470
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,359
That wound was too neat.

471
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,240
And from the angle of the wound,

472
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,000
it looked like a self-inflicted cut.

473
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,160
Self-inflicted?

474
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,160
If it were you,

475
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,319
under what circumstances
would you cut your own finger?

476
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,599
You mean

477
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,279
Tan Xian left a message
by using his blood in this room?

478
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,839
Tan Xian didn't meet
someone from Tongmenghui.

479
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,599
It's very likely

480
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,559
that he left a clue in this room.

481
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,519
If I were Tan Xian,

482
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:00,960
what would I do?

483
00:27:44,986 --> 00:27:50,362
(Unmarked grave in Pingyao,
Bodhi's inheritors)

484
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,640
(The one sending a note)

485
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,519
to Tan Xian to tell him
to answer a call at 1 AM

486
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,000
must be someone from Tongmenghui.

487
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,880
The phone call came as scheduled,

488
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,599
which indicates that Tan Xian
and Tongmenghui

489
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,359
had not established contact.

490
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,319
So the secrets Tan Xian held

491
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,599
were surely still unknown
to Tongmenghui.

492
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,559
The note was placed in the meal tray.

493
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,920
At that time, the bodyguard girl
had already run out,

494
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,400
trying to lead us away from the target.

495
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,160
And Tan Xian was also preparing to flee.

496
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,400
At that moment, he received the note.

497
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,519
And he had no intention

498
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,559
of waiting for the call at 1 AM.

499
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,240
Because at that time, we were outside,

500
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,640
as well as the Japanese
and men of Rongtian Ridge.

501
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,599
Staying in the hotel
would only increase the danger.

502
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,079
After receiving the note,
he would realize

503
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,680
Tongmenghui knew he was in this room

504
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,519
in this hotel.

505
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,559
Even the Public Council's protection
for Tan Xian

506
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,880
(was also the result
of Tongmenghui's efforts.)

507
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,920
(Unmarked grave in Pingyao)
(So he wrote the message in blood.)

508
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,640
(Bodhi's inheritors)
(Unfortunately,)

509
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,440
(when he was about to escape,)

510
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,039
(Huo Qin from Rongtian Ridge came.)

511
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,200
(Tan Xian is dead.)

512
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,759
(The letter containing clues
to the Altar Treasure has been burned.)

513
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,160
That letter must be very important.

514
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,000
But the most important thing

515
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
is the line of blood writing
he left behind.

516
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,920
(Unmarked grave in Pingyao,
Bodhi's inheritors.)

517
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,759
The Bodhi's inheritors

518
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,359
refer to those
of Southern Shaolin, right?

519
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,440
The one who offered the treasure
to the imperial court back then

520
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,359
was a disciple of Bianjie,
who was the inheritor

521
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,400
of the Disciplinary Department.

522
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,279
If I were the abbot,

523
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,319
I wouldn't entrust
the treasure map to just one person.

524
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,440
It's not just
the Disciplinary Department.

525
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,288
I'd split the map in two,

526
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:22,656
one for the Disciplinary Department,
the other for the Bodhi Department.

527
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:23,648
It'd make sense.

528
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,880
Unmarked grave in Pingyao,
Bodhi's inheritors.

529
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,599
Living people do not reside in a grave.

530
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,000
Only the dead do.

531
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,799
The other half of the treasure map

532
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,960
must be in the grave
of Bodhi's inheritors.

533
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,200
The ones who know the secret.

534
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,559
Tan Xian is dead.

535
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,799
Tongmenghui is still unaware.

536
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,240
That bodyguard might know.

537
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,880
I suspected from the start
that Zhuo Bufan knew.

538
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,839
They have set off toward the west.

539
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,599
They must be heading to Pingyao, Shanxi.

540
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,960
So whoever goes to Shanxi

541
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,759
knows the secret.

542
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,559
Stir-fried medick.

543
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
We've run out of medick.

544
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,480
Eel paste.

545
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,559
We're also out of eel paste.

546
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,880
Then how about a fish?

547
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:18,920
Pufferfish.

548
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,359
None available.

549
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,160
Coilia nasus.

550
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,000
Also unavailable.

551
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,599
Reeves shad.

552
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,480
Still none.

553
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,759
You're out of all the Three Delicacies
of the Yangtze?

554
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,359
Sorry, sir.

555
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,440
This is just a small hotel.

556
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,839
You...

557
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,480
What fish do you have?

558
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,920
Yellow croaker.

559
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,000
So low-end.

560
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,359
Okay, write it down.

561
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,200
Do you have fried river shrimp?

562
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,680
Yes, we do.

563
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,920
Three Yellow Chicken?

564
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,359
Yes, we have it.

565
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,839
And stir-fried clams.

566
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,440
Well...

567
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
We don't have this one.

568
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,240
You don't have any high-grade dishes.

569
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,920
Alright, that's it.

570
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,720
Hurry and get it done.

571
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,640
Okay.

572
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:05,960
A pot of Huadiao wine.

573
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,119
Alright.

574
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,519
It's me.

575
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,599
Me.

576
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,440
Lucky!

577
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,759
Good luck.

578
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,160
Last night.

579
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,319
Hotel, inside my room.

580
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,920
You got a bad memory.

581
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,000
You don't recognize me
once I put on clothes?

582
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,279
As the saying goes,
once a stranger, twice an acquaintance.

583
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's have some drinks.

584
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,640
Interesting.

585
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,359
Really interesting.

586
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,839
Let me tell you.

587
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,359
I've been looking for a hotel all night.

588
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,480
French and Japanese Concessions
and the International Settlement.

589
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,440
I searched from one to another.

590
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,359
The ones with vacancies
were not to my liking.

591
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,200
The ones I liked had no vacancies.

592
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,519
Then I thought

593
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,680
tomorrow morning, I'd leave by train

594
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,240
and I could make do
near the train station.

595
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,359
And as a result, I ran into you.

596
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,160
It's fate. Really lucky.

597
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,599
Even the yellow croaker,
a dish that's not presentable,

598
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,480
seems tasty now.

599
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,279
Take a bite.

600
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,839
This season is a good time

601
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,880
to eat the Three Delicacies
of the Yangtze River.

602
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,559
But this hotel is too small

603
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,599
with too few dishes.

604
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,240
Actually,

605
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,480
I don't particularly like fish.

606
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,279
But I'm going to Shanxi tomorrow.

607
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,880
The fish dishes there
aren't as good as these in Shanghai.

608
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,519
You're going to Shanxi?

609
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,400
Fenzhou.

610
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,799
You are going to Fenzhou?

611
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:19,920
Yes.

612
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,599
Cheng Yu left clues to the treasure

613
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,200
in his own tomb.

614
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,240
This is the location of Cheng Yu's tomb.

615
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,698
(Fenzhou, Shanxi)

616
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,359
(That chatterbox)

617
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,480
in Tan Xian's room tonight.

618
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,200
Lin Haohan.

619
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,960
Yes.

620
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,000
Could he be the one
Tongmenghui was going to meet?

621
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,359
Could he have already seen
the writing on the wall?

622
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,000
He is certainly the most suspicious.

623
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,440
Tan Xian left a clue in that room.

624
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,119
Anyone who has lived there

625
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,480
is subject to suspicion.

626
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,240
So when I let him go,

627
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,079
(I gave him a banknote
with our special mark.)

628
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,319
(As long as he uses it,)

629
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,279
I'll know where he has been.

630
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,480
Wouldn't it be better
to capture him back?

631
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,000
Before I took the mirror off the wall,

632
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,519
I carefully observed the area around it

633
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,480
and found that between the mirror
and the wall,

634
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,159
there was a small cobweb.

635
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,800
The cobweb didn't have much dust on it.

636
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,079
It must have been done by a spider

637
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,679
after Tan Xian wrote down the words.

638
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,320
It indicates

639
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,519
no one had removed the mirror
before I did.

640
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,360
If Lin Haohan had seen those words,

641
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
the cobweb would have been torn off.

642
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,320
Moreover,

643
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,000
if he were from Tongmenghui,

644
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,400
when we entered the room,
he should have...

645
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,239
Hot!

646
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,000
He should have been busy
looking for clues

647
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,360
instead of having fun with a girl.

648
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,519
So that's what I'm saying.

649
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,320
What a small world.

650
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,679
Look.

651
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,440
We met at the hotel

652
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,840
and the restaurant.

653
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:55,039
We even saw each other again
on the way to Fenzhou.

654
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,360
What are the odds?

655
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,960
You're leaving tomorrow?

656
00:34:59,159 --> 00:34:59,960
Early tomorrow morning.

657
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,000
Aren't you too?

658
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,480
No, the day after tomorrow.

659
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,800
The day after tomorrow?

660
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,400
Then why do you stay here today?

661
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:12,800
Lucky.

662
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,599
Right.

663
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,280
Can I ask you something?

664
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,920
Go ahead.

665
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,920
Can we swap our tickets?

666
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,599
I have an urgent matter
and need to get to Fenzhou soon.

667
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:22,679
Well.

668
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,679
I have an urgent matter too.

669
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,079
You give me your ticket.

670
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,480
I'll give you my ticket.

671
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,119
Just stay in Shanghai for an extra day.

672
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,400
I can pay you double.

673
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,519
(Shanghai to Fenzhou)
A third-class seat?

674
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,920
That's where the lowly people

675
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,760
stay.

676
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,599
You don't want to?

677
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,400
If you're really in a hurry,

678
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,800
why not go with me?

679
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,239
I have reserved a private compartment.

680
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,719
The train offers private compartments?

681
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,639
Of course.

682
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,960
There's even a sofa and a dining table.

683
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,960
And a bed.

684
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,840
It's just me alone.

685
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,000
We can board together.

686
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,079
Such a large private compartment.

687
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,880
The two of us will travel from Shanghai

688
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,440
to Shanxi.

689
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,079
How about it?

690
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,079
(I think Lin Haohan)

691
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,960
is just an ordinary merchant.

692
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,159
If people from Tongmenghui

693
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,880
all behave like Lin Haohan,

694
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,599
even if you gave them
ten secret treasures,

695
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,079
they still wouldn't change anything.

696
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,440
How should I address you, miss?

697
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,119
Liu Lin.

698
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,320
Look.

699
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,559
Your first name is my last name.

700
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,280
What are the chances?

701
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,280
Miss Liu Lin,

702
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,000
what are you going to Shanxi for?

703
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,960
My father's birthday is coming up soon.

704
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,079
I want to buy him
an antique as a birthday present,

705
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,440
so I'm going to Pingyao.

706
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:49,760
Oh.

707
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,800
What a coincidence.

708
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,360
Let me tell you.

709
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,840
I deal in antiques.

710
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,400
This time I'm going to Shanxi

711
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,639
to take a look at a batch
of newly unearthed antiques.

712
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,000
If you want to buy anything,
make sure to tell me.

713
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'll help you keep an eye out.

714
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,480
I guarantee you'll buy genuine,

715
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,320
good, cheap but valuable stuff.

716
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,760
Your men lost them?

717
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,320
How many people did you send in total?

718
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,119
Four, all experienced.

719
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,280
All experienced.

720
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,360
And they still lost track?

721
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,119
Those good-for-nothings.

722
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,400
Shouldn't they die out there?

723
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,960
They did die.

724
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,760
Four were killed.

725
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,559
Their bodies were left dumped.

726
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,920
Zhuo Bufan and his men
have disappeared without a trace.

727
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,599
Where did they lose track of them?

728
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,159
Jiangsu.

729
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:10,159
(Huai'an, Jiangsu)

730
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,440
Why do we keep taking the back roads

731
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,400
instead of the main roads?

732
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
The Imperial Household Department
and the Japanese

733
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,719
are after them.

734
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,199
What would you do if you were them?

735
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,719
Since you can think of it,

736
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,440
Zhuo Bufan surely has as well.

737
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,480
He knows we would track him
through the back roads,

738
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,800
so wouldn't it be better for him
to just walk the main roads?

739
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,079
You're right.

740
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,000
But it's not something

741
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,960
they can sneak past.

742
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,159
The Imperial Household Department

743
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,000
just needs to watch the checkpoints

744
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,760
and post stations on the official roads.

745
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:37,760
They'll find them

746
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,960
without even chasing.

747
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,239
So Zhuo Bufan and his people
can only take the mountain roads

748
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,320
and back roads.

749
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,440
But why have we walked for so long

750
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,920
and still not seen them?

751
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,800
They must be very cautious,

752
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,400
not leaving any traces.

753
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,079
But you needn't worry.

754
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,800
Even if they are extra careful,

755
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,800
they will still leave clues.

756
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,679
Because they are humans.

757
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,360
Wherever humans pass,

758
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,880
there will be traces.

759
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,559
These are from a fire they made.

760
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,079
They covered these things up

761
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,719
to prevent people from noticing them.

762
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,480
If you didn't point it out,
I'd not notice it at all.

763
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,199
Look.

764
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,039
How sharp the cut on this branch is.

765
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,239
Would an ordinary person

766
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,719
choose this back road

767
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
instead of the main road?

768
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,440
And would they carry such sharp weapons?

769
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,400
This is the mark left
by a sword scabbard on the ground.

770
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,239
Even the horse dung is covered up.

771
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,000
They were very cautious.

772
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,440
We just need to look carefully,

773
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,679
and we're sure to find something.

774
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,519
So they must have tied up the horses

775
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,559
over there,

776
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,320
sat on the ground to rest,

777
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,679
and warmed themselves

778
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,880
around a fire
with their swords leaning against them

779
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,960
and the scabbards stuck in the ground.

780
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,800
We're going the right way.

781
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,880
Zhuo Bufan and his fellows
have been here.

782
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,360
And there must be a woman among them

783
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,440
riding in a carriage.

784
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,440
Look.

785
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,719
This is a wheel track.

786
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,840
Although it's not very clear,

787
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,159
it can be surmised

788
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,400
that they headed in that direction.

789
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,559
Are we still far from them?

790
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,119
The ashes are already cool.

791
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
So they left here

792
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,320
at least half a day ago.

793
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,760
Keep going.

794
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,352
