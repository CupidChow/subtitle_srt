1
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,440
- Sir.
- Sir.

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,960
Tell me about the major national events,

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,920
the major affairs in the court,

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,199
and the major events that occurred

5
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,960
in the capital each year,

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,439
starting from 1898.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,359
On April 23, 1898,

9
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,240
the late emperor issued an edict
to declare the policy

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,079
and initiate the reform.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,520
Initiate the reform?

12
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,960
It was but a dream of a hundred days.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,600
Start with August.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
Tell me things I did not know.

15
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,479
Brew me a pot of Xinyang Maojian tea.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,319
Understood.

17
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,439
In 1899,

18
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,719
the imperial court and France signed

19
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,040
the Guangzhou Bay Concession Treaty,

20
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,159
leasing Suixi County, Wuchuan County,

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,280
and Maxie Bay to France,

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,680
which would later be called

23
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,799
Guangzhou Bay.

24
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,280
In July 1900,

25
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
Britain, France,

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,920
Germany, Russia,

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,480
the United States, Japan,

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,319
Italy, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,359
attacked our capital together.

30
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,480
In November,

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,359
Li Hongzhang
negotiated with the foreigners

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,959
and signed an armistice outline.

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,879
In March 1901,

34
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,840
the imperial court
paid 450 million taels of silver

35
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,920
to those eight countries.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,519
For what reason?

37
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,200
The foreigners have guns and artillery.

38
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,239
Continue.

39
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,840
In July,

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,599
the imperial court again
signed the Boxer Protocol

41
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,439
with Britain, the United States,

42
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,319
Russia, Germany, Japan, Austria, France,

43
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,920
Italy, Spain, Belgium,

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
and the Netherlands, which is also known

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,000
as the Beijing Protocol.

46
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
The indemnity would be paid
off over 39 years

47
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,560
at an interest rate of 4%.

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,599
An embassy district was built
in the Beijing Legation Quarter,

49
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,080
stating that Chinese
were not allowed in.

50
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,080
Batteries are removed.

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,599
No troops can be stationed
within 20 li of Tianjin.

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,400
Forfeited territories
and paid indemnities every year!

53
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,039
Continue.

54
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,479
In 1904,

55
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,759
Japan occupied Lvshun.

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,599
In July of the same year,

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,759
the imperial court signed
the Lhasa Treaty with Britain.

58
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,159
Later in the twelfth month,

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
a group of students who studied in Tokyo
petitioned the imperial court

60
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,879
for constitutionalism.

61
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,560
In April 1905,

62
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,560
Six Divisions of the Beiyang Army
completed training,

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,639
totaling 70,000 soldiers.

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,639
(In February of the next year,)

65
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,360
(the French missionary
Jean-Marie Lacruche)

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
(killed Jiang Zhaotang,
magistrate of Nanchang.)

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,319
(The angry masses destroyed the church
and killed Lacruche and five others.)

68
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,199
(The court executed the rebel Gong Dong
and paid 350,000 taels of silver.)

69
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,960
(In October 1907,)

70
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,439
(the rebels attacked
and seized Zhennan Pass.)

71
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,879
(Sun Wen fired at the Qing soldiers.)

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,400
(On December 17 of the same year,)

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,479
(the Shanxi Commerce Bureau)

74
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,000
(decided to use
2.75 million taels of silver)

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,680
(as payment to redeem)

76
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,639
(all mining rights in Shanxi.)

77
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,800
(In January of the next year,)

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,719
(the court appointed
Prince Chun as the Military Minister.)

79
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,120
(In February, Huang Xing
from Tongmenghui)

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
(staged a rebellion
at Madushan in Qinzhou.)

81
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,479
(It lasted over 40 days,)

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,080
(and the rebellion failed in the end.)

83
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:50,560
=Heroes=

84
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,504
=Episode 2=

85
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,000
(Hengyi Inn)

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,639
They had vacant rooms.

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,399
It's just that,
seeing you covered in blood,

88
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,600
they feared
you would scare the other guests

89
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,519
and dared not keep you.

90
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,079
Thank you, Miss Lin.

91
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,759
I was covered in blood.

92
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,839
It indeed looked quite frightening.

93
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,079
Didn't my county yamen

94
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,079
summon you?

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
That official took me
to record a statement.

96
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,600
And then

97
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,720
he said I was no longer needed.

98
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,319
Why would you be here?

99
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,000
I found that group of suspects
by the river.

100
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,199
There were six of them.

101
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,079
They were disciples
of Rongtian Ridge in Lingxi.

102
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,160
I executed one of them.

103
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,480
And the other five ran away.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
So I chased them all the way

105
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
until I ended up here.

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,480
Were you chasing them alone?

107
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,600
Yes.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,160
Miss Lin, how come you are here?

109
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,680
I do not know where I should go.

110
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,439
But why would the people

111
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,959
from Rongtian Ridge harm your family?

112
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,279
Did they say something?
What did they ask?

113
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,720
Did you hear anything
while hiding in the closet?

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,439
It seemed like

115
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,680
they were pressing my uncle
for something.

116
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,360
But I don't know exactly what.

117
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,120
I returned to the country this time

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,399
to visit relatives with my family.

119
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,319
I even had no idea where my family

120
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,800
was exactly going.

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Miss Lin, rest assured.

122
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,800
I will surely capture these suspects

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,759
and bring them to justice

124
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,959
for you.

125
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,279
Thank you very much, sir.

126
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,560
Don't call me 'sir'.

127
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,920
I'm just a lowly constable.

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,079
Just call me Jialuo.

129
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,160
Or Mr. Wang is fine.

130
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,519
It's late in the night.

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,759
Mr. Wang...

132
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,519
Sir,

133
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,639
you have an investigation tomorrow.

134
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,160
You should go to bed early.

135
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,879
I'll go and make the bed for you.

136
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,399
No need.

137
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,720
I have already troubled you enough.

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,120
Sitting here is fine for me.

139
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,160
That won't do.

140
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,800
Thank you, but no.

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,160
Miss Lin,

142
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,240
go to rest quickly.

143
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,720
Sitting here is sufficient for me.

144
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,639
(March 28, 1911, 42 days to Mangzhong)

145
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,959
In December of 1909,

146
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,680
rebel Xiong Chengji from Guangfuhui

147
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,839
plotted to assassinate
Naval Minister Zaixun and Sa Zhenbing.

148
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,040
Luckily, he failed.

149
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,160
He was captured and executed.

150
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,600
He even ranted wildly during his trial,

151
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,480
claiming it is better
to die a day earlier

152
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,800
for the tree of freedom
to be nourished by blood a day earlier.

153
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,120
As a day sooner it's nourished,

154
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,759
it flourishes

155
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,360
and blooms a day sooner.

156
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,040
In March of the next year,

157
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,600
rebel Wang Jingwei of Tongmenghui

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,079
intended to assassinate Prince Zaifeng.

159
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,480
He should have been executed.

160
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,839
But later, Prince Zaifeng showed mercy

161
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,759
and granted him life imprisonment.

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
He's still in prison to this day.

163
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,160
In October,

164
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,360
Prince Regent decided to move

165
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,519
the constitutionalism deadline
originally set

166
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,079
in Year Nine of the Xuantong Era
to Year Five

167
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,519
to establish a congress.

168
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,600
That's all?

169
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,600
You may leave.

170
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,440
Understood.

171
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,440
Getai.

172
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Good morning, Muqing.

173
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,240
What did you...?

174
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,600
I asked them to tell me
about what has happened

175
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,080
in these 12 years.

176
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,120
You have been listening
to these all night?

177
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,799
I have already identified the suspect.

178
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,799
Wanhe?

179
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,960
A maid of Kunning Palace?

180
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,519
Muqing,

181
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,120
forgive my dullness.

182
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,639
Not only has Wanhe
never entered Wenyuan Pavilion

183
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,960
in the past half-year...

184
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
In the past half-year,

185
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,720
she has never been near Wenhua Hall,

186
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,399
right?

187
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,519
Yes.

188
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,480
Therefore, I don't know
why there would be anything unusual.

189
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,399
Wanhe's residence is on the east side
of the palace city.

190
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,919
The places she frequents on duty

191
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,399
are Kunning Palace and Ningshou Palace.

192
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,080
About how to get from her residence
to these two palaces,

193
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,519
you two should be very clear, right?

194
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,159
By way of Archery Pavilion

195
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,879
or going through three gates.

196
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,480
That's right.

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,559
But relatively,

198
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,080
the first method saves over 20 steps

199
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
and three flights of stairs

200
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,679
when compared to the second one.

201
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
The difference of 20-plus steps
and three flights of stairs

202
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
is imperceptible to ordinary people.

203
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,360
But for the maids and eunuchs
who have grown up

204
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,759
in the palace since childhood,

205
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,240
the difference is significant.

206
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,600
Moreover, she makes the journey
more than three times a day.

207
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
It would be unwise for her to detour.

208
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,679
Judging from the daily travel records
of the maids,

209
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,799
just half a year ago,

210
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,360
Wanhe would go through Donghua Gate

211
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,480
to Archery Pavilion to head north.

212
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,000
But in the past half-year, she switched
to passing through three gates.

213
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,639
Why?

214
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,000
It's because
the former route required her

215
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
to pass by Wenyuan Pavilion.

216
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,000
That's right.

217
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,240
Wanhe deliberately changed her route.

218
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,679
And there's only one reason
she did this.

219
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,919
To avoid suspicion.

220
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,200
Go arrest her.

221
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,480
Bring Wanhe to the imperial yamen
for questioning.

222
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,200
Yes!

223
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,039
Getai,

224
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,639
I have a question.

225
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,240
In year 1909,

226
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,360
why did the Prince Regent
only dismiss Yuan Shikai from office

227
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,960
and not charge him with a crime?

228
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,519
I do not know either.

229
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:52,960
Why?

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,559
Are you acquainted with Yuan Shikai?

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,799
No, I'm not.

232
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,240
Or I am, in some way.

233
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,279
Without that wretch's betrayal
and leak to the Empress Dowager,

234
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,759
supporters
of the Reform Movement of 1898

235
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,559
wouldn't have been beheaded.

236
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,679
And the late emperor wouldn't
have been confined.

237
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,919
The clouds always
blot out the sun's brilliance.

238
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,240
The absence of Chang'an
in sight makes one worried.

239
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,919
Had the reform succeeded at the time,

240
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,919
by now, Qing would have already
completed its reform

241
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,840
and its national strength
would be much greater than today,

242
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,200
nor would there be any rebels
daring to stir up unrest

243
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,879
even to the point of rebellion.

244
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,039
Mr. Mu,

245
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,240
Mr. Cunqing urgently summons you.

246
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,200
Last night, Zhili Prefecture
sent over an urgent memorial.

247
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,360
Zhili Prefecture?

248
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,919
From the capital's eastern 11 counties
all the way to the seashore,

249
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,639
I've ordered the local yamen
to closely monitor

250
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,840
anything related to nine.

251
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,159
Sir, are you thinking
of Long Zhen Li Jiu?

252
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,159
I can't give up

253
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,000
on any suspicious clues, right?

254
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,879
Nine people died
at the Dagu Inn yesterday.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,919
The time

256
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,159
of the arrival of these nine people

257
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,240
is similar to the rumors of omens.

258
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,000
And they came from Japan in the east.

259
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,440
What is the most abundant in Japan?

260
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,679
Those rebels.

261
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,720
If these nine people returned
from the east to conspire a rebellion,

262
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
how could they die so unexpectedly?

263
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,919
Could it be that someone is secretly
safeguarding the Qing dynasty?

264
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,440
Sir,

265
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,519
the murder of those nine people
happened a day ago.

266
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,120
Even if it's related to rebellion,

267
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm afraid it will be difficult for us

268
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,639
to find the murderer
if we continue the investigation now.

269
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,440
I think the urgent matter at hand

270
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
is to first follow

271
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
the clues on the lost treasure map.

272
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,759
But as for this murder case,

273
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,559
I will not ignore it.

274
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,799
Then how will you handle it?

275
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,120
I'll send people to Dagu County

276
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,559
and quickly transport the corpses here

277
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,480
to ascertain their identities
and causes of death.

278
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,720
Let's do as you say.

279
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,159
It's time to confess.

280
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,559
Shall we start

281
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,519
questioning her?

282
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,399
No need for that.

283
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,480
Begin the torture.

284
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:12,353
(Palace gate access records)

285
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,679
Where are you going?

286
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,639
The Imperial Kitchen.

287
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Have you seen Jiang?

288
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
Jiang?

289
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,399
He came in the morning,

290
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,440
saying he had an upset stomach.

291
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,960
I let him go
since there wasn't much work.

292
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,399
What's wrong?

293
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,759
He did try to run.

294
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,840
Luckily, you discovered it in time.

295
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,480
To the torture chamber.

296
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,919
Cut him open

297
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,200
and see what he has swallowed.

298
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,440
A ring?

299
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,279
It's made in the West.

300
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,960
Muqing,

301
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,440
where are we going now?

302
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,240
Dengshikou.

303
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,639
Dengshikou?

304
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,440
There is a grocery store at Dengshikou

305
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,039
specializing in the trade
of Western items.

306
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,919
Mu!

307
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,000
Getai!

308
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,679
That maid could not bear the torture

309
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,480
and confessed.

310
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,080
She said she was

311
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,720
instigated by Jiang
of the Imperial Kitchen.

312
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,799
Did she mention the time of her theft?

313
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,320
It was on March 23rd.

314
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,480
And she handed it over
to Jiang on March 25th.

315
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,600
Was it in the morning or evening?

316
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,440
In the evening.

317
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,120
Mu,

318
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,279
should we continue the torture?

319
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:36,960
No need.

320
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,039
Have her executed in the torture chamber

321
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,960
immediately.

322
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes.

323
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Why stop the interrogation?

324
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,080
She's just a pawn.

325
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,120
Do you expect her to disclose
the mastermind?

326
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,519
Then why kill her?

327
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,799
She committed a grave crime.

328
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,759
We can only continue
to press her until she dies.

329
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,759
Rather than letting her suffer more,
it would

330
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,039
be better to grant her a quick death.

331
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,480
Muqing, you're merciful.

332
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,039
Are you wondering how I could tell

333
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,519
that Jiang
was Wanhe's inside accomplice?

334
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,879
Please enlighten me, Muqing.

335
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,039
From the records of movements,

336
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,960
I spotted the anomalies with Wanhe

337
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
and deduced that she was

338
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,039
the one who stole the treasure map
from Wenyuan Pavilion.

339
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,039
But maids cannot leave the palace.

340
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,720
So there must be an inside accomplice

341
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,159
to get the map out.

342
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:19,759
Exactly.

343
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,080
Or the stealing would be meaningless.

344
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,600
I reviewed the palace gate

345
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,039
(access records
for the past six months.)

346
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,639
(The Imperial Kitchen had six servants
who often went out to purchase.)

347
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,879
(The other servants only go out)

348
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,480
(for about four hours.)

349
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,759
(But Jiang needed five hours.)

350
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
He needed one more hour?

351
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,759
At first, I was wondering

352
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,440
whether Jiang was slower

353
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,879
and took longer than others.

354
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,440
But judging by the records,

355
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,360
he didn't come back
later than others each time.

356
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,039
Instead, he left the palace
an hour earlier.

357
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:43,919
Would a servant who spent

358
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,240
most of his life

359
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,000
in the Imperial Kitchen
be so diligent and dedicated?

360
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,039
So he was an accomplice.

361
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,320
I wasn't sure at first.

362
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,440
Unfortunately,

363
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,639
Jiang must have heard

364
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,600
about Wanhe's trouble
and wanted to run away.

365
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,279
And then my speculation was confirmed.

366
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,320
Many places in the capital

367
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,039
sell Western items.

368
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,320
Why are you so sure

369
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,080
that he went to the store at Dengshikou?

370
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,919
The distance.

371
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,600
From the Imperial Kitchen to Dengshikou,

372
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,440
the round trip takes about an hour.

373
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,080
On the morning of March 26th,

374
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,799
what did Jiang give you?

375
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
The morning before yesterday,

376
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,639
Mr. Jiang gave me
an old, worn leather hat.

377
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,559
He said it was for a relative of his.

378
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:18,840
And then?

379
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,320
Someone came that day

380
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,600
with nine copper coins,
as Mr. Jiang said.

381
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,080
The coins were just like yours.

382
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,279
What did that person look like?

383
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,919
Well...

384
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,440
That person had a tattoo on his hand.

385
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,639
(What kind of tattoo?)

386
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,320
(I don't know how to describe it.)

387
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,159
The brush and paper.

388
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay.

389
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
That's right.

390
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,679
It looks exactly like this one.

391
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,080
So you know about it, sir.

392
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,679
Please come inside.

393
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,960
For people,

394
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,039
when luck comes,

395
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,400
it can't be stopped.

396
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,240
But if you're out of luck,

397
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,880
you could even

398
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,359
have an unlikely combination
like two-three-five in the dice game.

399
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,359
Come on. Let's drink up.

400
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,240
Drink it.

401
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,960
Fill it up.

402
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,720
(What does that tattoo mean?)

403
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,519
It's the mark of Qilin Formation
of the former Elite Knight Battalion.

404
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,720
Qilin Formation?

405
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
It was made up of imperial guards

406
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,160
dedicated to the late emperor's hunting.

407
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,039
Each one of them has on their hand

408
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,559
a mark of a Qilin

409
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,799
to signify their unique status.

410
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,680
This is the first time
I have heard of it.

411
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,640
They are not part
of the regular establishment.

412
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,400
Those who weren't
by the late emperor's side

413
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
know very little about it.

414
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,359
Does Qilin Formation still exist now?

415
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,920
No.

416
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,000
After the Wuxu Reform,

417
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,240
they were implicated

418
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,559
and expelled from Imperial Guards.

419
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,640
Qilin Formation
had a total of 11 people,

420
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,960
all of whom are well documented.

421
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,640
It's not difficult to locate them.

422
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:10,880
Understood.

423
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,440
I'll have someone investigate now.

424
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,279
He is not at home?

425
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,319
No.

426
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,279
Not in the fields, either?

427
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:18,960
No.

428
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,440
Not at the yamen either?

429
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,400
No.

430
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,640
Not in town either?

431
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,599
No.

432
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,000
Where could Wang Jialuo have gone?

433
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,559
Could he have gone
to pursue the murderer?

434
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,720
Sir, I agree with you.

435
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,240
Wang Jialuo has been a stubborn person.

436
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,119
He's persistent.

437
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,559
If someone in the neighboring villages

438
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,519
loses a chicken,

439
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,480
he will chase it 20 li

440
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,519
to bring it back.

441
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,640
Wang Jialuo has been a constable
for six years now.

442
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,759
Although there were no major cases here,

443
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,680
not a single case handled by him

444
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,839
was left unresolved.

445
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,319
In my opinion, his problem
is that his studying

446
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,720
has ruined his brain.

447
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,599
It's his father's fault.

448
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,559
His father became a Xiucai in 1877.

449
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,119
He kept taking exams
for the next ten years

450
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,519
but achieved no scholarly title.

451
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,559
Later, his father

452
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,799
set his hopes on Wang Jialuo.

453
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,960
Since childhood,

454
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,559
Wang Jialuo has read classics well.

455
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,000
He has studied for over a decade.

456
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,880
Then, in 1905,

457
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,920
the Emperor
abolished the imperial examination.

458
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,119
Only then did he join our county yamen
as a constable.

459
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
Help me think this through, will you?

460
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,960
Shuntian Prefecture
has already issued an order

461
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,039
to forbid local officials
from interfering with this case.

462
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,039
If Wang Jialuo

463
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,839
persists relentlessly,

464
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,559
would it cause any trouble

465
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,640
for Dagu County?

466
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,640
I have already thought of that.

467
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,839
Let's alter the roster

468
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,880
of the county yamen

469
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,599
and remove Wang Jialuo's name.

470
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,680
This way,

471
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,119
no matter the trouble
he stirs up outside,

472
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,519
it has nothing to do
with our county yamen.

473
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,880
By then, if they come to us,

474
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,039
we can just say
he's not from our county yamen,

475
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,119
and that he was a temporary helper
hired by us.

476
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,079
Temporary?

477
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,920
Helper.

478
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm a constable from Dagu.

479
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,119
I'm on a case.

480
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,119
Have you seen anyone in Lingxi attire

481
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,359
with a strange accent?

482
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:58,920
(Sir,)

483
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,160
(may I ask you about some people?)

484
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,880
(Have you seen anyone from Lingxi?)

485
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:02,920
(Hengyi Inn)

486
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,799
You know, the ones that act all strange

487
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,519
and wear clothes

488
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,839
different from ours.

489
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,200
(The leader has a tooth gap.)

490
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,400
A big gap.

491
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,440
Have you seen

492
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,400
someone with a Lingxi accent?

493
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,359
How does it sound?

494
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,160
- Good!
- Bravo!

495
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,039
Sugar-coated haws!

496
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,160
- Good!
- Bravo!

497
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,960
Sugar figures!

498
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,559
- Good!
- Bravo!

499
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,519
- Good!
- Bravo!

500
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,880
(Long Zhen Li Jiu)

501
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,400
(will change the nation
at harvest time.)

502
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,000
Getai,

503
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,759
let's not return
to the department for now.

504
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,680
Okay.

505
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,359
And we're going...?

506
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,839
Let's go to another place.

507
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,720
Where is it?

508
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,000
The Examination Hall.

509
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:04,448
(Yong'an Pawnshop)

510
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,488
(Yong'an Pawnshop)

511
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,319
There you go.

512
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,799
That was a woman.

513
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,000
And her kung fu was a bit strange.

514
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,319
She used shurikens as hidden weapons.

515
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,880
She was a ninja from Japan.

516
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,799
A Japanese?

517
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,000
The nine from the Dagu Inn

518
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,359
just returned from Japan.

519
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,680
They must have been watched all along.

520
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,680
It seems the Japanese

521
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,400
are after the secret treasure too.

522
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,599
So this is the map
for the Altar Treasure?

523
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,559
The Altar Treasure

524
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,200
contains not only a vast fortune

525
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,960
but also Shaolin's profound scriptures
in martial arts.

526
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,319
The Imperial Household Department
has spent centuries and great effort

527
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,599
but has never been able to find it.

528
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,680
This map only shows the appearance
of a mountain and a river.

529
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,680
But we can't make out which mountain

530
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:56,960
or which river it is.

531
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,279
It's as if

532
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,559
we know that something

533
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,000
is placed inside a box.

534
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,519
But we simply cannot find

535
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,440
where the box is

536
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,880
or which room it's in.

537
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,880
This treasure map lacks a key part.

538
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,519
It's incomplete?

539
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,559
It surely is.

540
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,240
The nine people from Dagu Inn

541
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,279
came from Japan.

542
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,920
Their purpose

543
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,400
was to meet with someone

544
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
who held clues to the treasure.

545
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,119
So it seems that Tan Xian

546
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,519
indeed knows the secret
to unlocking the treasure.

547
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,079
- Sir.
- Sir.

548
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,920
No need for formalities. Speak directly.

549
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,279
Sir,

550
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,200
I have ascertained three things.

551
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,680
First, the rebels communicate using

552
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,000
nine coins from the former eras.

553
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
(Tongzhi Qianlong Shunzhi)
Nine coins from three different eras.

554
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,400
Three plus nine equals 12.

555
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,000
What's the significance of it?

556
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,759
From Emperor Nurhaci,
who established the dynasty,

557
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,160
to the current Emperor Xuantong,

558
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,720
there have been 12 emperors.

559
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,519
I've been thinking for quite some time

560
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,119
about how the current emperor

561
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,599
differs from his ancestors.

562
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,960
After much thought, I think
it's the imperial examination.

563
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,240
Exactly.

564
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,839
When the current Emperor
ascended to the throne,

565
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,359
the imperial examination was abolished.

566
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,400
Yes.

567
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,319
But not the Examination Hall.

568
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,160
I think

569
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,480
that the 'East' mentioned
in Long Zhen Li Jiu refers

570
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,599
(to the Eastern Suburban
Examination Hall.)

571
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,000
And the nine fire dragons?

572
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
They are actually the explosive devices

573
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,599
placed around the Examination Hall.

574
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
(Now that the Examination Hall
is forsaken)

575
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,519
(and dilapidated,)

576
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,640
(it's perfect for concealment.)

577
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,599
So, it seems these nine fire dragons

578
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,480
are indeed nine fireworks.

579
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,279
Once ignited near the Examination Hall,

580
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,400
onlookers at that time will see

581
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,720
as if fire dragons were descending
from heaven.

582
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,279
Exactly.

583
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,079
Have you checked the Examination Hall?

584
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:36,880
I just did.

585
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,279
I examined the Examination Hall

586
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,920
thoroughly.

587
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,559
(I discovered remnants
of sulfur and saltpeter in the soil,)

588
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,160
(signs of being disturbed)

589
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,279
(between brushes and grass,)

590
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,200
(and some branches
bearing scratch marks.)

591
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,880
I am convinced that the rebels

592
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,599
have placed the explosive devices
among them secretly.

593
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,799
So, you mean that on May 11th,

594
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,960
they need only to ignite the fireworks

595
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
to signal the start of an uprising?

596
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,359
This matter must be kept confidential

597
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,680
from anyone.

598
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,279
Should anyone be found leaking,

599
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,799
how shall they be dealt with?

600
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,039
Executed on the spot.

601
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,240
On the afternoon of March 23rd,
Wanhe sneaked

602
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,359
into Wenyuan Pavilion.

603
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,440
Yet there were no records
of her whereabouts at that time.

604
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,279
And none of the imperial guards guarding

605
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,559
and patrolling between Donghua Gate

606
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,680
and Wenhua Hall noticed at all.

607
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,200
It was certainly not a coincidence.

608
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,519
It's even less likely an opportunity

609
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,880
that came upon Wanhe.

610
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,640
So I went to ask

611
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,960
the on-duty guards that day

612
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,359
and found out that afternoon

613
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,400
that it was you who summoned the guards

614
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,160
to the entrance of Wenhua Hall
for a lecture.

615
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,160
The whole process took about 15 minutes.

616
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,079
So you created

617
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,599
that opportunity for Wanhe on purpose.

618
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,920
If you were not an insider,

619
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,039
who would it be?

620
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,400
It's impressive.

621
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,680
Guwalgiya Khankh

622
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,680
from Xiangbai Banner.

623
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,400
You entered the department
in the 27th year of the Guangxu Era

624
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:59,759
and have been working for me
for ten years.

625
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,079
Only after six years since he came
did I find out he was a spy.

626
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,079
I didn't expect you to expose him

627
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,720
in just one day.

628
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,880
That's truly impressive.

629
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,519
It's just

630
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,720
that you were too hasty.

631
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:17,640
Yes.

632
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
I was too hasty.

633
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,200
Right. This way,

634
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,680
no one can pass our message

635
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,960
to the mastermind now.

636
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:25,880
Sir,

637
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,720
the one behind the theft
of Wenyuan Pavilion

638
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,079
orchestrated by Khankh

639
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:31,000
must be the main instigator
of the rebellion.

640
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,079
Now that you already know who it is,

641
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,119
please instruct.

642
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,000
I will immediately arrest them
and bring them to justice.

643
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,039
I dare not act against him rashly.

644
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,400
Why is that?

645
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,680
Without solid evidence,

646
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,160
how dare I move against a royal member?

647
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,200
Especially when he is
a Prince of the First Rank.

648
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,440
A Prince of the First Rank?

649
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,799
He is Prince Regent Zaifeng's cousin,

650
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,920
Aisin-Gioro Zaiqi.

651
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,519
Prince Qi?

652
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,799
Prince Qi

653
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,240
is ranked ninth,

654
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,200
born under the sign of Li
with a natal of Fire.

655
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,720
I want to know what Prince Qi is up to.

656
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,000
I want to know with whom he associates,

657
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,519
the places he has visited,

658
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,880
and the food he eats every day.

659
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,200
Find all of this out for me.

660
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,559
Yes.

661
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,079
You got a pawn but lost a rook.

662
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,122
(Prince Qi's Mansion)

663
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,519
The Qing dynasty today

664
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,519
and Britain

665
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,240
220 years ago

666
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,519
share remarkable similarities.

667
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,640
Prince Qi, you understand
our country's development

668
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,480
very well.

669
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,200
I've even sent my young daughter
to study in Britain.

670
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,160
How could I not understand you?

671
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,039
Good afternoon.

672
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,559
Good afternoon, princess.

673
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,880
We need to understand you

674
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,559
because your country
is now very powerful.

675
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,119
I hope that the Qing in the future

676
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,480
can also be as strong as you.

677
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,599
The current Qing dynasty
cannot be considered strong.

678
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,039
The truly weak one is not the Qing,

679
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,440
but the imperial family.

680
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,599
I didn't expect you to say such a thing.

681
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,519
Why couldn't I say it?

682
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,599
Just because
I'm a Prince of the First Rank

683
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,400
and a member
of the imperial family's cabinet?

684
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,000
The imperial autocracy

685
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,480
is already at an impasse.

686
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,039
The times have brought us here,

687
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,440
where imperial power
has become a burden.

688
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,119
Constitutionalism

689
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,960
is the sole path to Qing's resurgence.

690
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,759
Hearing you make such remarks,

691
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,240
I am truly surprised.

692
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,799
In fact, within the imperial family,

693
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,319
many share my view.

694
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,559
If that is the case,

695
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,000
why is your implementation
of constitutionalism still so difficult?

696
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,759
Implementing constitutionalism
can preserve

697
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,039
and strengthen the nation.

698
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,759
But then the imperial power
would be gone.

699
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,440
It's hard to let go of it.

700
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:09,079
However, if we cling to imperial power,

701
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,119
I fear that there may be
no nation left eventually.

702
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,920
At that time, the imperial family

703
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,640
and my title of Prince of the First Rank

704
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,720
will all vanish like smoke.

705
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,920
Prince Qi,

706
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,519
on the contrary, I feel

707
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,960
it might take many years
for a country controlled

708
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:30,000
by the Aisin-Gioro family

709
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,480
to achieve constitutionalism.

710
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,200
I think you are wrong.

711
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,799
It won't take long.

712
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,880
Perhaps it will happen this year.

713
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,720
Muqing.

714
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,000
Actually, what I hope for the most

715
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,079
is that those people intending to rebel

716
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,200
are from Tongmenghui.

717
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,640
Those people don't value their own lives

718
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,319
and are desperate outlaws.

719
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,559
They don't have a really effective army

720
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,880
and cannot turn the tables.

721
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:56,400
What I worry about

722
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
and fear the most

723
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,839
is Prince Qi.

724
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,880
He has grand ambitions

725
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,839
and a heart for reform.

726
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,240
Do you know he has a son-in-law?

727
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,960
No, I don't.

728
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,400
That man is named Zhong Haichao.

729
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,400
He serves in the Sixth Division
of the Beiyang Army.

730
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,119
This is truly worrisome.

731
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,160
Muqing,

732
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,400
you must remember.

733
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
Without solid evidence,

734
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,880
I cannot simply
pin the crime of rebellion

735
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
on Prince Qi's head arbitrarily.

736
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,119
So you must

737
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:28,720
capture the person

738
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,519
who stole the treasure map.

739
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,039
Understood.

740
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,240
Long clouds over Qinghai Lake
darken the snowy mountains.

741
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,960
The solitary city gazes distantly
at Yumen Pass.

742
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,599
I will breach the enemy's core.

743
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:40,799
Good.

744
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,519
Father,

745
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:46,079
do you believe that constitutionalism
will save this nation?

746
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,279
But would my uncles
think the same as you?

747
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:51,599
Them?

748
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:56,359
They would rather sign treaties
of land cession and indemnity

749
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:59,359
with the foreigners

750
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,640
than reduce their own stipends

751
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,279
by even a bit.

752
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,440
They have no country in their hearts.

753
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,440
They only think
of their own small homes.

754
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,160
What could they think about?

755
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,440
Indeed.

756
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,960
Showing them democracy

757
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,640
is even less likely.

758
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,599
Democracy?

759
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,400
Why don't you tell me

760
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,640
what democracy is?

761
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:24,039
It's managing the country jointly
based on the principle of equality.

762
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,319
Don't tell me you actually think

763
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,000
those hot-headed revolutionaries

764
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,559
can achieve great feats.

765
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,400
The likes of peddlers and foot soldiers

766
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,599
couldn't understand how
to be diligent and love the people.

767
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,359
And butchers couldn't understand

768
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,880
the governance of a dynasty.

769
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,759
We're in the Qing Dynasty.

770
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,680
Talking about democracy here

771
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,880
is a pipe dream.

772
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,039
You may leave now.

773
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,039
I have things to discuss with Haichao.

774
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,119
Take action on May 11th.

775
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,920
And there must be no mistakes.

776
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,839
Father, rest assured.

777
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,200
I've already made arrangements.

778
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,559
On the night of May 10th,

779
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,480
the troops stationed
thirty li east of the capital

780
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,839
will set out to the eastern suburbs.

781
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,640
When the Examination Hall
catches fire at midnight,

782
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,079
they will breach into the capital.

783
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,000
No need to breach.

784
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,160
Just enter the city.

785
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,680
The Imperial Guards
and the Imperial Household Department

786
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,839
simply cannot withstand your guns.

787
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,279
It's kind of sarcastic.

788
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,680
For the sake of the Qing Dynasty,

789
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,319
I have to go against it.

790
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,640
Father,

791
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,759
overthrowing the imperial family
and deposing the emperor is not hard.

792
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,200
But...

793
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:49,960
Are you worried about Beiyang?

794
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,880
Yes.

795
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,039
Even if I lead troops into the capital,

796
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,240
as long as Beiyang commands,
I will have to withdraw.

797
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,359
I've arranged everything.

798
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,920
Before May 11th,

799
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,279
I can get a treasure
that rivals a country's,

800
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,759
which is enough to appease Beiyang.

801
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,519
There is no time to waste.
We will set off tomorrow.

802
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,119
We have too many disciples.

803
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,920
We may attract unwanted attention.

804
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,800
So we'll head south separately.

805
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,840
I'll go with Ms. Huo, Huang Xing,

806
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,199
and some of the disciples

807
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,639
via the water route first.

808
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,239
After settling down in Shanghai,

809
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,880
we'll first explore our connections.

810
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,800
Tang Yu,

811
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,719
tomorrow at dawn, take a few helpers

812
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,519
to buy some clothes
in the Tianjin Concession.

813
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,679
We should look

814
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,920
as if we just returned from Japan,

815
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,079
similar to those people at the Dagu Inn.

816
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,360
No problem.

817
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,400
Then you leave by land,

818
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,760
traveling through Shandong to Shanghai.

819
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,199
Bufan,

820
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,280
maybe I should lead the way

821
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,960
and go to Shanghai via the water route.

822
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,840
After all, I have been to Shanghai.

823
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,280
I'm a bit more familiar with it

824
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,199
and better
at finding the right connections.

825
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,199
Alright then.

826
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,920
Thank you, Huanjie.

827
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,159
Don't mention it.

828
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:01,280
I'll go first.

829
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,880
You can follow me
with Ms. Huo at your own pace.

830
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,800
You have already instructed us.

831
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,519
Yet Yu Huanjie insists
on doing it differently.

832
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,199
It's okay.

833
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,239
Let him be.

834
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,159
He just wants to get to Shanghai first

835
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,519
to have a bit of fun secretly.

836
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,679
I've long heard
it's a place full of temptations.

837
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,440
If he wants to go play, let him.

838
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,840
Why didn't you argue?

839
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,679
You are the sect leader.

840
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,639
Why do you always give in to him?

841
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,280
As you said,

842
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,280
it's giving in.

843
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,159
And I must give in.

844
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:03,960
Don't move.

845
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,079
Let me do it.

846
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,119
You never give in to those
who provoke the Rongtian Sword Sect.

847
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:30,000
And you never give in on the title

848
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,320
of the country's number one swordsman.

849
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,440
So why is it
that once you return to the sect,

850
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,039
you give in to everything?

851
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,280
I am a swordsman

852
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,079
who only wishes to live by the sword.

853
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,199
I never desired to be the sect leader.

854
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,480
But that responsibility
has been entrusted to me.

855
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,519
And I must bear it.

856
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:53,960
As the eldest disciple, Yu Huanjie

857
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,920
has always been dissatisfied
with not being the sect leader.

858
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,280
If I don't give in to him,

859
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,639
wouldn't it put the sect
into internal strife?

860
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,679
That wouldn't be
what my master wants to see.

861
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,719
Haven't you given in enough
to your master?

862
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,960
Ms. Huo.

863
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,760
There is no one else here.

864
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,440
It's just you and me.

865
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,519
I don't want to hear you
call me 'Ms. Huo'.

866
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,480
Bufan,

867
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,880
I am your junior sister.

868
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,960
Are you giving it back?

869
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:50,840
Huo Qin,

870
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,639
I can't keep it anymore.

871
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
So you're giving it back to me.

872
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,199
Yes.

873
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,119
I really want to kill you.

874
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,719
If I kill you,

875
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,119
there will be
no Rongtian Sword Sect anymore.

876
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,039
But all we have
is the Rongtian Sword Sect.

877
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,199
It's barely clinging to life.

878
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,400
I will surely make Rongtian

879
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,599
the top sword sect in the world.

880
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,880
I've had enough of these words.

881
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,760
Your master used to say this every day.

882
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,079
He's dead.

883
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,719
And now it's your turn
to say it every day.

884
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,519
If you can really do that,

885
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,960
find the secret treasure

886
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,920
and then completely change us.

887
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,559
I will do it.

888
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,400
Sir?

889
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,679
Come in for a cup of tea.

890
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,199
No, thank you.

891
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,639
I came just to tell you

892
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,239
that I couldn't find the suspects.

893
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,920
But you needn't worry.

894
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,719
I'll be returning to Dagu shortly.

895
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,760
We have two more constables
at our county yamen.

896
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,559
With more hands on deck,
we'll surely find them.

897
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,000
And I'll also inform
the neighboring county's yamen

898
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,920
to list them as wanted.

899
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,719
Those criminals are bound to be caught.

900
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,000
Thank you, sir.

901
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,159
Lin Anjing,

902
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,719
where will you go next?

903
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,239
I...

904
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,760
I want to be alone for a few days

905
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,480
to compose myself
before making any plans.

906
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,719
Sir,

907
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,400
do you think Chen Wu has struck it rich?

908
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,320
Chen Wu?

909
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,159
What riches could he possibly make?

910
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,280
You don't know?

911
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,119
Look.

912
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,559
It's a big banknote worth thirty taels.

913
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,679
It really is a big banknote.

914
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,239
Did he go to Lingxi these past few days?

915
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,679
I don't know. He probably didn't.

916
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,159
I can see him every day.

917
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,239
A banknote from Lingxi?

918
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,000
What's wrong?

919
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:49,840
Wait a moment.

920
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:52,880
Sir.

921
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:53,760
Yes?

922
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,320
Let me see the banknote.

923
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,360
Where did this come from?

924
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,920
Chen Wu gave this to us
when he bought wine.

925
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,559
Who is Chen Wu?

926
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,280
Muqing, we've found

927
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,519
the 11 men
from the former Elite Knight Battalion's

928
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,519
Qilin Formation.

929
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,840
Among them,

930
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,880
five are still in the army
of the Xilin Gol League.

931
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,960
Four have passed away.
Two died from illness,

932
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,920
one died in an accident during training,

933
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
and one fell into a pond
after drinking too much.

934
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,880
What about the other two?

935
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:25,960
The other two

936
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,800
left the Xilin Gol League
a few years ago.

937
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
One of them

938
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,639
returned home
to take care of his elderly parents.

939
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,639
And the other one?

940
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,960
The other one, nicknamed Chen Wu,

941
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,760
was expelled from the army six years ago

942
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,199
for drinking and gambling.

943
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:37,760
Where is he now?

944
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,119
We've found that he has been

945
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,880
frequenting the area
of Gegu Town in Tianjin,

946
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
either getting dead drunk every day

947
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,920
or gambling all night in casinos.

948
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,440
He is our target.

949
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:51,880
Open!

950
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,000
Open now!

951
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,639
Eight in red!

952
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,679
Who are you? You're courting death.

953
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:02,639
I'm looking for you,

954
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,679
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
Chen Wu.

955
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,000
A mere constable

956
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,559
who pretends to be all-mighty!

957
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,920
Either you explain everything to me

958
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,639
or come back with me to the yamen.

959
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,199
Fight outside if you want to.

960
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,440
You don't get to run wild here.

961
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,039
Get him!

962
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,519
Imperial Household Department!

963
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,679
All unrelated persons stand back.

964
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,239
Halt!

965
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,840
Wait.

966
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,360
Wait, gentlemen!

967
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,239
I am Wang Jialuo,
the constable from Dagu.

968
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:01,760
He's my suspect.

969
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,639
We're handling it.

970
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:04,320
All unrelated persons should stand back.

971
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,039
- I'm...
- You're unrelated.

972
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,119
Take one more step forward,

973
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,719
and I will execute you on the spot.

974
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:24,960
Where is the thing?

975
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,320
What thing?

976
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,440
What thing? I don't know.

977
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,079
I really don't know.

978
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,480
Wait. I'll speak.

979
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,360
I'll speak.

980
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,840
Someone gave me a large sum of money

981
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,239
to deliver an item.

982
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,440
All I had to do
was get a worn-out leather hat

983
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,119
from a grocery shop in the capital,

984
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,199
deliver it to a pawnshop
in Yong'an, Tianjin,

985
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,760
and then hand over the pawn ticket
to the contact.

986
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,559
Beyond that, I know nothing.

987
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,159
Sir!

988
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,480
It was Lord Khankh

989
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,159
from the Imperial Household Department
who made me do it.

990
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:31,679
Also,

991
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,920
that contact

992
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,320
(was dressed in an odd manner,)

993
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:41,280
(seemingly in Lingxi attire.)

994
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,320
I've told you everything I know.

995
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,039
As for the rest,

996
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,440
I really don't know.
