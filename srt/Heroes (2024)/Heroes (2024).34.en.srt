1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,799
Before tonight,

2
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,240
Wang Jialuo definitely wouldn't know

3
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,840
that Lin Haohan was the Prajna inheritor

4
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,640
and that his kung fu skills
were so good.

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,039
At that time,
you were also at Ze Ze Inn.

6
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,640
Why didn't you dare
to go out and fight him?

7
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,560
I have told you before.

8
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,960
I don't know kung fu.

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,359
My value is not in kung fu.

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,560
And my value is far greater than yours.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,480
You were going to die down there.

12
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,439
I would not join you.

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,640
I remember you telling me

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,359
that you made a deal with Zhong Haichao

15
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,879
to encircle Ze Ze Inn tonight.

16
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,159
Why didn't I see Beiyang's soldiers?

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,439
Men Sandao represents the Department.

18
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,959
Wang Jialuo represents the yamen.

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Zhong Haichao
couldn't point Beiyang's guns directly

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,280
at them.

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,359
By allowing us
to kill without hindrance,

22
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,840
he is already following the agreement.

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,199
If he knows
that the Prajna inheritor is coming,

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,919
will it change?

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,240
It definitely will.

26
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,800
The collaboration with Zhong Haichao
is fragile to begin with.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,199
If he finds out
that the Prajna inheritor has emerged,

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,159
he might come out
in full force to seize them.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,599
He doesn't know yet.

30
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,360
So we must hurry.

31
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,840
Go back

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
and continue to stay
by Wang Jialuo's side.

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,319
At least for now,

34
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,159
he is still our most valuable card.

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,159
He doesn't have the seal.

36
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,719
But others don't know that.

37
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,840
Therefore,

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,000
he is still important.

39
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,439
Moreover,

40
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,800
Lin Haohan may know
how to obtain the seal.

41
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,759
After all, he is a true inheritor.

42
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,520
Understood.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,199
Compared to the many men
you've been with before,

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,319
is Wang Jialuo considered good
among them?

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
I know you're the top agent
in the intelligence group.

46
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,800
Your past is too illustrious.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,319
Even the top courtesan in the brothel

48
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,000
doesn't have as many patrons as you do.

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,759
Yes, I am not as valuable as you.

50
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,639
Not nearly as much.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,080
I think

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
not many people can be like you,

53
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,280
who can romance any kind of man

54
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,759
and manipulate them.

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
Do you really wish to die?

56
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
I wish you would die.

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Why don't you believe what I say?

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,480
You are a person with a name.

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,560
You can't rival me.

60
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,920
Remember.

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,199
I have no name.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,839
If you dare provoke me again,

63
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,319
you will die.

64
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:31,552
=Heroes=

65
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,976
=Episode 34=

66
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,959
Mr. Muqing said you have a problem.

67
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,240
I doubted it.

68
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,800
I told him I had checked.

69
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,079
He said my checking must be incorrect.

70
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,480
I just wanted to tell him

71
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
that my checking was correct,

72
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,759
that I trusted you,

73
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,480
and that you were completely normal.

74
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,680
When I first joined the county yamen,

75
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,720
the constable who led me once told me

76
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,480
that if I had doubts about anything,

77
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,480
it was mostly as I suspected.

78
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,959
I have always remembered that.

79
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,560
I had my doubts a few times

80
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,399
with you,

81
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,680
but I still trusted you.

82
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,160
I should have thought sooner

83
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,360
about why I,

84
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,839
a poor constable

85
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,600
with no money

86
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,720
and no power,

87
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,240
could get you,
a woman who studied abroad,

88
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,919
to be interested in me.

89
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,879
Lin Anjing,

90
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,840
you...

91
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
you really are someone

92
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,039
who can romance any man.

93
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,879
Jialuo,

94
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,120
you are different from others.

95
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,399
Because I am useful to you?

96
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,960
I chose this path

97
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,240
for myself.

98
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
Now I have no choice.

99
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,399
It's true that I deceived you

100
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,519
and followed you to gather intelligence.

101
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,679
But my feelings for you are true.

102
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,080
And I married you willingly.

103
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,559
Jialuo,

104
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,960
will you take me with you?

105
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,360
Take me back to Dagu.

106
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,639
I am willing to abandon the current me.

107
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,519
As long as I can be with you,

108
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
I am willing to go anywhere

109
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,240
and live any kind of life.

110
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,399
What is your name?

111
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,240
Are you Lin Anjing?

112
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,799
Jialuo,

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,559
I...

114
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,320
How can you still expect me
to trust you?

115
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,159
I am an imperial constable.

116
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,480
I must protect the court's safety
until death.

117
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
You are allied with foreign enemies,

118
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,759
coveting the court's treasures,

119
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,679
stealing secrets,

120
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,799
and harming this country.

121
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,960
Your crimes are unforgivable.

122
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
Unforgivable!

123
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,399
According to the Qing Code,

124
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,960
you shall be executed.

125
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,919
I have no name.

126
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,200
I can't remember my name.

127
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,799
I like the name Lin Anjing.

128
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,720
It's because

129
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,120
this name belongs to you.

130
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,159
Take me back to Dagu.

131
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,399
I want to go back to Dagu

132
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,480
with you.

133
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,559
Take me home.

134
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,360
Let's go home.

135
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,399
I will take you back to Dagu.

136
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,559
For you,
I shall not marry again in this life.

137
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,960
I must find the Altar Treasure.

138
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,360
I swear to death

139
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
that I will maintain peace
for the court.

140
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,639
Greetings, General Zhong.

141
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,080
General Zhong.

142
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,080
Zhuo Bufan?

143
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,559
Yes.

144
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,480
Nothing was gained?

145
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,360
Since you have waited until now,

146
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,440
you should know that the inheritor
of Prajna hasn't appeared.

147
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,559
So it's true that you gained nothing.

148
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,559
If we only look at the results,

149
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,919
that is indeed the case.

150
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,879
Alright then.

151
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,440
I know you have done your best.

152
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,960
I don't blame you.

153
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,639
But don't think
about getting any rewards anymore.

154
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,080
Give the seal back to me.

155
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
I don't have the seal on me right now.

156
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,480
You actually left

157
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,039
such an important thing in the inn?

158
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,440
Yu Huanjie.

159
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,679
Yes?

160
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,840
Go retrieve the seal for me in a moment.

161
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,759
Yes.

162
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,879
Does that mean there's nothing else
you need me to do, General?

163
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,639
Come here.

164
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,440
I want to have a word with you.

165
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,000
Watch out, General.

166
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,759
Bufan,

167
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,344
let's go.

168
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,159
Let's go!

169
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,000
Rest assured, General.

170
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,080
I will surely kill Zhuo Bufan.

171
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,039
Go after them!

172
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,039
Remember to bring the seals back to me.

173
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,319
Let me go.

174
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,559
Let me go.

175
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,400
Where's our leader?

176
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,440
What have you done to him?

177
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,759
Let go!

178
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,759
Sect leader?

179
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,920
I am the sect leader now.

180
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,279
What good comes
from following Zhuo Bufan?

181
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,039
You can't eat or live well.

182
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,759
You are as poor as beggars.

183
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,720
What does it matter how powerful he is?

184
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,400
Can he provide you with a good life?

185
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,119
With me, you can have a good life.

186
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,880
Besides, the other disciples
have already made their choice.

187
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,119
Yu Huanjie, what have you done
to the sect leader?

188
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,599
Stop calling Zhuo Bufan the sect leader!

189
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,720
(The keys to my house.)

190
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,279
Once I capture Zhuo Bufan

191
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,920
(and secure the Altar Treasure
for the court,)

192
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,279
(we'll come back)

193
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,240
(and live a good life here.)

194
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,319
(I'll plant the vegetables)

195
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,279
you want to eat in the yard for you.

196
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,160
And if you want to eat meat,

197
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,799
I'll raise pigs, chickens,
and ducks for you.

198
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,559
Lin Anjing!

199
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,880
Lin Anjing!

200
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,224
What's wrong?

201
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,112
Something's off.

202
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,039
Aren't they your men at the door?

203
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,160
No.

204
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:13,799
No?

205
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,519
Wait here.

206
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,440
I'll take a look inside.

207
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:19,759
Be careful.

208
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,920
Mr. Cunqing is no longer with us?

209
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:03,880
Muqing,

210
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,000
from this moment on,

211
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,400
you are at my service.

212
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,599
Before starting this task,

213
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,799
Mr. Cunqing had given me a strict order

214
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,920
saying that I should
take no other orders

215
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,240
before I finish my task
and return to the capital,

216
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,759
no matter whether he was dead or alive.

217
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,720
Exactly.

218
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,960
It was typical of Mr. Cunqing.

219
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,160
He would indeed
issue such a strict order.

220
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,480
But Muqing,

221
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,160
if you still follow his orders now,

222
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,559
everything will be meaningless.

223
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,640
Long Zhen Li Jiu.

224
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,640
Change the nation at harvest time.

225
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Today is the 7th day.

226
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,440
Yes, the 7th day of the 5th month.

227
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,240
Grain in Ear is coming soon.

228
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,720
It's only four days away.

229
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,799
Shouldn't you be busy
with the uprising in the capital?

230
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,720
What?

231
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,880
Aren't you changing the nation?

232
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
What is needed for an uprising
is momentum,

233
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,400
not timing.

234
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,599
A few days earlier or later
doesn't matter.

235
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
It's the nation that's in a hurry.

236
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,119
I'm not.

237
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,039
Muqing,

238
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,680
from now on, if you serve me,

239
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,799
I will surely offer you more
than what Cunqing did.

240
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,440
He was nobody.

241
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,480
He could give you nothing.

242
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,960
You should first take over
Cunqing's position as minister.

243
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,480
You were demoted to the Xianglan Banner
when you were punished earlier.

244
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,799
You'll be promoted
to Zhenghuang Banner later.

245
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,920
And within half a year,

246
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,319
I will promote you
to a first-rank official.

247
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,200
The first rank is very crucial.

248
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,720
As a first-rank official,

249
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:59,400
you will be a suitable match
for Wulan Shan.

250
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,759
Since 12 years ago,

251
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:05,640
I have accepted you as my son-in-law.

252
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,680
You are a stubborn person.

253
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,559
But you have vision.

254
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,640
Do you know?

255
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:17,400
Before Cunqing died,

256
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,279
he felt proud

257
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,000
that he could end his life
in the most dignified manner

258
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,119
that the court could offer.

259
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,599
But he completely collapsed

260
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,400
after I told him something.

261
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,319
I told him a fact that he didn't know.

262
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,480
Zaifeng told me

263
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,400
that constitutionalism
was too slow and too difficult,

264
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,519
with too many hindrances.

265
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,039
He also

266
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
told me

267
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,440
to do it quicker

268
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,400
and be decisive in troubled times.

269
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,880
Actually,

270
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,759
Zaifeng has always known
about the matter of my coup.

271
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,799
He never stopped me.

272
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,000
He even encouraged me in secret.

273
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,599
Because he was very clear

274
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,480
that this is what leads Qing

275
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,720
onto the path
of becoming a powerful nation.

276
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,960
Although it's brutal,

277
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,759
it's the fastest way.

278
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,920
He even hoped
that I could accomplish this great task

279
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,599
as soon as possible.

280
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,200
I need you

281
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
because you have talent.

282
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,559
I want to accept you as my son-in-law

283
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,559
because you are a person
of great virtue.

284
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,599
The promise I gave you
wasn't to buy you off.

285
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,240
You don't have anything
worth buying off.

286
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,880
Muqing,

287
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,599
a new dynasty

288
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,039
needs pillars.

289
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,839
And you could be one.

290
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,480
Think about it carefully.

291
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,559
When we get out of the woods,

292
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,039
we'll try to hire a carriage to leave.

293
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,768
Wait.

294
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,960
Neither of us can leave like this.

295
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,079
Listen to me.

296
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,519
Just go and leave me alone.

297
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,759
What will you do then?

298
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,279
Zhuo Bufan,

299
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,400
for more than a decade,
I've been following you.

300
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,559
Only today can I take the lead.

301
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,920
As long as I have a breath left,

302
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,519
I'll be with you.

303
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,000
Let's go together.

304
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
Nothing to be afraid of.

305
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,039
I joined Rongtian at the age of 13.

306
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,680
Others bullied me.

307
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,240
But you always protected me.

308
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,119
Later on, I grew up.

309
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,839
Some senior brothers harassed me.

310
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,839
You were the one
who drove them all away.

311
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,680
I had made up my mind back then

312
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,319
that I would follow you for life.

313
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,039
But your master made me marry him.

314
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,599
I was thinking

315
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,240
that once you offered to take me away,

316
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,160
I would go with you.

317
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,319
But he was your master.

318
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,240
You couldn't do anything.

319
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,480
Later on, your master died.

320
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,839
I wore this veil
and became Ms. Huo to you.

321
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,000
I know I am a burden.

322
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,039
But you have never abandoned me.

323
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,440
Huo Qin,

324
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,359
I will never leave you behind.

325
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,519
Starting today,

326
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,240
we'll adventure together.

327
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,200
Okay.

328
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,400
Let's adventure together.

329
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,359
When your wounds heal,

330
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,000
you will still be the best swordsman.

331
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,200
Without those people like Yu Huanjie

332
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,799
and the encumbrances of Rongtian,

333
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,279
we can live well.

334
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:09,839
Hang in there.

335
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,559
Hang in there.

336
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,119
We're about to make it out soon.

337
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,160
Zhuo Bufan,

338
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,519
I've waited for you for so many years.

339
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,160
Even if it were for my sake,

340
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,279
you have to hang in there.

341
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,759
You're shameless to come along.

342
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,279
How can I compare

343
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,359
with you on shameless deeds?

344
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,799
Huo Qin,

345
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,599
do you think I don't know
the disreputable affair

346
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,160
between you and Zhuo Bufan?

347
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,720
You traitors!

348
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,319
You are truly of the same ilk.

349
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,559
The entire sect sides with me.

350
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,200
And you are just two people.

351
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,240
Who are the traitors now?

352
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,799
The minority are the real traitors.

353
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,599
Zhuo Bufan of the Rongtian Sword Sect

354
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,279
colluded shamefully with Huo Qin

355
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,359
and betrayed the sect.

356
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,400
I, Yu Huanjie, will lead the disciples
to purge the sect today.

357
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Do you dare to come over?

358
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,480
Bufan,

359
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,720
your swordsmanship is brilliant.

360
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,440
But now you are injured,

361
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,519
and the residues of poison
are still in your body.

362
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,519
Do you really think
you are the Sword God?

363
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,119
Guys,

364
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:43,680
get them!

365
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,224
Huo Qin!

366
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,079
Bufan!

367
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,039
Huo Qin.

368
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,920
Men Sandao,

369
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,000
do you know
that I work for General Zhong

370
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,359
and Prince Qi?

371
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,039
So what?

372
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,880
You're not working for the Department.

373
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,279
It's our Rongtian Sword Sect's
internal affair.

374
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,200
You don't need to get involved in this.

375
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,480
What's the matter?

376
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,039
What can you do to me if I intervene?

377
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:15,839
That's right.

378
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,200
We're already here.

379
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,160
I refuse to believe

380
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,920
you can put up a fight against me

381
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,759
since you were poisoned
merely half a day ago.

382
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:26,880
Get them!

383
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,240
If this continues, we'll lose.

384
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,720
Then figure out something.

385
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,680
Why didn't you
bring your imperial guards?

386
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,559
We're outnumbered and outgunned.

387
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,559
I thought you were a master!

388
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:01,839
If everyone is a master,

389
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,880
being a master is of no use.

390
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,680
Run!

391
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,200
To where?

392
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,000
You want to run?

393
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:34,720
Let's go!

394
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,880
Go after them!

395
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:42,759
Are you alright, Huanjie?

396
00:32:46,656 --> 00:32:48,000
(Huang's Butcher Shop)

397
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,920
Muqing,

398
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,000
you go first.

399
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,720
Just leave us behind.

400
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,960
No more nonsense.

401
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,559
We've arrived.

402
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,720
What do we do now?

403
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,440
I don't know either.

404
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,559
However, my master told me

405
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,640
to come here in case of trouble.

406
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,680
Maybe we have our own people here.

407
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,119
Our own people?

408
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,680
What do you mean?

409
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,759
How could a butcher shop
side with Southern Shaolin?

410
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,920
Is this butcher one of our own?

411
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,839
It doesn't seem quite right.

412
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,480
But what if we consider
slaughtering pigs as liberating them?

413
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,559
Muqing,

414
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,920
you two should leave now.

415
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,119
If possible,

416
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,279
take Huo Qin with you.

417
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:43,920
I won't go.

418
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,240
I want to stay with you.

419
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,416
How about trying

420
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,640
to announce your identity?

421
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,880
My identity?

422
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,864
I'm a second-class imperial guard.

423
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,119
No.

424
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,119
The Bodhi inheritor.

425
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,839
I am the inheritor
of the Bodhi Department's chief.

426
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,800
I'm the Bodhi inheritor.

427
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,000
I am the inheritor
of the Prajna Hall's chief.

428
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,840
Senior brother.

429
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,920
Junior brother?

430
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,639
It doesn't work.

431
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,679
Is there some kind of password?

432
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:53,568
Let's fight.

433
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,079
Bufan.

434
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,320
Figure out something.

435
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,360
Why not try the password?

436
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,112
Regardless of being poor or rich,
noble or lowly.

437
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,760
Why not say it earlier?

438
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,840
I've been expecting you.

439
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,159
Huanjie!

440
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,800
All beings will be equal.

441
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,440
Guys,

442
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,519
behold all beings.

443
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,440
Bufan.

444
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,079
Who are they?

445
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,440
Where are we?

446
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:14,144
(Abyss Is Not Empty)

447
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,280
This is

448
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,840
