1
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:16,192
(In 1898, the Year of Wuxu,)

2
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:19,648
(Emperor Guangxu aimed
to change the decaying Qing dynasty.)

3
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:22,548
(He issued the Imperial Decree
of National Policy)

4
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,352
(and undertook the Wuxu Reform.)

5
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:28,864
(Jingshi Academy was founded in Beijing
in July of the same year.)

6
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:29,879
(The Academy)

7
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,679
His Majesty has arrived.

8
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,119
- Long live the emperor.
- Long live the emperor.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,519
(Chinese scholar-officials)

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,400
(are immersed in handwriting
and reading,)

11
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:20,480
(while fierce soldiers are crude
and careless.)

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,439
(So their education doesn't fit them
for a certain job.)

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,000
(In times of peace, they scoff
at foreign weapons as clever tricks,)

14
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,840
(believing there's no need
to learn them.)

15
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,319
(In times of trouble, they're shocked
by the weapons, considering them magic,)

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,319
(believing they cannot be learned.)

17
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,200
(Li Hongzhang said these words
34 years ago.)

18
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,680
(His words still arouse my thoughts.)

19
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,560
(Aisin-Gioro Zaitian, Emperor Guangxu)

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,648
(Irgen-Gioro Muqing, the imperial guard)

21
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,400
This is the Jingshi Academy.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,680
What we learn from Neo-Confucianism

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,639
is nothing more than

24
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,400
preserving the heavenly principles

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,599
and eliminating human desires.

26
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,000
But in retrospect,

27
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,039
have different rulers of dynasties ever

28
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,319
only relied on sages,

29
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,560
virtue, and morality

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,199
to govern and bring peace
to the country?

31
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,280
(If we value reputation and integrity)

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
(but neglect practical stuff,)

33
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,400
(hypocrisy and weakness will arise.)

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,280
(Morality cannot
change a person's destiny.)

35
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,000
(Nor can it fundamentally change
the fate of a nation.)

36
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,599
Empty talk of virtue and morality

37
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,919
is the most foolish hypocrisy.

38
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,400
Today, the nation is getting

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,919
into a perilous situation not seen
in 3,000 years.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
If we adhere to old practices

41
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,520
and stick to our ways,

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,599
our country
will fall further and further behind

43
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,960
and become weaker and weaker.

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
If this continues,

45
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,639
the nation will collapse.

46
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,280
I hope all of you present here

47
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,719
will take it upon yourselves
to strengthen our country

48
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,520
without arrogance

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,319
and inferiority.

50
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,560
Face reality squarely

51
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,800
and strive with determination.

52
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,856
(On September 21, 1898, a coup
was led by Empress Dowager Cixi.)

53
00:03:38,856 --> 00:03:39,736
(Emperor Guangxu was under house arrest)

54
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,156
(and the 103-day reform,
the Hundred Days' Reform, failed.)

55
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:41,952
(On November 14, 1908,)

56
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,176
(Emperor Guangxu passed away
a day before the death of Cixi)

57
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:43,770
(at the age of 38.)

58
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:48,896
=Heroes=

59
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,128
=Episode 1=

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,080
(12 years after the failure
of the Wuxu Reform)

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,376
(March 26, 1911)

62
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:05,440
(Yongding River)

63
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,680
(A stele came out
from the Yongding River)

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,319
(and stopped at the Zhengyang Gate.)

65
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,319
(Shuntian Prefecture)
(Here's the rubbing of its inscriptions.)

66
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,600
(Ancient seal characters.)

67
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,040
(It says Long Zhen Li Jiu)

68
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,560
(will change the nation
at harvest time.)

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,920
(It has already spread widely?)

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,480
Do you understand the meaning?

71
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,680
I am slow-witted.

72
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
Change the nation?

73
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,079
It means

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,519
the nation will change hands?

75
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:44,519
(Cunqing, head of
the Imperial Household Department)

76
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,000
At harvest time?

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,560
Farmers plant seeds in spring
and harvest in summer.

78
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,000
Mangzhong is also a day for the harvest.

79
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,199
What does Long Zhen Li Jiu mean?

80
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,399
Zhen means the east, and Li means fire.

81
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,560
In a word, it means

82
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,040
nine fire dragons

83
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,399
will descend in the east.

84
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,399
Fire!

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,000
(Last night a fire broke out
at the Liulichang.)

86
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,079
(The imperial guards rushed
to extinguish the fire,)

87
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,879
(and they found this in the ruins.)

88
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Also inscribed
with ancient seal characters.

89
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,920
Long Zhen Li Jiu will change the nation
at harvest time.

90
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,680
Now, many rumors are circulating
among the populace.

91
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,279
What are they saying?

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,480
They say it's an omen,

93
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,959
a sign from heaven.

94
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,600
It foretells a sudden change
in the nation.

95
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
I will immediately arrest rumormongers
and interrogate them.

96
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,199
Greetings, sir.

97
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,480
Is it an omen or merely a rumor?

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,519
It is a rumor.

99
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,199
Investigate it.

100
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
Can't be found or can't be investigated?

101
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,720
Sir.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,839
It can't be investigated.

103
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,560
These people took money
to spread rumors.

104
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,639
But they do not know

105
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,720
who hired them.

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,279
What date is Mangzhong this year?

107
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,120
May 11th.

108
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
And today is March 26th.

109
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,439
There are still 44 days left.

110
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,600
In that case, this is not a rumor,

111
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,720
but groundwork.

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,240
Change the nation at harvest time.

113
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,959
It means someone intends
to overturn the emperor

114
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,399
and rebel, right?

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,360
Sir.

116
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,839
Long Zhen Li Jiu.

117
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,959
And Mangzhong is the ninth one

118
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,959
among the 24 solar terms.

119
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,959
Immediately ask the imperial yamen
to start searching and investigating

120
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,800
all stuff related to the number nine
within the capital.

121
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
Notify all the local yamens

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,040
to search 11 counties and cities
east of the capital to the seaside.

123
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,600
Find all businesses, residential houses,

124
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,519
and place names associated
with the number nine,

125
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,800
items measured by the number nine,

126
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
and groups numbered by nine.

127
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,519
If the name contains the number nine,
conduct a thorough investigation.

128
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,120
Yes.

129
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,839
I would like to see

130
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,680
who wants to change the nation.

131
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:37,538
(March 27, 1911)

132
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:39,584
(43 days left before the Mangzhong)

133
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:45,856
(Dagu division, Tianjin)

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,810
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

135
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:06,698
(Pursue righteousness
without seeking personal benefits)

136
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:10,976
(Clarify principles without counting
personal achievements)

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,279
Mr. Wang.

138
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,360
Mr. Xing, what's up?

139
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,720
Something happened.

140
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,879
Zhao Liu found his cattle

141
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,480
early this morning.

142
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,720
Something happened at a tavern.

143
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
A shocking case.

144
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,279
It's a murder.

145
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,759
A murder case?

146
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
It's been eight years.

147
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,080
It's my first murder case.

148
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,559
I've never seen a dead person before.

149
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,720
What smell?

150
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,559
It smells like when killing a cow.

151
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,519
The smell of blood.

152
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,080
N-Nine bodies?

153
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
The room is not messy.

154
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,919
There are also no signs of struggle.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
It's evident they died quickly.

156
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
It's very possible that they

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,159
were poisoned to death.

158
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,039
Here.

159
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,759
This is how he was poisoned.

160
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,440
His body hasn't completely stiffened.

161
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,679
The murderer is still nearby.

162
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,720
Go ask the innkeeper

163
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,679
who came in this morning.

164
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,360
Okay.

165
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,320
Tell me.

166
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,879
Who are you?

167
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
I am Wang Jialuo, a constable
from Dagu County Yamen.

168
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,080
What's your name?

169
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,600
Lin Anjing.

170
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
Lin Anjing.

171
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,679
Why were you hiding in the closet?

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
Do you know the dead?

173
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
My uncle,

174
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,759
aunt,

175
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,799
and cousin.

176
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,559
They all...

177
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,120
I studied abroad in Japan

178
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,440
and just went back with them

179
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,440
by boat.

180
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,440
We arrived just last night.

181
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,840
This morning...

182
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,519
Don't cry. Have some water.

183
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,639
Tell me what happened.

184
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,759
This morning,

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,600
I was changing clothes.

186
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,840
Suddenly, it was very noisy outside.

187
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
I heard my cousin scream.

188
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,000
My aunt told me to run.

189
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,519
Run.

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
I was very scared.

191
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,840
So I hid in the wardrobe.

192
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,279
Did you see who did it?

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,759
There were five or six people.

194
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,720
What did they look like?

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,720
I don't know.

196
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,960
What kind of clothes did they wear?

197
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,679
I also don't know.

198
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,120
All right. Take your time to think.

199
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,240
(Their clothes looked very strange,)

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,679
like the attire of foreigners.

201
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,200
Poison experts.

202
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,960
Foreign attire.

203
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,759
They're from Lingxi.

204
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,559
Mr. Wang.

205
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,639
This is huge.

206
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,559
Nine lives.
We can't take responsibility for it.

207
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,159
Return to the yamen to report.

208
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,679
No.

209
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,559
In my place,

210
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,960
nine lives were lost.

211
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
- You can't...
- Stop it.

212
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,639
You take the girl back to the yamen
for her statement.

213
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,440
I'm going to catch them.

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,840
Come back.

215
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,600
Yes, listen to me.

216
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,480
Sword.

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,480
Wait.

218
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,799
Really?

219
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,840
Wait for me.

220
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,440
In Dagu,

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,360
we hardly handle murder cases.

222
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,639
But this time, nine people died.

223
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,279
Goodness, it's so frightening.

224
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,720
Hurry and write it down.

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,480
Draft a report to the Zhili Prefecture.

226
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,720
This is a major case.

227
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,240
Yes.

228
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,879
An important case.

229
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,919
A murder case.

230
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,840
We're not capable enough

231
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,080
to cope with it.

232
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,799
You're right.

233
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,759
We need someone from above to help us.

234
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,159
Where is Jialuo?

235
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,200
He's gone to chase the murderer.

236
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,320
He's wasting effort.

237
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,639
Such a big case.

238
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,480
One person killed nine people.

239
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,519
What can he do

240
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,679
if he encounters the murderer?

241
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,080
Quickly get him back.

242
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,679
The Mahua is almost ready.

243
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,919
Sir.

244
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,320
Sir, I am back.

245
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,240
Weren't you buying leek flowers?

246
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,399
How did you come back so quickly?

247
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,159
I was.

248
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,720
But before I reached the market,

249
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
I ran into the courier
of the post station.

250
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,279
I got an order.

251
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,639
From today,

252
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,799
within our jurisdiction,

253
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,879
anything, like shops, residential houses

254
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,279
people, and affairs,

255
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,480
associated with the number nine

256
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,799
must be reported immediately.

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,120
The number nine?

258
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,960
What is this about?

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,320
I just fried nine Mahua.

260
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,399
Does this have to be reported?

261
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,679
Hurry. Go and buy leek flowers.

262
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,799
I'm on it.

263
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,399
Well...

264
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,919
Nine.

265
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,872
(Two years ago, in September,
a fire in the eastern outskirts)

266
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,799
(burned three households.
One of them lost nine lives.)

267
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,480
Leave.

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,480
It says

269
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,240
last November,

270
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,799
Caihuying

271
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,519
cut nine robbers.

272
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,840
Could they live after being cut?

273
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,399
Get lost.

274
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,679
In 1894, Zheng Guanying,
a native of Xiangshan, Guangdong,

275
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,080
wrote Warnings to a Prosperous Age.

276
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,200
He liked Western studies

277
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,039
and mentioned the need
for changes in his book.

278
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,440
Zheng Guanying?

279
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,679
The 20th year of Guangxu Era?

280
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:23,919
Sir.

281
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,919
It was the year of 1894.

282
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,799
Zheng Guanying is merely a scholar.

283
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,879
Not even the Reformists
think highly of him.

284
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
No need to be afraid of him.

285
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,360
In 1883,

286
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,600
the Black Flag Army had Liu Yongfu.

287
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,984
He was awarded the nominal commander.

288
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,960
Liu Yongfu was a famous general

289
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,360
and loyal to the end.

290
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,759
How could he possibly rebel?

291
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:39,440
Leave.

292
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,080
Sir.

293
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
We have caught a rumormonger

294
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,720
in the southern city.

295
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,679
Have you extracted any confession?

296
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,600
He couldn't bear the torture
and killed himself.

297
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,519
But inside the pillow at his home,

298
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,080
we found nine copper coins.

299
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,759
It's only nine copper coins.

300
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,159
Yet he hid them inside the pillow.

301
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,000
I think it's suspicious.

302
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,919
However,

303
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,120
I do not know why he did so.

304
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,039
Sir.

305
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,080
I looked through records and found

306
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,559
an item was gone
in the banned book cabinet

307
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,360
of Wenyuan Pavilion.

308
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,840
What item is it?

309
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,720
(Ren Shen)
Something on the shelf Shen of the cabinet Ren.

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Getai.

311
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,440
Yes?

312
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,759
Take my edict and summon someone here.

313
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,360
Men Sandao.

314
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,360
Bring the criminal

315
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,799
Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

316
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,919
Bring the criminal

317
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,639
Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

318
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Finally got it.

319
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,839
Yeah, I'm awesome.

320
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
I got it.

321
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,720
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
Exactly.

322
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,400
I am Wang Jialuo, a constable

323
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,480
of Dagu County Yamen.

324
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,519
You have committed murder
at the Dagu Inn.

325
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,680
Come back with me
to the yamen to be tried immediately.

326
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,480
Just a lowly constable.

327
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,759
I can't believe
he could follow us all the way here.

328
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,519
I can't be bothered to kill you.

329
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,359
Get out of here.

330
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,000
By law,

331
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,400
those who resist arrest

332
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,799
shall be executed.

333
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,079
What an ignorant fool!

334
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,599
Do you know who I am?

335
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,000
You kill people with poison

336
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,279
and dress like this.

337
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,799
You must be
from Lingxi's Rongtian Sword Sect.

338
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,000
You do know things.

339
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,880
That's right.

340
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,279
I'm indeed from Rongtian Sword Sect.

341
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,839
All of you, come with me

342
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,079
to confess your crimes.

343
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,000
Otherwise,

344
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,680
I will not show mercy with my sword.

345
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,200
We're extraordinarily skilled
in martial arts.

346
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,680
Even the imperial guards

347
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,400
don't dare to provoke us alone.

348
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,680
I warn you.

349
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,039
You're risking your life.

350
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,759
Get out of here.

351
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:56,920
It's my life.

352
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,599
But it's my job to catch the murderer.

353
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,920
I am Wang Jialuo, a constable

354
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,559
of Dagu County Yamen.

355
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,400
Huanjie.

356
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,200
Don't throw it away.

357
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,200
Seriously?

358
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,519
Tang Yu.

359
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,640
It's yours?

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,640
It's his.

361
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,799
What's his name?

362
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,160
Wang Jialuo.

363
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,359
Impressive.

364
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,640
Let's go.

365
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,200
It took us so long.

366
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,319
Let's get away by water.

367
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,720
Go to meet Mr. Zhuo in Gegu.

368
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,319
Getai.

369
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
Tell your men to leave.

370
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,720
If he really intends to do something,

371
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,200
none of you can stop him.

372
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,640
Three cups of tea.

373
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,079
Do you know
why he chose that cup of Longjing Tea?

374
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,680
Sir.

375
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,160
I don't know.

376
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,000
Look at the dishes on the table.

377
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,200
Spiced pigeon,

378
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
Luohan shrimp,

379
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,079
sweet and sour lotus roots,

380
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,000
sliced pig roast, and Lama cake.

381
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,079
What kind of dishes are these?

382
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,720
These are dishes served
at the Manchu-Han Imperial Feast.

383
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,279
He recognized them at a glance.

384
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,359
It's the Courtier Banquet
of the Manchu-Han Imperial Feast.

385
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,279
The first course of the Courtier Banquet

386
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,799
is the tea.

387
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,160
It must be Shifeng Longjing Tea.

388
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,880
Irgen-Gioro Muqing,

389
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,240
Zhenglan Banner,

390
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,559
joined the imperial guards
in 1894 and served

391
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,680
as an imperial guard
at the Qianqing Gate.

392
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,160
Among the imperial guards

393
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,240
and fighters in the Shenjiying,

394
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,799
nobody can defeat him.

395
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,839
Back then, many people challenged him
to duels outside the Zhengyang Gate.

396
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,720
As a result,
no one could withstand three strikes.

397
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,160
Thus,

398
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,119
he earned the nickname Men Sandao.

399
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,640
He's skilled not only in martial arts

400
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,599
but also in solving cases.

401
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,599
Even Emperor Guangxu praised him,

402
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,240
saying that compared to Di Renjie
of the Tang dynasty

403
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,359
and Song Ci of the Song dynasty,

404
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,559
he was superior and second to none.

405
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,319
In 1898,

406
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,720
together with Shumulu Chatai,

407
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,920
he was ordered
to protect those supporters

408
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,839
of the Reform Movement of 1898.

409
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,960
You've probably heard

410
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
about what happened next.

411
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,960
Shumulu Chatai was executed.

412
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,400
Even Emperor Guangxu was restricted

413
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
within the palace.

414
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,240
And he

415
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,240
was dismissed

416
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,119
and demoted to Xianglan Banner.

417
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,599
He has been
in the Infantry Commander Yamen Prison

418
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,319
for 12 years.

419
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,799
When the time comes,
everything goes well.

420
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,599
But in bad times,
even the hero can't master his fate.

421
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,720
Are you done?

422
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,480
Have a cup of farewell tea,

423
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Zhulan Tea.

424
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,519
The day before yesterday, a stele
was found in the Yongding River

425
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,200
outside Zhengyang Gate.

426
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,799
There were inscriptions on the stele.

427
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,200
Last night,
there was a big fire at Liulichang,

428
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,000
burning everything down

429
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,200
and leaving only one piece
of porcelain intact.

430
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,079
Seal characters.

431
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,720
Long Zhen Li Jiu

432
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,240
will change the nation at harvest time.

433
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,240
Now rumors are in the air,

434
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,559
saying it is an omen from heaven.

435
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,799
Water cannot wash away a stone.

436
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,559
Fire can scorch coarse porcelain.

437
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,079
Then, it means it's not an omen.

438
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,799
So it's just a rumor.

439
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,200
It means the people
who spread these rumors

440
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,759
take these events as the foreshadowing.

441
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,839
On the day of Mangzhong,
namely, May 11th,

442
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,920
they will start a rebellion.

443
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,839
The question is, who intends to rebel?

444
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,039
And how?

445
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,319
I'm asking you.

446
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,799
If you help me solve this case

447
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,279
and quell this crisis,

448
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,680
I won't send you back to prison.

449
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,759
You will be promoted
to Xianghuang Banner

450
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,799
and the Deputy Director
of the imperial yamen.

451
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,000
Do you remember the sword
the late emperor bestowed upon you?

452
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,759
I will also return it to you.

453
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,640
How can you lose your sword?

454
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,039
Do you want to serve the imperial court?

455
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,720
Or should I throw you back in jail?

456
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,279
The decision is yours.

457
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:09,720
Copper coins.

458
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,359
These nine copper coins come

459
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,480
from a traitor who was captured today.

460
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,480
I believe there is something fishy
about these nine copper coins.

461
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,359
Shunzhi Tongbao coins.

462
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,000
Qianlong Tongbao coins.

463
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,759
Tongzhi Tongbao coins.

464
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,039
What's the hidden meaning of them?

465
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,599
Emperor Shunzhi abdicated.

466
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,720
Emperor Qianlong gave his power.

467
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,000
While the Emperor Tongzhi
was merely a figurehead.

468
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,200
Speaking of the meaning,

469
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,480
these nine copper coins

470
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,640
imply the need for a change of rulers.

471
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,039
Very impressive.

472
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,200
You see through the mystery at once.

473
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,279
Sir.

474
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,759
Your spies are spread
throughout the capital.

475
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,160
You failed to find any clues
about the rebels.

476
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,119
I'm a former imperial guard

477
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,880
who has been imprisoned for 12 years.

478
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,519
How could I solve this case

479
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,440
and find out the mastermind

480
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,759
behind this within forty-odd days?

481
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,240
I am aware of my own abilities.

482
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,599
If you dare to let me out,

483
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,480
you must also be aware of my abilities.

484
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,440
You want to make use of my skills.

485
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,160
Investigating this case
based on the so-called omen and rumors

486
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,519
would be like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

487
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,920
So, you must have a more important clue

488
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,079
which makes you thought of me.

489
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,000
What do you think

490
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,200
the clue might be?

491
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,200
Has some special item related

492
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
to this case been stolen?

493
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,160
(Gegu Town, Tianjin)
Nine points.

494
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,279
Open.

495
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:48,960
No money? Out.

496
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,359
Just make room for others.

497
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,359
You're right.

498
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:51,960
It's my turn.

499
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,680
I'll do it. You're having such bad luck.

500
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,480
Stop playing.

501
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,359
Do you have money or not?

502
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,799
I have money.

503
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,519
Take it out.

504
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,599
- I have money.
- Take it out.

505
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,359
I'll play.

506
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,400
Look, this is money.

507
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,799
(Yong'an Pawnshop)
What is this?

508
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
Are you kidding?

509
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
That's a pawn ticket,

510
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,319
not a banknote.

511
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,160
What I pawned is a treasure.

512
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,680
Whoever gives me 300 taels of silver

513
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,000
will get this pawn ticket.

514
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,519
300 taels?

515
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,200
For this thing?

516
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,480
An old hat with frayed edges
and shedding fur.

517
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,400
A broken hat for 300 taels?

518
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,599
- Really?
- Shut up.

519
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,480
Chen Wu.

520
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,119
You're so ignorant.

521
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,119
This is just a pawn ticket from Tianjin.

522
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,880
It's not even worth the round-trip fare.

523
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:28,759
Exactly.

524
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,000
- Get out of here.
- Go away.

525
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,079
Back off!

526
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,079
I have money.

527
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,680
Get lost. It's my turn.

(Yong'an Pawnshop)

(Banknotes)

530
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,480
(Yong'an Pawnshop)
He actually wants this raggedy hat.

531
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,359
Chen Wu.

532
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,680
Who is that?

533
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,759
- Tell us.
- Yeah.

534
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,640
Who knows?

535
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,000
(Banknotes)
Anyway, he knows the goods.

536
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,480
Mr. Zhuo.

537
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,000
Ms. Huo.

538
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,400
Have you found it?

539
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,079
Yes, here it is.

540
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,000
Tomorrow morning,

541
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
we'll go to the pawnshop in Tianjin,

542
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,119
redeem the item, and leave.

543
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,200
I'll go get it.

544
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,319
Okay, Ms. Huo.

545
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,920
This is the pawn ticket.

546
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,640
These nine coins are
for redeeming the item.

547
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,799
Mr. Zhuo.

548
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,759
Has Huanjie come back?

549
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,880
He's waiting for you inside.

550
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,839
One of you died?

551
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,039
Yes.

552
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,640
Huanjie.

553
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,000
Qin Tuo, Tang Yu, and you

554
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,599
left with three elite disciples.

555
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,839
Yet one of you was killed

556
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,240
by a mere constable?

557
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,759
That person's kung fu is pretty good.

558
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,480
A constable's?

559
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,519
His skills are truly formidable.

560
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,279
If he is such a capable man,

561
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,200
how could he condescend
to be a mere constable?

562
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,599
What is this?

563
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,200
That person dropped this.

564
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,920
Gong Yang Yi Shu.

565
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,599
The one chasing you
is really a constable?

566
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:36,680
Yes.

567
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
But I don't think

568
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,079
a constable will read this.

569
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,640
Bufan.

570
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,960
A disciple has already died.

571
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,000
What else do you want?

572
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,720
What happened to those
who came back from Japan?

573
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,680
We killed them.

574
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,880
What?

575
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,480
Should I keep them alive?

576
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,279
How did you kill them?

577
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,519
Nine people.

578
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
We must kill them quickly.

579
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,680
I poisoned them.

580
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,119
Huanjie.

581
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,119
Haven't I told you to be unobtrusive?

582
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,400
We should act low-profile.

583
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,279
Mr. Zhuo.

584
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,480
We go to Dagu to find those nine people.

585
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,039
The purpose is
to find the key lead to the contact.

586
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,680
Now that we have the lead,

587
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,200
those nine people cannot be alive.

588
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,240
It's inappropriate to kill them

589
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
with our own methods, isn't it?

590
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,240
I used poison
when I was eliciting a confession.

591
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,480
Otherwise, how could I
have gotten the information so quickly?

592
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,839
Now everything has become clear.

593
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,359
The nine people
who came from Japan will go

594
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,839
to Shanghai French Concession
on the third day of April

595
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,319
to meet a person
who is coming over from overseas.

596
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,240
What is that person's name?

597
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,960
Tan Xian.

598
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,440
As long as we meet Tan Xian,

599
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,519
we will get most of the work done.

600
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,480
My part is done.

601
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,839
I don't know

602
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,759
if you've obtained the item.

603
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,920
Thank you for asking.

604
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,279
It can be obtained early tomorrow.

605
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,880
(Don't you think Yu Huanjie
is very mean)

606
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,039
(to you?)

607
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,599
He is the senior disciple
of Rongtian Sword Sect,

608
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,799
but he should not be rude.

609
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,279
After all, you are the Sect Leader.

610
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,680
I have been the leader for two years

611
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,480
and haven't achieved much.

612
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,480
There's a reason
Yu Huanjie has a problem

613
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,079
with me.

614
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,160
Rongtian Sword Sect.

615
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,839
Who thinks of us as a sword sect?

616
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,480
People refer to us as Rongtian Ridge.

617
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,400
Why?

618
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,160
Just because we were from Rongtian

619
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,440
and most of us were
refugees and orphans,

620
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,000
begging for food together,

621
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,000
outsiders didn't take us seriously

622
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,000
and treated us like beggars

623
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,440
from a beggar gang.

624
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,720
That's why my master

625
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,319
spent most of his life

626
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,960
turning Rongtian into a major sect

627
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,599
and relocated our sect

628
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:23,079
from Lingxi to the Central Plains.

629
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,119
He reduced the use of poison
in martial arts

630
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:27,519
and improved the swordsmanship
and whip techniques.

631
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,440
But whatever we achieve

632
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,839
in martial arts,

633
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,119
we will always be outliers

634
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,960
and struggle to be orthodox.

635
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,720
You're the best swordsman of our sect.

636
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,559
And throughout the entire martial world,

637
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,240
your swordsmanship is unparalleled,

638
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,400
and no one can beat you.

639
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,759
But I'm from Rongtian.

640
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,079
Otherwise...

641
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,319
Otherwise, you would have long
been a great master.

642
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,799
I know you have always thought this way.

643
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,160
I also know

644
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,680
how hard it is for you
to achieve this aspiration.

645
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,920
So, you believe

646
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,639
this is a rare opportunity

647
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,079
and an event significant enough
to change fate.

648
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,639
But do you know

649
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,880
what I think?

650
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,280
Yeah, I do.

651
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,000
Ms. Huo.

652
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,800
There is no one else.

653
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,320
Don't be aloof.

654
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,679
I'm done.

655
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,719
It's getting late.

656
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,719
You should rest early.

657
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,800
(Muqing.)

658
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,159
(During the Jiajing era
of the Ming dynasty,)

659
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,320
there was a man called Wang Zhi.
Have you heard of him?

660
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,360
He was known as the Wufeng shipowner.

661
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,719
The Ming dynasty banned marine trade.

662
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,039
Wang Zhi called together his followers

663
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,079
and Japanese ronins
to smuggle goods by sea.

664
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,880
Exactly, that's the person
I'm talking about.

665
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:41,239
From the year of 1540 to 1558,

666
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,840
he was the only one

667
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,360
who did business at sea
in the entire Ming dynasty.

668
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,360
Ships of silk and tea
earned him ships of gold and silver.

669
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,760
It's no exaggeration to say
that he was the wealthiest.

670
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,320
It's said that in the last years
of the Ming dynasty,

671
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,480
the gold and silver left by Wang Zhi

672
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,360
were accidentally discovered

673
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,280
by a secular disciple
of Southern Shaolin.

674
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,719
It was in troubled times,

675
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,000
so Southern Shaolin
sealed the secret treasure away.

676
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,320
Later, the secret treasure

677
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,119
was referred to by later generations
as the Altar Treasure.

678
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,920
In 1905,

679
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,760
the national treasury was depleted.

680
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,159
That year, I became the head
of Imperial Household Department.

681
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,199
I considered finding the Altar Treasure.

682
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,360
But after perusing some records,
I discovered

683
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,039
that several top-notch martial experts
from the palace

684
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,599
had perished
while searching for the treasure.

685
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,039
Ultimately, it was dropped.

686
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,760
Altar Treasure.

687
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,559
No matter how hard I tried,
I still failed to find it.

688
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:49,480
Still failed to find it.

689
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,480
Later, the treasure map was locked up

690
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,239
in the banned book cabinet
of Wenyuan Pavilion.

691
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,320
When the rumors
of Long Zhen Li Jiu appeared,

692
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,000
the treasure map suddenly disappeared.

693
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,440
That's so mysterious.

694
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,584
(Ren Shen)

695
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,800
Anyway, the treasure has been sought

696
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,400
for over a century but nothing is found.

697
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,639
What's the big deal if it's lost?

698
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,119
Currently, the nation is unstable.

699
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,320
Whoever intends to rebel,

700
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
a substantial amount
of financial resources is needed.

701
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,719
Otherwise, even if a change
of regime occurs,

702
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,960
it would be of no avail.

703
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,039
Now, our country

704
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,599
is raising a very fierce dog.

705
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,960
No one dares to provoke

706
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,559
or handle this dog.

707
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,320
It's Beiyang.

708
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,880
Whoever wants to rebel

709
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,039
will try to win over Beiyang.

710
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,960
To win over the dog,

711
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,519
the most effective method is

712
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,800
to give it money,

713
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,880
food, and a bonus.

714
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,519
So you mean

715
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,360
the person
who stole the treasure map is a rebel?

716
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,719
The rebels need money,

717
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,840
so to investigate the treasure map

718
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,920
is to track down the mastermind
behind the rebellion.

719
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:16,880
Sir.

720
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,880
Have you never considered

721
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,519
who exactly might want to rebel?

722
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,119
Many people have the intention to rebel.

723
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,199
The restless revolutionaries?

724
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,119
Or powerful and noble people

725
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,760
who worry
that their power is slipping away?

726
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,400
I do not know.

727
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,199
You have to figure it out.

728
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,440
There is one more thing
I don't understand.

729
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,079
Speak.

730
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,280
The thief stole in Wenyuan Pavilion.

731
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,559
It proves the thief knows about the rumor
of the Altar Treasure.

732
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,239
They must have also known
your department

733
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,400
has looked for the treasure
for over a century without success.

734
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,480
What makes them think

735
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,880
they can find the treasure with a map?

736
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,000
That gives you even more reason
to investigate it.

737
00:38:59,159 --> 00:38:59,719
Sir.

738
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,000
