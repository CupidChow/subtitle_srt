1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,399
Muqing.

2
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,399
Muqing.

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,120
Where are we heading next?

4
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,280
Here.

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,120
Muqing, this is...

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,759
This is your hard-earned money.

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,479
It's not much.

8
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,759
Thank you for these days.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,960
Not at all.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,520
Serving you is my honor.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,679
Where are we going now?

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,920
We shall part ways here.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,000
Go back to your business.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,856
What?

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,520
We haven't found the treasure yet.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,280
The treasure belongs to the court.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,679
It has nothing to do with you.

18
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,320
You may leave.

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,799
Muqing.

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,759
You do need me.

21
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,280
I am also willing to serve you
with all my might.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
I am so anxious
not to find the treasure.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,992
This is for the court, for the people,

24
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:57,504
for...

25
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:59,280
Enough, you are just a businessman.

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,672
The country is not your concern.

27
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,216
How about this?

28
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:02,600
I'll treat you
when you come to Shuntian.

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,519
No. I should be the one treating.

30
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,959
It doesn't matter.

31
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,239
Now, disappear.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
There's something I don't understand.

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,760
May I ask you about it?

34
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Please ask.

35
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,120
Why do you keep from others

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,480
that I obtained the secret

37
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,400
in Futu Temple?

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,159
I have told you.

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,840
It is to protect this secret.

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,599
If everyone knows about it,

41
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,959
it will make you a target.

42
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,159
We can't handle that.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,799
Your people are from the imperial yamen.

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,599
They all know
what Tongmenghui is capable of.

45
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,200
If they ever found out I had the secret

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,760
and the higher-ups also knew about it,

47
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,599
I'd surely be tortured.

48
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,319
You guys are so brutal.

49
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,280
It will be worse than death.

50
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,640
I really don't want to see you

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,400
end up so miserably.

52
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,200
I understand that.

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,280
But why do you keep things
from Mr. Wang?

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,719
After what happened in Shanxi,

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,360
weren't the two of you working together

56
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,319
to capture Zhuo Bufan?

57
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,479
One reason I didn't tell him was

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,479
that he only cared about capturing Zhuo

59
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,479
but cared little about the treasure.

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
Another reason was

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,879
that I despise Beiyang Army.

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,599
Beiyang Army is the most elite army.

63
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,800
Why would you despise it?

64
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,479
It's only

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,479
because of Yuan Shikai.

66
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,000
The failure of Wuxu Reform back then

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,560
had a great deal to do
with his betrayal.

68
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,800
Yuan Shikai's defection and betrayal

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
led to the failure of the reform
and the house arrest of Guangxu.

70
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,560
Exactly.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,199
Mr. Chatai who had always
been training me

72
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,759
was labeled a rebel.

73
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,840
All his family were executed.

74
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,520
I also served 12 years in prison.

75
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,960
Beiyang Army
was cultivated by Yuan Shikai.

76
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
Although he has stepped down from power,

77
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,479
I hate anything related to him,

78
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,039
including Beiyang Army.

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,159
You know what?

80
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,280
Even if Yuan Shikai hadn't betrayed,

81
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,080
Wuxu Reform

82
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,000
was doomed to fail anyway.

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,560
Firstly,

84
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,159
the conservatives were powerful

85
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,560
and the Reformists had no real power.

86
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,639
When the reform violated

87
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,960
the interests of the conservatives,

88
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,479
you were bound to be suppressed.

89
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,640
Secondly,

90
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,360
the Reformists lacked
proper theoretical guidance.

91
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,152
Kang Youwei's
'A Study of the Forged Classics'

92
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,680
was opposed not just
by the conservatives

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,520
but also disapproved
by many enlightened individuals.

94
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,000
Thirdly,

95
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,360
the Reformists were unorganized
and didn't have a leadership.

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
You relied only on the Emperor
who held no real power

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
and a very small number of bureaucrats.

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,199
Fourthly,

99
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,159
the implementation was too hasty.

100
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,919
You were too sloppy

101
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,000
and caused too much loss.

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
Fifthly,

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,000
the measures were oversimplified.

104
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,680
You adopted a top-down method

105
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
that was peaceful and legal.

106
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,199
Well said.

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,960
Well said indeed.

108
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,439
You made your points.

109
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,039
Firstly,

110
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,639
the Reformists had no real power.

111
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,080
What does Tongmenghui have?

112
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,439
You don't even have nominal power.

113
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:06,960
Secondly,

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,800
the Reformists
had no theoretical guidance.

115
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,919
What do you have then?

116
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,439
Those banned books and flyers?

117
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,240
Thirdly,

118
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,639
Reformists were not organized.

119
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,439
What about you?

120
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,000
You are just a bunch of rats.

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,079
Who is your leader?

122
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,759
Sun Wen?

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,680
Does he dare to show up?

124
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,720
Fourthly,

125
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
the reform was too hasty.

126
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,759
We were too sloppy

127
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,680
and caused too much loss.

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,319
What about you then?

129
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,720
The late Emperor only wanted to reform.

130
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,680
And you? You want to
turn the world upside down.

131
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,480
Fifthly,

132
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,759
Reform measures were oversimplified.

133
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,279
And you are better than us?

134
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,000
Other than risking your lives,
what else can you do?

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,199
I'll give you another point.

136
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,519
That is,

137
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,480
you cannot bring peace with literature

138
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,800
or with martial prowess.

139
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,279
Nothing can be achieved
with people like you.

140
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,240
You are hot-blooded but brainless.

141
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,600
Who do you think you can convince

142
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,160
with such a useless lecture?

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000
Save it.

144
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,079
You don't even respect
Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao.

145
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,399
Their ability to propagate

146
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,560
are way better than yours.

147
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,240
Talk. Say something.

148
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,240
Give me another lecture then.

149
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,240
Get out.

150
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:13,536
(Rich or poor,)

151
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:14,912
(all beings shall be equal.)

152
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:16,768
(Someone once told me this.)

153
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,624
(But back then,
I was naive and ignorant.)

154
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,120
(It was on this train
from Shanghai to Shanxi)

155
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
(that I brushed past this swordsman.)

156
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,080
(Suddenly,)

157
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,960
(I was reminded
of those words once again.)

158
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,440
(Everyone has a past.)

159
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
(Even a court's hound)

160
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,666
(has a past too.)

161
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,360
(My name is Men Sandao.)

162
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,600
(I spent 12 years in prison.)

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,720
(After leaving prison,
I found the world had changed.)

164
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,040
(In this nameless year,)

165
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,080
(everyone is doing their own business.)

166
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
(They do it for survival,)

167
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,480
(while I seek justice.)

168
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:50,760
(Nowadays,)

169
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,200
(being good is always harder
than being bad.)

170
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,360
(Retentive feelings can be gone,
and the clever will suffer.)

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
(So I thought)

172
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,120
(I would live a mundane life
for the rest of my life.)

173
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
(But when the gunshot rang out,)

174
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,960
(I kind of saw her again,)

175
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,840
(the one I've remembered for 12 years)

176
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,560
(but dare not mention.)

177
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,680
(She looked very much like her.)

178
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,880
(The way they walk was similar.)

179
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
(I watched her for a while.)

180
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,040
(I know it was not her.)

181
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,680
(It's that I missed her.)

182
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,600
(I missed her, so she looked like her.)

183
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,280
(Things couldn't go back again.)

184
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
(Just as trains don't run backwards.)

185
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,680
(Timing is very important.)

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,760
(It won't work if it comes too early)

187
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,000
(or too late.)

188
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:39,040
=Heroes=

189
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:42,658
=Episode 20=

190
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Mr. Wang is not stupid at all.

191
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,639
Of course, he's not stupid.

192
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,240
What do you think?

193
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,680
Will Men Sandao make any progress?

194
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,519
He is savvy and resourceful.

195
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,040
He should be able to obtain more clues.

196
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,279
It's just that no matter what,

197
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,519
he must get the seal from Zhuo Bufan.

198
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,279
As for Mr. Wang,

199
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,879
he doesn't care much
about treasure hunt,

200
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,399
but capturing Zhuo Bufan,

201
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,680
that's what he cares.

202
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,519
So

203
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,000
once he targets Zhuo Bufan,

204
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,920
he will obtain the clue.

205
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,759
It's just that we don't know
where Zhuo Bufan is.

206
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,839
His next stop is the capital.

207
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,759
But you can't tell Mr. Wang.

208
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,800
Otherwise, it would be too coincidental.

209
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,600
He has no suspicions
about you now, right?

210
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,120
No.

211
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,079
How much does he like you?

212
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,000
Just like you said,

213
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,519
I am his first love.

214
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,319
That usually ends up being a sad story.

215
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,959
Miss Lin.

216
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,519
Miss Lin.

217
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:08,959
Miss Lin.

218
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,639
What's wrong?

219
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,480
Slow down.

220
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,839
It hurts.

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,360
And I am cold.

222
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,920
Cold?

223
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,279
Then I'll get you two more blankets.

224
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,279
Jialuo.

225
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,680
My hands are cold.

226
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,080
They're not that cold.

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
You have a strong grip.

228
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,840
Exactly what makes you feel unwell?

229
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,360
I'll can call a doctor over here.

230
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,360
It's an old injury.

231
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,279
It just hurts.

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
Each time it hurts,

233
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,600
patchouli usually helps.

234
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,200
Alright, I'll go buy it.

235
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,399
Come on, keep warm.

236
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,840
Where did you keep the accounts
of those who bought herbs

237
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,600
yesterday?

238
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,399
What people?

239
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,159
Just those

240
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,360
who were in strange clothes.

241
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,919
The people from Lingxi?

242
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,519
Oh, right.

243
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,879
On the book at the bottom.

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,759
People dressed in Lingxi attire

245
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,559
have been here?

246
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,519
When?

247
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,759
Last night.

248
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,039
They came to buy some herbs

249
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,360
for stopping bleeding and such.

250
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,480
Know where they are staying?

251
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,200
I don't know.

252
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,559
They didn't ask for delivery.

253
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,080
They came here to take it.

254
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,759
I heard they were in a hurry to leave.

255
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,080
I think it was the capital.

256
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:53,960
The capital?

257
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,639
Right.

258
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,639
Are you sure?

259
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,200
Yes.

260
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,519
They mentioned it several times.

261
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,519
Here, take this.

262
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,024
Okay.

263
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,240
Thanks.

264
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,840
We haven't seen them these past days.

265
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,279
Turns out they already left.

266
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,639
No time to delay.

267
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,559
We should head to the capital now.

268
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,279
Get ready and set off

269
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,519
as soon as possible.

270
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,672
Jialuo.

271
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
General Long Chi
has indeed given authorization.

272
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,440
Beiyang Army

273
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,159
will chase after Zhuo Bufan with you.

274
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,840
We can go anywhere we want.

275
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,279
But in the capital,

276
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,519
I'm afraid there might be issues.

277
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,056
How about this?

278
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,960
I, along with you and Miss Lin

279
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,440
take the train to the capital.

280
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,799
As for our soldiers,

281
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,320
they'll head to the outskirts

282
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,720
and stand by at
the Beiyang Army's garrison there.

283
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,799
What do you think?

284
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:04,672
Alright.

285
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
You don't wanna look at my feet.

286
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,320
Here are my hands.

287
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,096
Why?

288
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,639
Punish me.

289
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,559
Do you want to talk
about your revolution again?

290
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,919
Next time then.

291
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,039
I don't have torture devices now.

292
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,200
Then do it later. I will go first.

293
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,440
Are all you revolutionaries
this humorous?

294
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,759
I'd like to analyze the thought process
with you.

295
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
Actually, the ideals of Tongmenghui,

296
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,320
Mr. Sun's ideals,

297
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,039
and the reform you've been involved in,

298
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,559
are essentially the same.

299
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,120
They are all
to save and strengthen the nation.

300
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,240
If the reform back then hadn't failed...

301
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,559
Didn't you say that reform
was bound to fail?

302
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,720
I said 'if'.

303
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,519
If the reforms had succeeded back then,

304
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,759
then the Great Qing
would be thriving once again.

305
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,480
It wouldn't be treated
by the great powers.

306
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,360
And there would not be

307
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,480
the emergence of Tongmenghui,
seeking to rebuild the nation.

308
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,039
Then Mr. Sun could also

309
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,879
be a doctor with ease.

310
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,279
But indeed,
there are no 'ifs' in this world.

311
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,399
The reform was hindered
by the imperial family.

312
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,639
That was why it failed.

313
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,679
Guangxu ended up badly.

314
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,159
So did you.

315
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,679
But the most unfortunate ones

316
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,200
are this nation and its people.

317
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,240
That's why Mr. Sun
gave up being a doctor.

318
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
He didn't cure people anymore,

319
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,279
but instead,

320
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
he started treating this nation.

321
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,720
You mean

322
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,440
Tongmenghui and the Reformists
share the same ideas?

323
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,919
Their purposes are similar.

324
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,399
Fine.

325
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,592
One.

326
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,519
One what?

327
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
One finger.

328
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,320
Each time you speak,
I'll pull out one fingernail.

329
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,200
You still have nine left.

330
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,279
Are you serious?

331
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,320
You're the one
who said I could do it later.

332
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,600
You can go on.

333
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,039
Or I won't pull out your fingernail
for what you said just now.

334
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,360
Let's discuss the Bodhi Seal.

335
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,200
Do whatever you want.

336
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,559
I've still got nine.

337
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,120
Including my toenails,
that's 19 in total.

338
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,519
I can talk with you 19 more times.

339
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,200
But all you say are just the same.

340
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
What's the point?

341
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,080
If you really don't want

342
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
your fingernails and toenails,

343
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,000
then just keep talking.

344
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,120
I will spare you for what you just said.

345
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,080
You still have 20.

346
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,799
If so,

347
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,720
then I will go on.

348
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,919
You better listen to me first.

349
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,360
Liu Lin.

350
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,320
You are in your early twenties, right?

351
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
Look at your fine skin.

352
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,480
You must be born into a well-off family.

353
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,360
You're able to study abroad.

354
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,799
So I am more sure about that.

355
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,360
Although I don't know
what your parents do,

356
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,000
they raised you and provided for you,

357
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,679
so they surely hope
you can live a good life

358
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,720
and honor the family.

359
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
Maybe get married one day.

360
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,559
But what did you do?

361
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,879
You joined a revolution.

362
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,240
How will you end up?

363
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,480
Your fingernails and toenails
will be peeled off

364
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,840
and then I will have you executed.

365
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,480
I know.

366
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,919
I know you're not afraid of death.

367
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,159
That's because you haven't seen it.

368
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,360
I reckon you haven't seen much death.

369
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,759
I have seen it.

370
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,159
I am telling you.

371
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,559
After I have seen death,

372
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,840
I am afraid of it.

373
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,080
I really am.

374
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,200
I have seen death.

375
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,639
You mean your comrades?

376
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,879
My father.

377
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,320
My mother.

378
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,840
And my brother.

379
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,919
Actually, we have all seen death.

380
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,679
Your late Emperor.

381
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,840
Your superior.

382
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,720
Those who participated
in the reform with you.

383
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,200
And your master.

384
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,320
They all died because of the reform.

385
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,559
Are you afraid of reform
because of this?

386
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,559
I will only spare you one time only.

387
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,960
You can leave.

388
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
Mr. Muqing.

389
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,320
You really are not like any hound
I have ever met.

390
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,960
(The 20th day of the 4th month, 1911)

391
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,552
(Grain in Ear is 20 days away)

392
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,048
(Prince Qi's Mansion)
(Shuntian)

393
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,120
Aren't you the best swordsman?

394
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,200
A temple gatekeeper

395
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,639
could defeat you.

396
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,200
If the Imperial Household Department
finds the secret treasure,

397
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,559
all you have done

398
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,000
will benefit them.

399
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,600
Are you done?

400
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,039
Apologize now.

401
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,519
If a treasure map could lead
to the secret treasure,

402
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,120
then the Department would have found it
a hundred years ago.

403
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,320
Why wait until now?

404
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,879
Moreover, after I obtained the item,

405
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,639
every step I took was correct.

406
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,720
Every step was ahead of the Department.

407
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,879
If we can't find it,

408
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,720
perhaps they can't find it either.

409
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,000
And I have also obtained
an important clue.

410
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,960
It is that the treasure map
is divided into three parts.

411
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
All are indispensable.

412
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,600
A passphrase is also required.

413
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,320
Even if we have the treasure map,

414
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,159
without the passphrase,
we can't obtain the treasure.

415
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,120
Now, Men Sandao
holds one part of the map.

416
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,120
And I have a part.

417
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,840
Whether he takes my map

418
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,039
or I take his,

419
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,480
neither of us can have the treasure.

420
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,320
So, in this case,

421
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,240
no one will gain benefit from the other.

422
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,480
As for the best swordsman,

423
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,159
I once thought I was.

424
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,039
But there are always people

425
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,320
better than me.

426
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,000
But don't worry, Your Highness.

427
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,039
I will still be the top swordsman
in the future.

428
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,480
Now, Men Sandao and I both
have one part of the map.

429
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,480
As long as he doesn't give up
the search for the treasure,

430
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,720
I will have the chance
to snatch his treasure map.

431
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,480
But even if I obtained it,

432
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,200
it would be of no help.

433
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,440
I don't know
where the third treasure map is.

434
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,279
So, I returned to the capital

435
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,919
to obtain more clues.

436
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,159
If you have vented your anger,

437
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,759
please think carefully

438
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,600
how you can offer clues

439
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
so that I can continue the search.

440
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,639
Rest assured.

441
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,519
I will find some clues for you.

442
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,440
Thank you.

443
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:57,879
Thanks for pardoning us.

444
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
This treasure-hunting journey
is extremely perilous.

445
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,200
It is more dangerous than what you said.

446
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
I once thought
I could complete the task easily.

447
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,359
But now it seems

448
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,680
it will be very difficult.

449
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,480
I really did not know

450
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,559
that there are three parts
of this treasure map.

451
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
It seems this journey

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,160
will be more fraught with setbacks
than anticipated.

453
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,119
And many disciples of my sect

454
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,200
have also sacrificed for this.

455
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,759
So,

456
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,839
I hope you can raise the pay.

457
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,079
Besides what we agreed before,

458
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,799
rebuilding the main altar
of Rongtian Sword Sect

459
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,759
and conferring us
as the first Sword Sect,

460
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,759
I also need some compensation

461
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,240
to comfort the departed disciples.

462
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,319
I will compensate you anyway.

463
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:03,319
They died because of this mission.

464
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,200
I also need an advanced payment.

465
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,319
Everyone in my sect is running around
in search of the treasure

466
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,799
with no other means of livelihood.

467
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,000
We run across the nation.

468
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,160
Expenses for food and clothing.

469
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Carriages and horses renting.

470
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Everything requires money.

471
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,279
Now we are pretty straitened.

472
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,240
So could you please

473
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,880
advance some of the payment?

474
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,000
Do you have other means
of making a living?

475
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,440
People always need to eat.

476
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,759
I have to do something to get by.

477
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,599
Before this, we were security escorts.

478
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,880
The best swordsman

479
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,359
would be a security escort?

480
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,720
You said yourself
I am the best swordsman.

481
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,519
So I would not
bully the weak and plunder homes.

482
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
However, it also is a way
to earn a living.

483
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,319
Your Highness, you need not mock me.

484
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,559
Zhuo Bufan.

485
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,039
You really are extraordinary.

486
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,000
Go to the accounting room
to get the silver.

487
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Thanks, Your Highness.

488
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,160
I shall take my leave.

489
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,440
Who does he think he is?

490
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,920
He didn't get what I wanted,

491
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,039
and yet wanted to jack up the price.

492
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
He is on a mission.

493
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,720
It's normal people died.

494
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,680
He can quit if he gets scared.

495
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,119
Please calm down.

496
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,519
Bring Jiang Hen here.

497
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:39,424
Yes.

498
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:40,480
Wait.

499
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,559
Ask Yu Huanjie

500
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,960
to come meet me alone.

501
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,368

00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,559
I have brought Yu Huanjie here.

523
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,599
Greetings,

524
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,559
Your Highness.

525
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,839
Tell me.

526
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,480
How likely is it that

527
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,440
Zhuo Bufan will find the Altar Treasure?

528
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,359
Your Highness.

529
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:22,920
I...

530
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,559
I think

531
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,559
it's around 60 or 70 percent.

532
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,759
If that's the case,

533
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,440
then why Zhuo Bufan said

534
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
that this was extremely difficult?

535
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,559
From what you see,

536
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,720
how much is he interested

537
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,079
in the secret treasure?

538
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,720
Zhuo Bufan, he...

539
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,240
Actually he really wants
to find the treasure.

540
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,039
For what reason?

541
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,720
Your Highness.

542
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,519
Zhuo Bufan is a martial fanatic.

543
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,400
It is said that
within the Altar Treasure,

544
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,480
there are Shaolin martial arts
scriptures hidden.

545
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,279
These are the things
Zhuo Bufan dreams of obtaining.

546
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,839
If so,

547
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,640
he could also join hands
with the Department.

548
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,480
We wouldn't dare.

549
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,279
We would not dare.

550
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,640
Rest assured, Your Highness.

551
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,680
You may not dare to do it.

552
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,480
Zhuo Bufan is different.

553
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,839
If I want to you to find the treasure,

554
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,279
how likely is that?

555
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,039
Your Highness.

556
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,599
If I were the one to look for it,

557
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,599
I should say 60 or 70 percent.

558
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,799
You may rise.

559
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,759
Thank you.

560
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,680
If you had the chance to
become Sect Leader of Rongtian Ridge,

561
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,279
would you take it?

562
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,519
I wouldn't dare to even think about it.

563
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,319
I will put it in another way.

564
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,039
The position of Sect Leader
of Rongtian Ridge

565
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,960
and three thousand taels of gold.

566
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,839
Two options.

567
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,960
Which will you choose?

568
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,839
Your Highness.

569
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,799
Rongtian Ridge

570
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,279
has been in decline for many years.

571
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,759
We're always living

572
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,000
a life of poverty and wandering.

573
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,839
Even if we rebuild our sect one day,

574
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,359
I reckon life wouldn't be much easier.

575
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:25,920
So,

576
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,599
it's perhaps better

577
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,359
to have some money,

578
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,240
then I can live an easy life.

579
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,200
You're being quite frank.

580
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,640
Sit down and let's talk.

581
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,640
Thank you, Your Highness

582
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,079
Do you know the saying?

583
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,079
Great men seek profit.

584
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,279
Ordinary men seek fame.

585
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,160
Please enlighten me.

586
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,599
Great men are well-resourced

587
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,160
and can easily make profits.

588
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,640
With profit,

589
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,400
they can use money to buy reputation.

590
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,039
The reason ordinary men seek fame

591
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,079
is because they have no money,

592
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,240
and they can only pursue reputation.

593
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,400
They use that reputation
to exchange for money.

594
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,288
Your Highness.

595
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,799
It's like a sudden enlightenment.

596
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,799
The Sect Leader of Rongtian Ridge
is just a title.

597
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,160
The first Sword Sect
is also just a name.

598
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,920
You didn't choose the title
but the money.

599
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
That's smart.

600
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,640
A choice like the great men will make.

601
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,480
How dare I claim to be a great man?

602
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:43,079
From today onwards,
you will contact me directly

603
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,559
and report to me every detail

604
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,319
about what Zhuo Bufan does.

605
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:48,960
Yes.

606
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,720
I will carefully follow your orders.

607
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,559
That is 300 taels.

608
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,319
As a reward for you.

609
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,400
If the Altar Treasure is found,

610
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,000
I will give you 3,000 taels of gold,

611
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,839
and grant you the position
of a third-rank military official.

612
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,440
Every Sect Leader,

613
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,519
in accordance with regulations,

614
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,960
must kneel when seeing an official.

615
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,000
Let alone a third-rank high official.

616
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,480
Yu Huanjie.

617
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,400
As long as you are loyal to me,

618
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:23,799
I will ensure you
gain both fame and fortune.

619
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

620
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
Thank you for your trust.

621
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,079
Thank you for the opportunity.

622
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,839
I will lay down my life

623
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,480
and by loyal to you until death.

Huanjie.

643
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,079
What are you doing?

644
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,319
Bufan.

645
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,799
All I do is for everyone's sake.

646
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,519
Look at you.

647
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,599
And you.

648
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,880
Look at yourselves.

649
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,720
If people see you

650
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,279
in these clothes

651
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,400
and with that hairstyle,

652
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,160
they can tell we are from Lingxi.

653
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,640
I know.

654
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,559
Everyone has pride.

655
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,000
Nobody wants to
wear the Manchu's clothes

656
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,079
or keep the Manchu hairstyle.

657
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,759
I don't want to either.

658
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,200
But we all inquire
about information everywhere,

659
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,160
so someone has to disguise, right?

660
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,440
I also hesitated

661
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,960
for many days.

662
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,119
But I have made up my mind.

663
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,640
I'll do it.

664
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,680
I will shave my head.

665
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,359
I will change my clothes.

666
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,960
If we ever need to ask around

667
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,319
or meet someone,

668
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,640
I will do it.

669
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,200
So we also won't be exposed.

670
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
Huanjie.

671
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,759
That's so nice of you.

672
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,440
Then should I also...

673
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,976
Don't.

674
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,576
Don't.

675
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,759
I am doing this

676
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,880
because I don't want you
to feel ashamed.

677
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,160
Appreciate it, Huanjie,

678
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:23,920
for what you do.

679
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,359
When we find the treasure,

680
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,880
I definitely

681
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,839
won't keep the hair.

682
00:29:37,312 --> 00:29:38,442
(21st day of the 4th month, 1911)

683
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:39,680
(Grain in Ear is 19 days away)

684
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,759
Is this your home?

685
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Yes.

686
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,039
I haven't returned for 12 years.

687
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,279
The Department has treated you well.

688
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,119
Such a nice mansion.

689
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,400
I am a Hound anyway.

690
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,720
They won't treat me badly.

691
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,440
I live in this room?

692
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,960
You can see me clearly from your room.

693
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,519
If you're not satisfied,

694
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,480
I can also lock you

695
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,559
by my window.

696
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,359
How could I be dissatisfied?

697
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,519
Thanks for not sending me to prison
of Ministry of Justice.

698
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,559
You don't need to thank me.

699
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,880
You understand why I didn't lock you up.

700
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,680
You also understand
why I let you live here.

701
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,240
So you don't need me to tell you

702
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,279
what to do, right?

703
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,519
I can't escape.

704
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,079
It would only be worse if I get caught.

705
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:44,680
So,

706
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,400
I will just stay here.

707
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,160
Mr. Muqing.

708
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,960
When can we talk?

709
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,359
Someone will bring you meals
at mealtime.

710
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,960
If you need anything,
just tell the servants.

711
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:57,920
This is Shuntian.

712
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,960
If you want to talk,

713
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,519
I'll take you to the torture chamber.

714
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,720
Torture devices are all there.

715
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,240
One talk for one punishment.

716
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,279
Settle it in one go.

717
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,240
I won't spare you anymore.

718
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,200
We have searched for over 100 years.

719
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,519
How could we find it
with just half a map?

720
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,400
There's nothing in the Bodhi Seal.

721
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,160
It's said that the treasure map
was destroyed long ago.

722
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,759
The Bodhi's inheritor
can't be that foolish.

723
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,599
Surely not.

724
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,279
Did you find anything?

725
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,799
Nothing.

726
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,480
There must be some clue.

727
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,400
This secret compartment
is quite special.

728
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
I plan to find out its origin.

729
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:45,039
How was Tan Xian's bodyguard dealt with?

730
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,880
She is being detained by my side.

731
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,920
She should be in Ministry of Justice.

732
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,319
But I'm afraid she knows more.

733
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,599
And just in case
she can be of use later on.

734
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,519
As long as she can be of use to you,

735
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
don't worry about anything.

736
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,720
Yes.

737
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,559
Sir, look.

738
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,599
On this end of this piece,

739
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,720
there is a knotty part.

740
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,799
Other end is a cross-section.

741
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:28,920
This piece of Bodhi Department.

742
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,200
One end also has a knotty part.

743
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,039
One is a cross-section.

744
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,119
You say they are the head and the end?

745
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,519
So that means
the seals of the Altar Treasure

746
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,000
are more than just two.

747
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,680
This is cinnamomum micranthum.

748
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,759
It originates from Fujian.

749
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,160
Although it's not rare,
it's also not common.

750
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,279
If you want to gather a whole piece,

751
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,839
it will probably take
one to two more sections.

752
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,000
Lucky Mall.

753
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,359
Lucky is my English name.

754
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,039
You don't remember?

755
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,480
It means good luck.

756
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,839
Mall is not the 'hat' in Chinese.

757
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,240
That's also English.

758
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,480
It's a general store.

759
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,119
I know.

760
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:12,799
Right.

761
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,880
I am being stupid.

762
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,519
Princess, you have studied abroad.

763
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,039
So we can talk happily

764
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,160
without language barrier.

765
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,359
The Chinese name
for our store is Han Can Hui.

766
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,359
The stars glimmer brilliantly
in the vast and boundless sky.

767
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,200
It means the goods in our store

768
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,519
are both abundant and fine.

769
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,720
Opening an upscale boutique
in the capital

770
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,160
has been my wish for many years.

771
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,119
I will surely make Han Can Hui

772
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,680
prosper and thrive.

773
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,240
Thank you, princess.

774
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,559
Let's do it as usual.

775
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,559
You will be my first guest.

776
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,279
When you finish,
other people can select then.

777
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,599
Things will be more convenient.

778
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,799
The shop is just at the front gate.

779
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,119
If you want to go and have a look,

780
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,160
please make your way over.

781
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,359
If you don't want to

782
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,160
go over there,

783
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,559
I will bring it over for you.

784
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,160
Here.

785
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,079
I need not say more.

786
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,039
Look.

787
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
Why are you giving me a gift?

788
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,519
I am about to open my business
in the next few days.

789
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,920
I have to invite friends
to support the grand opening.

790
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,720
If so,

791
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,720
who could be more distinguished
than you?

792
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:08,400
Princess.

793
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,679
If you don't come,

794
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,079
I would be heartbroken.

795
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,239
Your invitation.

796
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,039
I am busy with official duties.

797
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:21,599
Buddy.

798
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,639
My shop is so close to your place.

799
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,840
Walk a little

800
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,400
and it's right at your own doorstep.

801
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,880
It won't be a bother at all.

802
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,039
I want to look good.

803
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,079
No need to prepare money.

804
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,800
I have already taken care of it.

805
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
This is a nice gesture from me.

806
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,320
Please go.

807
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,639
I'd really appreciate it.

808
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,920
This is for the day of the opening.

809
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,360
You need to give it to me.

810
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,960
Just hand it over.

811
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,639
The gift.

812
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,760
You don't need to worry either

813
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,920
as I have already bought it.

814
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,880
It is absolutely presentable

815
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,079
and definitely nice.

816
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,920
At that time,
just hand it over to me directly.

817
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,400
I've even had
the written couplets prepared.

818
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,079
By a famous calligrapher.

819
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:57,504
(Wealth flows in abundantly)

820
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,679
If the signature "best of yamen"
embarrasses you

821
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,960
and makes you uncomfortable,

822
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,000
I'll immediately have them

823
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,119
rewrite it and send it over.

824
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,119
I am telling you.

825
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,840
Don't put my name on it.

826
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,079
I'm not just some
random friend of yours.

827
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,400
And when the opening comes,

828
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,280
many wives of nobility and royalty

829
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,480
will be there.

830
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,760
Many influential figures

831
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,960
are also going to come.

832
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,079
Then why do you need me?

833
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:19,679
I need you!

834
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,000
They are all clients.

835
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
You are my brother.

836
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,960
And my clients are all prestigious.

837
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,719
Several consorts of Prince Dun.

838
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
The wife and mother-in-law
of the Central Official.

839
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,880
Princess Wulan Shan of Prince Qi's.

840
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,599
They will be there.

841
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,079
Muqing.

842
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,039
If you don't come,

843
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,280
then I'll be truly heartbroken.

844
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,136
(Invitation)

845
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,199
Brother.

846
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,559
My dear brother.

847
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,559
My store has both Chinese
and Western antiques.

848
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,519
They are unique and classic.

849
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,079
You've seen my discernment.

850
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,519
Things that I have collected

851
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,800
can be passed down through generations

852
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,840
and even through the ages.

853
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,519
Muqing.

854
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,039
If you have any good stuff

855
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,679
and want to sell it at a high price,

856
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,719
come to me.

857
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,920
We're brothers.

858
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,519
I'll definitely give you a big discount
on the commission.

859
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,880
I actually do have a treasure.

860
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
Give me an estimate first.

861
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,639
Alright.

862
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,400
Bring it here.

863
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:23,719
Let's see.

864
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:26,880
Cinnamomum micranthum.

865
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
The wood is from Fujian.

866
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,119
It produces wood carvings.

867
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,119
But not many nice ones.

868
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,679
Cinnamomum micranthum
is not something common,

869
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,480
but it's also not quite rare.

870
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,239
Craftsmanship is not bad.

871
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,079
It is worth 20 taels at most.

872
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:40,704
No.

873
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,320
See the cross-section.

874
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,840
This thing comes as a set.

875
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,719
If there's only this one

876
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,960
and it is sold as a single item,

877
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,280
it is worth 15 taels at most.

878
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,239
You do have good eyes.

879
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,239
Not only can you tell the material,

880
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,559
but also know it's part of a set.

881
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,960
Brother.

882
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,880
It's not anything valuable.

883
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,239
Why bother hiding so cautiously?

884
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,000
Take them all out at once.

885
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,320
Can you make it simple?

886
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,599
Just take them all out.

887
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,239
I need to see everything
to give you a fair estimate.

888
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,079
I only have these two pieces.

889
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,280
Then I can't tell.

890
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,000
Hear me.

891
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,719
1,000 taels.

892
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,159
Buddy.

893
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,159
Are you short of money recently?

894
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,000
So you got desperate.

895
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,320
As long as you can find out

896
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,079
how many pieces are there in this set

897
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,480
and also its origin,

898
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll give you 1,000 taels.

899
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,480
Then I've got to earn this money.

900
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,719
I've got to earn it.

901
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,360
Muqing.

902
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,440
Let me take the wood back.

903
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
I will study it thoroughly.

904
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,199
One day.

905
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:37,728
No.

906
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,599
Half a day.

907
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,599
Within half a day,

908
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,280
I'll definitely get to the bottom of it.
