1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,279
We've wasted lots of time.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,560
We must hurry up.

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:17,719
Jialuo.

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,760
You are a good person.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,280
It's my duty. I can't stand by.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,800
Unexpectedly,

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,039
I didn't help at all.

8
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,879
I mean.

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,879
You are a good person.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
Why did you suddenly say that?

11
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,079
I saw you talking

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,280
to that little girl.

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,560
What were you saying?

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,359
I told her to remember her name,

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,920
Shen Linglong.

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,000
Name is very important.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,320
Yes.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,679
Yes, it is.

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,399
Jialuo.

20
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,319
If only I had met you even earlier.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,519
Haven't we met now?

22
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:09,799
Even earlier?

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,480
You were still in Japan.

24
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,640
We would not have met.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,439
I mean,

26
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,879
if only I could have met you

27
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,400
when I was little.

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,400
When I was little, I lived in Dagu.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,239
Back then, I studied
with my father and grandfather.

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,480
Even then, we wouldn't have met.

31
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,280
Never mind.

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,759
Ten people.

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,879
Some of them are boys
and older than you.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,080
You beat them all

35
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,199
and snatch this chicken.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,919
What is your name?

37
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,280
You don't have a name?

38
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,240
Very good.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,400
People without names are remarkable.

40
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,360
When you snatched this chicken,

41
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,960
someone pulled your hair and bit you.

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,639
But I never saw you cry.

43
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,439
It means you're hard-hearted.

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,360
I like that.

45
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,080
Crying will only make you weaker.

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,479
Only hard-hearted people
can become stronger.

47
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,400
If you can catch up with me

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,879
before I reach that street corner,
I will take you with me.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Afterward, you will sleep in a soft bed

50
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,879
in a cozy house.

51
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,199
You can eat as much chicken as you want.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,039
I will make you strong.

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,879
In this world,

54
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,240
once you become stronger,
no one can bully you again.

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
Otherwise,

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,719
you will always be trampled underfoot.

57

59
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,018
(Quanzhou, Fujian)

60
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,360
Salute!

61
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:03,610
(Second Regiment of Fujian Army)

62
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,079
How come you're here?

63
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,040
The accommodation you arranged for me

64
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,279
is pretty far from here.

65
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,639
It took a long time to get here by car.

66
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,800
The camp can't be compared to the house
in the city.

67
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,839
After all, we need
to accommodate many soldiers.

68
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,839
I understand.

69
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,199
I think

70
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,600
it's okay to live in the camp with you.

71
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,800
How could that be okay?

72
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,680
You all may leave.

73
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

74
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,399
Come.

75
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,759
You've come with me to this place.

76
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
It's already condescension.

77
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,160
How can I let you live
in a military camp?

78
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,399
You should just stay in the city.

79
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,120
I'll come to you
once I'm done with my work.

80
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,160
I've bought some local specialties.

81
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,439
I'm not sure if you like it.

82
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,360
Okay, let me try.

83
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,560
Here.

84
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,759
I think

85
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,360
I have to get used to local flavors.

86
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,319
Recently, you and my father

87
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
have been all secretive.

88
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,879
He made a real effort
to transfer you to Fujian.

89
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,639
What on earth are you up to?

90
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,439
Do you have a plan?

91
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,199
No.

92
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,839
It's just a normal personnel transfer.

93
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,799
I am a soldier.

94
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,600
I've already come here with you.

95
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,240
Why are you keeping it from me?

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,919
I'm your wife, not a stranger.

97
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,279
You and my father must be
up to something important.

98
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,440
Since you know it's something important,

99
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,000
I certainly can't tell you.

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,240
Your father doesn't allow it.

101
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,039
He's not here right now.

102
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,399
Whether he's here or not, I can't say.

103
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,600
Shan.

104
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,720
It's a man's business.

105
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
You stay out of this.

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Shan.

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,639
I really can't tell you.

108
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,960
It's a state and military affair.

109
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,159
Alright, enough.

110
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,000
I was just asking.

111
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,559
If you can't speak of it, then don't.

112
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,960
I might not be interested
even if you told me.

113
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,840
You're definitely not interested.

114
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,279
If it weren't for military orders,

115
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,480
even I would find it dull.

116
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,639
If you're bored, go and watch operas.

117
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,600
I hear the puppet show and Gaojia opera

118
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,519
are quite splendid.

119
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,480
Alright.

120
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,519
I'll go and watch it.

121
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,080
Try this.

122
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,039
Salute.

123
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,559
Go back and rest.

124
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,919
Do whatever you want.

125
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,840
I'll come to you
when I'm done with my work.

126
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,879
I have been very busy lately.

127
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,840
But I have no choice.

128
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,600
Don't work too hard.

129
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,919
You can't do everything at once.

130
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,879
Don't be too tired.

131
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,039
Okay, I'll keep it in mind.

132
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,840
Let's go.

133
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,720
She's been ignoring me these years.

134
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,240
What's wrong with her now?

135
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,159
She suddenly started to care about me.

136
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,200
Can't she stay in the capital?

137
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Why must she come?

138
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,000
It really displeases me.

139
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,240
You haven't eaten yet?

140
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,519
I was waiting for you.

141
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,679
If I come back late,

142
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,720
you eat first.

143
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,440
Don't wait for me.

144
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,639
It's okay. I'm not hungry anyway.

145
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,159
You're alone

146
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,720
and have nothing to do.

147
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,360
Are you bored?

148
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,960
No, I'm not.

149
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
I can read.

150
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,399
What's the point of reading it?

151
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,519
Do you want to watch a show?

152
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,159
A show?

153
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,559
♪Carefree Putuo of the Southern Sea♪

154
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:42,720
- Great.
- Great.

155
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,799
This is the marionette.

156
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,039
It's already many centuries old.

157
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,200
It's a puppet show.

158
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,399
Quanzhou has the most famous puppeteers.

159
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,240
It's said that good puppeteers

160
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,600
can manipulate several puppets at once.

161
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,919
A single person can

162
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,919
perform a show alone.

163
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,919
These puppets

164
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,200
actually do not know

165
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,480
whether they're happy or sad.

166
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,039
They don't know

167
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,960
people are manipulating them

168
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,720
and making them move as expected.

169
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,639
What makes you say that?

170
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,440
People can control those puppets,

171
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,720
but they're just performers.

172
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,039
They cannot decide

173
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,759
whether they're happy or not.

174
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,600
You are quite interesting.

175
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,240
Interesting?

176
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,960
Your words sound interesting.

177
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,960
Reading has changed you.

178
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,480
There were many things
I didn't understand before.

179
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,759
I thought that since something exists,

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,159
it should be normal.

181
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,480
After reading books, I started to think

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,679
about what should be normal

183
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,200
and what shouldn't be.

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,879
Reading enlightens you.

185
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,080
When you start to think,

186
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,639
it indicates you have begun to doubt.

187
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,399
When you have already done it,

188
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,399
it means you have already agreed.

189
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,600
I agree?

190
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,840
But didn't you say
I was reading a banned book?

191
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,039
Books that can enlighten people

192
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,840
are naturally banned by the court.

193
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,000
What should I do if I agree?

194
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,559
Join the revolution.

195
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,919
I can't.

196
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,200
No one is born knowing how to do it.

197
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,600
I dare not.

198
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,000
Without giving it a try,

199
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,279
you won't know if you dare.

200
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you dare?

202
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
The nation is so weak

203
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,639
that other countries dare to invade us.

204
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,600
I do not want such a country.

205
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,240
Beiyang is very powerful.

206
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,759
But even so,

207
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,279
it serves this weak nation.

208
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,919
I don't know if Beiyang can

209
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,679
change the country.

210
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,240
But for now, I identify with Beiyang.

211
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,519
If one day,

212
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,679
Beiyang can no longer
gain my recognition,

213
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,600
perhaps I will choose a way

214
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,039
that I can identify with.

215
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,240
What way?

216
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,559
Revolution?

217
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,720
Will you?

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,960
Do you dare?

219
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,600
Yes, I will, and I dare as well.

220
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,639
But I don't want to lose.

221
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,159
If I do it, I must win.

222
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,399
If you dare,

223
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
I dare to follow you.

00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,919
Do you dare not to follow me?

227
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,519
(Sir.)

228
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,480
(Quanzhou, Fujian)
(It happened 43 years ago.)

229
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,279
I'm 24 this year.

230
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,120
I heard of it from my father

231
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,240
when I was a child.

232
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,679
He said that my inn was really lucky

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,639
for receiving ministers from the palace.

234
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,320
They were generous,

235
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,639
paying for the room for several days.

236
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,039
Speaking of which,

237
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,639
my inn is indeed fortunate.

238
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,759
See, you've checked in my inn.

239
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,320

I will keep the ledger for now.

That's all.

Yes.

250
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,000
Is there nothing left to investigate?

251
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,679
That was 43 years ago.

252
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,960
He really can't know.

253
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,480
If he could know,

254
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,759
would we need to investigate it?

255
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,600
We found Luan Yi's token
at the Start of Autumn day.

256
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,799
A few days
before the Start of Autumn 43 years ago,

257
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,440
Luan Yi had already left the inn.

258
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,440
But his room remained empty.

259
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,559
He overpaid for the room,

260
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,840
and the innkeeper was afraid
he would come back and stay,

261
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,559
so the room remained vacant

262
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,559
for almost a month
after the Start of Autumn.

263
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,279
Luan Yi might be dead or have left.

264
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,320
Why was his token

265
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,080
sent back to the inn?

266
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,480
Dozens of guards went with him.

267
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,559
But why was

268
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,600
only his token returned

269
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,919
with a Buddhist verse?

270
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,240
That's because there was a possibility

271
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
that they might return to the inn.

272
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,919
If someone else wanted to find Luan Yi,

273
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,080
they would come back here.

274
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,559
This is a clue left by Luan Yi.

275
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,559
Luan Yi isn't an inheritor of seals.

276
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,120
He doesn't need to be secretive

277
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,759
or leave clues.

278
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,840
In my opinion,

279
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,480
it looks like a farewell letter.

280
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,919
To whom?

281
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,319
Imperial guards always have their tokens
on themselves.

282
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,319
If the token is taken off,

283
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,359
it means they're dead or missing.

284
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
If he'd been dead, who would've
returned his token to the inn?

285
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,519
Exactly.

286
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,880
So 43 years ago,

287
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,119
Luan Yi did not die

288
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,200
or disappear.

289
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,599
He just got rid of his identity
as an imperial guard.

290
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,440
Whether Luan Yi is dead or has left,

291
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
I think you have little chance

292
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,680
to find him.

293
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:30,880
Why?

294
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,400
That was 43 years ago.

295
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,640
Is he still alive now?

296
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,400
43 years ago,

297
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,440
your people went to Fujian

298
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,799
for investigation but found nothing.

299
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
43 years later,

300
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,640
what progress can you make
if you rely on info

301
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,720
from two unknown sources?

302
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,319
Don't you know I'm a good detective?

303
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,519
There are many ways
to find a person or a thing,

304
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,559
Different ways

305
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,519
make good or bad detectives.

306
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,839
What are the ways of good detectives?

307
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,839
The Imperial Household Department

308
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,319
is special and different
from other yamens.

309
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,640
When we handle cases

310
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
in various places,

311
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,759
the local officials will treat us well.

312
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,599
Even higher-rank officials

313
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,240
will treat us with great respect.

314
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,519
Yes.

315
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,079
How bossy you are.

316
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,160
We're not bossy.

317
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:16,920
Never mind.

318
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,039
Say whatever you want.

319
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,720
When bossy officials like us
handle cases,

320
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,079
we don't need money.

321
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:25,000
The local officials will resolve it.

322
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:25,960
Even if money is needed,

323
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
we'll use the banknotes
with special marks.

324
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,839
Once the banknotes are drawn,

325
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,440
the private banks will record it.

326
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,279
I understand.

327
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,000
If the guards wanted
to investigate Luan Yi,

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
they would start with the banknote.

329
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,000
They did not find anything,

330
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,119
which means Luan Yi did not

331
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,200
spend the special banknote.

332
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,440
Luan Yi knew this would leave traces,

333
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,559
so he would not spend the banknotes.

334
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,559
But he had to eat

335
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,960
which required money.

336
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,400
When imperial guards are on business,

337
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,519
they will have a little money on them

338
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,680
but will run out of money soon.

339
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,680
Even if Luan Yi wanted to run away,

340
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,039
he would need money.

341
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,240
So where did the money come from?

342
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,960
He probably wouldn't resort to stealing
or robbing.

343
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,440
Nor would he find a job.

344
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,119
Luan Yi and his guards

345
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,720
would sell their possessions.

346
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,839
Especially Luan Yi.

347
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,640
As a top imperial guard,

348
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
he had quite a few items on him.

349
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,359
All from the palace

350
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
and they're valuable.

351
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,519
More importantly,

352
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,200
these items

353
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,079
were valuable treasures.

354
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,599
Even after 43 years,

355
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,079
it's still possible to find them.

356
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,200
Now you know

357
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,279
why I took Lin Haohan, a snob, with me.

358
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,079
In terms of searching for antiques
and treasures,

359
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,960
this guy is truly a genius.

360
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,319
This is the best product

361
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,920
in my store.

362
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,720
A treasure from the palace.

363
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,160
200 taels.

364
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,559
It's a good deal.

365
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,599
If this is from the palace,

366
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,240
my underpants will be the same
as the emperor's.

367
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,359
This base is cast
from melted-down silver.

368
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,839
Don't you know that?

369
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
It's from the palace. So what?

370
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,680
Even if a minor official's wife

371
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,559
wants a necklace,

372
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,839
it will be made of gold, right?

373
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,000
This chain is made of gold.

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,359
Dare you tell me this is pure gold?

375
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
At a glance,

376
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,839
I can tell it's not pure.

377
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,559
And look at its workmanship.

378
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,400
Any craftsman

379
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,599
can make it easily.

380
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,200
What? You...

381
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,119
Well,

382
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,519
the quality of this gemstone is okay.

383
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,400
You can fool a layman.

384
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,680
Unluckily for you, I'm an expert.

385
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,480
I offer 12 taels.

386
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,720
Considering we hit it off,

387
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,519
I offer 15 taels.

388
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Otherwise, I won't buy it.

389
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,720
You can't sell it out.

390
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,240
I'll accuse you of hoarding stuff
from the palace.

391
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,960
That is a crime, you know.

392
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,079
What? Sir.

393
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,440
If you find it expensive,
you don't have to buy it.

394
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,640
But don't threaten me.

395
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,400
How about this?

396
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,079
You go ahead and accuse me.

397
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,640
You said it yourself.

398
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,440
This isn't from the palace.

399
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,519
What will you accuse me of?

400
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,200
Great.

401
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,720
I can tell you're straightforward.

402
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
So am I.

403
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
I'll offer you ten more taels.

404
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,119
25 taels.

405
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,599
200 taels.

406
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,240
Either you accuse me,

407
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,559
or you leave.

408
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,200
30 taels, and we'll be friends.

409
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,599
Department business.

410
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,440
The money is yours,
and the item is mine.

411
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,559
What?

412
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,319
That's not how things are done.

413
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,240
What have I done?

414
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
It's at most worth 35 taels.

415
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,759
I was about to close the deal.

416
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,000
Why did you give him the money?

417
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,799
I'm investigating a case, not shopping.

418
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,119
But I am shopping.

419
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,599
It's my fault
if you overpay for this item.

420
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,279
You're embarrassing me.

421
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,319
You're hurting my professional dignity.

422
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,559
Is it that serious?

423
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:36,920
Very serious.

424
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,759
I have an idea.

425
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,759
After I finish questioning,

426
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,839
you buy it from him again.

427
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,799
You've already revealed your identity.

428
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,599
Do you need to pay?

429
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,039
Just take it away.

430
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,960
Lin Haohan.

431
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,880
I also have professional dignity.

432
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,759
Take it away?

433
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,039
Can I do that as an official?

434
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,960
Tell me.

435
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,640
What's special about this item?

436
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,559
As you told me,

437
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,880
I've been

438
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,079
looking for suspicious stuff.

439
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,240
After looking for days,

440
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,480
I found this item most suspicious.

441
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
There's only one reason.

442
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,200
It doesn't match.

443
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,160
This gem

444
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,240
is a top-quality opal.

445
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,656
Its material is the same as the one
on the hats of officials

446
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:15,759
of fourth rank and above.

447
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,000
It's also the same as the one
on the imperial guards' belts.

448
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,039
It was made

449
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,480
by a state-owned shop.

450
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,519
It's neat with no flaws.

451
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,920
But look at the chain.

452
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,359
It is of poor quality,
made by a private shop.

453
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,319
It has many defects.

454
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,160
This gem

455
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,200
is much more valuable
than the chain and base.

456
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,599
After combining them,

457
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,119
how can it not be suspicious?

458
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,400
Sir.

459
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,200
Sir.

460
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,400
Found it.

461
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,440
Ten years ago,

462
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,319
a procuress fell ill
and couldn't afford the treatment,

463
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,640
so she pawned it.

464
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,319
The redemption period has long passed.

465
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,119
It's overdue.

466
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,319
Overdue?

467
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,079
Yes.

468
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,039
That procuress failed

469
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,720
to cure her illness.

470
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
And she died.

471
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So,

472
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,359
no one will redeem it.

473
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,799
Ever since I saw

474
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,599
this mismatched chain,

475
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,920
I've been thinking
there must be a story behind it.

476
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,759
As expected,

477
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,559
this item is connected
to a woman in a brothel.

478
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,240
It tastes authentic.

479
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,160
Muqing.

480
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
It's getting late.

481
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,119
After finishing this, shall we go?

482
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,279
To where?

483
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,039
We're investigating a case.

484
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,559
To a dangerous place.

485
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,440
You don't have to go.

486
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,519
He's going to a brothel.

487
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,599
As the pawnbroker said,

488
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,519
the woman is already dead.

489
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,599
What can be found?

490
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,519
There must be some clues.

491
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,160
The clue you found is useless.

492
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,000
Go and find more.

493
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,440
How so?

494
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,759
Muqing.

495
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,359
So far,

496
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,799
this item has been the most suspicious.

497
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,880
I mean it.

498
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,920
I hear there's a night market.

499
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,319
It's dark now.

500
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,519
Check out the night market.

501
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,839
How can I find it in the night market?

502
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,759
You go and look.

503
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,079
I think the brothel...

504
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm telling you
to go to the night market.

505
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,240
Alright, I'll go.

506
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,279
Why are you still sitting here?

507
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:19,920
Just by myself?

508
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,519
If I follow you,

509
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,160
I'm afraid
of damaging your professional dignity.

510
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,119
Fine.

511
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm at your service.

512
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,039
What did he find?

513
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,279
What's the deal with the brothel?

514
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,359
Found it in a pawnshop.

515
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,000
A procuress pawned it.

516
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,240
What's wrong with this necklace?

517
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,400
The gemstone.

518
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,319
The gemstone on this

519
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,359
is an ornament worn
by the imperial guards.

520
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,240
Why did you send Lin Haohan
to the night market?

521
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,359
You don't want him to know too much?

522
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,799
He is too cunning.

523
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,079
It's related to the past
of the Department.

524
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:08,119
It might
damage the Department's prestige.

525
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,319
He'd better not know.

526
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:12,920
Now, I know about it.

527
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:14,880
You?

528
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,799
Have you ever thought

529
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,079
the Department was prestigious?

530
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,240
Take me to the brothel
to investigate the case.

531
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,039
Showing me how you solve the case

532
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,640
could save your face.

533
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,799
Who will go to the brothel

534
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,960
with a woman?

535
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,000
Watch your mouth.

536
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,559
In the brothel,

537
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,400
there are many younger pretty women,

538
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,039
not old women like you.

539
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,599
Just stay here.

540
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,599
Ten years ago,

541
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,960
did a procuress died of illness?

542
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:17,920
(Banknote)

543
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,440
Sir.

544
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,200
Have you ever come here?

545
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,920
What was her name?

546
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,480
Her name...

547
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,400
Qing.

548
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,200
Yes, her name was Qing.

549
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,960
Qing liked to wear cyan clothes,

550
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,359
so everyone called her Qing.

551
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,079
Did she have any lovers?

552
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:37,039
Qing had many lovers.

553
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,440
Before she became a procuress,

554
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,680
she also received clients.

555
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,079
So she had many lovers.

556
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,680
Qing has been here since she was young.

557
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,440
She was sold here when she was young

558
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,759
and became a pimp when she got older.

559
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,039
Finally, she died in her room.

560
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,319
Qing

561
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,359
never left the brothel
in her whole life.

562
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,759
Did she have any lovers before she died?

563
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,279
Back then, Qing was already a procuress.

564
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,359
If any close clients came,

565
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,599
she would let other girls
entertain them.

566
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,720
How many guards do you have?

567
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,079
About five or six.

568
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,359
All can fight.

569
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,480
How old are they?

570
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,359
They are all young,

571
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,720
in their early twenties.

572
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,400
Waiter, serve the wine.

573
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,400
Alright.

574
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,920
After you, please.

575
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,519
How dare you spoil my mood.

576
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,440
You're so useless.

577
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:07,968
Sir.

578
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:08,480
Get lost.

579
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,799
What do you think you are?

580
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,119
How dare you stop me.

581
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,720
I'm telling you.

582
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,880
I won't pay you.

583
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:16,920
What can you do?

584
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,559
What?

585
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,039
You wanna fight?

586
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,759
Come on.

587
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,359
This terrible place

588
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,559
spoiled my mood.

589
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,000
It's alright.

590
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,039
Don't let this ruin your mood.

591
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,119
Lin.

592
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,559
Sweep the floor.

593
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,039
Sorry, guys.

594
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,799
It's been 43 years.

595
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,240
Your kung fu is still good.

596
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,279
Have you been hiding
in a brothel for 43 years?

597
00:30:55,617 --> 00:30:57,312
(Luan Yi's Token)

598
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,119
Anyway, you are my senior.

599
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,559
Let's drink together.

600
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,720
The dishes here are sweet.

601
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,039
Are you used to it?

602
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,480
It's been 43 years.

603
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,799
I have to adapt to it.

604
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,599
Take this shrimp.

605
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,400
I couldn't even peel it before.

606
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,200
Now, after I finish the shrimp,

607
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,319
I can put the shell back together.

608
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,519
In this place,

609
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,359
the cook puts the fresh shrimp
directly in the pot

610
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,359
and blanches it with seawater.

611
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,519
Do not add any seasoning.

612
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,359
If you live here for ten years,

613
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,799
you will grow to like it.

614
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:57,632
(Luan Yi's Token)

615
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,440
Yes.

616
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,079
43 years ago,

617
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,759
I indeed served as the Emperor's guard.

618
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,240
I came here to do a job
for the imperial yamen.

619
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,680
But I am not Luan Yi.

620
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,240
I am Luan Yi's deputy.

621
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,759
What kind of person is Luan Yi?

622
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,839
He was a first-class imperial guard,

623
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,920
a senior third-rank official.

624
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,079
His kung fu was superb.

625
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,680
He was extremely loyal to the court.

626
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,720
However, he was extremely violent.

627
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,279
In 1868,

628
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,519
you were ordered to come here
to investigate the Altar Treasure.

629
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,599
It was Luan Yi who led the team, right?

630
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,599
What did you find back then?

631
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:01,920
We found something,

632
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,759
or we didn't.

633
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,480
It's been 43 years.

634
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,319
Some people have left.

635
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,319
And those who should die have all died.

636
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,039
There's nothing to hide.

637
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,799
I can tell you everything.

638
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,240
In 1868,

639
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,920
my mission

640
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,400
was to find the Altar Treasure.

641
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,920
But we found nothing.

642
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,160
Southern Shaolin was gone,

643
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,880
and we didn't know
if their descendants were still alive.

644
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
Even if they were alive,

645
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,400
we didn't know where they were.

646
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,839
So in that area,

647
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,160
we began a cruel search.

648
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,880
I say so

649
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,519
because Luan Yi's investigative methods

650
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,599
were utterly inhumane.

651
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,480
He always believed

652
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,039
that a Xianghua monk
who appeared in Fujian

653
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,160
had an inseparable connection
with Southern Shaolin.

654
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,239
(That Xianghua monk once appeared)

655
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,800
(at the locals' weddings and funerals.)

656
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,559
(In that case,)

657
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,199
(Luan Yi violently
elicited confessions.)

658
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,440
You're a funeral director.

659
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,639
Don't you know the Xianghua monk?

660
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,480
Say no again,

661
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,760
and I will kill you.

662
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,639
I hear

663
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,239
a Xianghua monk is invited
to your wedding.

664
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,039
You find them.

665
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,840
Otherwise,
I'll send you more bridegrooms.

666
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,920
The Xianghua monk Luan Yi tried to find
was called Wu Shuangbao.

667
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Finally, one day,

668
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,480
he found Wu Shuangbao staying

669
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,599
at the Futu Temple in the east.

670
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,119
So,

671
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,760
he led his men to kill him.

672
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,440
However,

673
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,119
something strange happened.

674
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,719
On the way

675
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,480
to the Futu Temple,

676
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,079
we contracted malaria.

677
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,079
Some of us died on the road.

678
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:24,920
The remaining ones, including Luan Yi,

679
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,519
were all on the brink of death.

680
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,320
(We arrived)

681
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
(at the Futu Temple like ghosts,)

682
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,840
(completely without the bravery
of the imperial guards.)

683
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,519
(Each of us was dying.)

684
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,559
(And the one who saved us)

685
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,599
(was the very Xianghua monk)

686
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,119
(we were looking for.)

687
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,559
(Wu Shuangbao
and the abbot of the Futu Temple)

688
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
(saved our lives.)

689
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,280
(After escaping death,)

690
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,280
(everyone was moved.)

691
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,199
(We thanked Wu Shuangbao)

692
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,679
(and decided to give up catching him.)

693
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,039
(However, Luan Yi did not allow it.)

694
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,079
(When the other guards refused
to carry out the orders,)

695
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,800
Luan Yi acted as if possessed
by a demon,

696
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,760
killing his subordinates.

697
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,480
(When Wu Shuangbao arrived,)

698
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,360
(the bodies were all over the ground.)

699
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,280
(Luan Yi was going on a killing spree.)

700
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,719
Do you also disobey?

701
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,400
Sir.

702
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,599
He saved our lives.

703
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,519
This is the line.

704
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,199
If you cross this line,

705
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,719
I will kill you.

706
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,280
I said if you cross this line,
I will kill you.

707
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:25,472
