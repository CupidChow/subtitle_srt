(Abyss Is Not Empty)

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,879
What are you nagging about for so long?

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,559
Just say the paraphrase.

4
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:23,640
Mister.

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,760
Or should I call you

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,600
senior brother?

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,359
We people

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,679
are from Arhat Hall.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,879
Then we are all brothers.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,000
Senior brother.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,679
You've hidden yourselves

12
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,520
too well.

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,399
I am impressed.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,479
Disguise themselves as pig butchers.

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,960
Who could have thought
of such a genius idea?

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,359
We don't know

17
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,679
who came up with the idea.

18
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,880
We've just been butchering pigs here.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,399
We follow Master's orders

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
and stand guard here.

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,359

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,399
we will help with all our might.

Rongtian Sword Sect

ultimately met its end at my hands.

25
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,760
We survived this.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,719
Just forget about the Sword Sect.

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,120
In this life,

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,239
we have sacrificed enough for it.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,640
Okay.

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,000

the first time I met her.)

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,120
(She stood beneath the flowers)

95
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
(with a smile
as warm as the spring breeze.)

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
(I cannot give her the promise)

99
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,560
(or the answer.)

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,920

101
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,800
(I was always
searching for that answer.)

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,000
(But having lived long
in the tumultuous world,)

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,040
(I only wish that there are no fights)

104
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,160

You have guarded this place

109

Don't you know what you are guarding?

110
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,680
We don't know.

111
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,920
Hasn't your master told you anything?

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,560
He did.

113
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,000
As long as the visitor
says the paraphrase,

114
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,839
we will help with all our might.

115
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,800
You two have been talking

116
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,759
and claimed to be from the Prajna Hall
and the Bodhi Department.

117
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,319
Why didn't you say the paraphrase?

118
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:34,959
No.

119
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,120
I was so worried.

120
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:36,920
Wait.

121
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,759
Don't you know

122
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,759
you are guarding a treasure here?

123
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,199
Treasure.

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,199
Treasure!

125
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,639
The pigs are the treasure.

126
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,488
Senior brother.

127
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,728
You are smart.

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,800
Muqing.

129
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,000
You don't have to say anything, Bufan.

130
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,399
I made you a promise

131
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,360
and I will keep my word.

132
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,759
I have decided not to be a swordsman.

133
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,600
Those things have no use to me.

134
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,199
There's a long life ahead.

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,879
You will go to travel
to many places, right?

136
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,519
You can abandon the main altar.

137
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,079
But you need money

138
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,000
and also those martial arts books.

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,680
Whatever you want

140
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,800
will all still be yours.

141
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,759
Muqing.

142
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,439
You truly are a gentleman.

143
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,079
But I'm afraid I can't meet you

144
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
at Futu Temple tonight.

145
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:42,720
Besides,

146
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,680
I also wish
you can find the Altar Treasure soon.

147
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,000
Where will you go?

148
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,720
Where should I look for you
after I obtain the secret treasure?

149
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,120
Meixun.

150
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,279
Meixun.

151
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,319
If you go there,

152
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,959
I will definitely treat you
to a cup of Queshe tea.

153
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll certainly go for that cup of tea.

154
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,319
Bufan.

155
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,879
Take care.

156
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,680
Take care.

157
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,079
Take care.

158
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,279
Let's go.

159
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,040
Are you planning to return to Meixun?

160
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,079
Yes.

161
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
I left when I was young,

162
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,439
and haven't returned since.

163
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,639
I can hardly remember
what Meixun looks like.

164
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,279
Then let's find a place
for you to recuperate.

165
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,720
When you've recovered,

166
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,319
we'll look for Men Sandao.

167
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,360
How do you know I will go to him?

168
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
You never like to owe others.

169
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
Men Sandao helped you today.

170
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,279
You surely want to do something

171
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,199
to return the favor.

172
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,279
He calls me Bufan now.

173
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
And I call him Muqing.

174
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,360
Who says the swordsmen and the officials

175
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
cannot be friends?

176
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,319
I don't understand what he wants to do.

177
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,319
But whatever it is,

178
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,920
I want to follow him.

179
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,159
Mr. Zhuo.

180
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,919
We aren't done yet.

181
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,112
Jialuo.

182
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,799
Can you spare my life?

183
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
Let you get away

184
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,679
once again?

185
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,440
My Rongtian Sword Sect is disbanded.

186
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,559
And my senior brother
Yu Huanjie is dead.

187
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,799
I have given the Discipline Seal
to Men Sandao.

188
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,240
Can't you just put this to an end?

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,559
End?

190
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,080
Has the Dagu murder case ended?

191
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,799
Has my master's death ended?

192
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,279
Today, it's not about whether you want
to fight with me or not.

193
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,639
It's that your Rongtian Ridge disciples
have committed a grave crime,

194
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,519
and you, as their leader,
cannot shirk the blame.

195
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,759
Today, I must bring you to justice.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,320
So, today

197
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,519
you want me dead, right?

198
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes.

199
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,919
The Dagu murder case
was the doing of Yu Huanjie.

200
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,279
Bufan was also very outraged.

201
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,879
Rongtian has already disbanded.

202
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,320
There is no longer such a sect.

203
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,399
May you show mercy

204
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,159
and spare our lives?

205
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,919
We will no longer hold the swords

206
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,440
and will live out our days in peace.

207
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,559
And what about my master?

208
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,600
Was my master a swordsman?

209
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,559
He was just a madman.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
What did he have to do with you?

211
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,960
He was living a quiet and mundane life
in retirement.

212
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,679
Did you think of sparing his life

213
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
when you killed him?

214
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,360
Sir.

215
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,200
Please spare us.

216
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,600
Huo Qin.

217
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,000
Huo Qin.

218
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:19,168
Get up.

219
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:19,712
I won't get up.

220
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't beg him.

221
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,919
I have to.

222
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,759
You didn't do wrong.

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,679
Don't beg him.

224
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:24,759
Bufan.

225
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,080
Wang Jialuo.

226
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,399
I'll take responsibility
for what I've done.

227
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,039
But remember,

228
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,279
this has nothing to do with Huo Qin.

229
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,360
Leave her out of this.

230
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,679
No matter what,

231
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,080
if you lay a finger on Zhuo Bufan,

232
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,600
you have to step over my dead body.

233
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,120
Huo Qin.

234
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,559
Today, I only want Zhuo Bufan.

235
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
If you insist on stopping me,

236
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,039
according to the Qing Code,

237
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:49,696
we can kill you.

238
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:50,200
Wang Jialuo.

239
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,960
Then kill me!

240
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,520
Huo Qin.

241
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,840
You far outnumber us.

242
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,440
What kind of man are you?

243
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,120
Huo Qin.

244
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,320
Does hiding behind a woman

245
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,679
make him a man?

246
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:01,879
Huo Qin.

247
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:02,879
Go!

248
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,039
I won't go.

249
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,399
Only death can do us apart.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,559
Wang Jialuo.

251
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,440
Wang Jialuo.

252
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,200
Go!

253
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,559
I won't go!

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,559
Jialuo.

255
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,600
Was it you who fired the gun?

256
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,336
Yes.

257
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,960
Zhuo Bufan and Huo Qin.

258
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,399
Did you kill them?

259
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,960
Shouldn't I?

260
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,080
Can you tell me

261
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,159
why I should not have killed him
according to the Qing Code?

262
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,679
According to the Qing Code,
you were right to kill.

263
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,360
But we had an agreement.

264
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,600
He gave me the seal.

265
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,759
He cooperated with us.

266
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,960
You should have kept your words.

267
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,799
Mr. Muqing.

268
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,879
You are an imperial guard.

269
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,639
Yet you don't talk about laws
but the chivalry.

270
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,919
I know breaking laws was wrong,

271
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,559
but you can't be that cold-blooded.

272
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,840
I beg to differ.

273
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,679
I've told you that something
was wrong with your woman.

274
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,000
But because she is your woman,

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,519
I have never captured
and interrogated her.

276
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,559
You should've done it!

277
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,519
After you told me, I investigated her.

278
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,240
Lin Anjing

279
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,840
was a spy under Sei I Shinpu's command.

280
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,879
I have already

281
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,080
executed her.

282
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,360
Wang Jialuo.

283
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,279
You're heartless.

284
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,960
I'm not heartless.

285
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,360
I must adhere to the Qing Code.

286
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,919
It has been hard
to be both loyal and filial.

287
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,600
Isn't it the same with love and law?

288
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,759
I will be at Futu Temple tonight.

289
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,440
Let's put it to an end.

290
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,159
(When we were kids, you told me)

was very beautiful.)

00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,640
(You said you'd take me there.)

293
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,720
But we've never been there.

294
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,319

Yes.

354
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,039
Ding Yu.

355

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,279
Good.

361
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,039
You all may return now.

362
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,240
Return?

363
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,039
Hasn't he already
taken care of his business?

364
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,519
I mean the Dagu murder case.

365
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,799
Now Rongtian Ridge
has already been annihilated.

366
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,079
All the criminals have been executed.

367
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,880
What more does he want to do?

368
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,759
To investigate the secret treasure

369
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,640
is not a case
of Dagu County Yamen, right?

370
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:34,480
No.

371
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,920
Everyone of 43rd Association.

372
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,759
Today you all can go back.

373
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:41,799
You.

374
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,599
Take off the clothes you are wearing

375
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,599
and return them to us.

376
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,560
We are leaving.

377
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,119
Ding Yu.

378
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,680
In recent days,

379
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,319
I have been under your care.

380
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,319
Thank you and the brothers.

381
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,839
I will do what he said.

382
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:46,920
Go back.

383
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,480
Jialuo.

384
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,400
Take care.

385
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,200
Take care.

386
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,160
43rd Association.

387
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,200
We are leaving.

388
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,799
I have heard about yesterday.

389
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,440
You had dozens of people there.

390
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,440
And those poisoned useless men

391
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,039
still managed to escape.

392
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,440
They are highly-skilled swordsmen.

393
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,920
How come

394
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,279
you call them useless?

395
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,480
I have never believed
in so-called skills.

396
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,839
Perhaps they were
of some use in the past.

397
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,480
But the era of cold weapons
has already become history.

398
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,200
If it were not
for the advancement of technology,

399
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,079
then how could a small place like Japan

400
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,319
become so powerful?

401
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,480
Let's get to the point.

402
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,839
What do you want?

403
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,039
It is not proper for me
to go to your station.

404
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,079
Because Prince Qi arrived in Quanzhou
this morning.

405
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,759
It seems you have already known.

406
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,759
I don't know your plans...

407
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,799
Just say it.

408
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,440
What do you want to do?

409
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,400
Prince Qi's visit here is most likely

410
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,799
for the ownership of the Altar Treasure.

411
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,599
But I don't think
he can turn the situation around.

412
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,119
However, for you,

413
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,599
after all, he is your father-in-law.

414
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,200
So, our goal this time

415
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,519
is completely aligned.

416
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,839
Killing those who hold the seals

417
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:55,960
is the best for both of us.

418
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:57,960
General Zhong.

419
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,480
There is not much time left.

420
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,160
If you hesitate any longer,

421
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,000
there's a good chance
the opportunity will be missed.

422
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,839
Zhuo Bufan is dead.

423
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,200
Rongtian Ridge has been annihilated.

424
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,279
Men Sandao saved him
when he was in danger.

425
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,359
Therefore, it is very likely
that the Discipline Seal

426
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,240
is already in the hands of Men Sandao.

427
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,400
The soldiers following Wang Jialuo

428
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,720
have been dismissed by me.

429
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,880
Now, he is on his own.

430
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,160
He is not important.

431
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,720
Because he never had the seal.

432
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,799
Then kill Men Sandao.

433
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,839
You should know where he is now.

434
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,359
Here.

435
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,160
Have a drink.

436
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,799
I know you're inside.

437
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,079
Come out.

438
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,480
Fight them?

439
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,039
Quit it.

440
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,759
They all have guns.
You can't fight them.

441
00:28:13,248 --> 00:28:13,799
Keep knocking.

442
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,304
Huang.

443
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,000
You and others leave.

444
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,039
They're coming after me.

445
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,680
Why should I go?

446
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,079
It's easier for me to escape
if you leave.

447
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,640
It's more difficult with so many of you.

448
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,920
Can you do it alone?

449
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,559
Just go.

450
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,000
I really want to go.

451
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,599
They have so many guns.

452
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,160
They will riddle you with bullets.

453
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,759
So you should hurry up and go.

454
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:50,839
Give it a try.

455
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,279
Maybe there is a way.

456
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,119
What way?

457
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,400
A gentleman doesn't stand
under a dangerous wall.

458
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,480
Under these circumstances,

459
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,400
surrendering and pledging allegiance
is the best choice.

460
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,599
You are Men Sandao.

461
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,519
You are Zhong Haichao.

462
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,960
Give me the seal.

463
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
There should be two seals.

464
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,799
The Bodhi Seal.

465
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,920
The Discipline Seal.

466
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,160
I don't like guns pointing at me.

467
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,160
Put down the gun.

468
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,119
I only want the seals.

469
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,839
Give me the seals.

470
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,559
I will let you go.

471
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,079
You point guns
at a second-rank imperial guard

472
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,680
and demand something from the court.

473
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,079
Now you even dare to let me go?

474
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,759
You must want to kill me to silence me.

475
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,240
If you dare take one more step forward,
I'll shoot.

476
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,480
You're right.

477
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,400
I will surely kill you.

478
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,079
If you don't hand them over,

479
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,920
I'll search your dead body.

480
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,440
General.

481
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:18,720
General Zhong.

482
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,192
General, it's me.

483
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:20,759
Me.

484
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,640
We have met before.

485
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,680
I am Lucky.

486
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,039
Don't.

487
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:24,680
Don't shoot.

488
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:25,960
I have the seals.

489
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:28,880
Come here.

490
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,079
I have been held hostage by Men Sandao

491
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,799
and been forced to help him.

492
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,400
General.

493
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,440
Help me.

494
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,559
The seals are here.

495
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,720
Lin Haohan!

496
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,880
What are you doing?

497
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,119
What?

498
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,039
If you want him to live,
put your guns down.

499
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,000
Lin Haohan, you...

500
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,480
Put the gun down.

501
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,920
Put the gun down.

502
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,119
Everyone.

503
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,480
Move back.

504
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,039
Further.

505
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:45,824
Further.

506
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,920
Perfect.

507
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,000
Get in the car.

508
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,799
Get in the car.

509
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:12,599
(That's right.)

510
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,160
I am the Prajna inheritor.

511
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,720
If you cross it,

512
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,359
I'll kill you.

513
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,240
(Lin Haohan.)

514
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,279
It means to live

515
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,319
in the vast forest.

516
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,960
Of course.

517
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,119
You can also call me
by my English name, Lucky.

518
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,240
Lucky.

519
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,200
In Chinese,

520
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,039
it means good luck.

521
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,119
You're lucky.

522
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,519
Today,

523
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,240
meeting you is lucky for me.

524
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,079
Meeting me is lucky for you.

525
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,279
Since we're so lucky,

526
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,759
let's have fun together.

527
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,760
(So close.)

528
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:11,840
(Miss Liu Lin.)

529
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,840
(If I hadn't been
quick-witted this time,)

530
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,000
we would have been in trouble.

531
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:16,960
How come you are

532
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,400
caught by those fierce and evil people?

533
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,360
Told you.

534
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,360
You should have followed me.

535
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,039
Just me

536
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,039
and you.

537
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,760
Let's get in the car together.

538
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,000
And share a large private room.

539
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,719
We'll go all the way

540
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,440
from Shanghai to Shanxi.

541
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,199
How about it?

542
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,280
(Miss Liu.)

543
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,320
(We have traveled together.)

544
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,719
(You know my character.)

545
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,719
I actually have no merit.

546
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,239
I only want money.

547
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,599
So, for money,

548
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,559
I have decided.

549
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,880
I will join Tongmenghui.

550
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,400
In this way, I am your comrade now.

551
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,840
You can tell me the secrets.

552
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,480
Then I will help you find the treasure.

553
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,920
And deliver it to our comrades
on your behalf.

554
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,280
Mr. Sun, our leader.

555
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,280
(Please firmly believe)

556
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,480
that darkness is temporary.

557
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
And it will eventually be broken
by dawn.

558
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:28,800
(The first light of morning
is bound to come.)

559
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,280
What about them?

560
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,679
Why are there only the two of you?

561
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,480
Lin Haohan

562
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,559
is dead.

563
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,480
Liu Lin.

564
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,079
Liu Lin.

565
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,960
Liu Lin.

566
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,800
What's the use of chanting scriptures?

567
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,199
She told me

568
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,480
her ideals

569
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,559
was to see this country change.

570
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,119
She believed that
there would be a new China.

571
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,679
If possible,

572
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,320
I hope they can witness

573
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,920
the future's new China.

574
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,000
If you believe it,

575
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,039
it will happen.

576
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,440
I believe it.

577
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,920
If you believe it,

578
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,719
then make it happen.

579
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,559
I will.

580
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,400
Muqing.

581
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,320
I will too.

582
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,000
Together, we will change the world.

583
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,199
But I only have
the Bodhi and Discipline Seal.

584
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
Lin Haohan is dead.

585
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,840
Prajna Seal.

586
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,400
Isn't Wu Shuangbao still alive?

587
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,239
Muqing.

588
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,360
Only Wang Jialuo isn't here.

589
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,039
He said

590
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,800
that he would come here tonight.

591
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:13,472
(Futu Temple)

592
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:49,760
You're here.

593
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,599
Where is Mr. Lin?

594
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,119
Hasn't he arrived?

595
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:01,199
Jialuo.

596
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Let's talk.

597
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,400
About what?

598
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,392
Okay.

599
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,199
Let's talk.

600
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:30,000
You are an imperial constable.

601
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,960
I am an imperial guard.

602
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,240
That's right.

603
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,039
We are both servants of the court.

604
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,440
You are a Dharma inheritor.

605
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,119
I am a Bodhi inheritor.

606
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,480
We are both from Southern Shaolin.

607
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,400
Sort of.

608
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,519
Not sort of.

609
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,719
If there's no legacy,

610
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,000
how can you become a constable?

611
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And how can I become a guard?

612
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,840
Sir, what do you mean?

613
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,159
What I mean is,

614
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,800
shouldn't a disciple
follow the master's orders?

615
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,679
Of course.

616
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,320
Good.

617
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:11,239
Master's order...

618
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,760
But if the order goes against the court,

619
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,280
I will not obey.

620
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:15,599
Sir.

621
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,800
The sect is our home.

622
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,280
The court is the nation.

623
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
The nation must come first.

624
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,320
The court doesn't always
stand for the nation.

625
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,639
It is so under normal circumstances.

626
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,000
This nation is...

627
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,760
Mr. Muqing.

628
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,679
How can you say

629
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,000
such rebellious and outrageous words?

630
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,280
Forget it.

631
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,800
Never mind.

632
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,352
No.

633
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,639
We must talk it through.

634
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:42,760
No.

635
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,608
I have nothing to talk with you.

636
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:45,199
It's just that...

637
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,280
I shouldn't have talked to you.

638
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,480
I am stupid.

639
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,719
Just stupid.

640
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,280
You are just obstinate.

641
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,920
Come on.

642
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,519
Let's fight!

643
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:57,519
Why?

644
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,599
Wang Jialuo.

645
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,800
Let me put it bluntly.

646
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,039
The treasure belongs to Southern Shaolin.
It's not the court's.

647
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:04,199
Our masters are both
from Southern Shaolin.

648
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,519
They are the owners
of the Altar Treasure.

649
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:07,559
What they wish

650
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:08,960
is that the court cannot have it.

651
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,360
It must be given to the rightful person.

652
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,000
All under heaven is the emperor's land.

653
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,159
Since it is within the borders
of the Qing Dynasty,

654
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:20,440
then it belongs to the Qing Dynasty.

655
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,280
If not to the court, to whom?

656
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,199
Who is the rightful person?

657
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,840
Those rebels from Tongmenghui?

658
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,039
Men Sandao, what's wrong with you?

659
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,039
Have you lost your mind?

660
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,719
I think it's you
who have lost your mind.

661
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,760
Do you know what I used to do
back in the days?

662
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,280
I was the guard
by the late Emperor's side.

663
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,599
I could even enter the imperial study.

664
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,800
I joined the reform
with the late Emperor.

665
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,360
Do you know what the reform means?

666
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,679
It's about changing the world.

667
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:43,320
I was a reformist back then.

668
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:45,320
Now, Tongmenghui
also wants a revolution.

669
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,480
They want to change the nation.

670
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,519
I will give the Altar Treasure to them!

671
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:49,199
Men Sandao!

672
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,360
You are outrageous.
According to the Qing Code...

673
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,400
Cut the crap.

674
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,440
What else do you know?

675
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,159
These past days,

676
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,400
I've seen you've got skills.

677
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,360
I wanted to give you a chance
to join the revolution.

678
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,840
Since you deny it,

679
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,800
alright then.

680
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,559
Let's fight!

681
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,119
You asked me to be an imperial guard,

682
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:07,840
but I refused.
And you said I was ungrateful.

683
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,920
Fortunately,
I did not stoop to your level.

684
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,199
Otherwise, I would have been shameless.

685
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,800
Shameless!

686
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:24,280
(Dagu County Yamen Constable)
Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

687
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,440
You intend to rebel.

688
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,599
I must execute you.
