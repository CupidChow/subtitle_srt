1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,079
Sir.

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,399
Do you know

3
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,960
where is the young lady
who came with me yesterday?

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,120
Oh, it's you.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,640
After you left last night,

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,840
she also left.

7
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,399
She left?

8
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,119
Didn't she stay here?

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,280
No.

10
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,640
Then do you know which way she went?

11
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,399
I really didn't pay attention.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,719
She probably

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,240
went in the same direction as you.

14
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,119
Thank you.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,879
Sir.

16
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,719
I also want to know

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,680
to Fenzhou, Shanxi,

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,159
which way is the nearest?

19
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:30,842
=Heroes=

20
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,824
=Episode 11=

21
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:43,514
(Fenzhou, Shanxi)

22
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,840
Miss Liu Lin.

23
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,360
I am really impressed.

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,840
You've actually stayed awake
all this way.

25
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,960
Aren't you tired?

26
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,800
I can't sleep with you around.

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
With an upright gentleman like me
guarding you,

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,840
what are you afraid of?

29
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,479
It's getting late.

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,360
How about we find an inn
to rest for the night

31
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,800
and set off early tomorrow?

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,400
Call a carriage.

33
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,960
Let's find a nice inn.

34
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,360
There's only one room left?

35
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,599
We can't stay in one room.

36
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,680
Find us another room.

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,360
Mister.

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,919
We've got too many customers here.

39
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,599
All the seats were filled moments ago.

40
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,759
Now they

41
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,680
finished eating and went to their rooms.

42
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,800
We really don't have any rooms left.

43
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,280
The fact we can spare a room for you
at this moment

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,080
means you two are lucky.

45
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,520
Let's go.

46
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,960
Find another inn.

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,199
Mister.

48
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,280
Even if you leave here,

49
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,120
you won't find an inn with spare rooms.

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,080
Let me tell you.

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360
These past two months

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
have been the peak time with customers.

53
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,599
In midnight,

54
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,240
you can see

55
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,240
someone is sleeping outside
on the street.

56
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,719
What should we do then?

57
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,319
It seems we will just have to make do.

58
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,199
Please come inside.

59
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,639
Please.

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,279
Thank you so much.

61
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,920
Mister, you...

62
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,839
Rest assured.

63
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
No one lives on this floor except you.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,759
You acted very unnatural just now

65
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,720
without any genuine feelings.

66
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,319
I don't want to criticize you.

67
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,600
Go and get me a jug of wine now.

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,240
I want the strong kind.

69
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,360
Okay.

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,720
Two jugs.

71
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:54,959
Alright.

72
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,279
Miss Liu Lin.

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,839
Because there's no other room,

74
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,560
then we have to share a room.

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,519
But don't worry.

76
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,720
An upright gentleman like me

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,360
will surely do improper things.

78
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,800
No...

79
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
I mean

80
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,040
I definitely will not

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
do anything to you

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,000
when sleeping with you.

83
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:15,319
No, no.

84
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,839
Anyway, my point is

85
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,720
an upright gentleman like me

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
won't take advantage of you.

87
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,399
There's a big wooden tub here.

88
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,120
We travelled a long way here.

89
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,079
Miss Liu Lin.

90
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,720
You can take a good bath first.

91
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,399
I'll guard the door for you.

92
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,959
Hot water can alleviate your fatigue

93
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,480
and make you sleep more calmly

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
and more peacefully.

95
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Have a nice bath.

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,079
Do you want to be blind?

97
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,519
Miss Liu.

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,800
It's a misunderstanding.

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
I saw a bug on the door.

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,079
I was afraid
it would get inside and scare you.

101
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,720
See?

102
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,240
Got it.

103
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,240
Miss Liu.

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
If you don't believe me

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
Open the door now and see for yourself.

106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,399
What a huge spooky moth.

107
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,399
It's right on my hand.

108
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,120
Scram.

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,199
Miss Liu.

110
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,439
Gentlemen bring others together
but won't mobilize factions.

111
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,800
Villains will gang up and plot.

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,439
And obviously I am a gentleman.

113
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,160
I am a forthright gentleman.

114
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
Do you still doubt it?

115
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,360
All along the way here,

116
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,000
everything I did

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,040
has shown my magnanimous virtue.

118
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,759
There's nothing shameless

119
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,920
and despicable.

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,800
You must be hungry.

121
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,839
Miss Liu Lin.

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,399
These are all famous dishes from Shanxi.

123
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,240
Braised pork.
Steamed oat flour rolls with broth.

124
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,079
Stir-fried sausage,
Shanxi roast duck, Prince goose.

125
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
How funny.

126
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,040
The goose is titled as a prince.

127
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,120
Please sit.

128
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,199
Sit.

129
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,160
You know about Fen Wine, right?

130
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,839
"The scent of wine is from the village."

131
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,639
You will know its allure
after tasting it.

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,040
They say the friendship of gentlemen
is as pure as water.

133
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,040
I am lucky to share a room
with you today

134
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,279
and spend a nice night together.

135
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,839
Let's use wine to celebrate.

136
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,360
Within just a few days,

137
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,920
you and I have met several times.

138
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,279
It is our destiny.

139
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,120
Come on, cheers.

140
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:50,959
Miss Liu.

141
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,639
Why aren't you drinking?

142
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,240
You're too dirty and smelly.

143
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,560
Go take a bath first.

144
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,839
Okay.

145
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,360
No problem.

146
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll go clean myself right now.

147
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,560
Miss Liu Lin, wait.

148
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,439
I will be quick.

149
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,680
The whole room is full

150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,439
of the lingering fragrance left
by Miss Liu Lin.

151
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,600
How refreshing.

152
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,079
It's like being in a fairyland.

153
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,919
What's the matter, Miss Liu Lin?

154
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,480
Why did you lock me inside?

155
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,240
Miss Liu Lin.

156
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,639
Please open the door.

157
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,519
I can't get out.

158
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,759
Aren't you a gentleman?

159
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,120
How can you, a gentleman,

160
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,240
stay in the same room with me?

161
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,960
I will certainly behave.

162
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,360
You should open the door.

163
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
Miss Liu Lin.

164
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,840
I haven't even had a meal yet.

165
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,879
You...

166
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
I can't sleep in here.

167
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,360
Miss Liu.

168
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,679
Miss Liu.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,679
Muqing.

170
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,720
I've already asked the people
at the Fenzhou Yamen.

171
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,519
They say that in the past few days

172
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,440
they have been monitoring checkpoints
in every place.

173
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,200
But they haven't seen

174
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,639
any trace of the Rongtian Ridge people.

175
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,240
They wouldn't take carts,
or take the main roads.

176
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,679
Although they left earlier than us,

177
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,399
they are still behind.

178
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
How much farther is it to Pingyao?

179
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,480
It's just four hours away.

180
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,159
Zhuo Bufan, just like us,

181
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,440
came from the east.

182
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,360
To go to Pingyao,
he must pass through Fenzhou.

183
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,320
Let local yamens keep monitoring.

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,679
We've been traveling all night.

185
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,519
There's no need to rush
another four hours.

186
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,559
Let everyone rest at the station
before we proceed.

187
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,799
That would be very good.

188
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,679
Getai.

189
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,240
Order the Fenzhou Yamen
to notify the Pingyao County Yamen

190
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,919
to prepare all the records
of the graveyards

191
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,000
and have them all ready.

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,639
Once we arrive,
we will need to go through them.

193
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,480
Okay.

194
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:15,544
(8th day of the 4th month,1911)

195
00:10:15,544 --> 00:10:16,730
(Mangzhong is 32 days away)

196
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,600
Miss Liu.

197
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,200
I've been true-hearted...

198
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,720
My legs are numb. I can't move.

199
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,120
Mr. Lin.

200
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,000
Thanks for everything along the way.

201
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,840
Goodbye.

202
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,879
Miss Liu.

203
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,279
Miss Liu.

204
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,240
Miss Liu.

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,879
Are you leaving?

206
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,519
Where to?

207
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,519
Pingyao.

208
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,559
What should I haul?

209
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,320
Me.

210
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,519
You're the...

211
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
It's you.

212
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,759
Yes, it's me.

213
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,279
Lucky.

214
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,559
It means good luck.

215
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I remember.

216
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,759
How come I can run into you here.

217
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,120
Quite a coincidence, huh?

218
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,600
Indeed, we should catch up a little.

219
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,360
Don't bother.

220
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,399
Delicate clouds change shapes,
and shooting stars carry sorrow.

221
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,559
The separate lovers reunite
on the long long milky way.

222
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,279
Meeting in the White Dew during autumn

223
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,279
surpasses countless encounters
in the mortal world.

224
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,679
Just a couple of days ago,

225
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,240
we had a great conversation
in French Concession in Shanghai,

226
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,879
and today we can once again
talk with each other

227
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,039
in Fenzhou, Shanxi.

228
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,960
Meeting an old friend here is so nice.

229
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,080
Sir.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,720
My dear sir.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,200
What's going on?

232
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
I know.

233
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,639
You want to know

234
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,919
why I am here, right?

235
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,679
I'll tell you everything.

236
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,519
My plan was

237
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,519
to leave Shanghai

238
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
and come here to collect goods.

239
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,039
There are many graves in this place

240
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,559
as well as many grave diggers.

241
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,759
So there are many antiques here.

242
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm in the antique business.

243
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,600
To collect goods,

244
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,639
this is the right place.

245
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,960
Where else could it be?

246
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,879
Dude.

247
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,639
Sir.

248
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,480
My dear sir.

249
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Why are you all still carrying blades?

250
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,039
Muqing.

251
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,639
I've checked his suitcase.

252
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,600
Nothing unusual.

253
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,519
Just the antique shops
in and nearby Fenzhou

254
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,679
are written on his notebook.

255
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,840
I've asked. What he said is true.

256
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,799
He is just an antique dealer.

257
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,720
Exactly.

258
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,519
I am just an antique dealer.

259
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,440
Gentlemen.

260
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,519
Officers.

261
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,799
Sirs.

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,279
We are all acquaintances.

263
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,759
You can totally trust me.

264
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,799
Do you know that I'm on a case?

265
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,519
I know.

266
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,919
I don't know.

267
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,879
I just think

268
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,360
running around like this,

269
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,600
you must be doing important things.

270
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,399
Then do you know

271
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,879
wherever I go during the investigation,

272
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,240
I run into you.

273
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,200
I don't know.

274
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,240
Sir.

275
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,960
I really didn't follow you.

276
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,399
This...

277
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,799
Maybe it's a coincidence.

278
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,440
Sir.

279
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,759
I think this might just be

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,759
an ineffable destiny.

281
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:57,080
Sir.

282
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,000
Can I leave right away?

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,840
I... I won't stay here.

284
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,720
I won't stay in Fenzhou.

285
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,799
I won't go to Pingyao either.

286
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,039
You want to go to Pingyao?

287
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:02,679
Yes.

288
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,080
No.

289
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,919
I won't go anywhere.

290
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,120
I... I will leave right away.

291
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,000
Back to Shanghai.

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,600
Forget it,
I will go back to the imperial city.

293
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,360
Or, wherever you want me to go,

294
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,840
I'll go there. Is that okay?

295
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,720
Why are you going to Pingyao?

296
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,600
Sir.

297
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
I have to collect antiques.

298
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,480
Places like Taiyuan and Fenzhou.

299
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,360
Those are places with good antiques.

300
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,919
But too many competitors are here.

301
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,600
I have to keep going further.

302
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,840
Pingyao

303
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
is indeed a small place.

304
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,919
But the antiques are adequate there.

305
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,360
Alright.

306
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,120
Then go to Pingyao.

307
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,080
No.

308
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,240
I won't go.

309
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,399
Didn't you say
wherever I want you to go,

310
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,519
that's where you'll go?

311
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,559
I'm offering you a chance.

312
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,879
Are you willing to serve the court?

313
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,240
What I've desired most in my life

314
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,559
is to serve the court.

315
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,559
That would be my luck.

316
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,320
But what's in it for me
if I help the court?

317
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,200
You have keen eyes.

318
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,559
Of course.

319
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,559
As the saying goes,

320
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,519
dealing antiques,

321
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,759
it's all about one thing.

322
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,480
Keen eyes.

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,080
Then follow me.

324
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,000
When I need your keen eyes,

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,759
don't make any mistake.

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If you do this well,

327
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,559
the court will reward you handsomely.

328
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,440
As for your antique business,

329
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,360
that's up to you. I won't interfere.

330
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,279
What kind of antiques
are you looking for?

331
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,720
When it's time,

332
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,879
I will let you know.

333
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,879
If so,

334
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,360
may I stand up now?

335
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,639
Did I tell you to kneel?

336
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,679
Sir.

337
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,639
Let me tell you.

338
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,000
You have indeed found the right person.

339
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,399
In the antique trade,

340
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,679
although I'm young,

341
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,600
I am a rare genius.

342
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,799
What is a genius?

343
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,360
A genius is someone
with talent given by the Heaven.

344
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,919
These eyes of mine
are a gift from the Heaven.

345
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,879
My name is Lucky,

346
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,200
but when it comes to antiques,

347
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,080
relying solely on good luck

348
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
is not practical.

349
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
You need to get some real skills.

350
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,519
And my eyes are what I've got.

351
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,000
These eyes of mine are sharp.

352
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,399
I can recognize every authentic treasure

353
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,519
and have never failed.

354
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,440
Sir.

355
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,759
The bracelet you're wearing.

356
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,720
I just recognize it. I am the expert.

357
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,919
Deep sea coral from Southeast Asia.

358
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,519
The top craftsmen

359
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,559
made it by hand, right?

360
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,080
I also know

361
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,320
the coral grows

362
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,279
in the seas near a desolate island
amongst raging waves.

363
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,000
All year round,

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,559
there are only three to five days

365
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,200
for people to dive down to harvest it.

366
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,519
Once you miss the time,

367
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,799
you will have to wait
at least another year

368
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,559
before you can dive down to harvest.

369
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,639
Fine.

370
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,759
I know you have sharp eyes.

371
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,120
Take him with us.

372
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,720
Alright.

373
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,039
I will follow you closely.

374
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,840
Where to?

375
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,000
To Pingyao.

376
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,919
Pingyao?

377
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Sir.

378
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,079
When we arrive at Pingyao,

379
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,160
whatever antiques you want,

380
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,240
just ask away.

381
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,759
I will surely find you the best

382
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,640
and most valuable things.

383
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,880
And moreover,
I will buy them at the lowest price.

384
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,680
Enough.

385
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,519
Go pack your things.

386
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,480
We will leave soon.

387
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,880
Go ahead.

388
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,480
Muqing, you do know how to use a talent.

389
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,079
We are looking for a grave this time

390
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,799
for the secret treasure.

391
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,839
Bringing him with me

392
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,200
can really be of help.

393
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,960
This guy has perfect judgments
on antiques.

394
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,119
Both you and I have seen it.

395
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,119
He is indeed exceptional.

396
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,200
I bring him along

397
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,599
also because I want to make sure

398
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,519
whether or not it's just a coincidence

399
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,880
that he always shows up
in the same place as us.

400
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:00,954
(Yaxuan Teahouse)

401
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
She is the best spy

402
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
that you've mentioned?

403
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,079
I am Yeshang Han.

404
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,799
So you have a name.

405
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,920
May I ask how to address you?

406
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,759
Just call me Lin Anjing.

407
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,359
Since you are the best spy,

408
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,400
can I challenge you?

409
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,279
Go ahead.

410
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,200
You didn't make a move.

411
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,359
Why should I?

412
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,799
I don't know kung fu.

413
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,000
I only kill.

414
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:54,599
One more step
and you would already be dead.

415
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,119
Believe me.

416
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,799
I said she's the best,

417
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,559
and that means she is the best.

418
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,039
Is Zhuo Bufan the most likely

419
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,119
to obtain the secret treasure?

420
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,680
At least he and his Rongtian Ridge

421
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,279
are ahead of the Department.

422
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,559
Those people from Rongtian Ridge.

423
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,920
What exactly are they doing now?

424
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
That lot

425
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,240
spread out after arriving in Fenzhou.

426
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,880
Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo

427
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,000
took some people to poke around.

428
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,079
What about you?

429
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,920
I had to keep following Zhuo Bufan.

430
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,680
But it was not of much use.

431
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,279
I had no chance

432
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,720
to get inside their circle.

433
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,079
I'll think of a way.

434
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,119
You have a plan?

435
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,359
Not exactly a plan.

436
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,000
And I'm also not sure

437
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,559
if it'll work.

438
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,799
I can secretly follow Zhuo Bufan,

439
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,400
but if we don't know

440
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,279
what exactly they will do next,

441
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,720
it's hard to achieve anything.

442
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,279
Regarding the Altar Treasure,

443
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
our goal is very simple.

444
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,240
I understand.

445
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,240
It's in our best interest
if no one gets it.

446
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,640
So destroying

447
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,480
is somewhat simpler than chasing.

448
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:41,626
(Fenzhou Records)

449
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,064
(Records of Pingyao County)

450
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,720
There are thousands of graves.

451
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,519
It will take forever

452
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,039
if we keep searching like this.

453
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,880
Yeah.

454
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,039
Don't even know where to start.

455
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,584
We don't know
when the Bodhi's inheritor died

456
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,000
(Pingyao County Boundary Records)
or their age.

457
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,279
We don't even know

458
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,599
if it was a man or woman.

459
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,000
Since that was the inheritor
of the Southern Shaolin,

460
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,759
it wouldn't be a woman, right?

461
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,279
But who knows?

462
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,119
There are so many graves.

463
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,920
How long will it take to find
what we're looking for?

464
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
So many graves.

465
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,599
Where to start
to find the Bodhi's inheritor?

466
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,559
But fortunately,

467
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,880
now we know
which year the Bodhi's inheritor died.

468
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,599
Otherwise, we'd really be clueless.

469
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,559
Anyway, let's see this time

470
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,960
whether fate is on our side.

471
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,880
We can only use the dumbest method.

472
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,279
Check each grave one by one.

473
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,920
All those suspicious, unclaimed ones.

474
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,319
Dig them and check.

475
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,519
But we don't have enough manpower.

476
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,440
Summon everyone
in the Pingyao County Yamen,

477
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,079
and transfer more people from Fenzhou.

478
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,680
Nine county yamens are in Fenzhou.

479
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
Whoever is on duty

480
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,160
needs to go dig graves.

481
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,559
Muqing, this doesn't seem appropriate.

482
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,319
Digging up graves is really
something with bad luck.

483
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,440
I'm afraid the local yamen officers
won't be willing to do it.

484
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,000
They have to do it anyway.

485
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,119
It's about the nation.

486
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,359
Nothing is inappropriate.

487
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,319
Unmarked graves in Pingyao.
Bodhi's inheritor.

488
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,519
Tan Xian

489
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,799
left such vague clues.

490
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,839
Maybe he didn't mean to.

491
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,400
It was just that

492
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,759
the clues were all he knew.

493
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,279
Right.

494
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,400
I remember I once told you

495
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,759
what Zhuo Bufan knew

496
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,880
wouldn't be more than ours.

497
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,920
Besides, he doesn't have
as much manpower.

498
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,839
And he can't dig graves
openly and legitimately.

499
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,319
Exactly.

500
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,160
His search must be even harder
than ours.

501
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,960
Thinking about it this way,
it's actually a good thing.

502
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
About digging unmarked graves
in Pingyao,

503
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,759
they suffer way more than us.

504
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,039
Is there anything much harder than this?

505
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,359
Ms. Huo.

506
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,799
In that letter,

507
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,240
did you only see 'Fenzhou'?

508
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,599
(The letter was already
burning at that time.)

509
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,359
(I only saw 'Fenzhou'.)

510
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,000
Think harder.

511
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,440
What were the words following?

512
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,880
There are nine counties
under Fenzhou's jurisdiction.

513
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,640
The number of graves is countless.

514
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,240
If we really have to search one by one,

515
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm afraid
it would take three to five months.

516
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,279
But now we have no other choice.

517
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,160
We can only trouble everyone

518
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,119
to search no matter how hard it is.

519
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,680
Huanjie.

520
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,000
Starting tomorrow, let's split up.

521
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,359
This is the only option.

522
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,720
Tomorrow,
I will go search in Licheng County.

523
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,640
Then I will take others
to Pingyao County.

524
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:53,680
Good.

525
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:55,799
One more thing.

526
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,400
Mr. Cunqing told me

527
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,359
the last time

528
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,519
when the Department was searching
for the Altar Treasure,

529
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,440
they had been to Shanxi
to track down Shovels.

530
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,559
That group of tomb raiders?

531
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:08,680
Follow it.

532
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,640
We cannot ignore

533
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,839
any single clue at present.

534
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:13,862
(9th day of the 4th month, 1911)

535
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:15,000
(Mangzhong is 31 days away)

536
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,759
Hurry up.

537
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,839
Jars.

538
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,599
Place them over there.

539
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,000
Huanjie.

540
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,184
The gravestone here has no name.

541
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:33,728
Should we dig?

542
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:34,336
Go ahead.

543
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,799
Dig up anything that is unusual.

544
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:37,680
Understood.

545
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,640
After all,

546
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,920
I am a well-known swordsman.

547
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,319
Yet I came to such a desolate wilderness

548
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,559
to dig graves.

549
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,799
I am so miserable.

550
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,519
Brothers, search carefully.

551
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,599
I'll look around.

552
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,039
Okay.

553
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,519
Don't miss anything.

554
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,079
You were right indeed.

555
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,960
He is here.

556
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,480
Mr. Yu.

557
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,079
Dianhong tea should
suit your taste, right?

558
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,119
You

559
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,319
have come to find me again.

560
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,160
What exactly do you want?

561
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,119
You are so smart.

562
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,640
Don't you know what I want?

563
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,519
Zhuo Bufan is a swordsman.

564
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,480
And Rongtian Ridge
is a martial arts sect.

565
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,319
But you are searching so diligently
for the Altar Treasure.

566
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,279
What for?

567
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,160
For money?

568
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,839
I didn't understand before.

569
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,480
Now I finally realize

570
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
you are working for Prince Qi.

571
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,599
You left Shanghai quietly

572
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,359
and finally made it to Shanxi.

573
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,240
But I can still find you.

574
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,920
Not just me.

575
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,759
Men Sandao from the Department
has also brought help here.

576
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,000
You don't know yet, do you?

577
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,640
The Department is going right after you.

578
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,880
You may not find the Altar Treasure
as you wish.

579
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,839
Even if you find it,

580
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:51,920
Rongtian Ridge

581
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,160
will only get a small share of it.

582
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,400
How much of it

583
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,680
will go to you, Mr. Yu?

584
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,960
Mr. Zhuo will still be the Sect Leader.

585
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,079
And you remain only a senior under him.

586
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,400
Since helping Zhuo Bufan
to hunt for treasure

587
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
doesn't benefit you

588
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,920
and is painstakingly difficult,

589
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,119
why bother?

590
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,000
You're telling me all this

591
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,839
just to get me

592
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,680
to work for you Japanese?

593
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,839
Do you think I would agree?

594
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,960
If you wouldn't,

595
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,960
I won't be sitting here.

596
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,079
Muqing.

597
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:48,920
Look.

598
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,960
It says the Department came to Fenzhou
to handle a case

599
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,920
and had three local constables
assist in investigating

600
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,319
the tomb robbers.

601
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,759
The sixth year of Tongzhi era.

602
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,039
(Sixth year of Tongzhi era)
Almost 40 years.

603
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,759
That must be it.

604
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,720
But

605
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm not sure if they are still around.

606
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,680
Go ask around.

607
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,440
I don't think we're so unlucky

608
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,680
that we can't even find one of them.

609
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:16,920
Then I'll go ask around.

610
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,680
If you help me,

611
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,200
and I am the one
who finds the secret treasure,

612
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,319
I can share with you
ten percent of the fortune.

613
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
As far as I know,

614
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,000
just this ten percent

615
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,039
is enough to rival
the wealth of nations.

616
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,119
With enough money,

617
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,640
the position of the leader
of a declining sword sect

618
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,279
no longer matters.

619
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,359
Even if I don't find it in the end,

620
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,400
I won't let you leave with nothing.

621
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,160
I know.

622
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,880
The headquarters of Rongtian Ridge

623
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,559
has been leased out
all at once for ten years,

624
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,039
but you only got less
than 1,000 taels of silver.

625
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:24,730
(Banknotes)

626
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,640
This is just the deposit.

627
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,039
See for yourself how much it is.

628
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,559
You...

629
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,240
What exactly do you want me to do?

630
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,880
Simple.

631
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,160
You just need to tell me in advance

632
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,920
every move of Zhuo Bufan.

633
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,319
If you can't beat him

634
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,920
and take the treasure from Zhuo Bufan,

635
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,000
it has nothing to do with me.

636
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,119
Of course.

637
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,200
If we battle with you people,

638
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,960
it doesn't matter
if you draw your sword against me.

639
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,079
Our Rongtian Sword Sect

640
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,319
originates from Lingxi.

641
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,160
Our master's wife, Huo Qin,
is adept at raising poisonous insects.

642
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,000
These poisonous insects

643
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,640
behave oddly
when they smell the scent of strangers.

644
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,599
Even if you get somewhat close to her,

645
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,480
she will definitely notice.

646
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,119
So,

647
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,000
if you are to come to me,

648
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,960
you cannot show up directly.

649
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,839
Then how will you give me the clue?

650
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,640
I will find a way to let you know.

651
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,240
Fine.

652
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,519
There's one thing
I've always been curious about.

653
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,920
Your master has been dead
for many years.

654
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,039
He wasn't young when he died.

655
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,640
Why is your master's wife
Huo Qin so young?

656
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:02,759
I've looked into you

657
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,160
but couldn't find the reason.

658
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,440
This isn't something worth praising.

659
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,880
So we kept it a secret.

660
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,039
You surely found nothing.

661
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,400
Tell me then.

662
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,000
Muqing.

663
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,799
I've asked everybody

664
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,960
in the yamen,

665
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,920
and finally found those three constables

666
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,960
who assisted the Department.

667
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,480
It's been 44 years now.

668
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,759
I was worried they might die.

669
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,119
Two of them have already died.

670
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,720
The one who's still alive
must be around 70.

671
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,279
72. His surname is Qin.

672
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,480
He must have gone back
to his hometown then.

673
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,000
Does he live far?

674
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
We're in luck.

675
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
He lives in the suburbs.

676
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,759
Muqing.

677
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Let's go pay a visit.

678
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,440
After all, he's an elderly man.

679
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
Let's buy some snacks to bring along.

680
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,880
A few years ago,

681
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,279
my master fell seriously ill

682
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,839
and has not been doing well.

683
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,279
Later, a fortune teller said

684
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,160
marrying a virgin girl
could bring good fortune

685
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,279
and cure him.

686
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,119
That place we stayed
was remote and poor.

687
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,880
We couldn't find anyone fit there

688
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,359
and we couldn't afford to buy one.

689
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,480
Well.

690
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,079
Huo Qin was the junior in our Sect.

691
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,720
There was no other way.

692
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,720
She was the only choice.

693
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,079
A junior of the Sect.

694
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,680
Did any of you disciples

695
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,440
take a liking to her?

696
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,079
Does it matter?

697
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,039
She became the master's wife,

698
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,240
and no one dared to say a thing.

699
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,559
Then what about
after your master passed away?

700
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,759
Are you crazy?

701
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,000
He is always our master.

702
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,559
Whether he is alive or dead,

703
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,640
he is our master.

704
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,920
Actually, I'm not interested

705
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,119
in these affairs of yours.

706
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,119
I just think

707
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,160
such a custom in Lingxi
is quite interesting.

708
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,799
Since we've already
reached an agreement,

709
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,759
you can't keep anything from me.

710
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,440
Now you can tell me

711
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,920
what Zhuo Bufan is going to do next.

712
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,680
Please, have some tea.

713
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,559
Mr. Qin.

714
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,559
We come here today

715
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,720
because we want to ask you something
from many years ago.

716
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,559
It's about what happened
40 years ago, right?

717
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,480
Otherwise,
how would I have the chance to meet

718
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,119
officials from the Department?

719
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,039
Then let's get straight to the point.

720
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,880
We want to know about Shovels.

721
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,599
What would you exactly like to know?

722
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,599
What sort of people

723
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,960
are in this gang 'Shovels'?

724
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,880
Do they still exist now?

725
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,839
Sir, you are mistaken.

726
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,160
The 'Shovel' is not a gang.

727
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,720
It's a person.

728
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,200
During the reign of Tongzhi,

729
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,279
the Imperial Household Department
dispatched secret investigators

730
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:50,440
to investigate
notorious tomb raiding gangs

731
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,160
in Shanxi region.

732
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,960
The tool used by their leader

733
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,960
wasn't any kind of weapon,

734
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,559
but a shovel.

735
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,400
Mr. Qin.

736
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,880
Could you tell us

737
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
about the whole story back then?

738
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,480
Back then, I was just a constable,

739
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,360
so I didn't know the whole story.

740
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,760
I'll tell you everything
as long as I remember.

741
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
If I miss anything,

742
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,440
please forgive me.

743
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,320
Feel free to speak.

744
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,719
I remember back then,
the imperial guards

745
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,960
were not handling a case
in Shanxi at first,

746
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,360
but were pursuing a master
outside the Great Wall.

747
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,480
It is said that
they found traces of that person,

748
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,199
located his residence,

749
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,239
and discovered something very peculiar.

750
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,519
A goblet for drinking liquor.

751
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,480
The guards identified it as an antique
from the previous dynasty.

752
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,079
They also confirmed
it was excavated in Shanxi region.

753
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,280
And it must have been
dug out by tomb raiders.

754
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,400
So it was given to that master
by the tomb raiders?

755
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,119
The imperial guards

756
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,360
also thought the same.

757
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,199
So they came to Shanxi.

758
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,440
And after some investigation,

759
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,639
they thought the person
capable of retrieving such an item

760
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,440
from an ancient tomb

761
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,599
must be Shovel.

762
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,880
So our local yamen

763
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,960
was ordered to assist the Department
to investigate the case.

764
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,280
It took two whole months,

765
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,599
but we gained nothing.

766
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,400
You didn't find Shovel?

767
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,199
We haven't even found his trace.

768
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,119
That was all?

769
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,119
Sirs.

770
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,079
From beginning to end,

771
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,880
I have already answered this many times.

772
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,360
There are absolutely no omissions.

773
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,159
If that's the case,

774
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,679
thank you for your time today.

775
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,800
Mr. Qin, take care.

776
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,239
Wish you all well.

777
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,440
Mr. Qin.

778
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,599
I hope you don't mind me asking.

779
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,960
The scar on your face...

780
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,440
This scar of mine
has already been 40 years.

781
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,239
I was cut by the bandit leader
with a blade

782
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,159
when I was after them.

783
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,239
It's because of this scar

784
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,280
that I am still a bachelor now.

785
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,920
The archives in the yamen
have records about it.

786
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,440
I took notice when I checked them.

787
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Mr. Qin, why did you lie?

788
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,119
Just tell me the truth.

789
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:31,880
Sir.

790
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,800
I don't understand.

791
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,000
Like you said,

792
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,920
you've already answered

793
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,519
countless times

794
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,719
about what happened back then.

795
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,320
So you said it very clearly

796
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,039
with no flaws.

797
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:45,800
However,

798
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,440
you can lie,

799
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,880
but the scar can't.

800
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,000
You just said that you got this wound

801
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,519
when you were after bandits,
and the leader cut you with a blade.

802
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,039
Yes.

803
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,400
A blade?

804
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,480
Yes.

805
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,280
Think again.

806
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,960
Were you cut with a blade?

807
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,159
As a swordsman,

808
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,039
even if your wound

809
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,280
has healed for 44 years,

810
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,639
I can still tell

811
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,360
it's not blade wound but a sword wound.

812
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,719
Old man.

813
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,400
The lie you've concocted

814
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,039
must have taken quite some effort.

815
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,159
Usually, whether it's tomb raiders

816
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,519
or bandits,

817
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,400
they're often brutes

818
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
using blades mostly.

819
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,440
There are very few who use swords.

820
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,079
If you said

821
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,920
that you were wounded by a sword
while pursuing bandits,

822
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,440
you'd surely be suspected.

823
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,840
That's why you claimed
it was a blade wound.

824
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:38,159
The reason why you told such a lie

825
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,800
is to hide something.

826
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,639
You've seen Shovel.

827
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,159
Old man.

828
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,039
You even dare to deceive us.

829
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,360
Don't you want to live?

830
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,360
At his age,

831
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,599
can he still not have lived enough?

832
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,719
You've kept this secret
for over 40 years.

833
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,599
It must be suffocating.

834
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,559
And yet you still won't tell us.

835
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,159
More than 40 years ago,

836
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,280
the guards of the Department
who came to Shanxi

837
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,719
found Shovel, right?
