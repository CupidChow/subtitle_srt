1
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,958
(8th day of 4th month
of 3rd year of Xuantong)

2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,128
(Grain in Ear is 32 days away.)

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,384
(Cotton Alley, Shuntian)

4
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:34,880
Hurry up.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,520
Hurry up.

6
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,119
Run.

7
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,079
Don't move.

8
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:58,138
(Long Zhen Li Jiu
will change the nation at harvest time.)

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,240
Sir.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,680
We found two boxes of gunpowder inside.

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,120
Take these rebels

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,480
back to yamen.

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,239
Are you a Reformist?

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,439
I am.

15
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,439
I am going to take down
all flunkies like you

16
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,439
and overthrow the Qing Imperial Court.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,400
You are under my control now.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,519
If you don't want to die...

19
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,040
There are quite a few like you.

20
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,480
Scared of death?

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,280
Scared of death?

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,519
I won't join the Reform if I am.

23
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,400
Kill me now,

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,200
and I wouldn't even blink.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,879
It doesn't matter if I die.

26
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,680
There will be other comrades

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,319
carrying on the cause
I have not completed.

28
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,120
That sounds very familiar.

29
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,040
Many people have said this
since ancient times.

30
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,640
Yes, you're right.

31
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,199
That's how we are.

32
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:08,919
Right?

33
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,360
Life and death are natural,

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,439
just a breath away.

35
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,599
Death really isn't so awful.

36
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,280
There are many things
more awful than death.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
Torture him a bit.

38
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,919
Show these people

39
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,800
what is more awful than death.

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,719
You will wish you were dead by then.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,360
I don't believe that no one cracks.

42
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,840
You devil.

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,520
You won't end up well.

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,479
The first person who confesses
will be spared.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,319
The rest will end up like him.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,439
Got it.

47
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,759
You devil, how dare you?

48
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,319
Whip him.

49
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,120
You devil.

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,240
Talk.

51
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,840
Talk!

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,879
Confess!

53
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,840
Come on!

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,759
Talk!

55
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,919
Aren't you tough?

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Talk!

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Confess!

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I confess!

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
I am willing to confess.

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,479
Sir!

61
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,240
Sir!

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,199
Sir, I will confess.

63
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,199
I will tell you everything, sir!

64
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,712
Talk.

65
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,560
Do I have to ask?

66
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,680
Talk!

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,319
Sir.

68
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,840
We were indeed planning a rebellion.

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,879
Long Zhen Li Jiu

70
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,680
will change the nation at harvest time.

71
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,879
This is a rumor they spread.

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,280
They want to confuse you

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,199
and make you believe

74
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,159
the rebellion will be on Grain in Ear,
the 11th day of May.

75
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,000
So when will it be actually?

76
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,360
Actually, we will take action

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,199
on the night of the 29th day
of the 4th month.

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,400
Nine groups of rebel forces
will launch attacks

79
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,800
from the west, south,
and north of the city.

80
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,280
Nine groups?

81
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,680
How many people in total?

82
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,759
I've heard there would be
about 300 people.

83
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,560
You've heard?

84
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,319
That's what I know, sir.

85
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
We just acted on orders.

86
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,720
Whose orders?

87
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,079
Tongmenghui.

88
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,439
Tongmenghui.

89
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,759
You are one of them?

90
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,199
No.

91
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,680
We aren't.

92
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,839
We just work for Tongmenghui.

93
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:35,680
Sir.

94
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,000
I shouldn't have done this.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,199
Please tell me what to do.

96
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,319
Please tell me what to do.

97
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,560
I am begging you.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,839
Please tell me.

99
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,480
Drag him away.

100
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,399
Get him out of here.

101
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,879
Please spare my life.

102
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,839
Sir.

103
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,759
Please spare my life.

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,079
Please spare my life.

105
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,106
=Heroes=

106
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:25,562
=Episode 10=

107
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,279
The phone is ringing.

108
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,800
Hello.

109
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,240
Father.

110
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,480
As you requested,

111
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Last night,
the Department captured the rebels

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,120
at the Cotton Alley.

113
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,120
And it was Cunqing
who interrogated them.

114
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,439
Did you raise any suspicion?

115
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,600
Father, don't worry.

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I have handled it perfectly.

117
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,120
Good.

118
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,120
Father, it was nothing.

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,120
So far, so good.

120
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,879
But don't let your guard down.

121
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Cunqing is a cunning man.

122
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,839
He might see through our ruse.

123
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,439
I know.

124
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,120
I will be cautious.

125
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,759
Father.

126
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,279
You and Wulan Shan

127
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,439
will be back tomorrow, right?

128
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,399
Yes.

129
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,839
Good, I will pick you up.

130
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,396
(8th day of 4th month
of 3rd year of Xuantong)

131
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:57,402
(Grain in Ear is 32 days away.)

132
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:59,120
(Shanghai Administrative Office)

133
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,920
Greetings, sir.

134
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,720
Get up.

135
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,680
Why did you suddenly come to Shanghai?

136
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,879
I took a train overnight here.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,079
All officials in Beijing and Shanghai
knew about it.

138
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,399
Has something happened?

139
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,680
Do you know where Prince Qi is?

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,720
He is in Shanghai right now.

141
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,600
They say he is here

142
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,000
for a relative's wedding.

143
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
What kind of relative has such an honor

144
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,240
to let the Prince of the First Rank
come in person?

145
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,200
I guess he's using this as an excuse

146
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
to meet with those rebels.

147
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,120
That's why I came to Shanghai
in a high-profile manner.

148
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,440
I hope he can dial it down.

149
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,559
You're so wise.

150
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,639
There's another thing
I want to tell you.

151
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,080
Last night the imperial yamen

152
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,639
captured a group of rebels.

153
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,600
Do you think suspicious?

154
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,600
I think it's ridiculous.

155
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,639
Exactly.

156
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,720
The date they mentioned

157
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
was completely different from the date

158
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,879
in that omen rumor.

159
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,960
They already gave themselves away.

160
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,559
The rebel you captured

161
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,360
didn't say anything
about Long Zhen Li Jiu

162
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,679
or mentioned the gunpowder setup
near the Examination Hall.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,919
This can explain everything.

164
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:17,720
Correct.

165
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
We have found that

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
the gunpowder setup
near the Examination Hall

167
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
was the critical spot
for releasing the signal

168
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,720
on the day they planned to rebel.

169
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,679
And the real rebels have no idea

170
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,519
that we have already known this secret.

171
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,639
The so-called rebels you caught
didn't mention it.

172
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,080
That can only lead to one answer.

173
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,759
They are fake.

174
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,840
They are baits
that the rebels used to distract us.

175
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,639
They wanted you to waste your time

176
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,440
and make you confused.

177
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,000
I was thinking the same on the way here.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,759
I was wondering

179
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,679
why he did this.

180
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,879
Mr. Cunqing.

181
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,240
If you believe what the rebels said,

182
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,840
what would you do?

183
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,519
That's right.

184
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,240
If I think

185
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,759
those were the real rebels,

186
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,480
then I would follow the clues.

187
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
With limited time,

188
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,320
I would still go all out

189
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,799
to find the nine groups
of rebel forces that didn't even exist.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,200
I might even summon you, Getai

191
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,799
and all the guards back to the capital.

192
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,039
Then I would fall into their trap.

193
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,480
I guess

194
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
this is exactly what the rebels want.

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,720
You are now going after
Zhuo Bufan and his disciples,

196
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,600
and also looking for the Altar Treasure.

197
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
If I summon you back to the capital,

198
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,600
then the people who benefit the most

199
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,960
will be Zhuo Bufan and his people.

200
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,399
So those people behind all this

201
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,840
don't want you

202
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,559
to go after the Altar Treasure at all.

203
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,000
Because they are afraid of you.

204
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,240
Just like what you thought,

205
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,840
Zhuo Bufan

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,000
is indeed working for the rebels.

207
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,320
The mastermind behind this is Prince Qi.

208
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,120
Ever since Xuantong Emperor
ascended to the throne,

209
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,519
and Prince Zaifeng became the regent,

210
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,080
the court is in jeopardy.

211
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
Prince Qi kept on

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,279
proposing some motions

213
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,200
but no one in the cabinet supported him.

214
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,919
Then he began to take action secretly.

215
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,159
He became improperly close to Beiyang

216
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,960
and associated
with envoys from various countries.

217
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,240
Prince Qi's talent
was enough to launch a coup.

218
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,799
But it's easy to start
but hard to stabilize.

219
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,799
Stabilization
requires a great amount of wealth.

220
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,360
If Prince Qi

221
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
finds this Altar Treasure,

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
then he can do everything he wants.

223
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,840
As we speak,

224
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
is Zhuo Bufan

225
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,879
going to find the Altar Treasure soon?

226
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,440
If what I think is right,

227
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,759
Zhuo Bufan indeed
will find the secret treasure soon.

228
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,399
So now, catching Zhuo Bufan

229
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,679
or the mastermind

230
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,559
is no longer important.

231
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,799
What's important is we have to

232
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,080
find the Altar Treasure before them.

233
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,679
That is what really matters.

234
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,320
Muqing, come over here.

235
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,039
This is the Golden Token
of the Department.

236
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,200
The documents to pass checkpoints.

237
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,120
With them,

238
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,919
you can mobilize any power of the court
wherever you go.

239
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,080
From now on,

240
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,840
finding the Altar Treasure
is your only mission.

241
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,519
Remember.

242
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,039
Don't tell anyone about this.

243
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,399
After all, the nation needs the treasure

244
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,200
because of lacking of money.

245
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,320
It's not something
to be proud of anyway.

246
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,159
I understand.

247
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,440
Once this is exposed,

248
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,879
the Imperial Household Department
will not admit any of this.

249
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,399
Even if you die,

250
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,000
we will make you a criminal

251
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,399
to uphold the dignity of the court.

252
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,000
Understood.

253
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,360
Good.

254
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,360
What do you plan to do next?

255
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,879
I will go to Shanxi.

256
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,840
The unmarked graves of Pingyao.

257
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,279
Pingyao, Shanxi.

258
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,639
The last agents from the Department

259
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,080
were sent to Shanxi.

260
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,960
And the record about the Altar Treasure
also says

261
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,879
those treasure-hunting experts

262
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,000
also made their stop in Shanxi.

263
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,960
I didn't know that.

264
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,159
Mr. Cunqing.

265
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,919
What else does the record say?

266
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,240
No much useful.

267
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,639
There is only a sentence

268
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,320
saying that
after they arrived in Shanxi,

269
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,159
they encountered a tomb-robbing group

270
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,360
lurking between Jiexiu and Pingyao.

271
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,279
They were called Shovels.

272
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,120
Shovels?

273
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,080
That's all I know.

274
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,240
If the clue from the last treasure hunt

275
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,320
ended in Shanxi.

276
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,000
And this time
the clue points to Shanxi again.

277
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,080
It's not a coincidence.

278
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,639
I think so too.

279
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,799
So this Altar Treasure

280
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,799
is very likely in Pingyao.

281
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,240
As long as you find the tomb
of the Bodhi inheritor,

282
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,360
you might find the treasure.

283
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,399
But Muqing,

284
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,080
even if you can't find it,

285
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,320
you can't let anyone else find it.

286
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,639
You can't give up.

287
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:55,759
Yes.

288
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:59,799
(Anyang, Henan)

289
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,720
Everyone, have a nice meal.

290
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,320
We need to travel overnight.

291
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,799
Okay, Mr. Zhuo.

292
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,080
Bufan.

293
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,639
It's getting dark.

294
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,279
Let's just settle down here then.

295
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,919
Huanjie.

296
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,159
For our safety,

297
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,519
we'd better travel overnight.

298
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,919
We've been rushing all day.

299
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,279
I don't need to rest.

300
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,360
But look at Ms. Huo.

301
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
She looks pale.

302
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
It doesn't hurt to stay here for a day.

303
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,000
Are you alright?

304
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm fine.

305
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,759
Mr. Zhuo is right.

306
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,639
Staying in one place for too long

307
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,559
is not safe for us.

308
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,960
If we keep traveling,

309
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,720
I'm afraid only till late at night

310
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,000
can we find an inn.

311
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,919
It's okay with me.

312
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,279
I'll follow your lead.

313
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,559
Let's go then.

314
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,519
Dai Si, have some meat.

315
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,399
Here, have a drink.

316
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
Thank you, Huanjie.

317
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,960
You've been looking pale lately.

318
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,919
Are you tired?

319
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm fine.

320
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,440
Are you...?

321
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,240
Yes.

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,039
Then let's stop at the inn ahead

323
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:23,840
and have a rest.

324
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,840
Do you want to travel all night long?

325
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:28,600
Along the way

326
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
we've left too many traces behind.

327
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,080
If it were me chasing us,

328
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
I could catch up in no time.

329
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,679
For example, the inn we just stayed in.

330
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,799
They just have to ask
and will know we didn't stay

331
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,159
and look for us at the next inn.

332
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,879
Then we don't need to rest. Keep going.

333
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,159
Never mind.

334
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,519
Even if they want to catch up,

335
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,919
it will take at least half a day.

336
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
And everyone's tired anyway.

337
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
I also don't want to see you suffer.

338
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,320
I've gone through worse things before.

339
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,600
You have a choice now.

340
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,679
I hope all of us
can have a choice one day.

341
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,200
You must be tired.

342
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,320
Pal.

343
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
I want to know

344
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,519
if anyone dressed in Lingxi attire
came today

345
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,799
with a strange accent?

346
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,600
Yes.

347
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,519
They just ate here.

348
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,440
Why? Do you know them?

349
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,759
I know them.

350
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,639
When did they arrive?

351
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,080
Before dusk.

352
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
They left after dinner.

353
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,240
Didn't they say they would stay here?

354
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,320
I thought they would stay.

355
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,120
But who would know
they would leave after dinner?

356
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,559
Are there other inns to the west?

357
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,759
To the west?

358
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,240
About 20 or 30 li to the west,
there's another one.

359
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,720
That's an inn in the village.

360
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
No match to here.

361
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,559
Okay, thank you.

362
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,960
Enjoy.

363
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
We are very close to Zhuo Bufan.

364
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,279
Indeed.

365
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,519
I guess tonight

366
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,400
they will probably stay at the inn
on the west side.

367
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,920
Then let's hurry over there.

368
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
We'll catch up to them before dawn.

369
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,359
You stay here tonight.

370
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,200
Have a good sleep.

371
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,519
Are you going to leave me behind?

372
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,799
It's not that.

373
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
It's just inconvenient
for you to follow me.

374
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,759
And with you following me,

375
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,088
I can't do my job well.

376
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:33,640
But...

377
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,279
Miss Lin.

378
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,319
Don't say anything.

379
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,559
Just settle down here.

380
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,839
We'll meet here tomorrow.

381
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,119
You are all by yourself.

382
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,039
I can't handle them on my own.

383
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,920
But it's also no use taking you with me.

384
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,528
Alright, it's settled then.

385
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,359
Why are you up?

386
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,720
I had some soup. I'm much better now.

387
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,640
It's not even dawn yet.

388
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,119
Go back and sleep.

389
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,400
You know me.

390
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,599
It's temporary.

391
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,599
The pain will go away.

392
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,119
If you are still worried,

393
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,079
then wake them up and set off.

394
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,000
Don't waste time because of me.

395
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,319
Then you...

396
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,240
Are you really okay?

397
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm fine.

398
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,519
In the past when I was in pain,

399
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,640
you would always make me hot porridge.

400
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,200
I rested a little
after having the porridge,

401
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,880
and I would be okay.

402
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,440
If you're really okay,

403
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,519
I'll wake them up.

404
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,759
Let's hurry on our way.

405
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,559
Bufan.

406
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,279
What is it?

407
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,079
We have a tail.

408
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:12,839
You go first.

409
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,720
Go!

410
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,839
Someone is following us.

411
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,519
We've come so far already.

412
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,240
I didn't see anyone
following us all day.

413
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,680
And all of a sudden?

414
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,160
This is a mistake, right?

415
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,799
Ms. Huo wouldn't make a mistake.

416
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,759
Let's go.

417
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,640
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
Wang Jialuo, Dagu County Yamen.

418
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,839
Six people were involved
in the Dagu murder case.

419
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Four have been executed.

420
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,480
The rest of you.

421
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,680
Qin Tuo, Yu Huanjie of Rongtian Ridge

422
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,680
and the mastermind Zhuo Bufan

423
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,519
must all be brought to justice today.

424
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
He is really persistent.

425
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,200
Wang Jialuo.

426
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,039
I underestimated you before.

427
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,000
Even the Japanese and the Department

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,240
couldn't catch up with us.

429
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,480
But you actually found where we were

430
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,839
and even confronted us like this.

431
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,680
I can tell you are a determined person.

432
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,480
I admire that.

433
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
So I don't want to kill you.

434
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,000
How about this?

435
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,759
Listen to me.

436
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,119
Go back.

437
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,920
Don't risk your life

438
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,400
for some irrelevant people.

439
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,880
People died.

440
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,640
Nine people

441
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,160
died by poison in my jurisdiction.

442
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,839
How can it be irrelevant to me?

443
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,640
You can't bear to kill me.

444
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,000
How could you bear to kill nine people?

445
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,319
Zhuo Bufan.

446
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,279
Today, you can turn yourself in
without putting up a fight

447
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,799
or fight me.

448
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,599
As long as I am not dead,

449
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,119
I will not give up chasing after you.

450
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
It seems
that you have made up your mind.

451
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:36,920
Even if I let you go,

452
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,160
you will still come after me

453
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,319
and never give up.

454
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,240
Wang Jialuo.

455
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,839
I am telling you.

456
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,839
I'm taking my disciples
to Fenzhou in Shanxi.

457
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,640
If you are lucky to survive today,

458
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,279
feel free to go after me as you want.

459
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,799
Mr. Mu, Mr. Getai.

460
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,559
Why did you come back?

461
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,839
Didn't I tell you to follow Mr. Wang?

462
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,200
Has he caught up with Zhuo Bufan?

463
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,079
Yes.

464
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,440
It seems Zhuo Bufan has killed him.

465
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,200
You're right, Mr. Mu.

466
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,599
Zhuo Bufan killed Mr. Wang this morning.

467
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,920
Where did he die?

468
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,039
Somewhere near Anyang, Henan division.

469
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,279
Muqing.

470
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,440
You seem very sorry for him.

471
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,119
He was so desperate to go after him.

472
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,519
It is not surprising
that Zhuo Bufan killed him.

473
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,000
I knew this day would come.

474
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,359
He was just too stubborn.

475
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,519
He knew he was no match for him.

476
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,279
But he wouldn't stop

477
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,880
until he got himself killed.

478
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,640
I am indignant.

479
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,240
How did you deal with his corpse?

480
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,039
I...

481
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,039
You just left him there?

482
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,200
I didn't think I needed to.

483
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,559
What?

484
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,720
After all,

485
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,319
he was a constable serving the court.

486
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,680
You just left his body behind

487
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
in the middle of nowhere?

488
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,640
Please forgive me.

489
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,319
At that time, I didn't dare to approach.

490
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,240
I was afraid
people of Rongtian Ridge noticed me.

491
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,200
Muqing.

492
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,160
If I were him,

493
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,759
I would do just the same.

494
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,519
You may go.

495
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,480
Muqing.

496
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,200
We need to hurry on our way.

497
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,680
If Zhuo Bufan finds the treasure,

498
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,559
that will be troublesome.

499
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,240
This is urgent.

500
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,519
At all costs,

501
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,039
we must arrive at Pingyao by tomorrow.

502
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:27,960
Let's set out!

503
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,640
- Yes!
- Yes!

504
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,960
(This morning,)

505
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,319
(Mr. Wang was in a village
near Anyang in Henan.)

506
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,759
(He caught up with Zhuo Bufan)

507
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,319
(and fought against him.)

508
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,119
(Zhuo pierced through his chest
with a sword.)

509
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,319
(And he died in the wilderness.)

510
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,839
(I am following Zhuo Bufan
and his disciples.)

511
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,519
(During this time,
they have already arrived in Shanxi.)

512
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,200
(Approaching the vicinity of Fenzhou.)

513
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,680
(Judging from the situation,
they have reached the destination.)

514
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,880
We're going to Fenzhou, Shanxi.

515
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,400
But the warriors we sent out
to track Zhuo Bufan

516
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,440
have all already...

517
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,119
That's right.

518
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,640
The warriors we dispatched to track down
people of Rongtian Ridge

519
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,240
have all been killed.

520
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,000
Then why?

521
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,920
Where did you

522
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,400
get this clue?

523
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,039
Did you arrange for someone else
to follow them?

524
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,119
The one following Zhuo Bufan right now

525
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,920
is the most capable warrior.

526
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:40,250
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

527
00:30:49,562 --> 00:30:50,720
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

528
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,640
Why did a constable
from the Dagu County Yamen of Tianjin

529
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
appear in Henan?

530
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,720
Get his wounds treated.

531
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,200
What do you think of
the Three Phase Theory?

532
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,480
Now is the Chaotic Phase.

533
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
You are right.

534
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,279
But we just need to end the chaos

535
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,680
and rebuild the dynasty,

536
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,200
so we can reach the Harmonious Phase.

537
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,440
Then who can lead us
to the Harmonious Phase?

538
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,640
Of course, the court.

539
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,599
How do you know the court now

540
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,480
can bring us to the Harmonious Phase?

541
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,039
I don't know

542
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,440
if the court is capable.

543
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,480
But one way or another,

544
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,559
I should do my best

545
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,039
to serve the nation.

546
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,880
I didn't expect you, a mere constable,

547
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,400
to harbor the integrity
of a scholar-official.

548
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,559
It's a pity you weren't born
six or seven years ago.

549
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,160
Otherwise, you could have
served in court.

550
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,640
Perhaps you would have
accomplished something.

551
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,440
I was going to
take the imperial examination.

552
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,480
It's just that
I wasn't born at the right time.

553
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,720
You are so young.

554
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,039
When you just came of age,

555
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,279
the imperial examinations
were already abolished.

556
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
I don't know in the future

557
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,160
whether there will be
imperial examination.

558
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,480
Even if there are,

559
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,480
you no longer have a chance.

560
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,920
Aren't you aware

561
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,200
that being a constable
is considered a lowly profession?

562
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,279
Yes, indeed.

563
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,519
Before the abolition
of imperial examination,

564
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,119
there were already
stringent regulations.

565
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,039
Due to dishonoring scholarship,

566
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,680
constables and their descendants

567
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,000
were not allowed to take the exams.

568
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,640
Even if a person
quits being a constable,

569
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,000
his offspring were only eligible
after three generations.

570
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:08,920
You see?

571
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,039
You knew it.

572
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,279
Even if I cannot
participate in the imperial examination.

573
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Even if I am just a humble constable.

574
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,880
I must still serve the court
with all my heart

575
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,519
and guard the Qing.

576
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,079
You are upright.

577
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,440
But there are plenty of you out there.

578
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,039
You all want to serve the court loyally.

579
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,799
But not all of you are capable of that.

580
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,359
About what you just said,

581
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,920
I don't quite understand.

582
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,640
Young constable.

583
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:47,480
Do you know that
there are three kinds of officials?

584
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,279
First are the Confucian officials.

585
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,440
Confucian officials
can dispel malevolent energies.

586
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,119
They can turn the war into peace.

587
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,960
They can establish the principles
for the society.

588
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,400
They can find the purpose
for the people.

589
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,319
They can bring the Confucianism
to a higher level.

590
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,759
They can create peace
for all generations.

591
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,360
Confucian officials can achieve things
in peaceful and prosperous times.

592
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,960
But in times of chaos,

593
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,760
if you only have the integrity
of the scholar-official,

594
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,119
that will be useless.

595
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,039
Second are the capable officials.

596
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,440
Capable officials
can go against the tide

597
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,159
and cause a torrential surge.

598
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,199
Just like Xie Anshi
who lives as a recluse,

599
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,559
who can calmly put down revolts
during a conversation.

600
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,719
But capable officials
can only do their best.

601
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,559
They don't know what will happen next.

602
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Nobody knows

603
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,960
whether it will succeed or not.

604
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,559
Confucian and capable officials,

605
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,280
in the Harmonious Phase
and Great Unity Phase,

606
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,880
can achieve something.

607
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,320
But in the Chaotic Phase,

608
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,880
officials that can assist the Emperor
are needed.

609
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,840
May I ask

610
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,320
what is different about them?

611
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,679
This kind of officials

612
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,960
do not fuss over formalities

613
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,599
or care about manners and morals.

614
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,159
They just care about goals.

615
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,800
In the Chaotic Phase,

616
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,079
you can make a difference by doing so.

617
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,199
Young constable.

618
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,320
You have pursued the criminal
all the way from Dagu to Shanghai.

619
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,880
And now you are here.

620
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,599
Although you are still unaware.

621
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,639
But in fact,

622
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,679
you have already shown the makings
of an official who can assist Emperor.

623
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,800
Given time,
you are sure to achieve greatness.

624
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,239
Perhaps you will be able
to achieve something

625
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,079
in times of chaos.

626
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,599
Keding.

627
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,960
Bring me my brush and ink.

628
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,480
Okay.

629
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,800
(Young constable.)

630
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,079
(Since you are going to Shanxi
to hunt the criminal.)

631
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,519
(Take this letter.)

632
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,920
(When you arrive at Shanxi,)

633
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,320
(go to Beiyang Army's 43rd Association.)

634
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,400
(Look for someone named Long Chi.)

635
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,480
(Show him the letter.)

636
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,320
(With this letter,)

637
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,360
(you can be
an associative military instructor)

638
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,000
(and command the soldiers.)

639
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,719
(Brother, I need your earnest help.)

640
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,679
(With soldiers and guns,)

641
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,719
(only then can you fight
people of Rongtian Ridge)

642
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,199
(and capture Zhuo Bufan.)

643
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:41,568
(Long Chi)

644
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:45,562
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

645
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,559
May I ask, sir?

646
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,440
Why do you help me?

647
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,039
You are talented.

648
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,039
I don't want you to waste your talent

649
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,840
or die.

650
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,360
Moreover,

651
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,760
I might save a lot of people
by doing this.

652
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
Please tell me.

653
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,000
What should I address you?

654
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,559
Wander to the ends of the earth
from here on.

655
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,159
I will wear a conical hat and a mino
on a fishing boat fishing.
