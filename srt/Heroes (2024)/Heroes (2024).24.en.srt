1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,360
Draw your sword.

2
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,520
This is not your martial skill.

3
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,800
If it's not mine, could it be yours?

4
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,359
How could you improve
so much in just a few days?

5
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,079
Want to know?
Hand over the seal, and I'll tell you.

6
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,599
Muqing, how did you become so powerful?

7
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,159
It's because he has become weaker.
He might be injured.

8
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,879
I felt especially uneasy at night.

9
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,160
I only found out you went to report
back to Prince Qi after asking them.

10
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,880
I couldn't help but run out to find you.

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,879
Who knew you would encounter Men Sandao?

12
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,879
I'm fine.

13
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,680
You were slow
because you were just injured.

14
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,840
Otherwise, how could he
possibly be your match?

15
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,800
No, I wanted to end the fight soon,

16
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,120
so I wasn't slow at all.

17
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,920
But he remembered every move
of my sword technique.

18
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,520
Every time, he could get the upper hand.

19
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,560
He wasn't that skilled before.

20
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,600
His knife.

21
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,719
That's right. He used a knife
but sword techniques.

22
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,360
The Sanyin Sword.

23
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,800
Men Sandao has made
such progress in such a short time.

24
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,280
He must have received
the Bodhi heritage at the Futu Temple.

25
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,439
The Sanyin Sword is truly formidable.

26
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,639
The Shaolin skills are so formidable.

27
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,560
I must find the Altar Treasure

28
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,440
to read through
all the techniques contained within.

29
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:17,696
(I'm Zhuo Bufan,
always in pursuit and extraordinary.)

30
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,048
(Only those who can wander everywhere
are worthy of this name.)

31
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,280
(My life is a gamble with fate, a wager
on life and death, a bet on the future.)

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
(Life is unfair,
and I fell on an evil time.)

33
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,440
(I do whatever I can to change my fate.)

34
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,000
(Everything is impermanent and fickle.)

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
(I will decide my own life and death.)

36
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,000
(I bet on a promising future
and a great undertaking.)

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
(I want to protect the last hope.)

38
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,320
(But I lost the bet on her.)

39
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,360
(10 taels)

40
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,000
(I thought we couldn't meet
the right one too late.)

41
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,400
(But actually,
meeting too early also will not do.)

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,800
(I always remember
the first time I met her.)

43
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,184
(She stood beside the flowers, smiling.)

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,768
(Later on, even though she
has been by my side,)

45
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,640
(she can't be for a lifetime.)

46
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,040
(I never know her answer.)

47
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,280
(When I was young,
I always pursued that answer.)

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
(But after a long time,)

49
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,680
(I only wish that no fights)

50
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,408
(and lovers get together.)

=Episode 24=

53
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,400
Just a regular merchant.
He often comes by to peddle some goods.

54
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,040
The prices are quite high,
but the goods are also quite good.

55
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
Why would you ask about this?

56
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,280
He gave me gifts.
Shouldn't I at least know who he is?

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,519
His name is Lin Haohan,
but he calls himself Lucky.

58
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,600
Lucky.

59
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,560
In English, it means good luck.

60
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,000
He's quite lucky.

61
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,880
Are you sure he's just
an ordinary merchant?

62
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
He's just an ordinary merchant.

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He goes around buying and selling goods.

64
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,040
He has sold quite a few things
to the princess.

65
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,720
He must have made quite a bit of money.

66
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,640
Lin Haohan
has recently set up a big shop.

67
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,000
It's going to be open soon.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,199
I hear he has even invited the princess.

69
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
Then it must be a coincidence?

70
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,400
Yes, a coincidence.

71
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,200
His gift isn't worth much in itself.

72
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,880
The material and workmanship
are both mediocre. It isn't top-notch.

73
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,920
But it's a good choice for a gift.

74
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,319
For a businessman,
it makes sense to give you

75
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,160
that not-too-expensive-or-cheap thing.

76
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,840
Good.

77
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,480
Anyway, he's unintentionally rendered
a great help.

78
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,399
You slept on the floor yesterday.

79
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,920
I'll sleep on the floor today.
You sleep on the bed.

80
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,399
It's alright. I'm a man.
I can sleep on the floor.

81
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
I'll accompany you
and sleep on the floor.

82
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
No.

83
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,040
Or you sleep on the bed with me.

84
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,879
That's even worse.

85
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,800
Is sleeping with me a terrible thing?

86
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,439
I don't mind it.
You're a man. Why do you even care?

87
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,120
I am already yours.

88
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,360
Sorry for disrespecting you last time.

89
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,519
As a highly educated man,

90
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,319
how could I do such a disgraceful thing?

91
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,760
I've already thought it through.
Once I close the case, I will

92
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,000
propose to you.

93
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,440
My master has gone.

94
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,639
We are the same,
without family in the world.

95
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,000
But I can become your family.

96
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,200
I will absolutely never let you
suffer any grievances again.

97
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,680
I believe you.
I'll wait for you to marry me.

98
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,320
I will marry no one but you.

99
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,679
Go to bed.
I'm going out for some fresh air.

100
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,919
Come back early. I'm afraid of the dark.

101
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,840
I'll be back in a moment.

102
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,944
(Changde Inn)

103
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,200
Stop. Back up.

104
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,560
Jialuo.

105
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,440
Haohan.

106
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,159
What are the odds?

107
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,240
I've been dozing off all the way.

108
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,880
And with just a glance, I saw you.

109
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,120
My shop just happens to open tomorrow.

110
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,080
I've been wanting to invite you,
but I just couldn't find you.

111
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,679
And now we've bumped
into each other like this.

112
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,440
This is the invitation.

113
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,920
(Beijing Qianmen Street)
This is the address.

114
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,879
Jialuo, your presence would be an honor.

115
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,679
Our good buddy,
Men Sandao, will be there too.

116
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,919
It's been a long time
since we saw each other.

117
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,400
Okay. Congratulations.

118
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,120
Thank you.

119
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,759
Congratulations.

120
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,440
Thank you.

121
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,039
Congratulations.

122
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,759
Thank you. You talk so much.

123
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
This is...?

124
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,240
(10-tael banknote)
Can you please give this to me tomorrow?

125
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,559
Do me a favor.

126
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,720
In return, this is
my thank-you gift. Keep it well.

127
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,879
It was unexpected,
so I didn't bring a gift.

128
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,679
I mean, the gift for you.

129
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,480
No need.

130
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,039
No.

131
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,240
It's your shop's opening.
I should give you a gift. Take it back.

132
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,720
Exactly. The gift for you to give me.

133
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,679
But it's okay.
We're good buddies. Forget that.

134
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,120
It's the thought that counts.
The Qianmen Street.

135
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,279
There's one more thing, Jialuo.

136
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,120
Could you please come
in your Beiyang Army uniform tomorrow?

137
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,000
That way, others will see
that I have connections in the military.

138
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,640
Remember. The Qianmen Street
and the military uniform.

139
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,480
The Qianmen... Military...

140
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,360
The Qianmen Street
and the military uniform. I got it.

141
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,320
Right. Jialuo, remember.

142
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,520
Let's go. Please don't forget.

143
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,480

Yu Peilun, courtesy name Yunji,
went to study in Japan seven years ago.

He and I joined
the Tongmenghui together.

he was no longer alive.

upon learning of his martyrdom.

168

Comrade? You are a prince's daughter,

a Beiyang general's wife,
but you are a member of the Tongmenghui?

Has Muqing also joined the Tongmenghui?

171

Seems these people have
no idea who hired them.

172
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,920
It doesn't matter. Who else could it be
besides the Japanese?

173
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,879
It must be that woman Sei I Shinpu
or one of her subordinates.

174

I'll go confront them.

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,799
Muqing, those are Japanese.

176
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,799
So what?

177
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,799
It's best not to take action
against foreigners these days.

178
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,720
Mr. Cunqing always warns us
not to provoke them.

179
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,440
Okay, I will ask Mr. Cunqing.

180
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,120
Muqing, should these just be locked up?

181
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,039
Why should we continue to do that?

182
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,840
No need to waste food on those
who help the Japanese deal with us.

183
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,320
Have those newcomers
who haven't interrogated suspects

184
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,040
use them for practice until their death.

185
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,240
During my search for the Altar Treasure,

186
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,200
the Japanese have been interfering.

187
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,519
Their head is called Sei I Shinpu.

188
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,559
They've ambushed us several times,
followed us and even tried to murder us.

189
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,440
So rampant. It's intolerable.

190
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,200
I ask for your permission
to take action against them.

191
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,440
How will you do it?

192
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,240
Once you permit, I'll secretly kill
Sei I Shinpu and her party tonight.

193
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,679
And then?

194
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,519
I can make it look like an accident.

195
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,639
So Muqing keeps you close
because you know

196
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,519
the secrets of the Futu Temple.

197
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,279
And because he couldn't watch
over you all the time,

198
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,680
he sent you to me.

199
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,519
Men Sandao,
that imperial lackey. He used me.

200
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,119
I'll arrange
for your departure immediately.

201
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,799
Don't worry.
I will ensure your safe departure.

202
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,359
Are you heading to Hong Kong or Japan?

203
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,759
No, I can't go.

204
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,799
No?

205
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,519
Do you know what you are now?

206
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,799
You are an imperial convict and a rebel.

207
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,920
You could be taken to Caishikou
for execution at any moment.

208
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,640
Listen to me. Leave immediately.
I will deal with Men Sandao.

209
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
He can't stop me.

210
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,359
First, listen to me. The last wish
of the owner of the Altar Treasure

211
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,640
is to bestow it upon the Tongmenghui.

212
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
My mission returning home
this time is to protect this clue

213
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,920
and assist with the liaison.

214
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,960
Tan Xian has already been sacrificed.

215
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,000
The Qing Imperial Court, the Beiyang
and the Japanese all want it.

216
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,720
No matter which party gets the treasure,

217
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,960
it will betray the hard work
of many people

218
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,440
and even let down the treasure protector
who has suffered for years.

219
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,440
So I must stay.
I must find the treasure.

220
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,320
And I mustn't go.
I mustn't leave Mr. Mu.

221
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,480
You can't leave Muqing?

222
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,800
No.

223
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,480
Why?

224
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,240
At the Futu Temple,

225
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,759
Mr. Mu had no choice but to inherit
the legacy of the Bodhi Department.

226
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,319
But he has absolutely no idea
where the seal is.

227
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,440
You have the passphrase,
so only you know.

228
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,800
It's of great importance.
I cannot tell you for now.

229
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,920
But I cannot leave Mr. Mu
before the treasure is found.

230
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,440
I understand. What can I do to help you?

231
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,039
You're already helping me
by letting me stay here.

232
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,880
That doesn't count. I'm helping
Men Sandao, the imperial hound.

233
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,200
Princess, actually I feel
that Mr. Mu is not the usual hound.

234
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,480
After he found out
I was from the Tongmenghui,

235
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,880
he didn't send me to the prison.

236
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,759
Nor did he interrogate me
by torturing me severely.

237
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,519
He even showed
understanding of my actions.

238
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,759
I think he understands revolution
and sympathizes with revolutionaries.

239
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,480
Yes, Muqing participated in the reform
with the late Emperor in the past.

240
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,960
He's not the kind of person
with outdated thinking.

241
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,440
During this time, I've had discussions
with Mr. Mu about democracy and reform.

242
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,960
I've found

243
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,759
he's not like those decadent and blind
loyalists of the Qing Imperial Court.

244
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,640
He is open to revolutionary ideas.

245
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,519
We can pull him to our camp.

246
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
If we can persuade him
to join us and help us,

247
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,480
our chances of success
will greatly increase.

248
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,839
You want to lobby him to join us?

249
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,640
What do you think?

250
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,839
I've never talked
about these things with Muqing before.

251
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,119
But one thing you need to know
is that Muqing is a Manchu.

252
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,400
He could accept
the late Emperor's wish for reforms.

253
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,720
If it's the Tongmenghui conducting
the revolution, he may not agree.

254
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,880
Aren't you a Manchu too?

255
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:10,400
I... I returned from studying abroad.

256
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,440
Wang Jialuo is the Dharma inheritor?

257
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,400
Is it a coincidence or fate?

258
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,776
Whether it's a coincidence or fate,

259
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,640
he doesn't seem to be of much use.

260
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,799
He doesn't have any seals at all

261
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,319
or know what the Dharma Seal is.

262
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,039
Not necessarily.
Since he's an inheritor,

263
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,192
he might be able
to get what others cannot.

264
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:52,559
Second thing, on the 6th of next month,
Southern Shaolin inheritors will go

265
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,119
to the Baohe Inn to fulfill
a 30-year-old promise.

266
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,440
If nothing unexpected happens, it'll be
the day the four inheritors meet.

267
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,880
The four seals will come together?

268
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,039
I don't know if they will all go.

269
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,160
It's uncertain
whether they can all be gathered.

270
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,480
The Discipline and Bodhi Seals
are with Zhuo Bufan and Men Sandao.

271
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,680
Both of them will definitely go.
Mr. Wang will go too.

272
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,039
But he doesn't have a seal.

273
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,000
The key point is the fourth person,
related to the treasure, may attend.

274
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,400
Where is the Baohe Inn?

275
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,039
Men Sandao is on it, using
lots of resources from the Department,

276
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,039
so he'll probably find it.

277
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
And the third one?

278
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,480
Mr. Wang has the same tattoo

279
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,119
as his crazy old master.

280
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,599
I think it may be a sect inheritance.

281
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,160
But perhaps it's not that simple.

282
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:51,160
The tattoo might be a map or a seal.

283
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,520
This doubt must be investigated.

284
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,599
I need a mini camera to take
a photo of the tattoo on him.

285
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,240
Still Expo. I've used it before.

286
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,400
Okay. You take the photo
and I'll have an expert analyze it.

287
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,920
If there is any hidden information,
it will definitely be found.

288
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,320
Have you already convinced Mr. Wang?

289
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,559
He is an extremely conservative man
who values traditional customs.

290
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,400
But he is also a man.

291
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,240
Kill them, and you'll be relieved.
But trouble will come to me.

292
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,000
Muqing, the Japanese
nowadays cannot be provoked.

293
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,839
Today is different from before.
The situation is too sensitive.

294
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,359
Not just the Japanese,
but also the Germans and the British.

295
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:56,920
Those foreigners are all untouchable.

296
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,079
Once they make a fuss using the death
of their nationals in the capital,

297
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,240
that would be an issue.

298
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,160
We might have to cede territory
and pay compensation. It's not worth it.

299
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:17,319
Hold it in. We must hold it in.
Continue to hold it in.

300
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,799
How can we change
what the foreigners have decided?

301
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,759
This is the Concession. You have
no right to enforce the law here.

302
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,160
They forfeited territories
and paid indemnities every year!

303
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,599
Sir, take care. Please come often.

304
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,079
It is dry. Be on alert for fires.

305
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,104
It is dry. Be on alert for fires.

306
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:27,680
(Tea)

307
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,640
You can't come in here. Go away.

308
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,519
Ask Sei I Shinpu out to see me.

309
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,279
Who are you?

310
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,400
Your father. Tell Sei I Shinpu
to come out to see me.

311
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,119
Asking for death.

312
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,599
You failed again?

313
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,480
We sent 17 people,
but all of them disappeared.

314
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,079
What do you mean by all disappeared?

315
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,880
No one can be found. No traces at all.

316
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,200
Sei I Shinpu, come out to see me.

317
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,039
How come it's him again?
We've all been avoiding him.

318
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,960
The back door. This is our place.
He wouldn't cause trouble here.

319
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,839
Sei I Shinpu,
come out, or I'm coming in.

320
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,400
Are you deaf? Didn't you hear me?

321
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Mr. Muqing, you honor us
with your presence.

322
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,920
I really should change my clothes
before coming out to see you.

323
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,559
Are you a working girl?
Having special clothes to meet guests?

324
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,400
How dare you be so rude?
What do you mean?

325
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,880
It's his first time here.

326
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,440
We must observe proper etiquette.

327
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,599
Right, Mr. Muqing?

328
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,839
A servant shouldn't really

329
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,000
interrupt when their master is speaking.

330
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,839
Let her slap herself.

331
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,440
I shall forgive her for her words.

332
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,279
Otherwise, I will be the one
to deliver the slap.

333
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,279
Mr. Muqing,
this is the Japanese embassy.

334
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:37,359
If you're here for tea and conversation,
we will treat you with courtesy.

335
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,000
I've smashed the door for you,

336
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,880
and you think I came here
to drink tea and chat?

337
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,359
As a high-ranking official
of the Department,

338
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,920
you know the consequences
of trespassing in our embassy.

339
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,559
Do you know the consequences of killing
an official of the Department?

340
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,279
Do you know the consequences
of assassinating a prince?

341
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,960
You hired 17 people to ambush
outside the prince's residence,

342
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,640
intending to assassinate Prince Qi.
The proof is solid.

343
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,176
Even if I kill all of you,
who can do anything to me?

344
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,480
If there is irrefutable evidence,

345
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,759
I'm afraid we'd already
be surrounded by your people.

346
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,279
You came alone. Doesn't that mean
you have no evidence?

347
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,880
So what if you've captured them?

348
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,960
They are all the locals.

349
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,920
How do you prove
they are not framing me? Stop him.

350
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,952
I said it. If you don't do it yourself,
I will do the slapping

351
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,359
Evidence is something
that can be produced at any time.

352
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,480
As long as I wish, I can arrest
your people for interrogation.

353
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,800
Even if I say you are a man,

354
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,960
they all have to say yes obediently.

355
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,720
How many of the people
you sent to follow me have returned?

356
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,480
You know I am the one
who killed your people. What can you do?

357
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,480
If I now execute you all,
what can you do?

358
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,160
You're great, disregarding the relations
between our two countries.

359
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,799
Relations? You've got
the nerve to mention them.

360
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,240
If you hadn't provoked me,
would I have even glanced at you?

361
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,880
Sei I Shinpu, I don't want
to see any of you again.

362
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Remember what I said,
or next time it won't just be a slap.

363
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,119
I must kill him.

364
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,880
You've been toiling for days.
Eat it to replenish yourself.

365
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,319
I really can't eat it anymore.
Aren't you sleepy?

366
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,559
No. After so long,
I've finally seen a comrade.

367
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,960
I'm too excited to feel tired.

368
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,680
I'm not like you.

369
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,240
Yunji never allowed me
to participate in any activities.

370
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,119
He said my identity was special,
and that it was best to hide it

371
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,799
and let it play a role
at a crucial moment.

372
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,520
So I'm usually just idling around

373
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,799
and doing nothing.

374
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,759
That's why I especially hope
to do something.

375
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,640
You previously traced it to Fujian?

376
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,400
The Southern Shaolin was in Fujian too?

377
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,560
Yes.

378
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,440
I think it is very likely related
to my father and Zhong Haichao.

379
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:36,759
Why?

380
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,680
Zhong Haichao used to be responsible
for the Beiyang troops in the capital.

381
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,519
That is an important position.

382
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,880
But my father has pulled some strings
to have him transferred to Fujian.

383
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,556
I didn't pay attention to it.

384
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,200
Now that I think about it,
could it be for the secret treasure?

385
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,160
When is he going?

386
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,240
Leaving in the next few days.

387
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,720
Once he leaves,
we'll be much more at ease.

388
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,640
You and your husband...

389
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,000
Why don't you and your husband
seem very close?

390
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,520
I am the daughter of a prince.

391
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,799
I had no choice in my marriage at all.

392
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,952
Didn't you ask me before
why I knew Muqing a lot?

393
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,076
He and I are each other's first love.

394
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,800
(We met when Muqing
was the late Emperor's guard.)

395
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:51,519
(But because of the difference
in social status, we didn't speak out.)

396
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,519
(Muqing accidentally dropped the sachet
he made for me in front of His Majesty.)

397
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,359
(The late Emperor saw it.)

398
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,960
(The late Emperor came
to know about our thing.)

399
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,920
(The late Emperor was always fond of me)

400
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,720
(and appreciated Muqing the most.)

401
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,040
His Majesty said, "Now that the reform
is underway, what does status matter?"

402
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,039
But to make it acceptable to my father,

403
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,480
the late Emperor first promoted
Muqing from third rank to second rank

404
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,640
and said after the reform,
he would be promoted to first rank.

405
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,200
And he acted as a matchmaker for us.

406
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,559
(And then the reform began.)

407
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:54,119
(The Hundred Days' Reform
failed, and then...)

408
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,920
And there was no "after that".

409
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,960
Not long after, my father
arranged a marriage for me.

410
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Zhong Haichao is the man he chose.

411
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,440
Muqing.

412
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,040
I am not a woman
from an ordinary family.

413
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,519
I need to see the bigger picture,

414
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,119
so I cannot have a choice.

415
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:00,120
I'll marry a general
and, like me, he has studied abroad.

416
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,640
He is the youngest leader
in the Beiyang Army and is promising.

417
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,400
The country is increasingly unstable.

418
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,960
The power of civil officials
is getting weaker and less significant.

419
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,760
Military generals are gaining more
and more say, especially the Beiyang.

420
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,720
The Beiyang Army is the most elite army.

421
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,519
I am a princess. He is a military man.

422
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,160
This is very crucial
for the future political landscape.

423
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,920
You may never leave this prison
for the rest of your life.

424
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,519
I must forget you.

425
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,280
There's nothing time can't erase.
The same goes for you.

426
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,000
The most fleeting things in life

427
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,920
are the youth that never returns
and the falling blossoms.

428
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,400
If one day you regain your freedom,

429
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,760
I hope by then
you will have gotten over me.

430
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,760
What an awful era.

431
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,880
Muqing hates nothing more
than Yuan Shikai and the Beiyang Army.

432
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:39,239
But I had to marry
a Beiyang Army officer.

433
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,840
It's not hard to imagine
how much Muqing must be suffering.

434
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,560
I am a Manchu.
Why would I join the Tongmenghui?

435
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,559
Because I hate everything
I've experienced and yet I'm helpless.

436
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,320
Until I met Yunji,
who showed me those books.

437
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,320
He made me understand
I could just let time erase everything.

438
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,920
I could also struggle, resist

439
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,480
and destroy this era
that won't allow us to be ourselves.

440
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,640
I am a Manchu
and the daughter of a prince.

441
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,520
I had no choice over my birth.

442
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,519
Joining the Tongmenghui was my choice.

443
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,079
It was my first true choice.

444
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,840
Would Mr. Mu think the same as you?

445
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,040
I hope he can.

446
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,880
If you can persuade him,

447
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,920
I think our chances
of success would be very high.

448
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,719
I can give it a try.

449
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,840
By the way, do you know
that Mr. Mu has a tattoo on his body?

450
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,400
The abbot of the Futu Temple

451
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,600
allowed him inside
because he saw the tattoo.

452
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,320
That tattoo depicts intertwined pigeons,

453
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,800
venomous snakes and pigs.

454
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,840
Why would he get such a tattoo?

455
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,384
I asked him, but he didn't know.

456
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:18,679
He told me his master
gave him the tattoo.

457
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,960
Perhaps it's a reminder
for him to always reflect on himself.

458
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,079
What's wrong with that tattoo?

459
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,719
It's nothing.

460
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,719
I just don't know why the abbot
was so sure that he was the inheritor

461
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,039
of the Bodhi Department
after seeing that tattoo.

462
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,360
Maybe it's the mark of their sect.

463
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,960
His master wished for reform.

464
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,599
The late Emperor wished for reform.

465
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,440
I think Muqing will side with us.

466
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,239
He is someone we must win over.

467
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,440
Time flies. It's almost dawn.

468
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,120
Yes, it's about to be daylight.

469
00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:18,560
(The 26th day of the 4th month in Year 3 of Xuantong Era.
Grain in Ear is 14 days away.)
