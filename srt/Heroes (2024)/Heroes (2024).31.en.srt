1
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,614
(The third day of the fifth month,
3th year of Xuantong era)

2
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,439
(eight days before Mangzhong)

3
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,559
Ancient coins from the Qianlong era?

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,679
Coins from the Qianlong period
can't be considered ancient.

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,039
Muqing, if you want to get something
that can appreciate,

6
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,039
it's better to get some
from the Xianfeng era.

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,480
Buy the coins with face value
of 100, 200, 500, and 1000.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,439
After a century or so,
they might be valuable.

9
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,079
I only want those from Qianlong era.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,200
You can go to Fuzhou or Xiamen
to collect them.

11
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,600
Tell me what this clue is.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,359
If you can find the coins,
then that would be the key clue.

13
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,079
If you can't find them,
there will be no clue.

14
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,359
There are many kinds of coins
during the Qianlong era.

15
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,479
You have to tell me
what kind you are looking for.

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,200
I will look for them if I know that.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,959
You need to look for
the problematic ones.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,120
You sound problematic.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,000
How would I know
which kind is problematic?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,719
If you don't know,

21
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,896
that's your problem to solve.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,079
I...

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,599
Okay, I'll go look for them.

24
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,120
Do your best.
Don't give me the runaround.

25
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,280
You've always been the one
giving me the runaround.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,760
I have always gone all out for you.

27
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,680
Fine, I'll get it done.

28
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,152
(Qingfu Building)

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
Mr. Muqing, was it funny?

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,159
The ancient coins of the Qianlong era
are not any clue, right?

31
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,280
Of course not.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,960
Then why did you lie to that flatterer?

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,039
You don't want him here
the next few days?

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,919
Maybe he seems detestable,

35
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,199
but deep down he isn't a bad person.

36
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,120
In a few days,
it will be the thirty-year pact.

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,039
Things will get dangerous.

38
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,360
I don't want him to get involved.

39
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,280
You can't even fool me, let alone him.

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,520
How could he miss an opportunity
that could make him rich?

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,400
He's so greedy and cunning.
He will surely sneak back.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,439
If he really is smart, he will know

43
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,360
how dangerous it will be on that day.

44
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,479
It will be dangerous?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,719
Won't it?

46
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:57,439
(Ze Ze Inn)

47
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,439
Fish meat! Fresh fish meat!

48
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,919
Has everything been arranged as I said?

49
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,080
Everything is ready.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,159
I had our people placed on each floor.
And the rooms are with windows.

51
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,039
After Wang Jialuo and Zhuo Bufan arrive,

52
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,599
no matter which room they stay in,
they will be surrounded by us.

53
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,039
They have many people.

54
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,319
We have no advantage
when it comes to manpower.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,639
That's right.

56
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,080
They and we all live in the inn.

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,879
Chaos is better when we start to fight.

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,719
Understood.

59
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,879
Let the guards rest well.

60
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,719
Three more days to rest and recuperate.

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,319
By the sixth day, we need to go all out.

62
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:16,384
=Heroes=

63
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:20,352
=Episode 31=

64
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,480
This villa belongs to
a Japanese businessman.

65
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,600
It seems that he greatly appreciates
the beauty of wabi-sabi.

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
He has great taste.

67
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,639
How many guards from the Department
are here?

68
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,680
Not many, about 20 or so.

69
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,240
Have they all gone to the Ze Ze Inn?

70
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,040
Yes, they have taken a dozen rooms.

71
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,552
Zhuo Bufan should still have
a dozen disciples with him, right?

72
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,360
They have not shown up yet.

73
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,120
Wang Jialuo has more than thirty guns.

74
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,800
He may also stay at the Ze Ze Inn.

75
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,600
Pick a few people to pose as businessmen
and stay at the inn as well.

76
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,279
The rest will scatter and monitor
everyone who is in and out.

77
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,079
Don't miss any slightest thing.

78
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,439
You look very relaxed.

79
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,064
I'm very nervous but I can't show it.

80
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:01,879
I can only pretend to be relaxed.

81
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,000
This is the basic quality
of a court Hound.

82
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,680
Mr. Muqing,
you are not an ordinary hound.

83
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,639
Whether I'm an ordinary hound or not,
we'll talk about it after the sixth day.

84
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,920
If I can obtain all the seals,
then I will certainly not be ordinary.

85
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,959
If I cannot,
then I can only be an ordinary guard.

86
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,120
You have to be careful
with the Beiyang Army.

87
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Wang Jialuo is not a person
who doesn't keep his word.

88
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,519
I'm talking about Beiyang Army.

89
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,839
I don't take his dozens of guns
seriously at all.

90
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,279
I'm talking about Beiyang Army.

91
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,079
You can just say Zhong Haichao.

92
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,199
Be straightforward.

93
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,439
Since you know it, I am relieved.

94
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,728
If he wants to go against me,

95
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,920
he can just confront me,
without the need to play dirty.

96
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,399
So what's the point of me being careful?

97
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
I'm going to eat now.

98
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,480
Then drink a pot of Tieguanyin
and have a good sleep.

99
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,120
I want to rest.

100
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,480
I didn't invite you to come.

101
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,720
Drink up.

102
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,319
Paper, scissors, stone.

103
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
Sit down and join me.

104
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,079
Come on, drink!

105
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,519
This beef soup is a local specialty.
It tastes good.

106
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,040
This white radish rice is also nice.

107
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,079
If you're not picky,
try this oyster pancake.

108
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,920
You've studied abroad in Japan,
so you surely like it.

109
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,639
Let's drink.

110
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Didn't you say you wanted to rest?

111
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,552
Why show up at mealtime?

112
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,679
I said I'd rest. But I have to eat.

113
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,080
Mr. Muqing, aren't you burdened
with important duties?

114
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,960
Now you are eating and drinking
like nothing is going on.

115
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,320
I want to keep it low-key.

116
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,080
But everyone knows that I am here
to fulfill the thirty-year pact.

117
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,639
So why bother? Drink up.

118
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,519
Today has been my idlest day
since I was released from prison.

119
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,600
There's nothing much to do
about the case now.

120
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,480
I just need to wait until the sixth day
when the thirty-year pact is up.

121
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,320
So let's eat and drink well.

122
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,519
Yes. Today's also the idlest day for me
since I returned to the country.

123
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,320
Good for you.
But don't talk about the revolution.

124
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,559
Today, let's just be ourselves simply.

125
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,159
You are not a Tongmenghui rebel.
And I am not an imperial guard. Come on.

126
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Let's enjoy the wine and relax.

127
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,639
And forget about anything else for now.

128
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,159
Don't be a buzzkill, come on.

129
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,960
Men Sandao,
I'm tired of saying it every day.

130
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,440
You're nothing
but a pedantic court hound.

131
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,399
She's a Tongmenghui rebel.
What do you expect her to call me?

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,120
Drink up. Come on.

133
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,120
- Come on, drink up.
- Enjoy.

134
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,600
May you endure hardships and bitterness
for your revolution.

135
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,480
May you fail soon for the Qing Dynasty
you serve loyally.

136
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,000
I wish you lose everything
due to the revolution.

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,799
I wish the court you so staunchly defend
meets its end in the revolution.

138
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,799
You are just a Tongmenghui rebel.
Get over yourself.

139
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,840
You guards are loyal blindly
and stuck in the past.

140
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,639
Just wait, you won't achieve anything.

141
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,440
Just wait.
Sooner or later, we'll take you down.

142
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,879
Besides bickering with me here,
what else can you do?

143
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,480
Go fight the Eight-Nation Alliance.
No use to being cocky here!

144
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,399
You're shameless!

145
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,320
You are a brute!

146
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,159
Rebel!

147
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:44,840
Hound!

148
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,759
- Rebel!
- Hound!

149
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,639
Rebel!

150
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,399
Hound!

I can show you the Forbidden City

I can have all yamen runners of Fenzhou
toast with you to show respect.

169
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,679
The capital is our turf.

170
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,879
It's no fun being alone there.

171
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,720
Come with me, we can have a good time.

172
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,279
Good, come to Fenzhou after that.

173
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,240
Fenzhou is my turf,
which means it's yours too.

174
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,039
This southern wine is not strong at all.

175
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,720
I can treat you the wine
from the palace.

176
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,320
Speaking of wine,
you must try the Fen Wine from Shanxi.

177
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,039
No wine can compare.

178
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,600
Altar Treasure is not a big deal.
We will definitely find it.

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,039
We are one. you are my only friend.

180
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,559
When you get to Dagu,
just say you're my friend.

181
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,159
Then you can do whatever you want.

182
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,559
When going to Shuntian, bring her along.

183
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,480
You can fly kites in the Forbidden City.

184
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
If you come to Dagu,

185
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,759
I'll have the county magistrate
serve you well in person.

186
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,840
Think bigger. I will have the head
of the Department accompany you.

187
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,039
The current Emperor is too young,

188
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,840
otherwise,
I will ask him out to drink with you.

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,480
You can't do that.
He's at the age of studying.

190
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,759
So what? Xuantong Emperor is one of us.

191
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Prince Regent is also one of us.
Even the late Emperor...

192
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:57,856
The late Emperor,
you passed away and left us behind.

193
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,159
Master.

194
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,600
Why Men Sandao act so unreasonably?

195
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,360
I think he's just drunk.

196
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,159
Impossible. He is an imperial guard,
not an ordinary man.

197
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,480
How can he act so impulsively?

198
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,159
I agree. But that's the fact.

199
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,799
I think if Zhuo Bufan arrives tonight,

200
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,039
he'll probably drink with him.

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,720
You left Ze Ze Inn at this time,

202
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,159
won't Wang Jialuo become suspicious?

203
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,200
No one at Ze Ze Inn will be sober
before dawn,

204
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,120
and no one will notice
that I've left at all.

205
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,000
Take this gun, and use it if necessary.

206
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,799
Zhong Haichao is also in Fujian now.
He was transferred here.

207
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,399
This must be Prince Qi's arrangement.

208
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,080
So Zhuo Bufan
has a strong army behind him.

209
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,000
The troop following Wang Jialuo
is the 43rd Association from Shanxi.

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,440
I've learned a bit about them.

211
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,559
They won't obey orders of military
commanders from other places.

212
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,519
Wang Jialuo has only
over 30 men with him.

213
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,559
Can they really combat the local army
if it comes to a fight?

214
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,679
Men Sandao and Wang Jialuo
are working together.

215
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,840
No matter how cocky the Beiyang Army is,
they don't dare to attack the guards.

216
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,679
This is far away from the capital.

217
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,279
Anything can happen.

218
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,120
So what is your plan?

219
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,279
Frankly, I don't have one at the moment.

220
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,320
Because I cannot be certain

221
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,159
whether the Prajna inheritor
will appear or not.

222
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,320
Even if so, what's the difference?

223
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,039
Wang Jialuo doesn't have
the Dharma Seal.

224
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,360
So the seals still cannot be enough.

225
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,440
Yes, that's the only thing
that reassures me.

226
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,440
In the end,
no one will get the Altar Treasure.

227
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,930
(The fourth day of the fifth month,
3th year of Xuantong era,)

228
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,776
(seven days before Mangzhong)

229
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,279
Wine!

230
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,159
Self-brewed wine!

231
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,720
Mr. Zhuo, we have arrived.

232
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,320
This is the place.

233
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,240
Let's go.

234
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,080
Let's go.

235
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:54,080
(Ze Ze Inn)

236
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,480
Huang Xing, here is the money
for rooms and meals for these days.

237
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,720
Go and deliver it to the innkeeper.

238
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,320
Okay.

239
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,840
Huanjie.

240
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,799
I still haven't spent
all the money you gave me.

241
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:12,440
I gathered information these two days.
It didn't cost me a lot.

242
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,360
Okay.

243
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Ms. Huo, have the poisonous insects
been affected?

244
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,919
More or less.

245
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,600
Their sense of smell
is easily disturbed.

246
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,519
What's the matter?

247
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,000
Haven't you smelled it? A strong scent
of wine is permeating here.

248
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,320
You are right.

249
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,919
Men Sandao arrived before us.

250
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,720
He knew we would probably
use poisonous insects for defense.

251
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,919
So he made the smell of wine everywhere.

252
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,679
He really is cautious.

253
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,360
This bad guy.

254
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,879
Bufan, you stay here.
I'll take a look around.

255
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,440
We have just arrived. Rest for a while.

256
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,120
I can't. Someone has to check around.

257
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,240
Check if there are any ambushes.

258
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,680
The guards from Department
and Wang Jialuo's men.

259
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,279
Alright then. Do you need anyone else
to go with you?

260
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,519
No need, I can do it myself. Look at me!

261
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,279
I didn't look like someone from Lingxi.
So it's more convenient.

262
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,839
Stay here. I'll take my leave, Ms. Huo.

263
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,839
Be careful.

264
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,519
I will.

265
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,400
Bufan, your injuries
are almost healed, right?

266
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,400
They are already healed.

267
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,000
Fortunately, we have not been
traveling fast these days.

268
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
And we have been staying at inns
every night.

269
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,839
There was enough time
for you to recover.

270
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,960
Otherwise, I would keep worrying.

271
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,119
Rest assured, I've already recovered.

272
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,799
I just wrapped the sword a few days ago.

273
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,880
It's such an important day,
but you won't let me get you a new one.

274
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,119
This is the least I can do.

275
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,160
There might be a fierce battle
the day after tomorrow.

276
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,720
Perhaps there won't be a battle.

277
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,880
Right. Perhaps there won't be a battle
even if the Prajna inheritor shows up.

278
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,759
Things have already come this way.

279
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,319
Everyone is thinking about
how to gain the most benefit,

280
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,359
but not risk their lives.

281
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,400
That's right.
The Altar Treasure is so huge.

282
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,640
Everyone gets a share.

283
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,279
Then everyone is happy.

284
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,519
Yes, I'll take care of it later.

285
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,240
Greetings, general.

286
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,640
He is one of us. Feel free to speak.

287
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:00,928
Okay. I just moved into Ze Ze Inn today.

288
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,119
And I found an excuse to leave
and came to see you.

289
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,000
For what?

290
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,200
Telling me that you've moved in?

291
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,440
Why bother?

292
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,119
My duty is to keep you informed
of the people from Rongtian Ridge.

293
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,279
Perfect timing. There are three things
I want to ask you.

294
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,359
When the thirty-year pact is up,
how likely will Zhuo get all the seals?

295
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,839
Given the current situation,

296
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,039
the guards don't have the upper hand
against our Rongtian Ridge.

297
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,599
Although Men Sandao is a master,

298
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,920
Zhuo Bufan could suppress him
in their previous two encounters.

299
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,440
If Zhuo Bufan puts in his full effort,
Men Sandao stands no chance.

300
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,000
Is Zhuo Bufan really that good?

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
To be fair, his swordsmanship is indeed
at the pinnacle.

302
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,359
Go on.

303
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes.

304
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,920
Wang Jialuo is quite persistent.

305
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,200
But he is average.

306
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,799
He has guns,
but they belong to the Beiyang Army.

307
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,960
He could be a threat before.

308
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,359
But general, now that you are here.
He can only listen to your order.

309
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,599
His guns belong to
the Beiyang 43rd Association.

310
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,640
Since I am here,
of course I will take control.

311
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,519
Indeed. Wang Jialuo is just a nobody.

312
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,200
And some Japanese are also here.
But don't worry.

313
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
They couldn't possibly
defeat Zhuo Bufan.

314
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,519
Does that mean he is holding a sure win?

315
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,640
As long as all the seals appear,

316
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,200
Zhuo Bufan is capable
of taking them all.

317
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,799
But it won't be easy.
It will certainly be a tough battle.

318
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,680
Could there be something unexpected?

319
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:53,920
Something unexpected? Do you mean
the mysterious Prajna inheritor?

320
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,000
It's indeed hard to say.
No one has ever seen that person.

321
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,839
What I mean is whether Zhuo Bufan
will make another choice.

322
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,079
General, I have thought about this.
I think he will.

323
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,068
Is he greedy?

324
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,184
Just the opposite.

325
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,440
That's exactly why something unexpected
might happen.

326
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:27,119
General, the Altar Treasure must be
a significant fortune for you, right?

327
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,960
Of course.

328
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,640
But Zhuo Bufan doesn't think this way.

329
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,400
What he cares about are
the kung fu essentials hidden in it.

330
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,079
Prince Qi agreed to give them to him
without any hesitation.

331
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,440
He didn't care about those books at all.

332
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,440
General, do you care about those books?

333
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,519
I have guns. Can they dodge bullets?

334
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,960
Exactly.
Zhuo Bufan asked for too little.

335
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,680
Prince Qi promised him those books.
So can you.

336
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,799
The Imperial Household Department
obviously even cares less about that.

337
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,039
If that's the case,
he could totally turn his back on you.

338
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,000
General, what would you like me to do?

339
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,400
Leave now.
I need to talk to General Zhong.

340
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,960
No problem.
General, I will wait outside.

341
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,960
Obviously, Zhuo Bufan is unreliable now.

342
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,680
Prince Qi actually
made such an important move

343
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,279
by relying on such a minor swordsman.

344
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,456
I don't know if he is daring

345
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:58,480
or too careless.

346
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,200
At the beginning, Prince Qi

347
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,920
thought Zhuo Bufan and his people
would surely find the treasure.

348
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
It's just that some people got involved.

349
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,776
Who would know

350
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,920
the Department
released a death row prisoner

351
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,848
imprisoned for 12 years.

352
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,279
And who would have thought

353
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,160
that a menial Daugu County constable
would be so persistent.

354
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,480
If these two people weren't involved,

355
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,839
Zhuo Bufan might have already
obtained the secret treasure.

356
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,319
Nothing is totally predictable.

357
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,799
If we cannot take these uncertainties
into consideration,

358
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,279
then how can it still
be called a strategy?

359
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,960
General Zhong, why do you think
that what Prince Qi did was not wrong?

360
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,960
Right. I understand.

361
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Because you don't want to speak ill
of your father-in-law, right?

362
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,359
I am an objective person.

363
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,552
I won't make incorrect choices
because of emotions.

364
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,799
Just like I am always aware

365
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,096
that I am a general
of the Beiyang Army first.

366
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,519
Then I am Prince Qi's son-in-law.

367
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,960
I said that Prince Qi was very confident
at the beginning.

368
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,079
But that was just the beginning.

369
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,240
If he could foresee
things would go this way,

370
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,319
then he shouldn't have done that.

371
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,839
So, in your opinion, what should we do?

372
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,160
Let me handle it. Handing it over
to Beiyang Army is the safest.

373
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,119
Your father-in-law may not
want you to be involved.

374
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,200
It's not that he doesn't want to,
but it's that he doesn't dare.

375
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,279
We agreed to support Prince Qi

376
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,240
because we wanted to
use him to stage a coup,

377
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,519
and then control the cabinet after that.

378
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,960
And now, what Prince Qi did

379
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,480
has already shown that after the coup,

380
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,359
he wanted to control the Beiyang Army.

381
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,279
You don't trust your father-in-law.

382
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,039
It looks like
he doesn't trust you either.

383
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,480
You don't trust me either, right?

384
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,960
You have come here from the capital.

385
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,160
I presume you want to see
if I am loyal to you.

386
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,559
General Zhong, I've long said
that you are a pillar of Beiyang Army.

387
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,519
While in the capital, I had already
commanded Yu Huanjie to serve me

388
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,880
and no longer to report to Prince Qi.

389
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,839
Now every move of Rongtian Ridge
is under my control.

390
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,680
If Zhuo Bufan gets the seals,
the seals will be ours.

391
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,240
If Zhuo Bufan fails
and Wang Jialuo gets them,

392
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,720
the result will be the same.

393
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,400
If Men Sandao has them,
we will kill him.

394
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,400
No one has to win
when it comes to the thirty-year pact.

395
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,720
But if someone is winning,
it must be us.

396
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,799
General Zhong, it's really lucky
for Beiyang Army to have you.

397
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,799
Since you are here,

398
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,680
I can leave with peace of mind.

399
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,119
Mr. Xie, don't flatter me.
I always know my place.

400
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,759
Get Yu Huanjie here.
I have something to say.

401
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,440
Sir, Zhuo Bufan and his people
from Rongtian Ridge are here.

402
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,200
Today is already the fourth day.
Of course, they are here.

403
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,680
You woke me up just for this?

404
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,200
No, sir.

405
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,680
Get lost. I want to sleep.

406
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,480
Sir, what do we do today then?

407
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,519
Weren't you drunk last night?

408
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,079
Yes.

409
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,880
Do you have a headache?

410
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,440
A little.

411
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,128
Then go back to sleep.
There's nothing to do today.

412
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
What about the others?

413
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,720
Do anything they want.
It's a day off today.

414
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:48,068
(Ze Ze Inn)

415
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,920
They haven't woken up yet.

416
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,880
You all drank too much last night.

417
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,240
But I am really impressed
that they are still sleeping.

418
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,559
Mr. Muqing is really broad-minded.

419
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,160
The thirty-year pact is imminent,
and yet he can still be so relaxed.

420
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,000
I think
there's nothing wrong about that.

421
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,680
After all, we will find out soon.

422
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,519
There's nothing much to do now,
so relaxing a little doesn't hurt.

423
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,160
This pork zongzi is really delicious.

424
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,119
I'm happy you like it.

425
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,400
Jialuo, once things are settled,
we can go back to Dagu, right?

426
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,079
Yes, but no need to hurry.

427
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,440
We've been here
for quite a few days anyway.

428
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,960
I will go with you
anywhere you want to go.

429
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,039
I don't have a family now.

430
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,319
You are my only family.

431
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,799
Wherever you go, I will follow you.

432
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,480
Whether you visit here
or go back to Dagu,

433
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,400
I'm willing to go with you.

434
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,279
Things are finally coming to an end.
It's so good.

435
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,240
It's not over yet. I haven't caught
Zhuo Bufan and Yu Huanjie,

436
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
or obtained the secret treasure.

437
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,079
Only when these are settled
will it truly be over.

438
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,359
Besides, I need to let your family
rest in peace.

439
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
I want nothing else.

440
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,559
I just want to be with you
and live a simple life.

441
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,319
We will. I want to be with you too.

442
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:03,079
Sei I Shinpu? What is she here for?
Let her in.

443
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,640
Yes.

444
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:12,240
Alright, I've finished eating.
I will leave first.

445
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,079
Then let me see you out.

446
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,559
No need, you've got a guest.

447
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,759
Ask someone to tidy the table then
before meeting her.

448
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,079
Okay.

449
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,279
Tieguanyin tea can be found
everywhere in Fujian.

450
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,160
You gave me a package of that.

451
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,119
To be honest,
it's not a surprising gift.

452
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,880
Alright, so much for pleasantries.
Now let's talk business.

453
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,832
Who do you hope
to obtain the secret treasure?

454
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,119
What do you mean?

455
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,920
I know Zhuo Bufan
is working for Prince Qi.

456
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,720
General Zhong, do you want him
to obtain the secret treasure?

457
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,559
You've said
he is working for my father-in-law.

458
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,000
I surely don't want him to fail.

459
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,880
If he succeeds,
what benefits do you have?

460
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,160
And what benefit do I have if he fails?

461
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,240
General Zhong, to be frank,
I'll share a secret with you.

462
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,119
There is an agreement
between us and Prince Qi.

463
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,200
He initiates a coup.

464
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,640
And we, the Japanese side,
after his coup succeeds,

465
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,108
will help him establish
and consolidate his leadership.

466
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:40,192
In exchange,

467
00:30:40,192 --> 00:30:43,960
we gain the right to transportation,
trade, and mining in the Northeast.

468
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,160
It seems this is
too much of an exchange.

469
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,519
Compared to an entire country,
a region counts for nothing.

470
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,960
But only with the help of our Japanese,

471
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,839
can he possibly manage
to restrain Beiyang Army.

472
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,799
General Zhong.

473
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,904
You don't know about this agreement
between us and Prince Qi, right?

474
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,279
After all,
you are a general of the Beiyang Army.

475
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,960
I don't think
you can restrain the Beiyang Army.

476
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,160
You are confident and arrogant,
but you lack self-reflection.

477
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,160
It's pretty clear that we are stronger
than Beiyang Army.

478
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,920
Just say what you really want to say,
and don't beat around the bush.

479
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:34,359
What I want to say is
Zhuo Bufan won't get secret treasure.

480
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,039
Or he won't
hand it over to you or Prince Qi.

481
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,920
Wang Jialuo and Men Sandao
have already teamed up.

482
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,440
What Prince Qi can give to Zhuo Bufan,
they can provide just the same.

483
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,880
If I were Zhuo Bufan, I would choose
to make a deal with them.

484
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,880
You've forgotten that Wang Jialuo 's
guns belong to Beiyang Army.

485
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,799
Will the Fujian garrison command
the 43rd Association of Beiyang Army?

486
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,839
You can't command them.

487
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,319
Then let the Department take it.
It still belongs to the court.

488
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,839
General Zhong, do you really think so?

489
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,400
As far as I know,
that is a great treasure.

490
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,240
It could even revive the royal family.

491
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,160
Is it really
what the Beiyang Army wants?

492
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,839
What we want less is letting you get it.

493
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,319
You just said the chance is slim.
You were wrong.

494
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,519
Sei I Shinpu, as long as I am here,
you can rest assured.

495
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,039
You stand no chance
to obtain the treasure.

496
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,160
General Zhong, I've looked into you.

497
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,240
I am well aware
you are extremely intelligent.

498
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,864
So I believe you know
how to gain the best benefit.

499
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,160
How about you hear me out
and see if we are on the same page.

500
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,519
This meat-stuffed bun is so good.

501
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,079
Yeah, that stewed duck with ginger
we just had was good too.

502
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,319
But I'm a bit not used to that jelly
made from earth bamboo.

503
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,440
We are in a new place and we have to try
the local specialties.

504
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,799
You are right, Mr. Muqing.

505
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:12,039
Ze Ze Inn is right there.

506
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,720
After this road is sealed off,
then basically no one can get out.

507
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,880
The Japanese will be staying at this inn
when the time comes.

508
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,920
They wouldn't dare
to enter Ze Ze Inn openly.

509
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,599
Then should we...

510
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,920
No. Sei I Shinpu is not important.

511
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,279
Not important?
Then what are they doing in Quanzhou?

512
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,599
Maybe they just
have nothing better to do.

513
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:45,559
You think so? Are you still not sober?

514
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,559
What she wants the most
is that no one gets the secret treasure.

515
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,000
If I get it,
it's beneficial for the court.

516
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,039
If Beiyang Army gets it,

517
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,720
although the court can't command them,
it doesn't hurt.

518
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,480
If you get it, well,
you can't get it anyway.

519
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:02,279
Even if you manage to get it,
it won't benefit the Japanese.

520
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,440
So stirring up trouble
is her ultimate goal.

521
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,039
Hasn't she been causing trouble
all along for the past 40 days?

522
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,239
You're not scared, are you?

523
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,760
Her intelligence capability
does give me some concern.

524
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,719
No matter what I do, what Wang Jialuo
or Zhuo Bufan does,

525
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,159
she seems to know
within the shortest time.

526
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Someone in the imperial yamen
is tipping her off.

527
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,400
It shouldn't be, but she has followed me
quite a few times.

528
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,688
What about Rongtian Ridge?

529
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,320
They are all from Lingxi,

530
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,760
and they are all disciples.
It's unlikely there will be traitors.

531
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,199
But their lives are really too hard.

532
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,280
It makes sense
that one or two might defect.

533
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,400
Wang Jialuo definitely won't.
He's just one man.

534
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,880
There's something wrong with his wife.

535
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,800
She is quite pretty
and doesn't look poor.

536
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,199
Why has she been following Wang Jialuo
since the crime happened?

537
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,840
Is it because he is handsome,
or because he is powerful and wealthy?

538
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,719
There are certainly stupid women,
but she can't be that stupid.

539
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,360
She didn't drink much last night.

540
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:09,360
Then she disappeared.

541
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,960
If she truly loved Wang Jialuo,

542
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,199
would she just leave him there
and go to sleep?

543
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,880
Anyway, I couldn't believe it.

544
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,519
Then why don't you tell Wang Jialuo?

545
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,000
I have no evidence, and he won't
believe me even if I tell him.

546
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,880
He's just obstinate. Just let him be.

547
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,960
Even if that woman
was sent by Sei I Shinpu,

548
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,599
what can she do?

549
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
What does she
need all that intelligence for?

550
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,599
What bothers me the most is
she might think of what I have in mind.

551
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,599
What is that?

552
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,599
To make a deal with Zhong Haichao.

553
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,360
Zhong Haichao? What kind of deal?

554
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,880
You are so dumb as a reformist.

555
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,320
Seriously. What do you mean by that?

556
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,199
Sei I Shinpu is Japanese.

557
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,239
You said that the Japanese
want no one to find the treasure.

558
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,880
Zhong Haichao is a general of Beiyang
Army and a prince's son-in-law.

559
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,760
Then he surely
hopes to find the treasure.

560
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,320
How can there be a deal
when their interests are not aligned?

561
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,039
You said Zhong Haichao is a general
and a prince's son-in-law as well.

562
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,639
What's the difference?

563
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,320
It is different. Prince Qi's coup
requires the support of Beiyang Army.

564
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,280
They support him
because they want benefits.

565
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,639
And these benefits are something
that Prince Qi cannot provide.

566
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,280
If he cannot provide them,
he has to offer power.

567
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,800
If Prince Qi had less power,

568
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,039
then his coup would be worthless.

569
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,880
Prince Qi has to find the Altar Treasure
if he wants to guard his position.

570
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,239
The secret treasure is the benefit.

571
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,800
Prince Qi wants to regain his power
with the secret treasure.

572
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,400
So, it will lead to
completely different outcomes

573
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,480
for Prince Qi or the Beiyang Army

574
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,239
to obtain the Altar Treasure.

575
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:45,280
If you were Zhong Haichao,

576
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
wouldn't you figure out
what's the best for you?

577
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,400
I can't figure it out.

578
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,079
I think so too.

579
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,320
This one is sweet.

580
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,840
The Altar Treasure is a key to success.

581
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,440
I've said that I hope nobody gets it.

582
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,119
If someone must get it,

583
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,599
it would be better for you to get it,
rather than the Department or Prince Qi.

584
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,599
Why?

585
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,159
Because there are too many factions
in the Beiyang Army.

586
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,840
There are so many commanders.
Who will be in charge?

587
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,840
You might turn against each other
because of the secret treasure.

588
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,840
It's surely a good thing for us.

589
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,559
You don't object to me.
Then I will take that as consent.

590
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,559
Under this situation,

591
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:57,599
you can choose to cooperate with me.

592
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,159
This is all just your speculation.

593
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,199
How can you be so sure that Sei I Shinpu
will cooperate with Zhong Haichao?

594
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,800
I, Wang Jialuo, and Zhuo Bufan
are all here in Quanzhou.

595
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,559
She can't be absent.

596
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:12,119
I've even picked out
the most suitable residence for her.

597
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,679
The inn on the street corner.

598
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,360
But she and her people
haven't moved in yet.

599
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,079
She knows
she can't pull this off by herself.

600
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,960
All she can do is to keep an eye on us
but can't interfere.

601
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,159
So she has to strike a deal
with Zhong Haichao.

602
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,360
Otherwise, she can't fight against us.

603
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,599
If I am right,

604
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,360
by tomorrow night at the latest,
she and her people will enter that inn.

605
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,944
That would mean she and Zhong Haichao
have already made a deal.

606
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,360
What deal?

607
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,840
About how to fight against us.

608
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,360
They let us handle the thirty-year pact.

609
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,639
But once the seals are all collected,
they will wipe us out.

610
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,000
Zhong Haichao isn't suitable
to handle this openly.

611
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,679
So Sei I Shinpu
is the perfect person to do it.

612
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,639
Then why did you say
she isn't important?

613
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,960
She isn't important.

614
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,559
But if she has Zhong Haichao's support,
that will be different.

615
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,360
Zhong Haichao has sufficient guns.

616
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,360
If your prediction is right,
doesn't that mean you will die?

617
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,679
Fortunately, I see what's coming.
Otherwise, I might die.

618
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,320
There are people from the Department
and the 43rd Association.

619
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,840
I definitely cannot show up myself.

620
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:32,480
All I can ensure is
that no one will get in your way.

621
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,679
On the sixth day, if Prajna inheritor
shows up as scheduled,

622
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,679
you can take him down directly,

623
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,079
and then kill Men Sandao,
Wang Jialuo and Zhuo Bufan.

624
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,719
I will also keep my promise

625
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,808
of handing over two of the seals to you.

626
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,639
We, the Japanese,
will keep the other two.

627
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,880
Good.

628
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,368
None of us will obtain the treasure.
But we both have it in control.

629
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,159
In the future,
we can collaborate further.

630
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,880
General Zhong,
becoming an ally with Japanese

631
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,679
will surely be to your benefit.

632
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,679
Then, I hope that you can
keep your promise.

633
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:19,320
In the future, I can always have access
to your intelligence network

634
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,639
and get the information I need.

635
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,800
My intelligence network
is the best in East Asia.

636
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,079
If it's wartime, its value is no less
than that of the secret treasure.

637
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,039
In this deal,
you are the biggest beneficiary.

638
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,920
Since it's a deal, it is on terms
acceptable to both parties.

639
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,679
You can't say who benefits more.

640
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:47,519
What will you do if the Prajna inheritor
does not show up as scheduled?

641
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,719
I won't spend too much time and effort
on one thing.

642
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,239
If the Prajna inheritor doesn't show up,

643
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,039
then the simplest way

644
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,880
is to annihilate them all,
leaving no troubles behind.

645
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,760
