1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,456
(Linqing, Shandong)

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,359
Muqing.

3
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,480
There's neither a village nor a shop
near here.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,519
Why have we stopped?

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,000
Isn't there a tea house here?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,480
Drink some tea and have some pastries.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,839
But we've just had lunch.

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,679
We only had lunch. We didn't drink tea.

9
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,480
Muqing.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,920
Don't we need to hurry to Shanghai?

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,479
No rush for the moment.

12
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,679
Waiter, bring two plates of pastries.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,439
Alright.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,079
Getai.

15
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,679
Be patient. It'll be just a moment.

16
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,719
Bufan.

17
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,960
Have you noticed it?

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,479
It's okay. I know.

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,320
What's up?

20
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,920
When we just left Tianjin,

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,159
we've already being watched.

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,719
Who could it be?

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,200
We'll know shortly.

24
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,319
What are you following us for?

25
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,290
=Heroes=

26
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,874
=Episode 4=

27
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,639
Japanese?

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,599
Sir.

29
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,680
How did you notice these people?

30
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,240
I noticed them when we left Tianjin.

31
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,680
At the end of the 3rd month,
beginning of the 4th month,

32
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
fish are all swimming north.

33
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
If they were truly fishermen,

34
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,680
why would they be fishing to the south?

35
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,400
No one knew about our trip south.

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,159
Everyone who knows is here.

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
It's impossible that the news leaked.

38
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,199
It seems they've been
secretly watching us from the start.

39
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,279
Speak.

40
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,319
Why are you following us?

41
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,600
Not talking, huh?

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,000
Huang Xing.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,720
Muqing.

44
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,040
Those are Japanese people.

45
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,680
What if they cause trouble
because of this?

46
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,279
I really want to see who will jump out.

47
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,439
Whoever jumps out

48
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,279
is their mastermind.

49
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,279
He stopped breathing.

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,639
It's the Japanese again.

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,199
Since it's a treasure map,

52
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,519
it's inevitable to attract attention.

53
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,680
Anyone could come for it.

54
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,199
How about

55
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,319
we change into
the Han people's clothing?

56
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,319
Then we won't attract much attention.

57
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,680
I would never wear such a thing.

58
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,959
You should know

59
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,519
the people I hate the most are those

60
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,399
who give us strange looks
because of our clothes.

61
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,319
That's why
I've been meticulously planning

62
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,600
to make our Sword Sect respected
by everyone in the world.

63
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,279
But if you want others to respect you,

64
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,079
you have to first respect yourself.

65
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,800
You are right.

66
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,279
Besides, the things you want to do,

67
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,480
no one can change them.

68
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
I know you mean well.

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
But given the current situation,

70
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,800
we have nothing to fear.

71
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,439
Take it slow.

72
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,839
Take your time.

73
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,279
Bro.

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Have you recently seen

75
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,040
someone dressed in Lingxi attire here?

76
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,120
No.

77
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,240
Then someone wearing clothes like mine?

78
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,800
Like yours?

79
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,079
No, no.

80
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,600
Then, is Linqing up ahead?

81
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,279
You'll have to walk
more than twenty li to get Linqing.

82
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,000
The sun is about to set.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,879
By the time you get there,
it will almost be dark.

84
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,920
Thank you.

85
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,480
Tang Yu.

86
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,439
Do you know the characters here?

87
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,079
He recognizes them.

88
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,680
He has studied when he was young.

89
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
Studied?

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,600
How to pronounce this character?

91
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,680
This is news.

92
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,319
Newspaper.

93
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,160
This paper talks all about news.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,959
News?

95
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,040
What is news?

96
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,720
It refers to fresh events.

97
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,800
It speaks of major events in the world.

98
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,040
What are the major events in the world?

99
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,399
There are many major events.

100
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,240
If I were to tell you,

101
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,439
I can't complete it in three days.

102
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,480
It's fine.

103
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,879
Just tell me a couple of things.

104
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,959
What do you want to know?

105
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,839
Which is the number one sect now?

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,439
Tongmenghui.

107
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Tongmenghui?

108
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,439
Why, can we not mention it yet?

109
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,600
This what "hui",

110
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
what kind of kung fu are they good at?

111
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,639
It's not kung fu they're known for.

112
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,439
It's reform.

113
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Reform?

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,560
This sounds like a deadly move.

115
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,120
It is not a move.

116
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,480
It's reform.

117
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,319
It's actually about changing the world.

118
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,959
Do you know who owns the world?

119
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,480
That must be...

120
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,920
Don't run, don't run!

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,399
Surely, it's the emperor's.

122
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,160
But Tongmenghui says the world
belongs to us,

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,959
to every common person.

124
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,519
Isn't this about rebelling?

125
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,439
It is indeed a rebellion.

126
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,560
Isn't it about rebelling?

127
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,639
Not just to change the emperor,

128
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,680
but rather, every commoner
being able to be their own master.

129
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,839
This is called democracy.

130
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,000
Achieving democracy is called reform.

131
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Got it?

132
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
Still don't understand.

133
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,120
So, this Tongmenghui,

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,120
is it orthodox?

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,000
Or is it unorthodox?

136
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
In the eyes of the imperial court,
they are unorthodox.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,399
But it is for the common people,

138
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,399
for the compatriots across the nation.

139
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,799
Therefore, they are orthodox.

140
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,960
If I want to join this Tongmenghui,

141
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,440
which master to look for?

142
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,279
What are you doing?

143
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,039
Do you want to switch a sect?

144
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,919
I'm just asking.

145
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,159
To join Tongmenghui, you don't need
to take a master

146
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,000
or leave the Rongtian Sword Sect.

147
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,360
Anyone can join.

148
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,600
This is called inclusiveness.

149
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,679
Tang Yu.

150
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,960
This Tongmenghui,

151
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,600
what is the name of the Sect Leader?

152
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,200
Sun Wen.

153
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,759
I've made up my mind.

154
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,039
When this matter is finished,

155
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,360
I need to tell the Sect Leader.

156
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,240
Revolution.

157
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,679
You are leaving?

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,039
Didn't the leader say
that once this matter is settled,

159
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,600
we can rebuild the headquarters?

160
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,200
You go and rebuild the headquarters.

161
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,399
I'll join the reform.

162
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm going to rebuild the nation.

163
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,039
I'll read it out to you.

164
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,360
Staking a hundred thousand
of our soldiers,

165
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:39,279
we must right the world
with our strength.

166
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,200
The heroic Qiu Jin of Tongmenghui

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,159
wrote the poem.

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
This poem states that

169
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,440
even if it takes the sacrifice
of a hundred thousand soldiers,

170
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,039
with their lives and blood,

171
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,320
we must right this upside-down world

172
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,679
with all our might.

173
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,120
I must copy down this poem

174
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,919
and remember it.

175
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Staking a hundred thousand
of our soldiers,

176
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,559
we must right the world
with our strength.

177
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,600
Staking a hundred thousand
of our soldiers,

178
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,480
we must right the world
with our strength.

179
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,360
Staking a hundred thousand
of our soldiers,

180
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,279
we must right the world
with our strength.

181
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,679
Let me have a look.

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,679
You've been looking at it for long.
Let me see it.

183
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,200
Get on the boat when we finish eating.

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,120
We won't rest tonight.

185
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,000
We'll travel all night.

186
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,399
Sir, here is your change.

187
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,320
Sir,

188
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,039
in the past couple of days,
have you seen

189
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
someone dressed in the Lingxi style

190
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,039
or with a Lingxi accent?

191
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,639
Yes, yes.

192
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,279
There were three or four young men,

193
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,840
dressed in student attire,

194
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
speaking in Lingxi dialect.

195
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,519
They were sitting right here just now.

196
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,879
Do you know
what they were talking about?

197
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,279
I didn't really catch that.

198
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,639
Where did they go?

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,720
They asked me about heading south,

200
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,200
looking for an affordable inn.

201
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,879
I directed them to the inn for carters
on the south outskirts of Linqing.

202
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,879
Thank you.

203
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,360
Three or four people?
It doesn't quite add up.

204
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,279
If I were Zhuo Bufan,

205
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,080
I would instruct my disciples
to go separate ways.

206
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,720
It has just darkened,

207
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,919
how come everyone is already asleep?

208
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,000
Those who can stay at inns for carters

209
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,960
are all the hardworking folks
from the docks.

210
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,960
As night falls, naturally,
they lay down to sleep.

211
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,240
We don't even know if they are inside,

212
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,320
Shall we apprehend everyone
for investigation?

213
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,360
The persons we're looking for
are right inside.

214
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,120
How do you know?

215
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
Those few pairs of shoes
on the floor to the left.

216
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,399
The big communal beds are not like
the ones at home or in an inn.

217
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,159
Everyone has to climb up.

218
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,120
Ordinary people getting on it,

219
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,159
usually have their shoe tips
pointing inwards.

220
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,480
But those few people have them
pointing outwards.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,360
It's a habit only those
who roam the jianghu would have.

222
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,000
So?

223
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,039
Take action.

224
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,759
Apprehend them all.

225
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,159
Go!

226
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,080
Get out!

227
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,640
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

228
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,919
You are that constable
from Dagu County Yamen,

229
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,679
Wang Jialuo.

230
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,240
Weren't you killed by me?

231
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,759
As long as you can't kill me,

232
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,559
I will certainly bring you to justice.

233
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,960
Want to catch me?

234
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,480
You don't have the ability.

235
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,319
The constable of Dagu County Yamen,
Wang Jialuo?

236
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,160
Exactly.

237
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,480
This person was killed by you?

238
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,000
This person is a murderer.

239
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,559
According Article 4 of Statute 289

240
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,000
in the Homicide section
of the Qing Code,

241
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,519
someone who kills with poison should

242
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,160
be beheaded.

243
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,640
You executed him without trial.

244
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,319
According to Article 4 of Statute 389
regarding apprehension of fugitives

245
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,759
in the Qing Code,

246
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:31,039
any murderer, thief, and the ringleader
who doesn't kill,

247
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,200
if captured after escape,

248
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,920
shall be beheaded on the spot.

249
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,319
You've certainly
memorized the Code quite well.

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
As an official of the Qing Dynasty,

251
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,599
knowing the Code well is my duty.

252
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,799
But do you know

253
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,920
that you killed him
before I could even conduct a trial?

254
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
When you caused Chen Wu to die at Gegu,

255
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,079
I hadn't interrogated him either.

256
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,079
Okay.

257
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,319
If you say so,

258
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,839
then we are even.

259
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,319
Handle cases impartially.

260
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,039
No saying of being even
in official matters.

261
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,400
I haven't blamed you
for causing trouble.

262
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,640
Yet, you insist on pestering me.

263
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,240
I'm conducting the investigation.

264
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,640
How have I meddled in yours?

265
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,839
And how have I been pestering?

266
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,599
Young constable.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
I don't want to waste words with you.

268
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,240
Get back to Dagu.

269
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,079
Don't interfere with our cases.

270
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,000
You can't handle this case.

271
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,680
Human lives prioritize,
let alone nine lives.

272
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,640
No one can bear it.

273
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,039
That's why I must investigate
to the end.

274
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,000
Have a look.

275
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,400
Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

276
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,920
Have you seen it clearly?

277
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,799
Yes.

278
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,400
If you've seen it clearly, get lost.

279
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,640
That tablet only states
second-class guard

280
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,799
of the Imperial Household Department.

281
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,680
Why should I leave?

282
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,279
I'm ordering you to get back to Dagu.

283
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,039
Dagu acts on orders of Zhili Prefecture,

284
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,559
which acts on orders
of Shuntian Prefecture.

285
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,720
The Ministry of Justice
is responsible for investigations.

286
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,519
It's never the Imperial Household
Department's place to give orders.

287
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,640
We handle cases.

288
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,799
Since when does it become

289
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,359
a minor official's turn
to ask questions?

290
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,559
Sir.

291
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,559
You are a fourth-rank imperial guard.

292
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,240
But even if your rank is sky-high
compared to mine,

293
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
you can't issue orders
beyond your authority.

294
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,559
I address you as "Sir".

295
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,559
But addressing is one thing,
taking orders is another.

296
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,519
Sir, you are right.

297
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,559
We bunch of minor officials

298
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,559
don't even dare to ask questions.

299
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,359
How could we dare to defy the Qing Code?

300
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,440
You, as a local constable
from Dagu County Yamen

301
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,960
why does it count to coming to Linqing?

302
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,279
Pursuing criminals across provinces.

303
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,680
According to the pursuit and arrest
section...

304
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,759
All right, all right.

305
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,119
Stop harping on about the Code to me.

306
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,279
Wang Jialuo.

307
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,680
I'm telling you.

308
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,160
This case has been taken over
by the Imperial Household Department.

309
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,680
No other yamens may interfere.

310
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,519
What are you doing?

311
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,039
Documents of Ministry of Justice.

312
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,519
How would I have their documents?

313
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,599
How could you not have them?

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,440
If you want local yamens to avoid,

315
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
you must carry the documents with you.

316
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,000
I...

317
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,319
I'm telling you.

318
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,720
The order has been issued.

319
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,640
If you don't believe,

320
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,880
return to Dagu County Yamen to check.

321
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,440
I will go back and check.

322
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,000
But sir,

323
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,240
if the Ministry of Justice truly issued
this document,

324
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,839
and you don't carry it on you,

325
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,920
it would be dereliction.

326
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,960
If the Ministry of Justice never issued
such a document,

327
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,240
and you, as a fourth-rank
imperial guard, proclaim so,

328
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,279
it would be deception.

329
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,440
Either of the two

330
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,640
has already violated the Qing Code.

331
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,440
You're insistent on making trouble
with me.

332
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm not here to make trouble,

333
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,599
but to investigate the case justly.

334
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,519
Look at you,

335
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,240
dressed like this as an official.

336
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,079
What a disgrace.

337
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Sir, you've overspoken.

338
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,160
I'm merely a lowly constable,

339
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,200
not prominent, nor a mandarin

340
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,920
appointed by the imperial court.

341
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,359
This attire

342
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,079
indeed has many improprieties.

343
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
Because I've been chasing criminals
for days,

344
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,680
and the uniform is already tattered
beyond repair.

345
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,759
I just casually bought something cheap,

346
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,599
to make do.

347
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,160
You, a local constable,

348
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,079
are also considered loyal
in serving the imperial court.

349
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,079
The money is a reward for you.

350
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,039
Take my advice.

351
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,359
Go back to Dagu.

352
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
You can't handle this case.

353
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,640
Nor should you.

354
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
What is this for?

355
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,000
This is the key to my house door.

356
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,119
I left the house in a hurry.

357
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm running short on travel expenses.

358
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,079
These ten taels of silver

359
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,279
can be considered as official funds
which I borrowed.

360
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,839
It will certainly be repaid
by Dagu County Yamen in the future.

361
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,839
You won't return to Dagu?
Will you still pursue it?

362
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,720
There hasn't been an unresolved case
in Dagu.

363
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,799
I must continue the investigation.

364
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,880
I cannot give up halfway.

365
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,400
Fine.

366
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,599
As you please.

367
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,720
If you're bent on seeking death,
why should I care?

368
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,400
Nine sets of clothes.

369
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,400
The 1st day of the 4th month.

370
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,920
Menxing Hotel in the northern
suburbs of Shanghai.

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,720
(Staking a hundred thousand
of our soldiers,)

372
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,039
(we must right the world
with our strength.)

373
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,319
Muqing.

374
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,839
They have confessed.

375
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
They are indeed disciples
of Rongtian Ridge.

376
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,920
The nine people from the Dagu Inn

377
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,720
were also indeed killed
by Rongtian Ridge.

378
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,599
But those two insist
they did not take part.

379
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,319
The case of the nine lives
is not important.

380
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,400
They also confessed that

381
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,160
the Sect Leader of Rongtian Ridge,
Zhuo Bufan,

382
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,400
ordered his subordinates
to head to Shanghai separately.

383
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,640
The one leading them on this route
was called Tang Yu,

384
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,400
the one who was killed
while trying to escape.

385
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,599
Do they know

386
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,559
what they are supposed to do
and where in Shanghai?

387
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,119
They only know they need
to go to Shanghai.

388
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,119
Even the meeting place

389
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,880
was known only by that Tang Yu.

390
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,839
However, one of them said

391
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,559
that he accidentally

392
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,240
overheard other disciples chatting,

393
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,039
mentioning Maiqi Road
in the French Concession.

394
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,920
And it seemed they mentioned
the 3rd day of the 4th month.

395
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,079
The 3rd day of the 4th month.

396
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
Maiqi Road in the French Concession.

397
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,759
Muqing.

398
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,160
Could it be the place and the time

399
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,039
of meeting with Tan Xian?

400
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,079
Is Zhuo Bufan acting on behalf of
Prince Qi?

401
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:55,839
I have tested that.

402
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,079
They truly do not know.

403
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,759
Inside their luggage,

404
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,279
there are a few sets
of Western-style clothes.

405
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,559
It actually looks like

406
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,119
the attire of the Tongmenghui.

407
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,079
Zhuo Bufan is to meet with Tan Xian.

408
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,240
He'll appear in Shanghai posing as
a Tongmenghui member.

409
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,599
The 3rd day of the 4th month is

410
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,240
just three days away.

411
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,279
Muqing.

412
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,079
We will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.

413
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,799
Hurry to investigate and prepare.

414
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,079
There should still be time.

415
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,960
Have you heard about it?

416
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,759
The Imperial Household Department

417
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,799
has someone from
the Infantry Commander Yamen Prison,

418
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,920
who was jailed for twelve years,

419
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,759
the former imperial guard
known as Men Sandao,

420
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:39,920
pardoned and released.

421
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:47,960
I really don't know.

422
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,319
How would I know such things?

423
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,200
But you haven't forgotten this person,
have you?

424
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,279
Thinking back,

425
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,359
you and Men Sandao had a deep rapport.

426
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,319
Even the late emperor intended
to bring you two together.

427
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:05,799
Now,

428
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,039
Men Sandao has already been pardoned
and released,

429
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,319
and returned to
Imperial Household Department.

430
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,200
Currently he's leading
the imperial guards

431
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,039
on an assignment outside.

432
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,559
The events of the past
are long forgotten.

433
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,759
And I don't want to mention them.

434
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,880
Why not mention it?

435
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,759
I still want to talk to you more
about Men Sandao.

436
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
What's there to talk about?

437
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:37,799
I'm tired.

438
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,640
I've booked a train compartment for you.

439
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,680
You can set off for Shanghai tomorrow.

440
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,039
I am really tired.

441
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,839
In my life,

442
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,799
being able to marry you

443
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,920
would leave no regrets.

444
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,480
Rest assured.

445
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,240
I will definitely treat you well
in the future.

446
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,359
From now on,

447
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,000
whatever you want,
I will give it to you.

448
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,000
Whatever you want,

449
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,319
I will comply with your wishes.

450
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,680
Rest assured.

451
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,039
I definitely won't take concubines
or mistresses.

452
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,599
The last flowers in spring have been
blooming to the point of withering.

453
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,680
(The end is near.)

454
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,079
(The splendor and the unforgettable
will be gone.)

455
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,400
(Muqing.)

456
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,279
(Take care.)

457
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,599
You two have arrived.

458
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,319
Hong.

459
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,279
Take good care of them.

460
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,759
Commander.

461
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
What brings you here today, sir?

462
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,440
I've missed you so much.

463
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:50,720
Commander.

464
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:54,240
I've specifically found a beauty
for you,

465
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
just waiting for your arrival.

466
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,119
She's still a maiden.

467
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,400
Commander.

468
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,039
Who was it?

469
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,960
Was it in England?

470
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,799
Or Japan?

471
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,960
Was it during your studies abroad

472
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
that you were with someone?

473
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,440
Will you tell or not?

474
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:11,720
Who exactly was it?

475
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,640
Who exactly has been with you?

476
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,599
What sort of world is this?

477
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,559
What's the propriety, justice,
honesty and honor?

478
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,640
What's wrong with you?
Have you gone mute?

479
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,279
Speak!

480
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,519
Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

481
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,599
Was it him?

482
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,000
Was it Men Sandao?

483
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,799
You won't admit it, huh?

484
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,319
I will send someone to the prison
right now.

485
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,799
I'll have him tortured to death.

486
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:07,839
What's wrong?

487
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,079
Do you feel pity for him?

488
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,759
Are you scared?

489
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,519
I beg you. Please don't harm him.

490
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,079
Then tell me.

491
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:20,200
I'm willing to serve you well
from now on.

492
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,799
I will give you whatever you want.

493
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,839
Whatever you wish to do,

494
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,440
I will follow your will.

495
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,839
If you wish to take concubines or
mistresses in the future,

496
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,960
I will not interfere nor blame you.

497
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,480
I only beg you not to hurt others.

498
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,599
If it were not for official duties
that I'm entangled with,

499
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,799
I would have gone to Shanghai
with you and father.

500
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,799
It's okay. Do your business.

501
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,039
Enjoy yourself, too.

502
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,400
Come.

503
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,880
I'll return to the capital soon.

504
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
You and father should have returned
to the capital by then.

505
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,920
You like Tianjin snacks.

506
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,079
I'll bring some back for you.

507
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,160
Then when I am in Shanghai,

508
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,839
I'll also buy some new clothes for you.

509
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,160
As for western style clothes,

510
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,839
the styles from Shanghai are
somewhat better.

511
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay.

512
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,880
Let's go.

513
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,000
Come and look! Fresh vegetables!

514
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Take a look! Take a look!

515
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,079
Steamed buns.

516
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,559
Steamed buns.

517
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,720
Fresh fruits.

518
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,359
Hot steamed buns.

519
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,039
Potatoes, cheap potatoes!

520
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,279
Green vegetables,
fresh green vegetables!

521
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,039
Lin Anjing.

522
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,640
Why are you following me?

523
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,119
You followed me all the way

524
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,039
from Tianjin to here?

525
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,319
How did you manage to keep up?

526
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,440
I don't even know
how I managed to keep up.

527
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,440
You walked too fast.

528
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,640
I lost you several times along the way.

529
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,559
Luckily, I found you in the end.

530
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,400
Didn't we agree that

531
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,559
you wait for my message at Dagu?

532
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,880
I don't know anyone there.

533
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,319
I don't want to go to Dagu.

534
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,759
I want to investigate the case.

535
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,240
So you've been following me all along,

536
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,400
without coming directly to me?

537
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,720
I... I was afraid
you would send me away.

538
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,599
You are simply crazy.

539
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,000
Not to eat all day
and keep rushing on the road.

540
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,079
If it wasn't for your inquiries
everywhere,

541
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,559
I would have lost you long ago.

542
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,519
Have you had anything to eat?

543
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,319
Come with me.

544
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,599
Steamed buns. Hot steamed buns!

545
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,200
Boss.

546
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,119
One steamed bun.

547
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,079
Alright.

548
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,440
Vegetables here.

549
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,160
Miss Lin.

550
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,319
We have an agreement.

551
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,559
I'm pursuing a criminal investigation.

552
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,079
It's indeed inconvenient
to have you with me.

553
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,160
Next, I need to go to Shanghai.

554
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,799
Once we reach Shanghai.

555
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,440
You absolutely cannot follow me anymore.

556
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,000
Boss, another one, please.

557
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,960
Okay, right away.

558
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,360
Green onions.
Take a look at these green onions!

559
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,239
You should make your own plans.

560
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,000
Consider where to go afterwards.

561
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,199
Either going home

562
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,920
or going back to Japan is fine.

563
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,639
It's convenient to go anywhere
once in Shanghai.

564
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,079
Or,

565
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,000
I'll take you to the Shanghai yamen.

566
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,440
Miss Lin.

567
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,280
It's not that I don't care about you.

568
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,760
It's that I am alone.

569
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,280
It's dangerous for you to follow me.

570
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,880
How did your clothes get torn again?

571
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,039
I'll mend it for you
if I get the chance.

572
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,400
Let's go.

573
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,800
Are you heading to Shanghai next?

574
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,079
Then how did you know

575
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,960
that those murderers went to Shanghai?

576
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,679
What have you found out?

577
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,960
When I was in Linqing,

578
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,039
I caught up with that fugitive.

579
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,000
Then I got a ledger from him.

580
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,440
Sei I Shinpu?

581
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,400
Japanese?

582
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:03,920
Let him in.

583
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:04,800
Yes.

584
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,440
General Zhong, hello.

585
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,320
Sei I Shinpu, from the Genyosha.

586
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:30,920
Zhong Haichao,

587
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,079
the Sixth Division of the Beiyang Army,

588
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,960
son-in-law of Prince Qi.

589
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,559
I've been wanting to visit you for long.

590
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,199
Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance.

591
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,920
It happens that we are
on official business in Tianjin.

592
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,800
From the 17th Division stationed
in North China,

593
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,519
the Colonel of the Third
Special Duty Brigade,

594
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,320
has also always been concerned
about China,

595
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,440
and he specifically instructed me
to pay you a visit.

596
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,000
You are too kind.

597
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:53,960
Please.

598
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,400
Have some tea.

599
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:51,960
The Lotus Sutra,

600
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,599
This sutra

601
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,920
is a small token of my regard for
General Zhong.

602
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,119
I hope the friendship between
Japan and China

603
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,559
will endure for a long time.

604
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,400
Now, in Shanghai,

605
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:14,079
foreigners are everywhere.

606
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,960
(Shanghai Yamen)
The Concessions are a few walks away.

607
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,800
As for me, the imperial inspector

608
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,519
actually is just a nominal title.

609
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,199
I have to look out for signals
from those above,

610
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,880
and consider the mood of the foreigners.

611
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,719
It's difficult to do my job.

612
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,760
I've come here this time
to handle a case.

613
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:30,800
Matters concerning you,

614
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,480
it must be a matter of importance.

615
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,960
So what do you need me to do?

616
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
Send people to thoroughly check
the hotels,

617
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,039
inns and restaurants.

618
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
I need to find Zhuo Bufan and
everyone from Rongtian Ridge.

619
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,280
What about inside the Concession?

620
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:44,960
Bro.

621
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,920
I'm here to investigate, not to kill.

622
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,440
Can we not even enter the Concession?

623
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,159
Understood.

624
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,719
Understood.

625
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,199
Then, I will make the arrangements now.

626
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,079
Buy some flowers, please.

627
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:17,360
(Shanghai, Menxing Hotel)
Flowers, flowers, flowers.

628
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,960
Qin Tuo.

629
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,239
Mr. Zhuo.

630
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,559
Ms. Huo.

631
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,840
It's been a tough trip.

632
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,559
You have arrived.

633
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,360
How is it? Has everyone arrived?

634
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,280
Tang Yu hasn't arrived yet.

635
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,199
I found it odd.

636
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,400
Tang Yu should have arrived before us.

637
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:34,760
That's right.

638
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,679
Tang Yu might have run into trouble.

639
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:39,760
What happened?

640
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:43,880
Qin Tuo.

641
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,719
Tell the fellow disciples to pack.

642
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,519
Let's leave immediately.

643
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,840
Leave? To where?

644
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,159
This place is no longer safe.

645
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,320
We'll discuss later.

646
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,519
Go.

647
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,119
Hope he's alright.

648
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,199
I hope so too.

649
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,880
Bufan.

650
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,159
Ms. Huo.

651
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,760
It's almost dark.

652
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,880
Where do you plan to go?

653
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,840
I haven't decided yet.

654
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,119
Let's set out first.

655
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,400
We finally made it to Shanghai.

656
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,400
Let's find a restaurant
in the Concession to taste

657
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,079
western cuisine.

658
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,199
Still considering a restaurant?

659
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,880
What time is it now?

660
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,000
You think it's too expensive?

661
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,079
That's not the case.

662
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,519
We can't be too conspicuous.

663
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,840
We need to be careful and cautious.

664
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,400
Then where do you suggest we go?

665
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,840
We can't just sleep on the streets.

666
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,199
Let's start walking and see.

667
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,079
Let's go.

668
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Come on.

669
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,119
Nothing has been missed.

670
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,639
Can't say that nothing has been missed.

671
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,719
But as for all sizes of inns,
restaurants and hotels,

672
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,559
I've inquired them all.

673
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:42,039
There's no trace of Zhuo Bufan
and Rongtian Ridge.

674
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,000
The suburban areas?

675
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,840
There are too many hotels and inns.
The suburbs are too far.

676
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,840
We're still inquiring.

677
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,400
However, Muqing,

678
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,079
to say something unpleasant,

679
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,880
this way of searching

680
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,159
might be a thankless task.

681
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:01,920
Indeed.

682
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,119
Muqing.

683
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,480
After all, you are the famous

684
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,639
top master in the imperial court.

685
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,920
Would you be afraid of that Zhuo Bufan?

686
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,039
There are rumors

687
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,880
that Zhuo Bufan's swordsmanship
is unrivaled.

688
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,960
I've also long heard of it.

689
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,119
I'd like to have a spar with

690
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,119
this extraordinary master.

691
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,119
But we currently have
an important mission.

692
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,679
We can't afford any mistakes.

693
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,000
If before the 3rd day of the 4th month,

694
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,119
we can find Zhuo Bufan

695
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,159
and capture him,

696
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:38,639
then we can go meet up with Tan Xian.

697
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,400
Otherwise,

698
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,840
in two days,

699
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,679
there will surely be a fierce battle.

700
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:51,920
Innkeeper.

701
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:52,960
A room, please.

702
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,320
Thank you.

703
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,079
Lin Anjing.

704
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,679
You'd better go up and rest.

705
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,960
What about you?

706
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,719
I'll just find a place to make do
for the night.

707
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,920
Here.

708
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,280
How can that be okay?

709
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,760
If it weren't for you,

710
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,079
I wouldn't stay at the inn.

711
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:20,920
You have a good rest.

712
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,079
I'll go have another look nearby.

713
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,960
I'll just find a place to crash
for the night.

714
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,039
I'll go with you.

715
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,719
Don't worry.

716
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,480
Listen to me. Go to sleep.

717
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,239
Then you must come back to find me.

718
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,440
Definitely.

719
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,599
If you don't come back for me,

720
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,079
I'll go to Shanghai to find you.

721
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Who are you people?

722
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,599
Wang Jialuo from the Dagu County Yamen.

723
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,239
Kill him.

724
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,000
Chase!

725
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:57,400
