1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,240
I sprinkled different powders
on the two of them.

2
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,920
It will attract
different kinds of insects.

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,039
The male insects follow the woman.

4
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,159
The female insects follow the man.

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,359
The woman already came out.

6
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,719
So Tan Xian is still in the hotel.

7
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,079
If that's the case,

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,000
now Tan Xian should be up there alone.

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,840
Go.

10
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,079
I'll wait here for someone.

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,880
Waiting for whom?

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,120
What's wrong, Muqing?

13
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,159
This is a deception.

14
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,319
I can't tell.

15
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,000
We have to be cautious.

16
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,120
Getai, you go ahead with others first.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,040
I'll go back to the hotel.

18
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:23,879
Okay.

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,120
This suit doesn't suit you.

20
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,879
How could I look good
in Japanese's clothes?

21
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,560
This official attire
suits you pretty well,

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,760
Mr. Zhuo.

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,799
How about you come
to the Imperial Household Department

24
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,079
and be my colleague?

25
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:34,202
=Heroes=

26
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:37,312
=Episode 7=

27
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,024
(At night, one o'clock,
telephone booth in the lobby.)

28
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,160
Men Sandao. you are really something.

29
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,759
I've heard
that your swordsmanship is unparalleled.

30
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,160
It's not wrong.

31
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,240
Well,

32
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,519
the Department released you

33
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,399
because you are the best they've got.

34
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,360
However,

35
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,360
I can see
that you have already done your best.

36
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,480
You haven't, though.

37
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,399
Your martial arts skills are good.

38
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,360
You can handle the sword
fast, accurate, and steady enough.

39
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,959
So within 60 moves, I cannot beat you.

40
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,360
But likewise, you cannot beat me.

41
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,879
But after 60 moves,

42
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,360
you can't think of new moves.

43
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,600
Therefore, with 100 moves at best,

44
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,360
you will lose.

45
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,800
You are truly a genius
that won other Sword Sects

46
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
in the Central Plains.

47
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,480
You're right.

48
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,319
Your swordsmanship is superior to mine.

49
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,600
But,

50
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,839
you might not beat me.

51
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,920
I still have a move unused.

52
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,000
One move?

53
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,920
You want to beat me with just one move?

54
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,160
I will risk my life.

55
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:06,839
Who is it?

56
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,120
Tan Xian.

57
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,360
Who are you?

58
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,519
What are you giving to Tongmenghui?

59
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,959
This insect is poisonous.

60
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,959
As long as it touches your skin,

61
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,480
you will be poisoned.

62
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,759
Hand over that thing
and I can spare your life.

63
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
And you won't have to suffer.

64
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,120
I'll tell you.

65
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,040
The thing I'm giving to the Tongmenghui

66
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,279
is in my

67
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,120
suitcase.

68
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,279
Suitcase.

69
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,799
What does it look like?

70
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,720
Answer me!

71
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,559
What?

72
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,200
This is the thing
I was about to hand over to Tongmenghui.

73
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,039
What a pity!

74
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,240
You will never get it now.

75
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,919
I will make you talk.

76
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,279
I believe you.

77
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,799
But,

78
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
you can't make a dead person talk.

79
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,480
You...

80
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,039
Tan Xian ran away from the hotel.

81
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,320
He disappeared in here.

82
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,720
How come?

83
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,399
People from the Department
and Rongtian Ridge chased after him.

84
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,960
But they didn't find him.

85
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,759
Bufan.

86
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,720
How is it?

87
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,639
The person who just ran out was a decoy.

88
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,279
Tan Xian was in the hotel,

89
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,320
but he was dead.

90
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
He was poisoned

91
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,799
and committed suicide.

92
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,639
There was a letter on the table.

93
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,320
I think

94
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
he was about to give it to Tongmenghui.

95
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,559
But it has already been burned.

96
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,000
Now we hit a dead end.

97
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:47,960
Men Sandao.

98
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,240
You heard her.

99
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,159
Do we still need to fight?

100
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,720
That letter

101
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,360
is what you wanted.

102
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,240
Chasing the stolen treasure map
of the Wenyuan Pavilion

103
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,159
is my mission
as a guard of the Department.

104
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,759
So you mean we still have to fight?

105
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,279
Even though you will lose?

106
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,360
Don't be too confident.

107
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,679
You might lose.

108
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,639
Tan Xian is already dead anyway.

109
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,919
I have nothing to rush about.

110
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,679
Let's finish this.

111
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,440
Your breath is already unsteady.

112
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,759
If you keep doing this,

113
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,879
you will only lose

114
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,960
and lose your life.

115
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,799
Then beat me and kill me.

116
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,879
I've said
that I didn't want to kill you.

117
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,679
Besides, you are an imperial guard.

118
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,200
I don't want to be
an enemy of the court.

119
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,919
Do you think that now

120
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,440
you're not an enemy of the court?

121
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,320
It will already get you executed

122
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,600
stealing treasure of Wenyuan Pavilion.

123
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,639
You're also suspected of being involved
in a rebellion.

124
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,879
I've chased you all the way
from Tianjin to here.

125
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,679
I won't wrong you.

126
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,600
Fine.

127
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,600
Since that's the case,

128
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,159
I will have to kill you.

129
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,080
Otherwise, you will not give up.

130
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,519
It's really annoying.

131
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,200
Let's go.

132
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,159
Go.

133
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,159
Muqing.

134
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,759
You guys stay here.

135
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,360
I will go find Tan Xian first.

136
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,279
Why is he dead?

137
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
You are the guards.

138
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,080
But it seems you did a bad job.

139
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
He is dead now.

140
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,399
And you even stand in our way?

141
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,320
Great. We all hit a dead end now.

142
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,399
You'd better think

143
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,720
about how to explain to your boss.

144
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,759
We are safe now.

145
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,639
You stayed in the hotel
for quite a while.

146
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,679
Indeed.

147
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,799
If that was the case,

148
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,240
you couldn't spend so much time

149
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,559
finding which room he was in, right?

150
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,120
Of course not.

151
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,320
You know everything about poison.

152
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,440
If Tan Xian had committed suicide
by taking poison,

153
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,919
before you got the clue,

154
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,799
you wouldn't let him die.

155
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,440
Tan Xian did commit suicide
by taking poison.

156
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,000
The letter he was going to
give to Tongmenghui

157
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,919
was burned indeed.

158
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,799
The reason I didn't save him

159
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,919
was because
before the letter was burnt out,

160
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,960
I saw a few words on it.

161
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,480
What words?

162
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,879
"The item is hidden in a tomb."

163
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,879
"Fenzhou."

164
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,919
So the secret of the Altar Treasure

165
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,279
is hidden in Fenzhou, Shanxi.

166
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,440
And the tomb

167
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,679
is the very tomb
of the inheritor of Southern Shaolin.

168
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,080
As long as we find the tomb,

169
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,759
we can find the item.

170
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,679
Now only we know
the whereabouts of the item.

171
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,759
But the Department and the Japanese

172
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,759
know nothing.

173
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,159
Great.

174
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,120
Things are going way smoother

175
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
than I expected.

176
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,240
How did he die?

177
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,759
He died right under your people's watch.

178
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,519
So you called this protection?

179
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,039
He was highly related

180
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,399
to the rebels from Tongmenghui.

181
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,600
He was the suspect of the court.

182
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,480
Now he died under your watch.

183
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,399
Do you think the court
will let you get away?

184
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,519
Or you think your foreign boss
will forgive you?

185
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,759
Now tell me,

186
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,799
who gave you the order

187
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,919
to get involved in this?

188
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
My boss at the Public Council
gave me the order.

189
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,600
As far as I know,

190
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,679
this order was issued from overseas.

191
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,320
About who issued the order.

192
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,240
I only have a rough guess.

193
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,159
Fine, tell me your guess.

194
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,679
I guess it's Tongmenghui

195
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,159
or supporters of the Reform Movement
of 1898 from overseas.

196
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,320
Whether it's the Public Council

197
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,720
or the Police Station.

198
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,639
We are just acting on orders.

199
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,080
Do you know how to explain this?

200
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,279
Or,

201
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,559
I can think of a way for you.

202
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,600
Anyway, you and your men

203
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,799
have to obfuscate the whole story.

204
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
You could tell a lie.

205
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,879
Just say that there was a disturbance
at the hotel tonight.

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,720
The Japanese and the Sword Sect

207
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,679
all swarmed here

208
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,320
and wanted to take Tan Xian away.

209
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,600
Wait a minute.

210
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,639
Are you sure this is a lie?

211
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,960
This is exactly what happened.

212
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,440
And then you had the situation
under control.

213
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,480
Just in case,

214
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,360
you had to make a decision

215
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,600
and get Tan Xian on the train
leaving Shanghai

216
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,720
and heading to Guangzhou.

217
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,440
Forging an exit document

218
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
is surely not difficult for you.

219
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,000
It's even easier to get the dead man

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,440
to press his fingerprint on the paper.

221
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,879
In this way, you will be considered

222
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,240
as improvising due to the emergency,

223
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,399
but not causing

224
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,799
a criminal's death.

225
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,919
You need to teach them what to say.

226
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,079
Both your people and the people
in this hotel.

227
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,799
This matter

228
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,519
must remain as a top secret.

229
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,519
We cannot let anything out.

230
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,200
You've taught me so much.

231
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,480
What do you want?

232
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,440
I want this person,

233
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,160
this room,

234
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,160
and the entire floor

235
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,759
for one night.

236
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,680
What are you going to do?

237
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,519
None of your business.

238
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,880
Just say yes.

239
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,839
Before dawn tomorrow,

240
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,240
I will leave everything

241
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,599
to you.

242
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,240
Then you can explain properly

243
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,000
to your boss.

244
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
And we, Imperial Household Department,
will owe you a favor.

245
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,960
Of course.

246
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,400
If you refuse,

247
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,759
I will go to the Public Council
for assistance.

248
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,519
And the court
will pressure the Concession.

249
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,519
You will be the one

250
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,720
who becomes the scapegoat.

251
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,599
How did he die?

252
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,359
He poisoned himself.

253
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,720
Who did he meet before he died?

254
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,559
We still do not know yet.

255
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,839
Where is the body now?

256
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,079
Inside the hotel.

257
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,680
However, Men Sandao is still there.

258
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,240
He is still in the hotel?

259
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,440
That means

260
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,319
Men was not the one
whom Tan Xian met before he died.

261
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,839
If it wasn't him,

262
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,640
then it must be one of Zhuo Bufan.

263
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,440
I had two men

264
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,559
following them.

265
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
They should be able
to locate the whereabouts.

266
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,400
I didn't see clearly.

267
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,240
But Zhuo Bufan knew

268
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,160
that the person
who ran out was not Tan Xian.

269
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,599
But he didn't say a word.

270
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,240
We just ran so long like fools

271
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,400
and got so exhausted.

272
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,440
And him?

273
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,839
Just went upstairs to look for Tan Xian.

274
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,200
So what are we going to do next?

275
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know.

276
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,680
Zhuo Bufan didn't tell me.

277
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,680
He was

278
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
just putting on airs.

279
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,599
He carried himself
in the way as the Sect Leader.

280
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,039
And he didn't even

281
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,400
tell me everything.

282
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,039
Huanjie.

283
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,039
Mr. Zhuo did this for our Sect.

284
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,640
We all did!

285
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,240
If it wasn't for Rongtian Sword Sect,

286
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,920
I would never

287
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,880
address him as Sect Leader

288
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,400
or without any complaint,

289
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,039
follow him around with you guys.

290
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,640
But for the Sect, I can endure anything.

291
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,799
He was indeed poisoned to death.

292
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,599
Look at his neck.

293
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,200
The soft whip is the symbolic weapon
of Rongtian Ridge.

294
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,599
The whip marks are red,

295
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,880
which means when he was strangled,

296
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,039
Tan Xian was still alive.

297
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,599
That woman lied.

298
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,440
Even if Tan Xian killed himself
by poison,

299
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,400
she coerced him to take it.

300
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
What about this wound?

301
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,559
Perhaps he cut himself when struggling.

302
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,160
They were fighting so fiercely outside.

303
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,119
If you were him,

304
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,200
would you have someone
deliver food to you?

305
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know others.

306
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,759
I might do that.

307
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,880
The food was untouched.

308
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,680
He didn't have time to eat

309
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,319
or he never wanted to eat at all.

310
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,640
Handprint.

311
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,960
Tan Xian moved the plate.

312
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,920
What did he want
if he didn't want the food?

313
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,599
The smell of oil.

314
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,279
It seems this is the thing
he wanted on the plate.

315
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,232
(At night, one o'clock,
telephone booth in the lobby.)

316
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,240
Good night.

317
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,640
Who are you?

318
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,480
Who are you?

319
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:49,946
(Shanghai)

320
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:06,720
(First Class)

321
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,640
Your Highness.

322
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:38,034
(4th day of 4th month
of 3rd year of Xuantong)

323
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:40,058
(Grain in Ear is 36 days away.)

324
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,039
Muqing.

325
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,200
You stayed up all night?

326
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,680
Still thinking about what to do?

327
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,440
The woman who left the hotel first

328
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,559
must be the bodyguard of Tan Xian.

329
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,319
Should we find her and take her back?

330
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,839
I've thought about it.

331
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,319
I'm afraid it won't be of too much use.

332
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,720
None of us knows her identity

333
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,839
or even her name.

334
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,799
We have nowhere to look.

335
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,839
Let's say we can catch her,

336
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,359
but when at the Maiqi Road,

337
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,400
judging from the way
she held a gun on Tan Xian,

338
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,400
I think

339
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,759
we won't get much out of her.

340
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,599
Or,

341
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,039
she doesn't know anything.

342
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,279
She left the hotel to distract us.

343
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,799
That means the secret information
that Tan Xian brought back

344
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,880
is what she might not know.

345
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,720
What about that phone call last night?

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,799
Who do you think made that call?

347
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,599
It must have been someone
from Tongmenghui

348
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,079
who didn't meet Tan Xian at Maiqi Road

349
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,599
in the day.

350
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,720
Since people from Tongmenghui

351
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,160
are still trying
to reach out to Tan Xian,

352
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,440
it means that they also

353
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,839
didn't get what they wanted.

354
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,079
Even though we work on the phone call,

355
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,160
we'll only find a rebel of Tongmenghui

356
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,400
who knows even less than we do.

357
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,200
It's meaningless.

358
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,160
So we have no leads at all?

359
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,000
That's right.

360
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,039
But there is still one way to go.

361
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,920
Muqing, please enlighten me.

362
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,759
Zhuo Bufan.

363
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,400
Zhuo Bufan?

364
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,200
Don't they know nothing?

365
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,240
This is the only thing
I cannot be certain of.

366
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,480
I've been thinking all night.

367
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,960
The most suspicious thing

368
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,759
is Zhuo Bufan's Rongtian Ridge.

369
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,759
Last night, it was Huo Qin,
Ms. Huo of Rongtian Ridge,

370
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,839
who first entered the hotel
and saw Tan Xian.

371
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Zhuo Bufan was stopping me
from going in there at that time.

372
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,720
So, I cannot be certain

373
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,359
if Tan Xian was already dead
when Huo Qin saw him.

374
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,160
We both saw the crime scene.

375
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,720
On the table,

376
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,519
the letter with clues on it was burned.

377
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,640
But what if the letter
was burned by Huo Qin?

378
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,240
You mean

379
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,319
Huo Qin saw the secret message,

380
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,640
destroyed it,

381
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,960
and killed Tan Xian?

382
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,519
She might not want to destroy it

383
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,559
but to make us believe

384
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,240
this is the only clue we can get.

385
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,640
So,

386
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,519
the most important thing right now

387
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,519
is to keep tracking Zhuo Bufan
and his people.

388
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,799
We don't even know

389
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,160
where they are now.

390
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,039
How do we investigate?

391
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,119
We can only use the dumbest method.

392
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,640
Place informants
at every dock and station.

393
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,279
Wish the luck is on our side.

394
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,720
I'll dispatch people now.

395
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,799
You suffered such severe injuries

396
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,720
but woke up after less than half a day.

397
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,920
The physician said

398
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,279
it would take a month for you
to get out of bed.

399
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,799
That means he was a quack.

400
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,440
This place is
the Imperial Household Department?

401
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,559
Look at this shabby place.

402
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,440
This is an inn of the Patrol Yamen.

403
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,000
You imperial guards are so privileged.

404
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,039
It is such a fine inn,

405
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,559
and you called it shabby.

406
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,319
Mind your word!

407
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,359
You are just a menial constable.

408
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,200
How dare you be so rude

409
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,119
to an imperial guard?

410
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,400
This is Mr. Getai.

411
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,799
Yesterday on Maiqi Road,

412
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,200
if he hadn't rescued you,

413
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,519
you would have already been dead.

414
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,839
He saved you

415
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,240
because you serve the court like us.

416
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,400
Moreover,

417
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,960
I believe you are quite capable.

418
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,960
Since you went all the way here

419
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,279
and found Zhuo Bufan.

420
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,640
Thank you, Mr. Getai.

421
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,759
I'll take my leave first.

422
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,039
The physician has said

423
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,680
that you needed to rest
for a month or so.

424
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,920
And for three months,
you must not engage in combat.

425
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,160
Who cares about what a quack said?

426
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Here.

427
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
This money is your reward.

428
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,839
After you recover, go back to Dagu.

429
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,000
You've seen it yourself.

430
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,880
The Department will handle the case.

431
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,759
Have you captured

432
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Zhuo Bufan and his disciples?

433
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,839
You haven't.

434
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,279
You've got so much manpower,

435
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,839
but Zhuo Bufan is still at large.

436
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,640
You should thank us but not blame us

437
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,400
since you are still standing here alive.

438
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,440
I don't care even if I die.

439
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,559
Capturing the criminal is what matters.

440
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,880
What?

441
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,240
Do you still want to go after them?

442
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,640
It is necessary.

443
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,880
I am serving the Emperor,

444
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,079
so I'll ease his concerns.

445
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,079
Mr. Muqing.

446
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,480
The criminals are still at large.

447
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,839
As an imperial guard,

448
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
you look indifferent.

449
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,960
You are the muscle. I am the brain.

450
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,680
What we are responsible for
is different.

451
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,680
Constable.

452
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,599
Mind your own business.

453
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,759
You've messed up, so save it.

454
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,720
Messed up with what?

455
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,400
They have fled.

456
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,680
I have already said

457
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,279
it wasn't about them
but about the whole case.

458
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,240
Isn't it all about catching criminals?

459
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,920
You are unique in handling the cases.

460
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,279
Where are Zhuo Bufan and his people?

461
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,240
What?

462
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,759
You don't even know where they went?

463
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,839
Why should I tell you?

464
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,200
I think you just don't know.

465
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,440
Wang Jialuo.

466
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,119
If you keep pestering me like this,

467
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:33,640
I will...

468
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,440
Someone!

469
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:42,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

470
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,880
Why couldn't you stop

471
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,279
Men Sandao from coming to Shanghai

472
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:51,160
but let him follow Zhuo Bufan?

473
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,119
I planned to kill Men Sandao.

474
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,000
But after I sparred with him,

475
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,519
I gave up.

476
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,200
You are no match for him?

477
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,960
If it were ten years ago,

478
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,880
perhaps I could have fought him

479
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,960
and saw how it played out.

480
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,599
But I am already 60 now,

481
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,279
so I am no match for him.

482
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,880
You are stupid,

483
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,039
but I'd rather think
you are incompetent.

484
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,119
Tell me.

485
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,319
With Men Sandao chasing after him,

486
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,400
what are the odds

487
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,480
of Zhuo Bufan
finding the secret treasure?

488
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,119
I'd say fifty-fifty.

489
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,359
And with the current situation,

490
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm afraid 30% at best.

491
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,400
Your Highness.

492
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,359
Actually, 30% already means
it's pretty hopeful.

493
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,720
For hundreds of years,

494
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,440
the Imperial Household Department
has sent so many capable guards

495
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
to search for the whereabouts
of the treasure.

496
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,759
And in the end, they found nothing.

497
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,279
Your Highness.

498
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,920
The Heaven blesses you.

499
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,160
You have been searching
for the Altar Treasure

500
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,440
for only less than a month,

501
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,559
but now you already
had quite a breakthrough.

502
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,519
It's truly a remarkable achievement.

503
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,359
Weren't you also at Maiqi Road
on the third day of the month?

504
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:08,880
Yes.

505
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,359
So do you think he can beat Men Sandao?

506
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,720
In terms of kung fu,
Zhuo Bufan is superior by a notch.

507
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,599
Under normal circumstances,

508
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,720
Men Sandao is definitely no match.

509
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,839
That's good.

510
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,599
Please sit.

511
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,839
Thank you, Your Highness.

512
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,039
I was afraid
that his reputation was undeserved.

513
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,240
Even a prisoner released from prison
by the Department

514
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,720
can beat him.

515
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,160
Your Highness.

516
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,160
Please rest assured about this.

517
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,839
Qin Tuo.

518
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,160
Since we've decided

519
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,599
to stay in Shanghai
for half a day longer.

520
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,880
Go inform them.

521
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,319
Let them have a good rest.

522
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,279
There are people from the Department,
the Japanese,

523
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,519
and the Police Station out there.

524
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,119
So we

525
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,480
must not expose our whereabouts.

526
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,160
Understood.

527
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,359
Why do we have to stay in Shanghai
for an extra day?

528
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,160
Have you found Tan Xian's stuff?

529
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,319
Just tell us.

530
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,480
Huanjie, keep your voice down.

531
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,640
Huanjie.

532
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,039
I decided to stay here for a reason.

533
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,039
What reason?

534
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,160
Can't you just say it?

535
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,160
Sect Leader.

536
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,400
I will leave you to talk.

537
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,519
I'll tell the others about this.

538
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:27,680
Huanjie.

539
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,000
We have already found the item.

540
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,039
Where is it?

541
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,880
Shanxi.

542
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,559
Shanxi?

543
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:38,160
Huanjie.

544
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,799
Lower your voice.

545
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,599
I wanted to go to Shanxi overnight.

546
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,000
But then I received a message.

547
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,160
His Highness has arrived in Shanghai.

548
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,944
You want to meet His Highness?

549
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:51,480
Yes.

550
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,279
When?

551
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,799
In a while.

552
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:54,920
Bufan.

553
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,319
I'll go with you.

554
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,359
You want to go with me?

555
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
His Highness is no normal person.

556
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,359
You need to know the proper etiquette.

557
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,759
Do you know it?

558
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,680
After all, I'm a senior
of the Rongtian Sword Sect.

559
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,960
I know better than you
about how to talk to people.

560
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,440
I'll go to see him with you.

561
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,119
That's also for the good
of the Rongtian Sword Sect.

562
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Isn't that right, Ms. Huo?

563
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,720
This is my senior apprentice,
Yu Huanjie.

564
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Nice to see you again, Sir.

565
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,279
Nice to see you too, Mr. Yu.

566
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,920
I've heard a lot about you.

567
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,640
His Highness is now greeting guests.

568
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,920
Please wait a moment.

569
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,119
Sure.

570
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,599
We'll just wait.

571
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:44,920
Bufan.

572
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,519
Is he the steward of Prince Qi?

573
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,839
I don't know. Never asked.

574
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,680
You should ask.

575
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,960
You should know that whoever by his side

576
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,599
are all important people.

577
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
You are right, Huanjie.

578
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,720
Your Highness.

579
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Long time no see.

580
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

581
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,759
Skip it.

582
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,119
No need for that.

583
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,240
You are Qing. And you're Yu.

584
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,000
Right?

585
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,000
I haven't seen you in half a year.

586
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,640
You two become prettier.

587
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,920
I've brought gifts for you too.

588
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Take it.

589
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,359
Take it.

590
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,519
Lucky always knows what is the best.

591
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,240
Of course.

592
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,400
I have got many good stuff here.

593
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,720
Please have a look.

594
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,039
A folding fan made of pearwood.

595
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,039
This is a comb made of rosewood
from Southeast Asia.

596
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,000
And here.

597
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,279
Red coral, gold star stone, agate Pixiu.

598
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,960
Jade chopsticks, enamel silver mirror.

599
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,119
White-glazed earrings,
shell-carved ring.

600
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,559
All of these are good stuff

601
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,920
that I brought back from abroad.

602
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,599
I haven't shown them to anyone else.

603
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,000
I want to let you choose first.

604
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,480
If you don't finish choosing,

605
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,960
I can't sell a single piece.

606
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,119
There are so many things here.

607
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,319
Even if you like none of them,

608
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,680
I dare to let others buy them then.

609
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,639
No one can compare with you.

610
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,559
Glib-tongued!

611
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,719
Who can compare with you?

612
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,079
Let me take a look at that.

613
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,239
Here.

614
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,960
See? That's why you're a princess.

615
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,119
You know what is high-class.

616
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,119
Look at the beautiful colors.

617
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,519
This is a complete set.

618
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,480
There is another one here.

619
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,679
These are the polished ornaments made

620
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,800
by sea coral from Southeast Asia.

621
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,480
You do have sharp eyes

622
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,400
and always know what is the best.

623
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,480
The coral grows

624
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,440
in the seas near a desolate island
amongst raging waves.

625
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,800
All year round,

626
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,280
there are only three to five days

627
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,519
for people to dive down to harvest it.

628
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,079
Then it's carved
by the best-skilled craftsmen.

629
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,800
The master who can carve this

630
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,199
must also be top-notch.

631
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,800
Those still alive

632
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,960
are no more than five.

633
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,400
And yet, it takes
a full three months of work

634
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,159
days and nights to make one of these.

635
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,736
Let alone that this is a whole set.

636
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,280
Your Highness.

637
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,199
Fine.

638
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,480
I'll take this.

639
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,920
Go get the silver.

640
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,280
Now that you have it,

641
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,440
I can be at ease.

642
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,679
I'll take my leave.

643
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,920
Some customers are waiting
for the good stuff.

644
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,559
If I bring back new fancy stuff
next time,

645
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,440
as usual,

646
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,039
I will certainly let you choose first.

647
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,880
If you are in Shanghai, I'll come here.

648
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
If you return to the imperial city,

649
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,480
I'll go to your residence to meet you.

650
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,039
I'll take my leave.

651
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,079
Lead the way.

652
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,719
Please wait a moment.

653
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,639
Your Highness.

654
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,079
Someone outside

655
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,000
claims to be an imperial inspector
from the Patrol Yamen.

656
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
He brought quite a few gifts.

657
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,480
Why bother to see him?

658
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,519
Let him in.

659
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,840
Greetings, Your Highness.

660
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,880
Please rise.

661
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

662
00:35:59,199 --> 00:35:59,960
Please forgive me.

663
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,400
I heard
that you have arrived in Shanghai

664
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,800
two or three days ago.

665
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,880
I have been meaning to come and see you.

666
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,480
But in the past few days,

667
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,599
I've been asked to assist the officials
from the imperial city with a case.

668
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,440
I have truly been too busy.

669
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,440
So I didn't pay you a visit
until this morning.

670
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,039
My apologies.

671
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,440
You just mentioned
that the officials are handling a case.

672
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Who is in Shanghai?

673
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,960
The imperial guards
from the Imperial Household Department.

674
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,800
Mr. Muqing and Mr. Getai.

675
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,079
They are in Shanghai?

676
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,599
Yes.

677
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,440
What case are they investigating?

678
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,280
Please forgive me.

679
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,800
I don't know much
about the specific details.

680
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,000
Thank you for taking the time
to visit me.

681
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,280
I dare not disturb you for too long.

682
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,480
I will take my leave.

683
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,480
Go send a letter for me later.

684
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,480
Yes.

685
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,480
It's almost noon.

686
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,039
I have prepared some food.

687
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,280
Please make do with it.

688
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,559
Please have a seat.

689
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,840
What? Sit down.

690
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,159
Sit.

691
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,559
Just now,

692
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,519
did you want to ask him

693
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,199
when Prince Qi will see us?

694
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,320
Yes.

695
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,679
How could you ask that?

696
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,159
He's a prince.

697
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,360
What about the prince?

698
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,320
He told me he would meet us
in the morning.

699
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,079
And it's already noon.

700
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,039
Even so, we must wait.

701
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,000
That's how things work.

702
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,480
We can only wait for him.

703
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,880
But it won't work the other way around.

704
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,519
Look.

705
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,400
He has even prepared a meal for us.

706
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,119
Come on.

707
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,280
There are quite a few dishes here.

708
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,719
Let's eat first.

709
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,400
Miss.

710
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,119
When will...

711
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:26,719
No rush.

712
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,559
Miss.

713
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:29,719
No rush.

714
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,960
The prince's matters must be important.

715
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,519
We will just wait.

716
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,480
Please do your job.

717
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,960
I also want to see him.

718
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,280
But control yourself.

719
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,679
It won't help anything.

720
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:02,426
(Wonderful Hotel)

721
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,480
Your Highness.

722
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,039
Your Highness.

723
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,119
There's no need for that.

724
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,719
Get to the point.

725
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,719
No wonder over 100 years,

726
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,880
nobody found the Altar Treasure.

727
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,559
With this unclear map,

728
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,760
no one knows where to look.

729
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,840
Just as you said,

730
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,320
this map is unclear.

731
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,840
Only when we find the other half,
can we make the next move.

732
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,039
Have you already known

733
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,039
how to find the other half?

734
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,320
I have learned from Tan Xian

735
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,840
about the place
that hid the half of treasure map.

736
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,639
It is in Fenzhou, Shanxi.

737
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,960
I will set off

738
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
after meeting you.

739
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,159
Very well.

740
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,920
This hasn't been an easy task.

741
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,920
But you have done well.

742
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,079
Find the treasure.

743
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,280
The martial arts manuals in the treasure

744
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,840
will belong to Rongtian Sword Sect.

745
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:55,199
I will also build for you

746
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,320
a main altar
to rival Shaolin and Wudang.

747
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,599
And in the name of the court,

748
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,920
I will confer you
the title of the first Sword Sect.

749
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,199
Thank you, Your Highness.

750
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:10,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

751
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,639
Before you go to Shanxi,

752
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:16,519
I have a key clue to tell you.

753
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,119
The inheritor of Bodhi
died six years ago.

754
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,440
With this clue,

755
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,400
you can find the treasure map

756
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,880
before the Department does.

757
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,760
Is there any difficulty?

758
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,440
Not really.

759
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,519
It's just that...

760
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,039
Please say it.

761
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,800
It's just that
the Department is chasing after us.

762
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,119
It's quite troublesome.

763
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,440
Men Sandao?

764
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,280
Yes.

765
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,440
Men Sandao's kung fu is indeed good.

766
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,119
Does it mean

767
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,159
you've already crossed swords?

768
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,800
I've fought with him twice.

769
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,400
Win or lose?

770
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,880
I was able to gain the upper hand
both times.

771
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,000
Men Sandao is known
as the top master of the imperial yamen,

772
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,519
and is also hailed
as a genius detective.

773
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:01,719
Becoming his target

774
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,239
is indeed a troublesome matter.

775
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,119
Tonight I will have someone

776
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,320
