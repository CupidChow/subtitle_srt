1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,960
Did Prince Qi really
hide something from me?

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,160
What's wrong?

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,199
Is there something upsetting you?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,480
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I need to return to my home.

6
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:35,840
Bring me the equipment.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,560
What's this for?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,960
It's for you.

9
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,719
Is today a special day?

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,359
Just a usual day.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,280
I was in a bad mood yesterday.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,880
I shouldn't have brought up the past

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,159
and thrown a tantrum.

14
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,640
So now I

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,600
came here to apologize to you.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
Apologize for what?

17
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,679
You've done nothing wrong.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,240
I was exhausted yesterday.

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,439
I was wrong too.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,400
Okay.

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,280
If you are not angry,

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,159
then I'm rest assured.

23
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,280
I'm not that petty.

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,480
Here, my lady.

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,599
Try it on.

26
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,439
Here, my lady.

27
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,319
Have a taste.

28
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,239
Why are you drinking today?

29
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,920
I am in a good mood.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,319
I've heard that
when father-in-law was young,

31
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,200
he also practiced kung fu.

32
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,200
That was many years ago.

33
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
He has long since given it up.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,759
He was just an amateur.

35
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,520
His skills were just for show
in front of the guards.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,120
Does he also have some friends

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,159
from the circle of swordsmen?

38
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,560
In the past, my father

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,199
only sparred with guards and retainers.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,919
He never had associated
with other martial arts practitioners.

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,240
Then did he recently

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,120
interact with any swordsmen
from various circles?

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,800
I don't know.

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,919
About my father's affairs,

45
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,719
I even know less than you do.

46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,360
Why do you bring this up suddenly?

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
Nothing, just asking.

48
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,479
Let's eat, my lady.

49
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:10,016
=Heroes=

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,184
=Episode 14=

51
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,656
(Fenzhou, Shanxi)

52
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,639
Stop following me.

53
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,040
The Department guards are behind you.

54
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't look back.

55
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,240
I'll go to market

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,079
to draw them away.

57
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,160
Get out through this alley.

58
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,040
Remember.

59
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:28,639
When you go out,

60
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,759
wait outside the city gate.

61
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,240
I will get there before nightfall.

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Don't wander off.

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,759
Take her to yamen.

64
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,920
Lin Haohan.

65
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,279
Getai.

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,959
I've finally found you.

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,600
Yes.

68
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,480
Run?

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,480
How could I possibly run?

70
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,079
Muqing.

71
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,759
Getai.

72
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,800
Don't you trust me?

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,839
Misunderstanding.

74
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,639
This is a huge misunderstanding.

75
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,240
That day at the mass grave,

76
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
I saw you

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,439
were battling fiercely.

78
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,480
I was scared.

79
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,879
I was scared of getting hurt.

80
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,959
So I hid

81
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,240
to keep myself safe.

82
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,120
It didn't matter if I got hurt.

83
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,680
I was just worried

84
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,639
that if I didn't get my job done.

85
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,839
That would be a real crime.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,480
So I

87
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,120
found a place to hide.

88
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,319
And I saw

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
there were people living in the village.

90
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,319
So I thought

91
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,680
maybe I could collect some good stuff.

92
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,240
I got so absorbed

93
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,839
that I forgot all about you.

94
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,839
So you fled back to Fenzhou on your own

95
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,839
with Liu Lin.

96
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,560
How could I possibly flee?

97
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,079
No way.

98
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,120
Muqing.

99
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,959
My suitcase is still here.

100
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,959
Still in the room

101
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,920
that you arranged for me
in the pose station.

102
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,639
Inside that suitcase

103
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,839
are all the good things
I've collected from various places.

104
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,639
That is everything to me.

105
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,199
Even if I lose my life,

106
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,839
I won't leave

107
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,560
those valuable goods behind.

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,360
As for Liu Lin,

109
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,240
why was she with me?

110
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,600
Then I can't answer you.

111
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,759
Maybe that girl

112
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,120
was also afraid of battles.

113
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,319
So she also hid along with me.

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,720
I was looking for good antiques.

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,560
She also followed me.

116
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,560
Why?

117
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,800
I think this might just be fate.

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,879
But later I realized

119
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,439
that I just overthought it.

120
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,480
Because after arriving at Fenzhou,

121
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,560
we got separated.

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,439
Alright, shut up.

123
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,560
You have to believe me.

124
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,439
We are heart-to-heart brothers.

125
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,720
I will never hide...

126
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,480
Okay, no more nonsense.

127
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,120
If you really want me to believe you,

128
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,879
then help me see what this is.

129
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,319
Muqing.

130
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,600
You must be very angry.

131
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,160
What is this that you've smashed?

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,720
This...

133
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,040
Don't tell me this is

134
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,639
the very jar dug out from the tomb.

135
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,279
Can you tell what this is?

136
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,839
That's it?

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,839
Muqing.

138
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,079
To be honest,

139
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,240
the moment it was dug out

140
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,199
from the grave that day,

141
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,160
when I laid my eyes on it,

142
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,279
I knew what it is.

143
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,279
It isn't worth much.

144
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Just a container

145
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,920
used for the ashes of esteemed monks.

146
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,199
To put it nicer, it's called a stupa.

147
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
But it's just an urn.

148
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,480
This thing is not ancient.

149
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
Even if it is,

150
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,360
people will rather spend their money

151
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,959
buying fancy containers.

152
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,439
Who would want to buy an urn
to keep at home?

153
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,839
It's worthless anyway.

154
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,920
It's okay that it's broken.

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,480
It's not a big deal.

156
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,360
Can you tell
where this porcelain is from?

157
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,800
Muqing.

158
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,079
Are you kidding me?

159
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,079
What?

160
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,560
You're kidding me, right?

161
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,279
This porcelain isn't
from any famous kiln.

162
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:28,920
Besides,

163
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,600
it's smashed like this.

164
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,840
I can't even find a mark on it.

165
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,600
How would I know where it's from?

166
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,360
Unless,

167
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,840
you can put these pieces back together
and glue them,

168
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,159
then I might tell where it's from.

169
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:44,919
Getai.

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,519
Take these fragments to his room.

171
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
Why?

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,519
It's useless for me.

173
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,799
So you can piece it together.

174
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,840
Muqing.

175
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,919
Are you serious?

176
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,399
Genius.

177
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,320
You're a genius, right?

178
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,879
I want you

179
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,320
to bring out the best out of you.

180
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,000
If you can't figure out where it's from,

181
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,919
then don't leave your room.

182
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,759
Lock him in the room.

183
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,120
Do not allow him to go anywhere.

184
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
If he even takes a step out,

185
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,320
chop his leg.

186
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,559
Let's go, genius.

187
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
You are Liu Lin.

188
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,120
I am Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

189
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,000
You can call me Muqing

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,000
or Men Sandao.

191
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,480
A hound of the court.

192
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,000
That's right.

193
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,320
I am a hound.

194
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,440
Answer my questions.

195
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,559
If you do not answer or you deceive me,

196
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,960
I will chop off your fingers.

197
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
You are a member of Tongmenghui.

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,759
I wouldn't blink an eye

199
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,159
even if I torture you or kill you.

200
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,399
Then kill me.

201
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,279
Falling into your hands,

202
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,399
I only want death.

203
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,799
I have interrogated many people.

204
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,039
Many people have told me

205
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,919
they only wished to die.

206
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,840
But in the end, they all realized

207
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,679
death was the easiest thing

208
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,039
and difficult to come true.

209
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,039
You came to Pingyao

210
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,320
because Tan Xian told you
the secret of the tomb,

211
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,919
right?

212
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,840
Right.

213
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,559
Good.

214
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,759
You didn't hesitate.

215
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,039
What is the secret of the tomb?

216
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,039
I don't know.

217
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,360
Is it the Altar Treasure?

218
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,039
What I know

219
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,399
is probably much less than you do.

220
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,960
I didn't look clearly
at that porcelain jar.

221
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,879
Did Tan Xian tell you anything else?

222
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,480
No.

223
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,360
Think again.

224
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,559
Same answer.

225
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,679
Tan Xian was dead
and the item was missing.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
My mission has completely failed.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,320
And now I've fallen into your hands.

228
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,799
I am just a sitting duck.

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,639
Tongmenghui members
are felons to the court.

230
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,679
But how to question or convict you

231
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,559
is not my concern.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,960
You will be escorted to
Ministry of Justice in capital.

233
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,480
You are a rebel of Tongmenghui.

234
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,240
You know how you will end up.

235
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,159
Well.

236
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,679
Make a deal with me.

237
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,320
If you can provide
some useful information,

238
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,720
I will let you go immediately.

239
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
I know nothing.

240
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,240
Even if I know something else,

241
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,279
I won't possibly tell you people.

242
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
No rush.

243
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
I won't return to the capital
in a short time.

244
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,600
You can answer me later.

245
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,000
Find a room to lock her up.

246
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
Muqing.

247
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,360
No room is available
at the post station.

248
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,360
Where to lock her up?

249
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,960
Here.

250
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,960
Keep a close watch on them.

251
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,600
Yes!

252
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,279
Miss Liu?

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,159
What happened?

254
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,759
Am I dreaming?

255
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,840
Fate brought us together again.

256
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,039
What a surprise.

257
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,879
Fate is just so unpredictable.

258
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Didn't I tell you to escape
through the alley?

259
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,559
How come you still got caught by them?

260
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,480
Why did they

261
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,240
lock you up with me?

262
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,279
How would I know?

263
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,840
It doesn't matter.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,799
Miss Liu.

265
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,600
It's wonderful to see you again.

266
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,759
Especially now

267
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,120
we are in the same room.

268
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,360
I just knew it.

269
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,240
What a small world.

270
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,039
What are you doing?

271
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,720
Men Sandao's fault.

272
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
This is the jar

273
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
that they dug out from the grave.

274
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,559
Can you still tell

275
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,080
that this is a jar?

276
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,480
Someone broke it.

277
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,159
And now they asked me
to put it back together.

278
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,519
Miss Liu.

279
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,720
It will take me a lot of time.

280
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,639
If you're tired, you can sleep first.

281
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,759
No need to wait for me.

282
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,720
Lin Haohan.

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,360
If you lay a finger on me,

284
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,240
I will surely make you
regret it for life.

285
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,120
Miss Liu.

286
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
We both end up here

287
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,360
and now even are locked
in the same room.

288
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,879
If nothing happens,

289
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,440
then I would truly regret it for life.

290
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,200
Mr. Muqing.

291
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,159
I've been waiting for long.

292
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,279
Since you are in Shanxi,
you have to try Fen Wine.

293
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,919
What, you really want to pay me back?

294
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,840
I feel uncomfortable
owing someone money.

295
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,759
Take your key back.

296
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,879
We're even now.

297
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,440
Thank you.

298
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Beiyang guns are stronger
than our blades.

299
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,799
Beiyang gave me guns, gave me manpower.

300
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,240
But I am still the constable
of Dagu County Yamen.

301
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,759
I still serve the court

302
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,960
and serve the Emperor.

303
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,279
Four days ago,
you were allegedly killed by Zhuo Bufan.

304
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,919
Who would know four days later

305
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,519
you would be in the military uniform
of the Beiyang Army?

306
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,440
What has happened to you

307
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,200
in these four days?

308
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,360
What happened these four days

309
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,639
was just like a dream to me.

310
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,679
You said it was a long story.

311
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Now we have plenty of time.

312
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,559
Interesting.

313
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,480
This person you've encountered.

314
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
Who exactly is he?

315
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,639
I don't know.

316
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,240
But I suppose
he must be someone important.

317
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,759
He was just fishing by the Anyang River

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,799
but had so many attendants
following him.

319
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,080
Otherwise, it was impossible

320
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,320
that after he wrote the letter,

321
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,679
the people of Beiyang
would act accordingly.

322
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,039
I'm not asking about that fat fisherman

323
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,200
but who sent you onto the boat.

324
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,279
Who was this man and what did he want?

325
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,799
The best detective in the Department.

326
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,639
You get to the point indeed.

327
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
At that time, I was totally dizzy.

328
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,000
(And in that status,)

329
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,720
(I tried to open my eyes
and caught a glimpse of him.)

330
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,799
(Although it was a hurried glance,)

331
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,000
I still recognized him.

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,919
Do you remember that man

333
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,080
when we were in Shanghai?

334
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,480
Him?

335
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,879
He was slashed by us
at least nine times.

336
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,799
How could he possibly
have followed you to Anyang?

337
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,440
No.

338
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,240
You meant the man who saved him.

339
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,919
Yes.

340
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,039
It wasn't the first time
I'd seen that man.

341
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,320
Back in Tianjin

342
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,639
I had already seen him.

343
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,360
Men Sandao.

344
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,799
An attendant by the side
of the late Emperor.

345
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,960
You are truly the top master
of the imperial yamen.

346
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,559
May I ask who you are?

347
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,799
(At that time,
I was tracking Zhuo Bufan)

348
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,039
(and the clue was missing.)

349
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,000
And then he suddenly appeared.

350
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,240
What did he do?

351
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,640
(He took me to an inn.)

352
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,119
(And that inn)

353
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,240
(was the one where people
from Rongtian Ridge had stayed.)

354
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,359
So I found out where Zhuo Bufan was.

355
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,039
If it were not for him,

356
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,240
I wouldn't have chased him
to Concession in Shanghai.

357
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,839
He also helped me.

358
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,359
When we were in Shanghai.

359
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,880
After we parted in Linqing.

360
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,759
After you killed Tang Yu?

361
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:34,559
Right.

362
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,680
When I was about to arrive in Shanghai,

363
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,599
I was ambushed by a group of people.

364
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,599
Who did it?

365
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,279
What do you think?

366
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,480
The Japanese.

367
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,440
At that time,
they knocked me down a cliff.

368
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,680
If it weren't for him,

369
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
I might now

370
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,759
be dead in the wilderness.

371
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,359
(Including that time in Henan,)

372
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,160
(he has saved me twice.)

373
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,240
That's not right.

374
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,200
How is that?

375
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,400
If it were not for him,

376
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,519
I would have already lost track
of Zhuo Bufan in Tianjin.

377
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,680
If it were not for him,

378
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,200
you wouldn't have made it to Shanghai.

379
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,039
If it were not for him,

380
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,640
you would have already
died in Anyang, Henan.

381
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,720
You couldn't possibly

382
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,119
become a second lieutenant of Beiyang

383
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,400
with soldiers to dispatch.

384
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,599
Without him,

385
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
we would not have had the chance
to monitor Zhuo Bufan,

386
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,200
let alone find the Bodhi tomb

387
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,480
in Shanxi.

388
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,920
(Who exactly is he?)

389
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,559
(What exactly does he want to do?)

390
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,640
Why does he step by step

391
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,759
lead us toward the truth?

392
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,519
But he is not a person of the court?

393
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
No.

394
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,680
A man in the circles of swordsmen.

395
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,960
Why would he do this?

396
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,839
He helped both of us.

397
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,279
You are a second-rank guard
of the Department.

398
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,799
And I am a lowly constable
of Dagu County Yamen.

399
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,759
There is a world of difference
between us.

400
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,960
The only thing in common is...

401
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,839
That we are both going after Zhuo Bufan.

402
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,039
Everything this person has done

403
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,640
is most disadvantageous to Zhuo Bufan.

404
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
So, he and Zhuo Bufan are definitely
not on the same side.

405
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,319
That's right.

406
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,359
The Japanese were after you,
but he saved you.

407
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,599
So, he is not with the Japanese either.

408
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes.

409
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,119
Right now, the people who are
looking for the Altar Treasure

410
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,519
include you, me,

411
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,240
Zhuo Bufan, the Japanese,

412
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,039
and also this man.

413
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,920
He is unlikely to be an enemy.

414
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,759
We are the only ones he has helped.

415
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,240
You and I also
have another thing in common.

416
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,119
We both serve the court.

417
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,000
Correct.

418
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,559
So

419
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
he will not be an enemy of the court.

420
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,400
But why every time he showed up

421
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,920
in such a secretive way?

422
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,240
The lone moon hangs over
the clear Milky Way.

423
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,319
The Big Dipper and Venus
shine at each other.

424
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,920
No matter who he is,

425
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,599
we just need to know

426
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,160
that he is not our enemy at the moment.

427
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,039
You're right.

428
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,559
Among those pursuing the Altar Treasure,

429
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,519
only you and I serve the court.

430
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,359
Right now, we should work together.

431
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,720
How do you want us to work together?

432
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,640
Since we will be partners,

433
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,319
we need to be honest with each other
from now on.

434
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,960
We both serve the court.

435
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,599
I will tell you everything I know.

436
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,000
I have the manpower from the Department,

437
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,279
and you have the manpower of Beiyang.

438
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,400
Let's join hands to go after Zhuo Bufan

439
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,960
and search for the Altar Treasure.

440
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,160
Let's work together.

441
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,680
However, we don't know

442
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,759
where Zhuo Bufan is now.

443
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,000
I have already dispatched people
to set up checkpoints.

444
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,599
I believe you have also mobilized

445
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,559
the soldiers of the Beiyang
to look for him, right?

446
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,279
Yes.

447
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,359
The porcelain jar unearthed
from the Pingyao tomb

448
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,799
must be unusual.

449
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,839
The clues to the treasure

450
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,759
are very likely to be on that jar.

451
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,799
Wasn't the porcelain jar

452
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,359
broken by Zhuo Bufan?

453
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,000
Right.

454
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,839
But I have already

455
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,799
gathered all the fragments.

456
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,480
Fragments?

457
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,599
If the clue is on the porcelain jar,

458
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,160
perhaps we can find it
from the fragments.

459
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,599
Do you want to...

460
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,519
You've pieced them?

461
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,279
It was so painstaking.

462
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,240
Muqing.

463
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,359
Have a good look.

464
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,200
I've given it my all.

465
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,799
This is...

466
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,359
I am Wang Jialuo.

467
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,720
Jialuo.

468
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,839
Nice to meet you.

469
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,720
I am Lin Haohan.

470
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,079
It means my heart is like a vast forest.

471
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,880
You may also call me by my English name
if you want.

472
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,599
Lucky.

473
00:21:58,759 --> 00:21:59,480
Lucky.

474
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,720
In Chinese,

475
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,599
it means good luck.

476
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,000
Did you find anything on it?

477
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,480
Well,

478
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,759
it's not that I don't want to.

479
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,000
Muqing.

480
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,400
I have already gone all out

481
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
and exerted all my might.

482
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,359
But this is all I can do.

483
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,079
It's just that

484
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,640
this jar is broken into too many pieces.

485
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,640
The worst part is

486
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,640
that it broke from the bottom.

487
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,400
The entire base has shattered
into tiny pieces.

488
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Impossible to put them together.

489
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,880
Muqing.

490
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,160
You know antiques.

491
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,079
So you should know

492
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,880
the marking on the porcelain
is usually on the bottom.

493
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Now the bottom is shattered.

494
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,359
We can't know where it's from.

495
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,519
Don't you agree, Jialuo?

496
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,759
If so,

497
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:48,400
the bottom of this jar
should have a marking on it.

498
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,000
It certainly had.

499
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,359
If not so,

500
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,119
why would Zhuo Bufan shatter it?

501
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,359
So when Zhuo Bufan got the jar,

502
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,160
he discovered the secret of the bottom,

503
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,599
so he shattered it on purpose.

504
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,599
It must be so.

505
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,599
There are characters on it.

506
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,200
That's right.

507
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,200
There are.

508
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,000
It's kind of vague though.

509
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,480
You can only see clearly

510
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,680
very few of them.

511
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,640
Ancient seal character?

512
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,240
Just an imitation. It's a replica.

513
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,880
It's already rare

514
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,079
to recognize ancient seal characters.

515
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,400
Not to mention that it is incomplete.

516
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,359
I also didn't recognize it.

517
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,640
Mr. Muqing, do you recognize it?

518
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,640
Look at your smug face.

519
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,799
Do you know what does it say?

520
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,039
I am not smug.

521
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,920
I've been modest all along.

522
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,119
Do you know it or not?

523
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
Muqing, you know it.

524
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,359
Recognizing the ancient seal characters

525
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,440
is already quite impressive.

526
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,559
In the past.

527
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,920
That's a skill only academicians
of Hanlin Academy had.

528
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,160
I'm not talented.

529
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,160
I can really recognize a few.

530
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,920
It's just that it is incomplete.

531
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,200
What kind of person

532
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,160
can tell what it means

533
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,799
from these vague characters?

534
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,119
That must be the greatest genius.

535
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,440
What exactly does it say?

536
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,039
Calm down.

537
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,240
With the lofty ambition,
I must achieve the Prajñāpāramitā.

538
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,119
Should this wish remain unfulfilled,
I vow not to attain Sambodhi.

539
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,200
It's a line from a scripture.

540
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,440
What does it mean?

541
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,400
This...

542
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,720
You say this is a line from a scripture.

543
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,880
Yes, a scripture.

544
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
What does it mean?

545
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,440
It means...

546
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:28,920
Jialuo.

547
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,799
I'm not a monk.

548
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,720
How can I interpret the scripture?

549
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,319
But these words are engraved on it.

550
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,440
There must mean something.

551
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,599
Fine.

552
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,440
If you ask me,

553
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,920
it only means that this jar
is related to a senior monk

554
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,200
and the temple.

555
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,680
However, the bottom is already gone.

556
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,720
It's impossible to tell
which temple specifically.

557
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,079
Since this jar

558
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,920
is for storing the relics
of a senior monk,

559
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,839
then

560
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,119
he must be Bodhi's inheritor.

561
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,720
I think so too.

562
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,440
But there are no relics inside

563
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,279
or ashes.

564
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,440
It's just an empty jar.

565
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,920
The relics or ashes of a senior monk

566
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
are usually enshrined in temples.

567
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,720
But this was buried in a mass grave.

568
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:06,920
This is new to me.

569
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,400
That makes it even more problematic.

570
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,759
Obviously, it was placed inside a tomb

571
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,279
to preserve clues.

572
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,920
So the temple
that housed this porcelain jar

573
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,039
is the real place that hides the secret.

574
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,240
Mr. Muqing.

575
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,880
What do you think?

576
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,599
Yes.

577
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,079
That must be the case.

578
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,400
It seems we have to start to
investigate from the temple.

579
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,720
Well.

580
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,640
I will send someone to the Fenzhou Yamen

581
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,240
and have them ready all the documents

582
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,839
on Shanxi's temples for us to check.

583
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,400
Alright.

584
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,920
Then I will return to military camp.

585
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,680
In the archives of Beiyang,

586
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,519
there must be records
related to temples.

587
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,279
Let's split up.

588
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,880
Keep each other informed
once find any new clues

589
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:46,920
and work together.

590
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Why are you still up?

591
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,000
We went through so much
to find the Bodhi tomb

592
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,039
and dug up the porcelain jar.

593
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,359
Then you had to destroy it.

594
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,960
Now the clue is completely gone.

595
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,079
What should we do next?

596
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,079
Do you really think

597
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,359
that I destroyed the porcelain jar
because I had to?

598
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,920
If you hadn't destroyed
the porcelain jar.

599
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,519
Men Sandao and that local constable

600
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,319
would have discovered the secret within.

601
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,039
I saw two sentences on the bottom.

602
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,186
(Produced by the Great Zen Anhui Temple)

603
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,400
At that time,

604
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,519
I couldn't take it with me,

605
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,240
so I destroyed it.

606
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,400
Just to stop Men Sandao and Mr. Wang

607
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,559
from following the clue.

608
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,599
By doing so,

609
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,960
they will quit following us for now.

610
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,640
I remember on that porcelain jar,

611
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,799
there were some engraved characters.

612
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,440
It's a line from a scripture,

613
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,599
which coincides with the action

614
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,799
of Southern Shaolin inheritors
to cost their lives to protect

615
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:14,839
Altar Treasure.

616
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,880
We finally

617
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,640
are getting closer to the treasure.

618
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,000
You are too slow. Do it again.

619
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,559
Good, this is fast.

620
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,680
Good.

621
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,519
Who is that young guard?

622
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,720
Mr. Chatai.

623
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,559
That is a newly recruited
Blue-Feathered Guard.

624
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,519
His name is Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

625
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,160
He is quite skilled for his young age.

626
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,839
Sir.

627
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,279
Muqing just turned 17 this autumn.

628
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,839
He practiced this since little

629
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,559
and his swordsmanship
is quite remarkable.

630
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,400
Where does he serve now?

631
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,160
He serves as the Emperor's guard,
patrolling around Qianqing Gate.

632
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,559
Six third-rank guards

633
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,960
are not his match.

634
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,000
To have him be
just a Blue-Feathered Guard

635
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,319
is a total waste.

636
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:09,880
Make him a third-rank.

637
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,359
A second-rank guard.

638
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,519
Muqing.

639
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,240
Come here and thank Mr. Chatai.

640
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,000
He has just promoted you by two ranks.

641
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,960
He can be promoted
by two ranks with such skills?

642
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,079
Mr. Chatai.

643
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,079
It is too easy to be under your command.

644
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,680
Then what do you think

645
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,559
can convince you?

646
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,160
Muqing.

647
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,279
He is the leader
of the Elite Knight Battalion,

648
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,920
also known as
the First Swordsman of the capital.

649
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,559
Youngster.

650
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,200
Have a bout with me.

651
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,440
You are a first-rank guard now

652
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,920
and also granted the position
of patrolling the Imperial Study.

653
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Starting from today,

654
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,680
you will assist me
in guarding the Emperor.

655
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,079
Thank you, sir.

656
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,039
Since when you practiced martial arts?

657
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,839
Sir.

658
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,440
When I was five.

659
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,799
Your kung fu is remarkable.

660
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,160
Who is your master?

661
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,400
I have no master.

662
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,400
Really?

663
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,319
I learned by myself.

664
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,680
I never had a master.

665
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,119
I will meet the Emperor.

666
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,599
You may kneel down here.

667
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,160
Yes.

668
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:38,720
Master.

669
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,079
Master.

670
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,720
When will I see you again?

671
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,599
I am your master and you're my disciple.
It's already something.

672
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,039
People come and go.

673
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,839
It's time to part ways.

674
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,160
Why so stubborn?

675
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,640
But I don't want you to leave.

676
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,680
A sword can shatter bamboo.

677
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,200
You are a swordsman.

678
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,519
How could you cry?

679
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,319
Get up.

680
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,440
Wipe your tears away.

681
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
From now on,

682
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,519
I am no longer your master.

683
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,519
And you must not tell anyone else

684
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,599
that I have been your master.

685
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,359
Master, why?

686
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,240
With the lofty ambition,

687
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,480
I must achieve the Prajñāpāramitā.

688
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,720
Should this wish remain unfulfilled,

689
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,039
I vow not to attain Sambodhi.

690
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,519
Master.

691
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,039
Do you have any

692
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,559
unaccomplished cause?

693
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,519
Is that why you are leaving?

694
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,880
You do not understand

695
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,440
what this saying means.

696
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,280
Perhaps one day
you will come to a realization.

697
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:29,880
Or perhaps

698
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,440
you will never understand.

699
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,360
Can't you just tell me?

700
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,800
I can teach you kung fu,
and teach you cultivations.

701
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,320
But self-cultivation

702
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,599
must rely on your own experience

703
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,480
when you go explore the world.

704
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,119
Master.

705
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,159
That's it.

706
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,039
Remember, starting from today,

707
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,320
you no longer have me as your master.

708
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,199
Master.

709
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,639
Are you, the man who taught me
swordsmanship when I was young,

710
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,559
the chief of Bodhi Department
of Southern Shaolin?

711
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,599
Is the Bodhi's inheritor

712
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,519
that I am pursuing

713
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,400
my fellow disciple?

714
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,039
Master.

715
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,000
What exactly is your lofty ambition?

716
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,400
Could it be to hand over secret treasure

717
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,480
guarded for centuries
by Southern Shaolin

718
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,119
to the Tongmenghui?

719
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,679
Could it be

720
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,880
to overthrow

721
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,079
the Qing Dynasty?

722
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,039
You once said

723
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,639
that perhaps one day
I would come to a realization.

724
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,159
Is this what you wanted?

725
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,119
All these years, I never thought

726
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,239
that you would be a traitor to the court

727
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,199
and an enemy of the Qing Dynasty.

728
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,119
Why?

729
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,159
Why will it be like this?

730
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:52,880
Master.

731
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,960
I would rather I had never

732
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,480
found this tomb.

733
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,320
I would prefer this secret

734
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,400
to have remained buried
and unknown forever.
