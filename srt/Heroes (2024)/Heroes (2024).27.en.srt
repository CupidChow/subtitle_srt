1
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:14,635
If something happens to me,
the secret must not be lost.

2
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,220
We are comrades.
You will carry on my cause.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,244
I have to entrust it to you.

4
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,610
Remember the secret of the Bodhi Seal.

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,650
Have you remembered?

6
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,370
Yes.

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,370
I've never known how
to unlock this secret.

8
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,729
But since it exists,
there must be a reason.

9
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:42,569
It must be so.

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,730
I'm glad you remembered.

11
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,289
I will be careful, and you must be too.

12
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,090
We all need to stay safe.

13
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,210
I'm leaving now, Muqing. Take care.

14
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,210
Take care, princess.

15
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,169
Muqing, there's something
I often think about.

16
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:24,369
Please tell, princess.

17
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:45,289
We both take care.

18
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,616
(Fragrance of Tea)

19
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,529
I don't want to hear you
call me princess.

20
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:48,050
If everything had been different,
I wouldn't be just a princess to you.

21
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,450
If the reform had been successful,

22
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:55,089
I wouldn't be a princess.

23
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,369
But it failed,
so now I am still a princess to you.

24
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:08,649
So what's the point

25
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,890
of guarding this dynasty
that let you gain nothing?

26
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,170
Do you love this dynasty?

27
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,809
But aside from the pain,
what else has this dynasty given you?

28
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,730
I will marry a famous general's son.
He has also studied abroad like me.

29
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,649
He's the youngest leader in Beiyang Army
with a promising career.

30
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,689
Our dynasty is growing unrest.

31
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:48,210
Civil officials are
becoming less powerful and significant.

32
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,649
Military officials are gaining more say,
especially those in Beiyang Army.

33
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:57,050
Beiyang Army is the Qing Dynasty's
most elite modern army.

34
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:01,290
I am a princess, and he is a soldier.

35
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,730
This is also crucial
for the future political landscape.

36
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:12,929
You might never leave this prison.

37
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:16,010
I have to forget you.

38
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,929
There is nothing that time can't erase.
You are not different.

39
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:27,050
Nothing in this world
can be retained forever.

40
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,089
Beauty fades like
flowers falling from trees.

41
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,890
If you regain your freedom one day,

42
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,649
I hope by then
you will have forgotten me.

43
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,896
(I've lost the place where I live.
I have nowhere to be.)

44
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:07,940
(I will survive by just a little water.)

45
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,856
(I can't believe you say such things.)

46
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:12,384
(It would have been better
to find me at the dried fish stores.)

47
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:43,968
=Heroes=

48
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,688
=Episode 27=

49
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,089
Get inside.

50
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:05,210
Now, answer my questions.

51
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,250
If I'm not satisfied with your answer,
or if you lie to me, I'll blind you.

52
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,289
The last time
you said this to me in Shanxi,

53
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,330
you wanted to chop my fingers.

54
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,370
Did you talk about the revolution
with the princess?

55
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,010
No.

56
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,049
Your look changed.
It means you are lying.

57
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,930
A needle is placed an inch away.
Of course, my look changed.

58
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,169
I'll ask one more time.

59
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,330
Did you talk about the revolution
with the princess at her place?

60
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,210
No.

61
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,130
Then why have you two become so close
in just two days?

62
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,969
That was the lady's talk.

63
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:30,609
Ladies can become familiar by chatting.

64
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:32,210
Did you tell her
about the Altar Treasure?

65
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,130
Are you crazy? She's the daughter
of a prince of Qing Imperial Court.

66
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,289
How would I tell her about that?

67
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,250
Zhong Haichao took up a post in Fujian.
It's obviously about the Altar Treasure.

68
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,810
I said I was going to
Quanzhou on purpose.

69
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,810
At that moment,
you glanced at each other.

70
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,089
Men Sandao, you idiot.

71
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,049
Say that again.

72
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,089
You idiot.

73
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,370
Yes. We both glanced at each other
when you mentioned it.

74
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,289
But don't you understand why?

75
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,289
I don't understand.

76
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,729
She was happy knowing that,
and I was happy for her.

77
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,649
Happy?

78
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,570
Wulan Shan told me
about the story between you two.

79
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,489
Can you take that thing away now?

80
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:09,210
How could she possibly tell you that?

81
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,489
She thought we were lovers.
I've already warned you.

82
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:14,810
How could you, a Bannerman,
have a Han Chinese as your relative?

83
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,729
Do you think she would believe you?

84
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,810
Even if she didn't believe me,
she wouldn't have asked you.

85
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,729
Come on. You have no idea
what a jealous lady could do?

86
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:25,770
She kept beating around the bush
because she thought we were lovers.

87
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,010
When she believed that
it is not the fact,

88
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,770
she told me everything about you two.

89
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,529
You two are each other's first loves.
You were deeply in love.

90
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,250
But this has been found out
by Emperor Guangxu.

91
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,010
He wanted to be your matchmaker.
Am I wrong?

92
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,049
How did you convince her to believe you?

93
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,849
I said I am the daughter
of a friend of your master.

94
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,690
My father is also a Reformist.

95
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,050
But he died somewhere else,
and I had nowhere to go.

96
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:54,050
I used the information left
before my father died and found you.

97
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:57,570
She cried when she heard it.
And she was convinced then.

98
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,729
If we have told the same story,
she shouldn't have doubted a thing.

99
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:02,690
Why did she cry?

100
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,264
Because of you!
If it weren't for the reform,

101
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:11,889
you would have been her husband
and the prince's son-in-law.

102
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,210
Do you think she really wants to marry
that general of Beiyang Army?

103
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,089
I've seen that man.
Wulan Shan doesn't like him at all.

104
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,729
Now you know why she was happy
when you said you were going to Fujian?

105
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,969
She's happy even just
to take a glance at you.

106
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,249
Do not tell anyone else about this.

107
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:39,889
Are we heading to your place?

108
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:41,690
Yes.

109
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,930
Are you going to Quanzhou?

110
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,249
Yes.

111
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,312
Your master.

112
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:16,102
(Master, Cheng Yu's spirit tablet)

113
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:18,530
The third inheritor
to Bodhi Department of Southern Shaolin.

114
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,530
(Master, Cheng Yu's spirit tablet)

115
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,410
Cheng Yu is a great man.

116
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:26,290
He had dedicated his life to the future
of the nation and the people.

117
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:30,330
He left behind
clues of the Altar Treasure.

118
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:35,369
His wish is to hand it over to someone

119
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:40,930
who can truly change the future
of the nation and the people.

120
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:46,129
That person is not Xuantong,
or anyone named Aisin-Gioro.

121
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,410
That person
shall be called revolutionist.

122
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,296
(Head of the Imperial
Household Department)

123
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,849
You lost your freedom
due to reform back then.

124
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:11,089
Now, you become a lackey
for a more decadent imperial power.

125
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,969
Don't you think you have betrayed
your belief over these 12 years?

126
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:21,450
If everything had been different,
I wouldn't be just a princess to you.

127
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,290
Do you love this dynasty?

128
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,410
But aside from the pain,
what else has this dynasty given you?

129
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:51,089
When things hit a dead end,
we must change a new path.

130
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:55,170
The world is undergoing significant
changes unseen in three thousand years.

131
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,170
Adhering to the old ways
and isolating from change

132
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,650
will only lead our nation
to fall further behind and be weaker.

133
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,450
If this continues,
our nation will perish.

134
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:16,516
(Zhili, Chongling)

135
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,969
Your Majesty, I have many questions.

136
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,410
I don't know
if I am doing the right thing.

137
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,609
I know you wanted a strong Qing Dynasty.

138
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,089
But how can it be strong today?

139
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,009
I have protected the imperial power
with all my might.

140
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,170
But am I really
guarding the peace of the Qing Dynasty?

141
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,930
Mr. Cunqing has been tirelessly
in search of the secret treasure.

142
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,530
Is he doing it
for the prosperity of the nation?

143
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,729
Why have the Reformists
become our enemies now?

144
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,969
Liang Qichao once said
he wanted a Young China.

145
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,969
But why do today's young people
give up on the court?

146
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,249
Are they wrong or I am?

147
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,410
My mentor is now seen
as an enemy by the court.

148
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:48,249
But he is helping the Reformists
and helping you.

149
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:53,729
Has he gone astray

150
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,969
or have I been lost all along?

151
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,089
I was once a spirited guard.

152
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,849
The Emperor's guard
with unparalleled glory.

153
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:40,530
But why can't I feel proud
of what I do anymore?

154
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,489
I never hesitated
when you promoted the reform.

155
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,530
Why now do I often want
to run away from all this?

156
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,769
Am I wrong,
or have I simply lost my faith?

157
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,410
Your Majesty!
If we had won 12 years ago,

158
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,889
and if the reform had been successful,
how great that would have been.

159
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,450
How great that would have been.

160
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:30,530
Now,

161
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:37,849
I really don't know
what to do, Your Majesty.

162
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:44,410
Your Majesty,

163
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,089
I do not know what to do.

164
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,050
The place just brought up many memories.
Sorry for the disturbance so late.

165
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,889
It was nothing, sir.

166
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,489
The rain stopped. I should leave.

167
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:51,810
Please be safe, sir.

168
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:10,112
(All are equal regardless of status)
(Made in the 4th year of Tongzhi)

169
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,610
Who are you? This is a waist token
of the Imperial Household Department.

170
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,370
What does this sentence mean?

171
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,130
Why is it engraved on your waist token?

172
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:44,450
Sir, I am Irgen-Gioro Muqing,
a second-rank guard of the Department.

173
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,529
I'm investigating a case.
Were you an imperial guard before?

174
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:51,529
How come this sentence
is on the waist token?

175
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,360
It's been 43 years.
Why the Imperial Household Department

176
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:09,729
still doesn't give up
on the Altar Treasure?

177
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,210
You know about the Altar Treasure?

178
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,049
(E Clan)
Luan Yi.

179
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,170
Your name is Luan Yi?

180
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,049
Mr. Luan Yi was a first-rank guard.
I was not.

181
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:31,650
I was just a Blue-Feathered Guard
in the Imperial Household Department.

182
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,969
Then why do you have this waist token?

183
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:42,769
Do you want to know
what happened back then?

184
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,080
As I said earlier,
I am investigating this case.

185
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:51,410
Then you must have read the records
of the Imperial Household Department.

186
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,569
It will surely have a record
of what happened 43 years ago.

187
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,450
I would still like you to say it.

188
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,969
Maybe what you remember
is different from the record.

189
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,090
Haven't you read the record?

190
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,850
The Department did have a record
of searching the treasure 43 years ago.

191
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,489
However, the record is simple.
They found nothing.

192
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,769
Indeed, they found nothing.

193
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,569
The record said the fact.

194
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,450
Otherwise, many more people
would have been implicated.

195
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,009
So you're saying the record I have seen
wasn't the real one.

196
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,212
(Martial Number 361)
You have Luan Yi's waist token.

197
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:45,690
But you say you are not him.
So I presume he was dead.

198
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,329
A first-rank guard died.

199
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:51,769
Yet the Imperial Household Department
has no records of it.

200
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,329
I think keeping vigil here
is your punishment.

201
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,352
It seems you didn't just find nothing
but were utterly defeated.

202
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:02,720
It was so shameful and tragic.

203
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,809
So the Department
didn't put it on record, right?

204
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,410
Sir, you are an old man.

205
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,610
I won't take you to the imperial yamen
and interrogate you under torture.

206
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,410
Besides, a Blue-Feathered Guard like you

207
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,969
has been demoted to keep vigil here.

208
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:20,529
There's nothing worse than this.

209
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:21,650
You are my senior.

210
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,930
Please consider it a favor. Talk to me.

211
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,809
If you tell me,
I promise no one will trouble you.

212
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,890
As what you said,

213
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:35,969
I am already in the worst condition.
What trouble am I afraid of?

214
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:37,769
Then let's talk.

215
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,249
You were one of the guards searching
for Altar treasure 43 years ago, right?

216
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,969
43 years ago,
what the Department dispatched

217
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:57,130
was not one team, but two.

218
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,969
Only few guards
who went to Shanxi survived.

219
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,769
So another team
was dispatched to Fujian.

220
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,049
I was a member of that team.

221
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,090
The leader was Luan Yi.

222
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,890
After arriving in Fujian, Mr. Luan

223
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,009
targeted a Xianghua monk
who often appeared.

224
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,329
Do you know what Xianghua monks are?

225
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:32,489
They don't live in the temple. They eat
meat, grow hair, and get married.

226
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:35,930
They only look like monks
when they wear robes for rituals.

227
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,529
Right.

228
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:44,210
He thought perhaps Xianghua monk
was an inheritor of Southern Shaolin.

229
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,729
So, we started the search.

230
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:52,009
Indeed, we discovered many things
that were suspicious.

231
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:52,850
Please be specific.

232
00:21:54,809 --> 00:22:01,210
Kung fu. All of those monks
were highly skilled in kung fu.

233
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:06,769
The Xianghua monk Mr. Luan was after
was named Wu Shuangbao.

234
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:12,729
He exerted a lot of effort
and finally found Wu Shuangbao.

235
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,569
But at that time another guard and I
had official matter elsewhere.

236
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:23,450
When we received the order
and rushed to the rendezvous point,

237
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,170
Mr. Luan and other guards
had all disappeared without a trace.

238
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,370
The two of us searched
for over three months.

239
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:38,529
At last, we found the inn
where Mr. Luan had stayed.

240
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:39,450
(Luan Yi)

241
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,690
(Luan Yi)
We found this waist token there.

242
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,969
But no one was found there.

243
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:50,090
We had no choice
but to return to the capital to report.

244
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,890
(Made in the 4th year of Tongzhi)

245
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:56,130
So many first-ranked guards
sacrificed within such a short time.

246
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,650
It was a major issue.
No one wanted to take responsibility.

247
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,729
So it was reasonable
that they did not make a record of it.

248
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:12,489
Then I was demoted and transferred here
to guard the imperial mausoleum.

249
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,529
43 years ago
was the 7th year of Tongzhi.

250
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,729
Yes.

251
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,090
The place where you found the token
was the inn where Luan Yi had stayed.

252
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:23,370
Right.

253
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,090
What is the name of that inn?

254
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,529
It's an earthen building.

255
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,170
The locals called it
the Earthen Building Inn.

256
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:36,769
Where is the inn?

257
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:40,690
In the west of Quanzhou,
if I remember it right.

258
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,569
Do you still remember the time
when you were ordered to convene?

259
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,569
The end of the 7th month.

260
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:50,249
When was the token found?

261
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:51,610
The 7th day of the 8th month.

262
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,450
You have found them for over ten days?

263
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:55,329
Yes.

264
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:01,249
By then, Luan Yi had been gone
for eight or nine days.

265
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:04,969
During those ten days,
no one had touched this token?

266
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:09,969
When Mr. Luan and others left the inn,
they left a lot of money for the rooms.

267
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,090
So the innkeeper
didn't rent out the rooms.

268
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,890
They cleaned the rooms every day
and left them unoccupied.

269
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:25,249
The innkeeper said
no one had seen this waist token.

270
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,690
If someone cleaned up the rooms,
how come they didn't see the token?

271
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,489
Perhaps the waist token
wasn't left behind by Luan Yi.

272
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:34,650
Instead, it was placed in the room
by someone on purpose later.

273
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,690
Sir, you must have checked
the writing on this, right?

274
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,890
I was not acquainted with Mr. Luan.

275
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,569
After returning to
the Imperial Household Department,

276
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:52,769
I went to a clerk
who had past dealings with him.

277
00:24:53,729 --> 00:25:00,009
I had him compare the writing.
He said it wasn't Luan's handwriting.

278
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:05,969
Sir, you have said a lot.
Please continue.

279
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:09,049
What's the point
of keeping the secret now?

280
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,370
You compared the handwriting.

281
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,969
That means you were quite suspicious
about what happened.

282
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:16,370
So what exactly raised your suspicion?

283
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,130
You are very discerning.

284
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:34,370
43 years ago,
Mr. Luan was a formidable man.

285
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,049
He was decisive and ruthless,

286
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,969
without any compassion.

287
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:44,210
Do you mean a man like him

288
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,450
would not write the sentence
from the scriptures?

289
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:49,289
I don't believe
he could stop the killings.

290
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:53,529
Let alone
he could achieve instant enlightenment.

291
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:57,130
None of the guards following Luan Yi
to track the Xianghua monk returned?

292
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,049
Not a single one returned.

293
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:06,170
(Made in the 4th year of Tongzhi)
Who put the token back in the inn?

294
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,850
I have been pondering this
for so many years.

295
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,529
And still, I still can't figure it out.

296
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:18,009
We've talked for so long.
But I don't know your name.

297
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:23,249
I'm just an old man
who watches over the dead.

298
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,289
Just call me old man.

299
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:28,729
I'll have someone fetch you some tea,

300
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,610
some wine and cured meat to you later.

301
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,450
Along with some fine tobacco.

302
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,489
Well, thank you very much.

303
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,489
Soon, I will head to Fujian
and do the same thing you did back then.

304
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,210
If I find out who put this waist token
back in the inn,

305
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,329
I will come back and tell you.

306
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,370
It's been 43 years. Can you find out?

307
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,370
It's been 43 years. We should seize time
before it's too late.

308
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:09,450
You are awake.

309
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,450
Go get some sleep.
I will watch outside for you.

310
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,410
No need, go back to sleep, go.

311
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,650
No. You need to get enough rest
to chase after them.

312
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,650
I'm used to it. Go back to sleep. Go.

313
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,529
Then I'll go buy you something to eat.

314
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,450
It's them.

315
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,690
I'll go outside. Wait for me here.

316
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:42,489
Remember.
Don't go out or get near the window.

317
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:46,468
(Chuanshan's Posthumous Works)

318
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,009
Do you know
you're reading a banned book?

319
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:22,410
Banned book? When was it banned?

320
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,890
When Qianlong Emperor ruled.

321
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,809
How will you punish those
who wrote banned books?

322
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:29,529
Confiscation of property, execution,
and dismemberment.

323
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:30,729
What about reading banned books?

324
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:36,210
It depends. For a book like this,
you should be executed or amputated.

325
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,529
What if someone hides banned books?

326
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:40,930
Confiscation of property.
Perhaps execution.

327
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,729
This book is yours.
It's in the cabinet in the room I stay.

328
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,090
Seizing banned books is part of my duty
as an imperial guard.

329
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,489
Didn't you just get home from jail?

330
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,569
And you had time to seize banned books?

331
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,769
It was during the reform, right?
You must have read it.

332
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,650
Do you know?

333
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,210
Mr. Chuan Shan was
the venerable teacher of Tan Sitong.

334
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,809
Liang Qichao was also
deeply influenced by him.

335
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:16,729
I'm giving you this book.

336
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:21,529
Never mind, give it back.

337
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,489
I've given you so much,
and you've never told me anything.

338
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,130
That's because
what you gave me was too cheap.

339
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,489
Right, what did you do
so late yesterday?

340
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:40,130
Come on. Don't forget
only I know the secret of Bodhi Seal.

341
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,249
I am quite likely to collaborate
with you now.

342
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,170
Let's keep each other informed
if there's any information.

343
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:50,289
Alright, I'll tell you.
I knew something important last night.

344
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,489
43 years ago, in 7th year of Tongzhi,
the first-rank imperial guard

345
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:56,090
sent to Fujian to investigate
the secret treasure was named Luan Yi.

346
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,249
And then?

347
00:29:57,249 --> 00:29:57,769
Then Luan Yi...

348
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:01,170
Muqing. Muqing.

349
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,930
Lin Haohan.

350
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,610
He came here twice for you this morning.
But you were so deeply asleep.

351
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,170
Is it time to set off?

352
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,370
Buddy, we had an agreement.

353
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,450
I provided such crucial clues.

354
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,650
I should follow along
to search for the secret treasure.

355
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,650
And that person that day...

356
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:22,210
Right here. I didn't hear

357
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,049
what he said to you at all.

358
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:27,569
The thirty-year pact
he told you is up soon.

359
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:32,130
I need to follow you
and be at your service at any time.

360
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,969
You can forget all the things
I've done for you before.

361
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,090
I reassembled the Sheli Box,
figured out the Anhui Temple,

362
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,610
and discovered the words on your box.
Also there was Ze Ze.

363
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,729
Right? Let's forget these.
Having me will be helpful for you.

364
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:50,170
Even if I'm not useful,
I'll bring good luck.

365
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,450
Did I say I wouldn't take you with me?

366
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:54,210
No, of course not.

367
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,890
I just came to ask when we are leaving.

368
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,729
Should we set off earlier?
I need to prepare.

369
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,130
Also, Muqing.
About the 10 percent we agreed on.

370
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,450
We're not changing that.
It is set in stone, okay?

371
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,370
We are all decent people.
You need to keep your word.

372
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:21,890
Lin Haohan, you must have
made a good fortune from your business.

373
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,840
You can afford to rent a large store
in Qianmen.

374
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,090
So you can't be short of money.

375
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,489
Why do you insist on treasure-hunting
but leave the business behind?

376
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:32,009
Muqing, I am short of money.

377
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:34,690
Look at those rich businessmen
like Wu Bingjian and Hu Xueyan.

378
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,090
I am no match for them.

379
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,690
My greatest wish is
to become immensely rich.

380
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,569
Searching for the secret treasure
is a great chance to fulfill my wish.

381
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,650
But what if we can't find it?

382
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,650
If so, that means
I'm not destined for it.

383
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,450
But I can at least try,
as I am an ambitious man.

384
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,370
Still want to bring
this sycophantic man?

385
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,130
He has his strengths.

386
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,049
He has helped me
find new clues several times.

387
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,329
That's why you bribed him willingly.

388
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,170
I've never given him any money.

389
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,329
If he wants to gain something,
he has to work by himself.

390
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:11,569
Besides, compared to hypocrites,
I prefer his kind.

391
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:13,329
You haven't explained about Luan Yi yet.

392
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:16,650
Do you expect me to shout at you
from such a distance?

393
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,969
The imperial guard from 43 years ago
was your predecessor.

394
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,890
Did he discover something extraordinary?

395
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,009
He vanished into thin air
during the investigation.

396
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,210
Sir, please tell me
if you want something.

397
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:42,610
As long as I have it,
I will certainly give it to you.

398
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:49,489
I want you to tell me
about the Altar Treasure.

399
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:53,569
My father and I
have already said it so many times.

400
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:56,210
But I want you to say it once more.

401
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,729
Alright, I'll say it.

402
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:06,009
My grandfather Xu He accidentally
knew the secret of our sect.

403
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:10,489
It was the 28th year of Daoguang.

404
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:13,920
(The 28th year of Daoguang)

405
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:19,930
It's been 13 years. You once asked me
what sect we belonged to.

406
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:23,930
Everything I told you was not real.

407
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:29,210
Our true sect is Disciplinary Department
of Southern Shaolin.

408
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:33,329
The reason why we hide ourselves
and keep our sect a secret

409
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:38,210
is because we
are protecting a huge secret.

410
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,288
My grandfather heard this secret.

411
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:44,729
Then he knew there was a huge treasure
called the Altar Treasure.

412
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:51,170
The chief of the Disciplinary Department
had the treasure map with the location.

413
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:53,969
My grandfather became greedy.

414
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:59,969
He thought it was a rare opportunity
for glory and wealth.

415
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:05,329
So, shortly after his master's death,

416
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,210
he poisoned his senior
who was to inherit the chief position.

417
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,289
After obtaining the treasure map,
he studied it for a long time.

418
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,529
But he couldn't understand
the treasure map at all,

419
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:20,849
so he was unable
to find this vast fortune.

420
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:24,970
After mulling over it for over a year,
to curry favor with the local officials,

421
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,409
(Chengdu Government Office)
he gave the map to county magistrate.

422
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,809
Surprisingly, not long after,
the Governor of Zhili summoned him

423
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:34,249
and gave him a generous reward

424
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:37,409
as well as
a fifth-rank official position.

425
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:42,929
It is said that the Department searched
multiple times but found nothing.

426
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:47,809
They thought there were not
enough clues on the treasure map.

427
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,610
So the Department stepped in

428
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,650
and made my grandfather
the owner of a martial arts school,

429
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,369
hoping to attract other inheritors
of the Southern Shaolin

430
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,289
to obtain more clues.

431
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:05,170
One day, in the 7th year of Tongzhi,

432
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:08,889
a gravely injured young man
came to the martial arts school.

433
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,809
Are you looking for me?

434
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:14,010
Yes. Are you the chief
of the Disciplinary Department?

435
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,610
Yes. I am.

436
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,809
Greetings, uncle master.

437
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:23,369
He asked and then knew the young man was
the fourth chief inheritor of Dharma.

438
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,369
You are the inheritor of Dharma!
Come on, please come inside.

439
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:31,849
After settling him down,
my grandfather reported to the court.

440
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,369
That night, led by six imperial guards,
three groups got there.

441
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,889
However, before they arrived...

442
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,490
Young man.

443
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,570
The inheritor of Dharma
said to my grandfather.

444
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:51,329
With the lofty ambition,
I must achieve the Prajñāpāramitā.

445
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,249
My grandfather was confused
and raised the young man's suspicion.

446
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:56,970
It's alright, uncle master.
Let's have tea.

447
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,809
The moment guards
of the Department arrived,

448
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,329
the inheritor of Dharma
hurt my grandfather severely and fled.

449
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:32,170
My grandfather passed away soon.

450
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,449
Then do you know
about the thirty-year pact?

451
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:40,130
No. The officials came before
also never asked about it.

452
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,970
What about the Baohe Inn?

453
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,369
Never heard of it either.

454
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,010
This family has no
kung fu skills at all.

455
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:51,729
Look, they can hardly bear it
after being in the sun for just a while.

456
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:56,490
Sir.

457
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,849
Alright. Fortunately,
they don't know much useful.

458
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,570
Otherwise,
you would have died, Wang Jialuo.

459
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,929
Wang Jialuo?

460
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,369
He has been on the roof for so long.
Aren't you tired?

461
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:21,530
Bufan, he has Beiyang Army
behind his back.

462
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,170
Leave him alone. Let's leave.

463
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,729
Don't you know him?

464
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:28,729
If he really had troops with him,
he would have come out with guns.

465
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:31,490
Bufan, we still need to go to Fujian.

466
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,249
Don't complicate matters any further.

467
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:35,050
Don't worry, Huanjie,
I know what I'm doing.

468
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:37,289
He is an inheritor of Dharma.

469
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,929
I won't kill him
before I obtain the Dharma Seal.

470
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:48,610
Wang Jialuo, the Xu Family
caused your master to go crazy.

471
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:52,090
If you want to revenge,
they are all yours.

472
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:54,929
Let's go.

473
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:00,929
How to investigate things and people
43 years ago?

474
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,289
Once things happened,
there would always be traces to track.

475
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:10,769
Did Luan Yi leave behind
something important?

476
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,490
That would be the clue
to the secret treasure.

477
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,090
(Made in the 4th year of Tongzhi)
A first-rank guard vanished back then.

478
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,050
This is an important matter itself.

479
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,050
This token was placed back in the inn.
What was the purpose?

480
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,130
To distract the imperial guards
who came later from the Department

481
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,849
and make them focus
from the treasure to Luan Yi.

482
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:30,090
Leaving such a Buddha scripture behind

483
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,690
was to make things look complex
and mislead the investigation.

484
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,809
You already know the clue.
Why look for Luan Yi?

485
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:39,329
Were all the Tongmenghui people
so slow-witted like you?

486
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:40,329
It's such an insult.

487
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,690
They did this 43 years ago
was to stop the people later.

488
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,249
Looking for Luan Yi
means looking for the clue.

489
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:58,130
(Made in the 4th year of Tongzhi)
All are equal regardless of status.

490
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,050
Could this sentence be...

491
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,650
These are not my master's handwriting.

492
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,690
If it were, Luan Yi would have
already been killed by him.

493
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:08,369
Or maybe he is not dead.

494
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:09,809
What do you mean?

495
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:14,329
Nothing. We can only find out
after investigation.

496
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,729
Pack your things. We're leaving.

497
00:39:18,729 --> 00:39:19,610
What do I have to pack?

498
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,490
Sunflower seed shells.

499
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,610
Do you hate the Xu Family very much now?

500
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,889
Their ancestors
caused your master to go insane.

501
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:35,449
I hate them. For their ruthless betrayal
of fellow disciples.

502
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:38,249
My master was traumatized and went crazy
because of that.

503
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:48,729
But even though I hate them,

504
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:54,449
but presenting the secret to the court
was morally upright.

505
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:57,889
Even if I want to avenge my master,

506
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:02,530
how could I make an enemy
out of someone with merit to the court?

507
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:15,769
I can only think that if not for them,
my master would not have become mad.

508
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,530
If my master were not mad,
he would not have become my master.

509
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,690
If my master truly
were an enemy of the court,

510
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,690
how could I
fulfill filial piety for him?

511
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,449
Since he has gone mad, I can only
consider him as my master.

512
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:48,090
To me, those who killed my master
are those from Rongtian Ridge.

513
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,570
It's Zhuo Bufan and Yu Huanjie.

514
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,610
I will seek them out for revenge.

515
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,329
Besides, they are the last two suspects
of the Dagu murder case.

516
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,490
Find the secret treasure. It's also what
your master wanted to protect.

517
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,929
If you find it,
the Rongtian Ridge will fail.

518
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,970
You can serve the court
and leave Zhuo Bufan in despair.

519
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,010
Revenge like this is truly meaningful.

520
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:28,809
Right, you're right.

521
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,650
This is Ze Ze Inn.

522
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,170
Quanzhou in Fujian?

523
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,130
It's not very convenient for us
to mobilize resources in Fujian.

524
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,849
Zhong Haichao
was also transferred to Fujian.

525
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,970
He must also be there
for the thirty-year pact.

526
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,409
So do we cooperate with him?

527
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:57,010
As long as there is a shared interest,
we can cooperate with anyone.

528
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:03,809
Besides, we know
what we want to get there.

529
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:05,610
So do we need to go to Fujian as well?

530
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,690
We have to go
and we also need to mobilize

531
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,249
all the military forces we can.

532
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,050
Our purpose for this trip
is not to find clues.

533
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,249
This time, we either get what we want

534
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:22,729
or no one gets it.
