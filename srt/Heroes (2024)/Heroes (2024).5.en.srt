1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,119
(During the Kangxi era,)

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,000
(the Eight Banners
besieged Southern Shaolin)

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,480
(and burnt down the temple completely.)

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,239
(The reasons behind this are varied.)

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,640
(But most people)

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,440
(in the Imperial Household Department
believe)

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,079
(that destroying Southern Shaolin
was to seize the Altar Treasure.)

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,320
(The last abbot of Southern Shaolin)

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,519
(coexisted with the temple.)

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:30,920
(Before passing away,)

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,840
(he handed over the treasure map
of Southern Shaolin's Altar Treasure)

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,960
(to the chief
of the Disciplinary Department.)

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,359
(He told him to live in seclusion)

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,840
(and keep the secret.)

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,240
(By the 28th year of the Daoguang era,)

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,320
(before the second-generation chief
of Disciplinary Department passed away,)

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,119
(he passed on his mantle
to his eldest disciple.)

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,119
(But his second disciple
overheard the secret.)

19
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,920
(This second disciple is Xu He.)

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,840
(He secretly killed the elder disciple,)

21
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,039
(who's the third-generation
chief inheritor.)

22
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,000
(Then Xu He took the treasure map
and defected to the imperial court.)

23
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,280
(By the 7th year of Tongzhi era,)

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,880
(Xu He reported to Qing Imperial Court)

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,480
(that a person)

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,719
(who proclaimed himself
to be an inheritor of Southern Shaolin)

27
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,680
(came to him.)

28
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,519
(He wanted to take this man down
with imperial guards)

29
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,159
(of the Imperial Household Department.)

30
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,680
(But unexpectedly,
his plan was exposed,)

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,519
(and he got killed by this man.)

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,480
(All the clues are gone.)

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,400
(Therefore, documents
about the Altar Treasure)

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,359
(became confidential)

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,159
(and was locked up in Wenyuan Pavilion
by Imperial Household Department.)

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,480
This all happened a long time ago.

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,239
Even Mr. Cunqing said

38
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,120
that this secret treasure

39
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,599
is merely a legend to him.

40
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,079
It may not even exist.

41
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,680
Then Southern Shaolin
has no other inheritors, right?

42
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,239
Xu He was not

43
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,799
the inheritor at all.

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,319
So he didn't know most of the secrets.

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
But he vaguely remembered

46
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,680
that his master had
some mysterious friends.

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,200
But he had no idea who they were,

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,840
nor where they would be.

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,040
Xu He is dead?

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,239
Right.

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
He deserved it.

52
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,480
So no one

53
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,120
ever mentioned this again.

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,960
Now Tan Xian appeared.

55
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,680
Could Tan Xian be

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,439
another inheritor
of the Southern Shaolin?

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,319
Perhaps.

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,159
If he really is,

59
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,000
with Zhuo Bufan
who has the treasure map,

60
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,120
and Tan Xian,

61
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,479
maybe we can find the Altar Treasure.

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Well,

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,599
Tan Xian is even
more crucial than Zhuo Bufan.

64
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,400
Getai.

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,479
Don't let Tan Xian get away.

66
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,439
He can't.

67
00:03:56,768 --> 00:04:01,792
=Heroes=

68
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:05,370
=Episode 5=

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,919
The scallion oil noodles

70
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,399
are still best made in Shanghai.

71
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,279
There's an old shop in City God Temple.

72
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,800
They make them even more delicious.

73
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,399
After we settle the case,

74
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,040
I'll accompany you
to stroll around there.

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,560
Okay.

76
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:43,130
(Maiqi Road, Shanghai)

77
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,519
We need over 2,600 steps

78
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,879
to walk down the Maiqi Road,

79
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,839
about

80
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,800
25 yin 14 zhang and one chi.

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,560
There are 11 shops
on the east side of the street.

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,000
Three clothing stores,

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,959
two grocery stores,

84
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,160
two fruit stores,

85
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,199
two restaurants,

86
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,160
(Book Store)
one book store,

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,959
(Bama Tea House)
and one tea house.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,560
There are nine shops
on the west side of the street.

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,519
One large restaurant,

90
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,839
(Bogu Store)
two foreigners' stores,

91
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,639
one fruit store, one jewelry store,

92
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,560
one gold shop,

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,000
and one shop that sells foreign bread.

94
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,920
The one above is

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,199
the foreign coffee shop.

96
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,800
Muqing, you are perceptive.

97
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,839
Trying to intercept people
on a street like this

98
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,920
only requires 15

99
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,800
capable guards,

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,680
even for a master.

101
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,079
Then we have enough manpower.

102
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,199
Muqing.

103
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,240
Maybe we should

104
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,399
get our men to wear these western suits.

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,399
We don't even know
where the contact person is.

106
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,160
Disguise ourselves
as members of the Tongmenghui

107
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,959
might give us away.

108
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,040
Just keep an eye on this street.

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,199
For his intersection, corner,

110
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,319
and this street,

111
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,720
we need to send more men to stand guard.

112
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,680
Understood.

113
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,000
What are you looking for?

114
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,639
I am wondering

115
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,720
where Zhuo Bufan will appear tomorrow.

116
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,879
I guess

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,720
he will definitely have his men

118
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,600
hide among these merchants.

119
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,399
Then we should deploy our men

120
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,639
all over the street.

121
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,879
So, we need

122
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,839
to have them disguise
themselves as passersby.

123
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,000
Merchants, tourists, peddlers, porters,

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
beggars, and vagrants as well.

125
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,720
Don't all disguise as the same type.

126
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,639
Got it.

127
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,959
This road isn't very long.

128
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,199
We've got enough men

129
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,800
to lock down the front.

130
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,959
No way.

131
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,360
If we do so,

132
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
Tan Xian and the others won't come in.

133
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,160
Position soldiers around Maiqi Road

134
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,079
and tell them to disguise.

135
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:41,839
Yes.

136
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,360
Did you take down
that county yamen's constable?

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,560
He can work on a case

138
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,519
with the Imperial Household Department.

139
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,519
It means that he must
be a master of stealth.

140
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,040
His martial arts are indeed

141
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,720
superior to those
of many Japanese samurais.

142
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,399
But I have already
knocked him off the cliff

143
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,680
and he is impossible to survive.

144
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,800
Did you

145
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,879
go down the cliff to look for his body?

146
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,920
You didn't?

147
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,360
There was no way

148
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,439
I could get down there.

149
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,720
Then how can you be sure

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,560
that he is impossible to survive?

151
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,399
Based on my judgment,

152
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,560
I think he must have been dead.

153
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,839
I hope so.

154
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,759
I hope you're right.

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,279
You're awake.

156
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,120
You saved me?

157
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,399
I can't.

158
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,079
You made it.

159
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,519
Eat some?

160
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,519
Take it.

161
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,120
Thank you.

162
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
You are a monk,

163
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:58,240
so why are you eating meat
and drinking wine?

164
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,320
What about the precepts?

165
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,399
Who told you I am a monk?

166
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,200
There's not a temple here,

167
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,840
let alone the precepts.

168
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,000
Furthermore,

169
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
following Buddhism is
all about the mind,

170
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,440
not related to the words

171
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,679
or the food.

172
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,120
You make sense.

173
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,559
You flattered me.

174
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,000
How much money do you owe?

175
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,200
Why were you attacked like this?

176
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
(Bama Tea House)
I want braised eel,

177
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,120
eight-treasure duck,

178
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
stir-fried herbage,

179
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,639
Yanduxian,

180
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,799
and stir-fried rice cake with crab.

181
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,679
Alright!

182
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,399
Sounds delicious.

183
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,360
Muqing, you are also
familiar with local dishes?

184
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,639
This is a nice place.

185
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,039
The whole street is in full view.

186
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,000
We'll observe any changes

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,039
here tomorrow.

188
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,519
This position should
be left for Zhuo Bufan.

189
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,080
Tomorrow we'll go upstairs for tea.

190
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,399
We have to be patient tomorrow.

191
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,360
We can't make any action

192
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,879
until Zhuo Bufan helps us

193
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,759
recognize Tan Xian.

194
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
At your disposal.

195
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,879
If these patrolmen meddled,

196
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,159
I'm afraid it would ruin our plan.

197
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,799
Go and notify the Patrol Yamen

198
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,919
to have all these patrolmen
transferred away tomorrow.

199
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,000
Muqing.

200
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,000
These are the patrolmen
from the Concession.

201
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,919
The Patrol Yamen can't control them.

202
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,000
Then who can?

203
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
It should be
the Concession's Public Council.

204
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,600
But it is controlled by foreigners.

205
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Ask the Patrol Yamen

206
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,159
to tell those foreigners

207
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,279
the court has a case to handle.

208
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,039
No matter what,

209
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,519
let us do our things.

210
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,049
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
I can't believe you

211
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:49,840
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
chased all the way from Dagu County.

212
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,960
Are you going to
keep chasing to Shanghai?

213
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,759
Yes.

214
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,519
What are you after?

215
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,240
You are a mere local constable.

216
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,759
Is it worth it?

217
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,224
To ordain conscience
for Heaven and Earth.

218
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,464
To secure life and fortune
for the people.

219
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,000
To continue lost teachings
for past sages.

220
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,919
To establish peace
for all future generations.

221
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,360
You really dream big.

222
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,759
Can't I?

223
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,080
You are persistent.

224
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,000
But you are too persistent.

225
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,519
Do you think you can bring justice

226
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,480
on your own?

227
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,919
You don't know

228
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,840
how much it takes

229
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,559
to bring justice.

230
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,960
You're never going

231
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,000
to accomplish this in your life.

232
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,600
Your life is short,

233
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,600
but the dynasty lives long.

234
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,399
It existed before you were born.

235
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
Maybe it still exists when you're dead.

236
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,399
You can't even live longer than it.

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,759
Why do you care about it?

238
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,399
I just think...

239
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,399
The Qing Dynasty has been around
for nearly 300 years.

240
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,120
You are only a young man.

241
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
You know nothing at all.

242
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,120
When you're dead,

243
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,559
your flesh will rot away.

244
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,080
What's left?

245
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,360
Fame lasts forever?

246
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,639
That's a lie.

247
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,200
There is no fame in a pile of bones.

248
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,559
Not just fame,

249
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,639
even notoriety can't last.

250
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,919
Being notorious

251
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,440
is not an ordinary thing as well.

252
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
I managed to survive.

253
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,759
And yet you say such words,

254
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,879
so why didn't you kill me
in the first place?

255
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,120
As a merely

256
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,159
a county yamen constable,

257
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,279
you can quote Zhuang Zhou's maxims.

258
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,600
Impressive.

259
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,039
Really impressive.

260
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,600
What's so hard about reading
books by sages?

261
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
The hard part is

262
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,279
to convey the idea
of the sages to others.

263
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,519
You can achieve great things.

264
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,159
Anyone who can achieve great things

265
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,600
must go through hardships.

266
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,919
You've got a tough road ahead of you.

267
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,759
What great things can I achieve?

268
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm a merely yamen constable.

269
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,480
All I think about is

270
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,639
being able to catch those murderers

271
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,639
and bring them back.

272
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,559
Because you are persistent,

273
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,759
so you will surely achieve great things.

274
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,919
Local constable,

275
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,960
fate has brought you this far.

276
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,360
You have no choice.

277
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,440
It's so hard to get drunk.

278
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,240
Local constable,

279
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,960
I have to go get some wine.

280
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,039
From here to Shanghai,

281
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,600
it takes half a day to walk.

282
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
You'd better get on the road.

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,080
Thank you for saving me.

284
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,720
If I...

285
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,639
If you can accomplish great things,

286
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,279
then I did a wise choice
to save you today.

287
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
(Shanghai Management Department)
Sir, I've been talking to the foreigners

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,159
at the Public Council
of French Concession all afternoon.

289
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,799
I have been exhausted.

290
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
And the foreigners finally agreed

291
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,039
to turn a blind eye,

292
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,679
and wouldn't hinder us.

293
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,679
From 8 AM

294
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,639
to 6 PM tomorrow,

295
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,879
there are 10 hours!

296
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,159
All the police forces on Maiqi Road

297
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,799
and the surrounding three streets
will be withdrawn.

298
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,039
It's a huge gesture.

299
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,559
What did he say?

300
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,000
From the hour of Chen
to the hour of You,

301
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,879
they can make things easier for us.

302
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,039
That's all?

303
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,480
You call it a huge gesture?

304
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Of course.

305
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,000
Those are foreigners.

306
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,360
They also made

307
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,679
some requests.

308
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,799
Requests?

309
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,440
Right.

310
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,159
They want us to promise

311
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,919
not to create chaos,

312
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,799
not to fire guns,

313
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,279
or harm any innocent.

314
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,440
I have to give face to them

315
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,960
when we do our things in our own place.

316
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,679
Mr. Mu.

317
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,919
This is not our own place.

318
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,360
This is the Concession.

319
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,320
Mr. Mu.

320
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,399
This is the foreigners' territory.

321
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,320
Just bear it.

322
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,120
Flowers for sale!

323
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,320
Would you like to buy some flowers?

324
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,679
(Menxing Hotel)
Flowers! Flowers!

325
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,960
Would you like to buy some flowers?

326
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,399
Excuse me, kid.

327
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,440
What?

328
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,440
Sir,

329
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,159
may I ask...

330
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,840
This is a hotel.

331
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,480
You either sleep or eat here.

332
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
What do you want to ask?

333
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,639
Why are you like this?

334
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm talking to you nicely.

335
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,960
What do you mean?

336
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,759
Look at you.

337
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,480
Hick!

338
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,039
Hick?

339
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,679
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

340
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,559
I am the constable of Dagu County Yamen,

341
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,280
and I come here to investigate a case.

342
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,559
Check it.

343
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,720
Constable of Dagu County Yamen.

344
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,080
Did you frighten me?

345
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,039
Dagu County of Tianjin.

346
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,039
What are you doing in Shanghai?

347
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,120
Look at you.

348
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,559
I think you picked this up.

349
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,639
You should pick a token
of a bigger city.

350
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,039
Laugh at me?

351
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,480
Laugh again, if you dare.

352
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,039
Sir!

353
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,679
Please don't be angry.

354
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,120
You are generous.

355
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,120
He's young and naive.

356
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,440
Let me ask you.

357
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,799
On the first day of the fourth month,

358
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,319
were there a group of people
in Lingxi costumes here?

359
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,720
Yes.

360
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,880
But they all left yesterday afternoon.

361
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,799
How many of them?

362
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,240
They've split up.

363
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,279
There were about 20 people.

364
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,279
They planned to book rooms
for three days,

365
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,400
but I don't know why

366
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,720
they all left yesterday afternoon.

367
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,480
Where did they go?

368
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
I don't know.

369
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,640
Did they mention any place?

370
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,839
Well...

371
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,839
Did they mention or not?

372
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,599
What did they say?

373
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,240
Where will they go or what will they do?

374
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:39,799
Think hard.

375
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

376
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,552
This is a confidential document
from the military department.

377
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,246
(Confidential)

378
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:07,136
(The third day of the fourth month,
3th year of Xuantong era)

379
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,480
(37 days before Mangzhong)

380
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,119
Cigarettes!

381
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,440
Cigarettes!

382
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,519
Muqing.

383
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,279
I've just made a round of checks.

384
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,279
The Concession's Public Council

385
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,519
have transferred
all the patrolmen away from here.

386
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,279
This street
and the surrounding three streets

387
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,599
are completely undefended.

388
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,880
And our people are also all in position,

389
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,440
from one end of the street to the other.

390
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,680
Setting up defenses.

391
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,039
What kind of defense is this?

392
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,160
These two beggars

393
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,920
just put mud on their faces,

394
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,519
but didn't even beg for money.

395
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,759
I wonder if these two vendors

396
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,599
are out of mind.

397
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,079
They don't even sell things.

398
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:29,720
Cigarettes!

399
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,799
Not for selling.

400
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,319
And those with shoulder poles...

401
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,480
They should be

402
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,240
walking the streets calling out.

403
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,160
But they are just sitting in the shade.

404
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,640
They just look like

405
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,759
imperial guards in disguise.

406
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,240
And these two...

407
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,599
They've even painted the lamps.

408
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,240
They don't even look like painters.

409
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,279
Who are they ambushing?

410
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,279
Muqing, you are right.

411
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,480
I'm sorry about that.

412
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,799
I'll go warn them.

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,400
They are already in position.

414
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:00,640
(Bama Tea House)

415
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,880
It's better not to move now.

416
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
Making any move might expose them.

417
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,519
Maybe the opponents don't see it

418
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,359
like you do.

419
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't see anything unusual outside.

420
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,200
People
from Imperial Household Department

421
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,519
and the Japanese

422
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,319
might not know

423
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,119
we are waiting here for Tan Xian.

424
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,359
An ambush is not something you can see.

425
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,799
If it can be seen,

426
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,559
then it won't be an ambush.

427
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,640
Zhuo Bufan is here.

428
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,279
Just as you predicted,

429
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,119
they're sitting at

430
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,839
the same table we sat at yesterday.

431
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,799
Three people in total.

432
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,880
Zhuo Bufan, one man and one woman.

433
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,759
Right.

434
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,720
We found nine sets of clothes

435
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,119
at Tang Yu's place earlier.

436
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,599
So, I'm afraid

437
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,559
there are nine men

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
from Rongtian Ridge hiding out here.

439
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,000
Not nine,

440
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,400
but eleven.

441
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:57,880
Eleven?

442
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
Look at that clothes store.

443
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,519
There are four men inside.

444
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,119
From the way they dress,

445
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,839
they seem like reform-minded students.

446
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,400
But that store is for tailoring suits.

447
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
And they keep getting
close to the window,

448
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,079
and they are surely
observing the outside.

449
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,160
Those two standing
and chatting by the street

450
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
have been talking ever since I arrived.

451
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,160
There's not that much to talk about.

452
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
Three men who look like students

453
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,039
are sitting beside the bookshelf.

454
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,640
They picked the right place.

455
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,000
However,

456
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,839
I've already had a pot of tea

457
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,279
and he hasn't turned
a single page of his book.

458
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,400
That makes nine.

459
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,880
I am not that observant.

460
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,039
What about the rest two?

461
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,200
They are strolling,

462
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,640
from the street corner
to the center of the street,

463
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,519
and then they walk back.

464
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,880
They went back and forth three times.

465
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,839
Indeed, there are eleven.

466
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,240
Getai, have you noticed anything?

467
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,799
Please advise me.

468
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,519
The clothes store and the book stall

469
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,759
are on the east side of the street.

470
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
The people inside keep
looking across the street.

471
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,799
Those two people who are chatting

472
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,640
are standing near
the intersection on the east side.

473
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,559
Those two men who are strolling
keep walking south along the road.

474
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,279
So that's where...

475
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,359
Correct.

476
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
All of them

477
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,559
are focusing on that coffee shop.

478
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,880
Zhuo Bufan's men have revealed

479
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
that Tan Xian will show up there.

480
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,720
That coffee shop
is the key location for today.

481
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,599
Alright.

482
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,839
You guys sit here.

483
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,920
I'm going for a stroll.

484
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,880
Look at it clearly.

485
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,640
This is Tan Xian.

486
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,720
Yes.

487
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,776
(Bogu Store)

488
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,440
Boss.

489
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,079
Is business doing well?

490
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,680
Thank you for asking.

491
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
Not bad.

492
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,079
Sir, what would you like to buy?

493
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,480
Good stuff.

494
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,279
I only want good stuff.

495
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,960
Everything in my store is good stuff.

496
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,079
That's what I do.

497
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,400
Whether it's good or not
is not for you to say.

498
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:30,920
This is nice.

499
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
This jade cabbage is made
from a single piece of jade.

500
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,480
That Buddha statue is far inferior.

501
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,519
I'm

502
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,920
discerning.

503
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,519
Amazing!

504
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,200
Expert.

505
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,799
You are an expert.

506
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,400
Sure enough, an expert

507
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,359
is so discerning.

508
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,880
Take a look.

509
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,200
This is not simple.

510
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,279
It appears to be from Ru kiln,

511
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,960
but it's not.

512
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,680
It is from Bianjing official kiln.

513
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,599
This kiln has much
in common with Ru kiln.

514
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,599
Many are in antique style.

515
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,799
The main part is in deep gray or purple.

516
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,599
The glaze includes light greenish blue

517
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,480
and bluish white.

518
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,079
It's crystal-clear

519
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:12,960
with streaks.

520
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,440
Purple rim and iron foot.

521
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,519
You can't tell it

522
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,000
if you are not an expert.

523
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,519
Among a bunch of Ru kiln stuff,

524
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,799
but you...

525
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,440
You picked this one up.

526
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,799
You are discerning!

527
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,599
You are an expert,

528
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,799
and you have sharp eyes.

529
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,480
Sir.

530
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,279
It seems we are all experts.

531
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,079
We should communicate more.

532
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,119
I come from the South Asia,

533
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,559
specifically dealing in
antiques and treasures.

534
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,279
Let's get to know each other.

535
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,000
I am Lin Haohan.

536
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,279
(Lin Haohan)

537
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,960
Secluded groves
amidst the endless immensity.

538
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,559
Of course.

539
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,400
You can call me
by my English name if you like.

540
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,039
Lucky.

541
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,000
Lucky.

542
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,200
In Chinese,

543
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,119
it means good luck

544
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,200
and blessings for a prosperous start.

545
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,000
A good friend is hard to find.

546
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,599
Sir, you have arrived.

547
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,200
Is that him?

548
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,000
I think so.

549
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,519
Can I help you?

550
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,480
Coffee, please.

551
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,640
Alright.

552
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,799
Enjoy.

553
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,559
Thank you.

554
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,559
Sugar, please.

555
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,599
Thank you.

556
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,079
Any problem?

557
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,279
I just gave him

558
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,720
a gesture to verify identity.

559
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,319
But he had no reaction at all.

560
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,039
So what do we do?

561
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,519
It isn't him?

562
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,359
That man wants to say hello to me.

563
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,920
He's coming for us.

564
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,000
Stay calm.

565
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,079
Don't panic.

566
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,599
Let's wait a bit longer.

567
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,119
Fine porcelain

568
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,400
is truly more precious than gold.

569
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Like you,

570
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,839
I just can't put

571
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,960
such a fine thing down.

572
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,960
Touching it feels

573
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,759
so satisfying

574
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,519
and amazing.

575
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,119
Let's go.

576
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,359
Those people

577
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,960
are very likely to come at us.

578
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,279
We have to leave right away.

579
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,319
But how can we meet them up?

580
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,319
If we don't leave now,

581
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm afraid we can't get away.

582
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,839
Alright, as you say.

583
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,319
Let's go.

584
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,039
Sir,

585
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,079
what's the rush to leave?

586
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,079
The Japanese are here.

587
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:41,960
Sir.

588
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,160
Muqing.

589
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,319
The Japanese are here.

590
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,119
What's so surprising?

591
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,319
It would be odd if they don't come.

592
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,840
But they have many people.

593
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,519
There is no fear of the mob in numbers.

594
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,480
Looks like we will have a tough day.

595
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,920
No matter what,

596
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,000
don't waste your energy.

597
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,079
We have only one target.

598
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,719
The man in the coffee shop

599
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,960
must be Tan Xian.

600
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,760
There are too many people.

601
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,599
Don't go out now.

602
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,920
Qin Tuo.

603
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,960
Sect Leader.

604
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,480
Go in and capture the man.

605
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,679
Stop them.

606
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,760
Let's see who dares to stop me.

607
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
The murderers
of the Dagu Inn case in Tianjin,

608
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,679
the men from Lingxi Rongtian Ridge,

609
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,719
surrender now.

610
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,336
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

611
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:25,440
I am Wang Jialuo, the constable
of the Dagu County Yamen.

612
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,192
I have chased the murderers
for 1,000 miles.

613
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,119
Rongtian Ridge's men,
Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo,

614
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,400
have committed the crime of murder.

615
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,119
Zhuo Bufan, Sect Leader of Rongtian
Ridge, has to take the responsibility.

616
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,360
Put down your weapons

617
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,519
and come with me
to the Dagu County Yamen for trial.

618
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,079
Should you not surrender
and confess your crime,

619
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,496
according to the laws
of the Qing Dynasty,

620
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,039
you shall be executed.
