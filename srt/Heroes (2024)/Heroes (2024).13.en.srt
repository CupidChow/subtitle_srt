1
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:14,472
(10th day of 4th month
of 3rd year of Xuantong)

2
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,024
(Grain in Ear is 30 days away.)

3
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,214
(Jiexiu, Fenzhou)

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,960
Sir,

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,199
we're from out of town.

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,000
We would like to collect
some things around here.

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,480
Do you know where we can do that?

8
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,039
What are you going to collect?

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,079
Just some old objects.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,520
Old items.

11
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,560
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,039
- I want it.
- Give it to me.

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,799
Just some old items.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,880
Old items?

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,479
Trinkets.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,600
I don't know.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,119
You should ask around elsewhere.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,840
I thought every family
here had a treasure.

19
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,879
I wish I had one.

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,079
Why don't you take a look

21
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,680
to see if there's anything you want?

22
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:13,408
(Ask and you shall receive)

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,920
Things from the tomb.

24
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,920
How can I get those?

25
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,040
Who around here can do so?

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,599
Shovel.

27
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,159
You don't know him?

28
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:29,719
This one?

29
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,599
No.

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,760
The one who digs graves.

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,760
Isn't a shovel for digging soil?

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,840
It can dig anything, can't it?

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
I spent all morning

34
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,879
asking around the whole village.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
No one has heard about Shovel.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,959
Seems like none have anything
to do with tomb robbing.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,159
Muqing,

38
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,400
you're so relaxed.

39
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,080
What if Zhuo Bufan

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,680
finds the clue before us?

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,360
Take it easy.

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,360
Judging by the clues left
by Tan Xian in the hotel,

43
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,000
Zhuo Bufan only knows that much.

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,319
He doesn't have more cards
in hand than us.

45
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,319
And he doesn't have
the county yamen's assistance.

46
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,479
He can only sneak around
blindly digging graves.

47
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,000
But we have a helper.

48
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,439
A helper?

49
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,599
Muqing, Getai,

50
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,360
I've missed you so much.

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,680
Today my right eye has been twitching.

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,240
I knew there must be good luck.

53
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,159
Sure enough.

54
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,960
The opportunity to serve
the imperial court has come.

55
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,039
Muqing,

56
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,400
is there anything I can help you with?

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,000
No.

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,560
I can't have you serving me tea.

59
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
Thank you.

60
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,759
Take a look.

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,759
Look.

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,879
Look at what?

63
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,719
Have a look if there's anything amiss.

64
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,479
It's not good porcelain.

65
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,560
Nor is it a quality clay body.

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,520
As for the craftsmanship,

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,680
it's just ordinary.

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,400
This tea tastes pretty good.

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,840
I didn't expect in this small village,

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,479
I would find palatable tea.

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I've been sitting in this shed
all morning.

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
I drank two pots of tea,

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,159
ate a bowl of multigrain congee

74
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,199
and a boiled egg.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,479
That multigrain congee contained millet,

76
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,599
sweet potatoes, pumpkins,

77
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,120
cabbage, Chinese yam and soybeans.

78
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,159
Wasn't that a bit too rich?

79
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,000
Even in a tavern

80
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,639
in Fenzhou, Taiyuan,

81
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,319
such a bowl of multigrain congee

82
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,520
would be considered a luxury.

83
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,280
Such a breakfast

84
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,800
cost me a total of 13 wen.

85
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,240
Wasn't that a bit expensive?

86
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,199
Eating breakfast in Fenzhou
wouldn't cost more than that.

87
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,719
Here, Jiexiu County of Fenzhou.

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,759
Yesterday, when I examined
the local documents,

89
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,639
I took a glance

90
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,680
at the local tax collection situation.

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,719
It's clearly a poor place.

92
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,639
A peasant family works hard

93
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,560
and earns about 16 strings
of coins a year.

94
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,759
It's like making forty-something wen

95
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,240
per household per day.

96
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,199
Can the peasants of Jiexiu

97
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,040
afford a 13-wen breakfast?

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,319
This dilapidated tea hut
at the entrance of a poor village

99
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,360
is not on a main thoroughfare.

100
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,279
Not many people pass by.

101
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,439
Who are the customers?

102
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,079
A golden goblet of clear wine
costs ten thousand.

103
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,319
A jade plate of delicacies
is worth ten thousand.

104
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,199
Muqing, you are correct.

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,279
People from this village

106
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,360
must be quite rich.

107
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,879
Muqing,

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
there must be some in this village

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,759
who don't live off farming.

110
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,959
And they aren't a minority.

111
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,720
I've been sitting here since morning

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,759
and haven't seen a single person
come for breakfast.

113
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,040
But look.

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,839
Which restaurant would wash
a huge pile of bowls

115
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,360
before opening for business?

116
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,279
Yes.

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,279
And which farmers

118
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,839
can afford to eat an expensive breakfast

119
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,800
that costs 13 wen

120
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,199
and then go work the fields?

121
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,519
So these washed dishes and chopsticks

122
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,879
must have been used
by those who worked at night

123
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,199
and came to eat in the morning.

124
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,879
We've found the right place.

125
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,279
There must be many here
who work at night.

126
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,839
Muqing,

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,519
I will have our men go door to door.

128
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,959
Getai,

129
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,079
we are here to investigate a case

130
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,480
not to catch tomb robbers.

131
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,199
If the villagers see us officers coming,

132
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,720
and they're asked about tomb-robbing,

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
they certainly won't tell the truth.

134
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,120
What did I bring him here for?

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,639
How clever!

136
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,839
Muqing, how brilliant!

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,199
I'm gonna

138
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,040
take a stroll around the village now.

139
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,199
What are you going to do?

140
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,800
Getai,

141
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,120
haven't you understood yet?

142
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,519
What do I do?

143
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,639
I specialize in dealing with antiques.

144
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,839
I am an expert.

145
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,199
I'll ask around

146
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,399
under the pretense of collecting things.

147
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
If someone brings out something

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
from a grave,

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,199
that person must be a tomb robber.

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
I pretended to be
an antique collector this morning

151
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,639
but didn't find out anything
after asking around.

152
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,720
Isn't that obvious?

153
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,120
Getai,

154
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,439
they can tell from your tone

155
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,360
at once you're not a collector.

156
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,839
I guess you don't even know the lingo.

157
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,120
What lingo?

158
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,959
How was the haul last night?

159
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
Take me to see our godson.

160
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,279
I don't know any of that jargon you use.

161
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,199
Alright, Lucky.

162
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,560
Hurry and go check in the village.

163
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,560
Okay!

164
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,439
That little brat.

165
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:51,872
=Heroes=

166
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,354
=Episode 13=

167
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,439
Mr. Zhuo, Ms. Huo.

168
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,600
This morning, we found someone

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,120
in a village of Pingyao County.

170
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,879
The female bodyguard
who was with Tan Xian at Maiqi Road

171
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
in the French Concession in Shanghai.

172
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,279
Why is she here?

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,199
If she's here,

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,040
it means she definitely knows

175
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,560
the location
of the Bodhi inheritor's tomb.

176
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,720
Right.

177
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,000
I speculated
she might go to the Bodhi tomb,

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
so I didn't let her notice me.

179
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,519
I had two junior brothers follow her.

180
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,040
Then I hurried back to inform you.

181
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,560
Well done.

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,839
So

183
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,759
let's catch up
with that female bodyguard.

184
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Then notify everyone

185
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,560
to meet up in Pingyao.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,360
Pingyao?

187
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,879
Mr. Zhuo commanded us to leave at once.

188
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,080
You've found the Bodhi tomb?

189
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,519
We found

190
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,320
Tan Xian's female bodyguard in Pingyao.

191
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,600
She definitely knows
where the Bodhi tomb is.

192
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,039
By following her,
we'll definitely find it.

193
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,200
Got it.

194
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,960
I'll pack up and be right there.

195
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,519
Hurry up.

196
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,679
Pingyao.

197
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,440
What's this?

198
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,399
Taigu cake, a specialty of Shanxi.

199
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,080
A waiter just brought it over,

200
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,159
saying it was sent by Mr. Yu.

201
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,440
Mr. Yu?

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,720
Yu Huanjie from the Rongtian Ridge.

203
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,519
He's working for us too?

204
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,360
We hope so.

205
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,600
Mr. Yu told that waiter

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,879
Taigu cakes went well

207
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,360
with beef from Pingyao.

208
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,440
Yu Huanjie is not foolish at all.

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,879
It seems Zhuo Bufan
has already found it.

210
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,519
They've gone to Pingyao.

211
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,960
This one.

212
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,120
A wine cup.

213
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,440
This is not rare.

214
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,159
Just dig a hole and you'll get
a bunch of them.

215
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,240
But this one.

216
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,440
It's a Taotie carved on it.
[*Ancient Chinese mythological creature]

217
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,159
It's not even noon yet.

218
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,440
I just took such a small tour,

219
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,039
and I've already collected
so many things.

220
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,799
Muqing, Getai,

221
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,480
and sir.

222
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,320
There must be a secret
lurking around here.

223
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,679
Alright, let's move.

224
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm going to deploy people
to seal off the village now.

225
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,200
Getai,

226
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,919
bring over their village chief first.

227
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,039
I'll ask him some questions.

228
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,919
Follow me.

229
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
Sir,

230
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,840
I'm the local village official.

231
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,159
I don't care

232
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,240
about your grave robbing
and I won't arrest you.

233
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,559
You just need to do one thing for me.

234
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,759
Sir, I'm all ears.

235
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,600
More than 40 years ago,

236
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,879
almost during the early years
of Tongzhi,

237
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,080
there was a tomb robber named Shovel.

238
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,960
Find his descendants for me.

239
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,879
Or take me to his grave.

240
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:09,960
Sir.

241
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,080
I'll only give you half an hour.

242
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,360
If you can't bring the person
or point out the grave,

243
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,519
I will seize all of you.

244
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,799
By the Qing Code,

245
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,159
tomb robbers

246
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,039
shall be executed.

247
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,879
Sir, spare me.

248
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:20,480
Sir,

249
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,639
more than 40 years ago,

250
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,159
I was just a little kid then.

251
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,519
The man you speak of.

252
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,320
I seem to have heard of him.

253
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
He was a master at obtaining treasures.

254
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,759
But I've never heard
about his descendants.

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,039
Let alone knowing

256
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,960
where his grave is located.

257
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,759
If you don't know,
hurry back to ask around.

258
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,600
You only have half an hour.

259
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,559
Do as you see fit.

260
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,440
Muqing,

261
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,879
don't you think
half an hour is a bit long?

262
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,679
I'll go ask right away.

263
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,000
- How is it going?
- Mr. Zhuo.

264
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,919
Go two and a half li

265
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,879
and then head west.

266
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,600
Where's that?

267
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,279
Zhaozhuang.

268
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,200
Okay.

269
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,919
You two continue to follow her.

270
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,159
Remember not to alert her.

271
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

272
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,639
It seems the Bodhi tomb is right here.

273
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,519
Correct.

274
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,200
But before she finds any clues

275
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
or discovers the tomb,

276
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,960
we must not act rashly.

277
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,559
Otherwise, among the thousands of graves

278
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,960
in the nine counties of Fenzhou,

279
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,000
when would we ever be able
to find it on our own?

280
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,160
Bufan,

281
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,799
eat something.

282
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,000
You're always attentive.

283
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,200
Qin Tuo,

284
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,320
distribute these.

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,840
Here they come.

286
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,840
He brought that person.

287
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,639
No, he invited that person.

288
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,240
That person is the head here.

289
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,840
Actually, the village chief
listens to him.

290
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,960
You have a keen eye.

291
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,559
Just like me when it comes
to recognizing antiques.

292
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,159
Sir,

293
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,000
greetings...

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,759
Cut the crap.

295
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,039
Just tell me what I want to hear.

296
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,159
What do you want me to say?

297
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,840
The things about Shovel.

298
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,399
Come on.

299
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,639
Shovel.

300
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,120
Shovel must be referring to Mr. Su.

301
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,159
Mr. Su?

302
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,279
The details.

303
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,320
Yes.

304
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,240
In the early years of Tongzhi,

305
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
nearly 40 years ago,

306
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,200
in the entire Fenzhou

307
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,639
and even the whole Shanxi,

308
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,000
the best tomb robber

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,360
was Su Yunzhi,

310
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,279
Mr. Su.

311
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
Mr. Su used nothing but a shovel.

312
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,440
And he was so skilled

313
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
in using it.

314
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,879
So those in the same line of work
all called him Shovel.

315
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,200
And later on,

316
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,360
the number of Mr. Su's disciples
kept growing,

317
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
and his status kept rising.

318
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,600
So fellow antiquities dealers

319
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,440
all revered him.

320
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,000
It seems that you are quite familiar

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,879
with Su Yunzhi.

322
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,360
No.

323
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,600
Sir, please do not think so.

324
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,879
It's all hearsay.

325
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm just an honest farmer
who tills the soil.

326
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,320
I don't understand antiques at all,

327
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,919
let alone anything about tomb robbing.

328
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,919
All I know about him

329
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,240
is from my grandpa.

330
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,039
But he didn't know
about tomb robbing, either.

331
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,679
Our family for generations
has been farming.

332
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,240
That's all we know how to do.

333
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
I don't care whether you're a farmer
or a grave digger.

334
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,759
If you keep beating around the bush,

335
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,840
I will smash the jade

336
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,080
from the Southern Song on your waist.

337
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,639
This...

338
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,200
The Northern Song.

339
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,679
Sir,

340
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,600
when my grandfather was alive,

341
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,639
he would pay respects
at Su Yunzhi's grave every year.

342
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,440
But my grandfather
has been dead for many years,

343
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,759
and I have never been to Mr. Su's grave.

344
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,600
I just know the place.

345
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,480
It's in the wild graves
on the west end of Zhaozhuang.

346
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,919
How can I find it?

347
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,639
Mr. Su robbed countless tombs
in his lifetime,

348
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,399
and he didn't care about the afterlife.

349
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,960
He thought a fancy tomb would only tempt

350
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,120
more grave robbers.

351
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,799
A desolate grave would be safer,

352
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,039
and it would be more quiet.

353
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,360
Let's go.

354
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,360
Muqing,

355
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,639
there must be many secrets here.

356
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,000
Let me stay behind
and have a good look around

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,799
to see

358
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,320
if there are
any other suspicious things.

359
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
You want to pick up
some bargains, don't you?

360
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,399
How about I count you in?

361
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,759
I'll pick a valuable thing for you.

362
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,440
Come with me to Zhaozhuang first.

363
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,120
After that, you can take
whatever you want.

364
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,399
Yes.

365
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,600
I'll follow your lead.

366
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,080
Muqing,

367
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,240
do you think the Bodhi tomb

368
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,799
is in Zhaozhuang?

369
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,120
Getai,

370
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,879
I have a hunch
that we're about to find it.

371
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,799
It really is you.

372
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,799
You were the one

373
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,480
who was with Tan Xian on Maiqi Road.

374
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,319
Since you're here,

375
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,599
it means we're looking
for the same thing.

376
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,119
Tell us.

377
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,920
Which grave should we dig up?

378
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,039
I am asking you which tomb

379
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,119
the Bodhi inheritor's is!

380
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,160
Someone's coming.

381
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,160
And there are many of them.

382
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,799
Huang Xing.

383
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,480
Getai,

384
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,960
we've found the right place.

385
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,079
It's just that we have to battle.

386
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,839
Let me say something.

387
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,079
You two,

388
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,640
should we fight first

389
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,720
or dig the grave first?

390
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,000
So many graves.

391
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,720
Which one should we open?

392
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:16,960
Huang Xing.

393
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,640
Either point out which grave it is now

394
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,920
or I kill you right away.

395
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,480
Miss Liu.

396
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,200
You...

397
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,599
Why are you with them?

398
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,720
You might just kill me.

399
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,799
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

400
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,920
Everyone is here.

401
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
Actually, this matter

402
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,079
is already troublesome enough.

403
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,559
Even if we dig up
these graves one by one,

404
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,720
it can't be done in a day and a night.

405
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,839
Besides,

406
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,839
this thing

407
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,599
is unconscionable.

408
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,559
Taboo.

409
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,119
Too taboo.

410
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,640
Can you actually find
the grave I am looking for?

411
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,680
Muqing,

412
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,839
excavating graves is not my forte,

413
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,519
but this actually has
some connection with antiques.

414
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,319
What kind of tomb are you looking for?

415
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,400
If I know the approximate year
of burial,

416
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
it may be simpler.

417
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,759
6 years ago.

418
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,720
6 years.

419
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,599
6 years.

420
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:24,799
Okay.

421
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,359
Dude,

422
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,440
lend me a tool.

423
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,799
Stubborn, huh?

424
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,240
This grave is at least 15 years old.

425
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,039
Not right.

426
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,319
Mr. Zhuo,

427
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,480
I've brought 11 people.

428
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,920
Each one of them is a top-notch master,

429
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,599
whereas there are only eight of you.

430
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,839
And you've brought a woman along.

431
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,680
You are already at a disadvantage.

432
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,880
Any five individuals from my sect

433
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,799
can easily deal
with you so-called masters.

434
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,799
Not to mention there are eight of us.

435
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,000
But Men Sandao,

436
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,759
you are a real master.

437
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,960
There are fewer and fewer masters
in the martial world.

438
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,240
How about this?

439
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,400
You take your men back.

440
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,680
Make up some excuse
to appease the court.

441
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,720
The court will punish you.

442
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,119
But they won't go
as far as to execute you.

443
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,599
But if you fight me,

444
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,480
I will.

445
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,279
Thank you, Mr. Zhuo,

446
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,400
for your kind words.

447
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
But I bear the Emperor's command.

448
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,359
I can only give it my all

449
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,799
to not fail the Emperor.

450
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,240
Mr. Zhuo,

451
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,799
I'll give you a word of caution too.

452
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,400
You have already

453
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,920
committed a grievous crime.

454
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,279
If you continue to be obstinate,

455
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,240
you cannot escape punishment.

456
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,559
How would you punish me?

457
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,920
Don't you find your words

458
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,519
ridiculous?

459
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,359
I found it!

460
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,359
A 6-year-old grave.

461
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,240
Someone, come dig it up and take a look.

462
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,319
Getai.

463
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,319
I found it!

464
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,000
Why does this coffin have no nails?

465
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:46,960
Get ready.

466
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,599
Wait for those imperial guards

467
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,640
and the Rongtian Sword Sect
to both be weakened.

468
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,279
Then we'll make our move.

469
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,440
Let's go.

470
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,839
Don't just stand here.

471
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,599
I'm afraid if we don't take action now,

472
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,119
we won't find
such a good opportunity again.

473
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,000
We've got the thing.

474
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,720
Let's go.

475
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,599
Zhuo Bufan!

476
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:49,920
Men Sandao,

477
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,920
if you're determined to die,

478
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,440
I'll grant your wish.

479
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,799
You're right.

480
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,759
It may be the best opportunity.

481
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,200
What a mess.

482
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,680
Even the Beiyang Army
has been drawn into this.

483
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,079
That leader.

484
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,359
Why does he look familiar?

485
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,279
Isn't that Mr. Wang?

486
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,079
Why is he leading Beiyang soldiers?

487
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,920
And in military uniform.

488
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,839
Impossible.

489
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,839
This is absolutely impossible.

490
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,519
He was clearly killed by Zhuo Bufan.

491
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,519
I personally touched his corpse.

492
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,720
Jialuo.

493
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,640
You are Wang Jialuo.

494
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,680
I didn't expect you to be able
to cheat death under my sword.

495
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,559
Zhuo Bufan,

496
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,359
put down the sword in your hand.

497
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,880
Otherwise,
your sect will cease to exist.

498
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,400
Jialuo,

499
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,319
snatch the jar in his hand!

500
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,839
That's the most important thing.

501
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,319
Zhuo Bufan,

502
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,079
if you do not want me to shoot,

503
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,039
drop your sword now

504
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,319
and hand that over.

505
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,960
Mr. Ding,

506
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,359
capture these from the Rongtian Ridge

507
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,880
who not only killed people
but also attempted

508
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,000
to steal the treasure of the Qing.

509
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,160
If there is any resistance,

510
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,519
show no mercy and kill them.

511
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,599
Huanjie,

512
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,599
take the others and leave.

513
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,079
Don't move.

514
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,000
Take one more step

515
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,279
and no one will get this thing.

516
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:53,680
Go.

517
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,720
Let's retreat.

518
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,400
Go!

519
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,079
You have guns after all.

520
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,119
I lost.

521
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,319
It's a trick!

522
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:20,920
Shoot!

523
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,000
Catch him!

524
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,079
- Yes!
- Yes!

525
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,119
Getai,

526
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,880
have someone collect
all these fragments.

527
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,519
Not a single bit can be missed.

528
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,200
This is the clue to the Altar Treasure.

529
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,440
You know about

530
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,559
the Altar Treasure?

531
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,279
I am currently pursuing Zhuo Bufan

532
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,640
and his fellows

533
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,160
not only for the Dagu case

534
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,440
but also to stop them from stealing

535
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,720
the treasure of the Qing.

536
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,480
If it weren't for you today,

537
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,559
Zhuo Bufan might have succeeded.

538
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,559
Thank you.

539
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,799
But he still got away.

540
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,720
Why do you...?

541
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,559
You lead the Beiyang troops,

542
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,440
and you're in Beiyang's uniform.

543
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,720
It's a long story.

544
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,720
I have to go now.

545
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,240
Mr. Muqing, I'll see you.

546
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,000
Jialuo,

547
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,480
where are you staying now?

548
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,400
In Fenzhou.

549
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,239
Me too.

550
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,559
How about we have
a drink at a tavern tonight?

551
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,480
You can tell me

552
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,719
that long story.

553
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,639
Good. I'll see you tonight.

554
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,000
Mr. Muqing,

555
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:21,679
I'm off now.

556
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,039
Alright.

557
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,320
Zhuo Bufan did it on purpose.

558
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,960
The jar has been chopped up so finely.

559
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,920
There must be clues on this.

560
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
We must find a way
to restore and piece these together.

561
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,199
Where is Lin Haohan?

562
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,079
Get him over.

563
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,360
He...

564
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,880
How could he disappear?

565
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,599
Find him.

566
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,679
Hurry up and find him.

567
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:13,840
So dangerous.

568
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,440
Miss Liu Lin.

569
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,159
If it weren't for my quick reaction,

570
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,800
we would have been in trouble.

571
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,480
Why were you captured

572
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,920
by those fierce and evil people?

573
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:22,880
Look.

574
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,719
You should have followed me.

575
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:28,719
What is it?

576
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,159
Where are you going?

577
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,719
You're not going back, are you?

578
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,119
Miss Liu Lin, have you gone mad?

579
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,639
If you don't run now,
you'll lose your life.

580
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,039
Why go back to face death?

581
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,239
This place is not safe.

582
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,960
Let's head back to Fenzhou.

583
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:42,719
Go.

584
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:45,504
(43rd Association, Shanxi Army)

585
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,440
We found Zhuo Bufan

586
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,519
in Zhaozhuang, Pingyao.

587
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,360
But he managed to escape.

588
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,239
We couldn't capture him.

589
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,239
What a pity.

590
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,960
Jialuo,

591
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,480
we made you a second lieutenant
in the Beiyang Army

592
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
and gave you command of troops

593
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,039
because we want you

594
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,760
to stop Zhuo Bufan's intention
to steal the treasure.

595
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,119
General Long,

596
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,639
I understand.

597
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,559
I will certainly do my utmost

598
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,920
to guard the treasure for the Emperor
and for the Great Qing.

599
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,880
I've already ordered a citywide alert

600
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,239
and had my men search
for Zhuo Bufan and his fellows.

601
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,719
We will prevent him.

602
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,239
Alright.

603
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,480
You've been toiling all day.
You must be tired.

604
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,559
Go back and rest.

605
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,519
I'm not tired.

606
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,039
I will continue the investigation.

607
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,760
How come Mr. Wang is so hard to kill?

608
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
He survived many times.

609
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Who knows

610
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,199
what he found in the coffin?

611
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,400
Yu Huanjie hasn't sent
any messages until now.

612
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,559
Maybe we should find
a way to contact him.

613
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:02,840
No.

614
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,079
I promised him that I would not.

615
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,159
Besides, Huo Qin is adept
with poisonous insects,

616
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,599
which isn't just hearsay.

617
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,079
Wait a little longer.

618
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,800
Mr. Wang is a headache for us.

619
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,719
You must find a way to get back to him

620
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,960
for information.

621
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,000
Zhuo Bufan destroyed the porcelain jar
he found in the coffin

622
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,519
right in front of you all?

623
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,440
Yes.

624
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,440
Very suspicious.

625
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:40,719
Zhuo Bufan might already be aware

626
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,280
of the secret of the porcelain jar.

627
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,440
That's why he resorted to such a scheme.

628
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,559
I think so too.

629
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,559
Those from the Rongtian Ridge
are so skilled

630
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,480
in martial arts.

631
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,639
They escaped too fast.

632
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,760
We couldn't catch up with them.

633
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,480
Do you think Wang Jialuo

634
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,320
can find Zhuo Bufan?

635
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,719
He has meticulously arranged for his men

636
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,440
to scout for their traces.

637
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,159
I think he can do it.

638
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,880
Moreover, on our turf,

639
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,320
he can't manage

640
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,679
to come and go without leaving traces.

641
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,840
Draft a telegram

642
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,800
detailing the whole thing
about the Altar Treasure

643
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,239
involving the Rongtian Ridge,

644
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,679
Zhuo Bufan
and the Imperial Household Department

645
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,920
from the start.

646
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:28,840
Yes.

647
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,800
General, there's a visitor.

648
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:36,960
Who is it?

649
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,880
It's Mr. Xie.

650
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,039
Bring him to my office.

651
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,320
Who is it?

652
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,840
A secret envoy from Beiyang.

653
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,519
He is here to see me.

654
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,039
It must be a matter of importance.

655
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,719
Mr. Xie.

656
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,639
General Zhong, it has been many days.

657
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,960
I've missed you quite a bit.

658
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,079
Sit.

659
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,039
General, do you know

660
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,000
about a sect in Lingxi

661
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,559
named the Rongtian Ridge?

662
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,719
It seems to be
a martial arts sect, right?

663
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,880
This Rongtian Ridge

664
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,920
is a declining sword sect in Lingxi.

665
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,599
They suddenly left
their stronghold a few days ago.

666
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,599
They first went to Tianjin,

667
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,960
and then they showed up in Shanghai.

668
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,360
And most recently, they went to Shanxi.

669
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,559
Quite strange.

670
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
So we did some investigating,

671
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,199
and we've found out their purpose

672
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,239
is to search
for a legendary secret treasure.

673
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,000
Mr. Xie,

674
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,159
what does this matter
have to do with us?

675
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,159
It has nothing to do with us.

676
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,519
But it might have
something to do with you.

677
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,880
Sir, I don't quite understand
what you mean.

678
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,519
This martial arts sect

679
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:29,039
is actually under someone's command

680
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,760
to go all out to search

681
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,320
for this legendary fortune.

682
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,079
The mastermind behind this,

683
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,960
according to our deductions,

684
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,079
is most likely your father-in-law,

685
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,639
Prince Qi.

686
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,400
But I have never heard of this.

687
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,000
Really?

688
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,559
I'm absolutely telling the truth.

689
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,559
General Zhong, please stay calm.

690
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,920
Sit.

691
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,039
Previously, we had
an agreement with Prince Qi

692
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,800
to assist him in a coup

693
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,760
and then help him form a cabinet.

694
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,159
But we wanted to maintain

695
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,960
absolute control of it.

696
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,239
If it is true that Prince Qi
is hiring martial forces

697
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,719
to look for the legendary treasure.

698
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,920
It indicates that he's actually trying

699
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,559
to use our power to control us.

700
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:38,920
Mr. Xie,

701
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,519
I understand what you mean.

702
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,000
But don't worry.

703
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,360
Although I am Prince Qi's son-in-law,

704
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,639
at the end of the day,
I am a man of Beiyang.

705
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,440
The Beiyang Army nurtured me,

706
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,480
so I will never forget my roots,
no matter what.

707
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,119
Very good.

708
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,920
So, what should you do next?

709
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,920
General Zhong, are you clear on this?

710
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,599
I will go and check soon.

711
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,599
If Prince Qi really
has other intentions,

712
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,559
I won't hide anything from you

713
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,679
or Beiyang.
