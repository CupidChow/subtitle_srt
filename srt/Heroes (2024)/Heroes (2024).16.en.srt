1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,760
We have set up checkpoints
on all main roads within Shanxi.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,399
Even if Zhuo Bufan and his people
manage to break through by luck,

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,559
we can catch up with them within 100 li.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,760
But if they get out of Shanxi,
then it won't be easy to catch up.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,376
Now, Zhuo Bufan and Huo Qin
are heading west.

6
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,280
While Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo are
heading east in attire of Han people.

7
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,848
You suspect that Rongtian Ridge's people
have split into two to distract us.

8
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,079
Exactly.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,799
So, you want to chase after
Yu Huanjie and his people.

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
I want to wait longer.

11
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,119
As the first detective
of the imperial yamen,

12
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,560
Men Sandao won't believe
apparent things.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,039
He must think that we did it on purpose

14
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,479
to attract his attention.

15
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,040
If he has already detected our lies,
perhaps we can't deceive him, right?

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
Let's change the route and head north.

17
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,120
Sir, they've changed their route
and headed north.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,176
Okay, I know.

19
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:27,104
Yes.

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,879
You see. Zhuo Bufan and his people
have changed the route and gone north.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,680
If I am right, he will find a horse next

22
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,880
to speed up and run away even faster.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,200
Since you have determined
Zhuo Bufan and his people serve as bait,

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,320
then why not just
chase after Yu Huanjie and his people?

25
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,000
You really are impatient.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,640
Alright, let's go catch them.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Then what about Zhuo Bufan?

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,799
Don't worry. I have people watching him.

29
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,439
If you still are concerned,
you can have men follow them. Let's go.

30
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,120
Aside from those people tailing,
no one else sent by Men Sandao followed.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,360
Like what you expected,
the pursuers should be after us.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,680
Could they have already found out?

33
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,560
You are right.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,152
Then what should we do?
Martial Uncle Mo Kun may be in danger.

35
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,240
How many people are still following us?

36
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,680
Not many, about seven or eight people.

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,879
Good, then I'll take care of them.

38
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,560
Martial Uncle, this way.

39
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,400
Martial Uncle,
Shandong should be that way.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,719
You two take the disciples
and head to the south.

41
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,800
This is a strategy
to lure the tiger out of the mountain.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,879
From the beginning,
I have decided to use myself as bait.

43
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,120
I forced Bufan to put on a show with me,

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,800
making you believe that Anhui Temple
in Shandong was the real destination.

45
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,479
What?

46
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,159
Zhuo Bufan acted like
he was drawing the enemy into a trap

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,759
to misguide Beiyang Army
and the Imperial Household Department.

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,319
He wanted Men Sandao to see through it
and then come after us.

49
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,048
There is an Anhui Temple in Shandong,
but it is not his destination.

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,639
His real destination
is Anhui Temple in Fujian.

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,080
Zhuo Bufan, the shameless guy!

52
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,319
Do we have anyone following now?

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,919
No.

54
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,639
Good, let's head south directly.

55
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,639
Men Sandao...

56
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,800
They have been tricked.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,759
Is Martial Uncle Mo Kun in danger?

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,584
Let's go.

59
00:05:56,196 --> 00:06:00,768
=Heroes=

60
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,320
=Episode 16=

61
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,519
Zhuo Bufan has impressive swordsmanship
and a talent that defies the world.

62
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,319
He also has patience and decisiveness
to achieve great things.

63
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,839
With him, there is hope
to revitalize the Rongtian Sword Sect.

64
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,519
The master made the right choice
to let him be the Sect Leader.

65
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,519
Martial Uncle,
Zhuo Bufan is so malicious.

66
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's head south and question him.

67
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,800
Huanjie, you were raised by me.
It's not exaggerated to call you my son.

68
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,920
So you have to listen to me.

69
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,680
What Zhuo Bufan did is right.

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,000
Any success cannot avoid sacrifices.

71
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,199
He did it
for the sake of Rongtian Ridge.

72
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,120
So you cannot hold grudges against him
or seek revenge on him.

73
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,600
Martial Uncle.

74
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Alright, no more talk.

75
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,519
You two
take the disciples and head south.

76
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,160
Martial Uncle,
we are not going without you.

77
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,720
Right, let's go together.

78
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
To die for nothing?

79
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,439
Pursuers from Beiyang Army
and the Department are getting closer.

80
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,000
I must stay to cover your retreat
from Shanxi, understand?

81
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,319
Go! Just go!

82
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,199
I won't go.

83
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:33,720
Go!

84
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,720
Remember, you all are seeds.

85
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,639
Only if you survive,
there is hope for resurging the sect.

86
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,000
You misjudged.

87
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,879
Maybe I did.

88
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,559
Would the top
imperial detective misjudge?

89
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,720
I am a person,
and that means I make mistakes.

90
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,039
Perhaps Zhuo Bufan
is playing mind games with me.

91
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,639
If they split into two as a distraction,
then I didn't misjudge.

92
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,352
But I think it is
more complicated than that.

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,679
What are you talking about?
Just admit it if you are wrong.

94
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
First, he pretended to be bait
to raise my suspicion.

95
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,928
I didn't go after him.

96
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,600
Next, he left
and wanted me to fall for it.

97
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,120
Lastly, Yu Huanjie didn't even realize
that he was the real bait.

98
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,679
Keep going. Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo
are also murderers.

99
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,400
I'll go arrest them. Let's go.

100
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,240
Let's go.

101
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,519
Jialuo, you head south
and I'll head east for twenty li.

102
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,399
If we don't encounter the people
from Rongtian Ridge,

103
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,279
go back and support the other party.
Did you hear me?

104
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,519
I heard you.

105
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
You are...

106
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,879
Mo Kun, the Martial Uncle of Zhuo Bufan.
He's the Sect Leader of Rongtian Ridge.

107
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,344
Mo Kun, I've heard your name.

108
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,480
Over 10 years ago, you were famous
throughout the martial world.

109
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,559
I have also heard of him.

110
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,559
But he has disappeared
for more than ten years.

111
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,600
It's been 12 years.

112
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,600
Has not Irgen-Gioro Muqing
also vanished for 12 years?

113
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,432
(Shumulu Chatai, Minister of Department)
You must know him.

114
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,496
It was Minister Chatai
who spotted and heavily utilized you.

115
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,639
You know Minister Chatai?

116
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,720
Like you, I was entrusted by him
to protect the Reformists.

117
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,759
Regrettably,
I was imprisoned for 12 years.

118
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,120
I never expected
the person who is hunting me down today

119
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,919
is the proud disciple
of Minister Chatai.

120
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,200
I wonder what he would think in Heaven.

121
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,559
If Minister Chatai
sees what I do in Heaven,

122
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,440
he will understand
I am fulfilling my duty to the court.

123
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,399
Back then, you lost
your freedom due to reform.

124
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,919
Now, you become a lackey
for a more decadent imperial power.

125
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,600
Don't you think you have betrayed
your belief over these 12 years?

126
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,960
It was the Emperor who wanted reform,
and I just followed his orders.

127
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,152
Now, the Emperor wants the criminals,
so I am also just following his orders.

128
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,480
I am an official of the fourth rank
and the leader of the Emperor's guards.

129
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,919
Obeying the Emperor's command
is my only mission.

130
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,519
Alright, then let's cross swords.

131
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,879
We can't do this anymore.

132
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,759
We can run,
but our juniors are already exhausted.

133
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,559
I'll stay to hold them off.

134
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,399
Qin Tuo.

135
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,799
Huanjie, even though we have been
wandering all these years,

136
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,519
as long as we are together,
I can put up with anything.

137
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,039
Huanjie, you also know.

138
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,039
Mr. Zhuo is a prodigy unmatched
in Rongtian Sword Sect for centuries.

139
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,559
Martial Uncle also said
he could revitalize our Sword Sect.

140
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,039
You wish the Rongtian Sword Sect
to be strong.

141
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,679
I have the same wish.

142
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,559
Every one of us wishes for the same.

143
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:39,879
I hope from now on,
you can put aside past grudges,

144
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,399
and not blame Mr. Zhuo
for today's matters.

145
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,840
Because everything he does
is for the revitalization of our sect.

146
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
Go, Huanjie,
you are more important than I am.

147
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
To rejuvenate the sect,

148
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Mr. Zhuo cannot do it
without your protection.

149
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,200
Go, Huanjie.

150
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
Qin Tuo.

151
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,519
Go.

152
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,159
Let's go.

153
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,759
Qin Tuo, we will stay here with you.

154
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I only want you.

155
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,279
You surrender. Others may leave.

156
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,639
Wang Jialuo, keep your word.

157
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,824
I always keep my word.

158
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,359
I said I would hunt down
murderers of the Dagu murder,

159
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,960
I will surely arrest you.

160
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,976
Alright, let my juniors go. I will stay.

161
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,680
Qin Tuo.

162
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,960
They can leave if they want.
I only want you.

163
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,559
Go, now!

164
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,888
Go!

165
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,799
I would rather die than surrender.

166
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,799
Wang Jialuo, shoot me.

167
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,599
Ding Yu, tell them to lower their guns.

168
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,299
Killing criminals is my duty,

169
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,440
and Beiyang Army
doesn't need to intervene.

170
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,039
You can leave. Go.

171
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,920
Let's go.

172
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,720
I am Wang Jialuo,
the constable from Dagu County Yamen.

173
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,599
Qin of Rongtian Ridge
is the main culprit in the Dagu murder.

174
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,160
According to the Qing Code,
if you resist arrest, I can kill you.

175
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,240
My name is Qin Tuo,
from the Rongtian Sword Sect.

176
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,720
Surrender and I won't kill you.

177
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,079
I am from the Rongtian Sword Sect.

178
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:38,960
You are said to be the best swordsman
of the imperial yamen.

179
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,359
I think you don't live up
to such a reputation.

180
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,440
It's far from what I expected.

181
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,480
You lost. What's the point
of saying all this now?

182
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,119
You switched from chopping to slicing,
and then from slicing to stabbing twice.

183
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,599
You showed vulnerabilities
when you changed moves.

184
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,400
I've aged, and this is my first time
I've used a sword in 12 years.

185
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,440
Besides, I didn't want to kill you.

186
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,200
Otherwise, you would have already died.

187
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Zhuo Bufan's swordsmanship is subtle.

188
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:45,200
With your skills,
you can contend with him in 50 moves.

189
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,200
But you will lose within 70 moves.

190
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,160
Within 100 moves,
he will slice your throat.

191
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,319
I thought you could surprise me.

192
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,960
Unfortunately,
you aren't half as good as Cheng Yu.

193
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,160
You know my master?

194
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,799
I can't last three rounds against him.

195
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,279
Do you know my master?

196
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,680
Hasn't Cheng Yu ever told you

197
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,440
not to tell anyone
that he was once your master?

198
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:40,720
Cheng Yu dedicated his whole life
to helping those like-minded individuals

199
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,680
who could overthrow the imperial power
and build a new world.

200
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,720
He was willing to give his all
throughout his life.

201
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,920
Sadly, his disciple is willing
to be a hound of the court.

202
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,799
How pathetic it is.

203
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,799
I feel sorry for him.

204
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,640
What is life like running
from here and there?

205
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,160
It should be like a swan goose
stepping into the snow.

206
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,839
Men Sandao, take care.

207
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,319
Elder.

208
00:24:57,188 --> 00:24:58,272
(Qin, Yu Huanjie, Zhuo Bufan)

209
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:10,496
(Qin)

210
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,039
They can't escape out of Shanxi.

211
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,599
You had someone shoot them?

212
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,599
I killed these three people for you.

213
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:27,680
They were really tough,
and wouldn't say anything.

214
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,256
But even if we asked,
these disciples wouldn't be of any use.

215
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:38,200
Zhuo Bufan wouldn't tell them
where he was going.

216
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
We still got outsmarted by Zhuo Bufan.

217
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,559
He used everyone else but him as bait.
He was just ruthless.

218
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,599
Keep wasting your time here.
I will chase after Zhuo Bufan.

219
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,079
Where are you going?

220
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,920
The people who were tailing Zhuo Bufan
were all killed by him.

221
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,599
Do you know where he went?

222
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,039
Since he bought himself time to escape
at the cost of his disciples' lives,

223
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,920
once he's succeeded,
he won't easily expose himself again.

224
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,240
You say the same thing in Shanghai,
but still, I managed to chase him down.

225
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,599
That was because
I told you his whereabouts on purpose.

226
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,759
Otherwise, you couldn't find him.

227
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,279
His Martial Uncle decided from the start
to use himself as bait

228
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,960
and court his death willingly.

229
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,519
Do you think he dies for nothing?

230
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,920
Do you think his death wouldn't buy time
for Zhuo Bufan to run away?

231
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,720
Qin Tuo has already been executed by me.

232
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,640
Two people died.

233
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,000
The three disciples who followed Qin Tuo
are also dead.

234
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,039
Five people died because of Zhuo Bufan.

235
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,920
Rongtian Ridge is a remarkable sect.

236
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,759
As a child,
I believed money mattered most.

237
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,440
But after growing up,
I found out it really is so.

238
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,000
Disgusting.

239
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,079
What? Aren't you also looking for money?

240
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,440
You don't care about your life.
You care about it more than I do.

241
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
Am I doing this for money?
I'm doing this to save...

242
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,079
Save the country, and save the people.
And all these need money.

243
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,079
Why save the country?

244
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,960
If the people all have money,
who would need your help?

245
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,920
Miss Liu, don't look down on me.

246
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,119
Everyone loathes a destitute life,
so who doesn't favor money?

247
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,559
It's like a crappy deal wrapped
in pretty paper.

248
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,279
You make yourselves sound so selfless.

249
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,480
But I am an honest guy. I love money.

250
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,720
Have you ever heard this saying?

251
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,776
No money, then everything is a dog.

252
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:32,880
What?

253
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,720
No money, then everything is a dog.

254
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,599
You miser.

255
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,119
Muqing, long time no see.
I've missed you.

256
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,640
I miss you too.

257
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,279
When Zhuo Bufan destroyed this jar,

258
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,839
he had already found the clue.

259
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,359
You've restored it so perfectly,

260
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,240
how come you can't find anything?

261
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,680
Muqing, you know it.

262
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,079
The key lies at the bottom.

263
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,880
Without the bottom,
it is difficult to find any clues.

264
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,720
So, you mean you didn't find the clue?

265
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,000
I am still trying.
I'm still pondering seriously.

266
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:14,200
There are many ways to find clues.
Take this jar for instance.

267
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,000
You can judge from its material, texture
and the words on it.

268
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,279
A bottom cannot be restored.

269
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,079
But that can't become
your excuse, right?

270
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,720
Right, you made some very good points.

271
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,920
Muqing, what are you going to do?

272
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:35,680
Make you confess.

273
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,880
No need for that. I am one of you.

274
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,240
Is that so?

275
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,039
Pry her hands open.

276
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,000
Muqing, she knows nothing.
There's no use doing this.

277
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,400
Is that so? Am I wrong?

278
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,480
I clearly saw her winking at you.

279
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,039
Really? I didn't notice.

280
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,680
It might be because the two of us
have been in the same room,

281
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,160
and over time
we had feelings for each other.

282
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,160
You are one of us, but she is not.

283
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,519
She is a member of Tongmenghui.

284
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,319
Tongmenghui? She is a rebel.

285
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,319
Right, do you like a rebel?

286
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,200
No, how could that be possible?

287
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,559
I think so too. You only love money.

288
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,400
That's right.

289
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,400
Muqing, she is a felon.

290
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,576
Shouldn't you take her back
for interrogation?

291
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,200
Isn't it a good opportunity
to get you promoted?

292
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:45,160
Right. I just started to torture her.
If I stop right now,

293
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,039
wouldn't it be a bit embarrassing?

294
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,920
You enlightened me.

295
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,680
Haohan, have you thought of something?

296
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,440
The scripture on the porcelain jar
actually comes from a Buddhist sutra.

297
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,519
Understood.

298
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,599
Do you know it had a great impact
after being introduced in China?

299
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,559
If you speak any slower,
she really will run out of breath.

300
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:12,519
The most famous translator of this sutra

301
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,359
is the abbot of Anhui Temple in Fujian.
But he died.

302
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,160
No, he entered nirvana.

303
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,720
The material of this jar
is white porcelain.

304
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,680
It's made in Dehua, Fujian.

305
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,440
So this jar should be a ritual implement
from Anhui Temple in Fujian.

306
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,000
Haohan, you are really a genius!

307
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,079
No. It was you who enlightened me.

308
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,240
Then let's pack up and go to Fujian.

309
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,759
Good. Going with you to Fujian

310
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:37,359
is my good fortune and my luck.

311
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Your Highness, Zhuo Bufan reported
that he found a key clue in Pingyao.

312
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,559
He is now heading south to Fujian.

313
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,440
What about the Department?

314
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Zhuo Bufan claimed only he had the clue,
and the Department didn't.

315
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,039
However, both the Department
and Beiyang Army are after him now.

316
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,240
Beiyang Army? How did they get involved?

317
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,079
I looked into it.
It's the 43rd Association.

318
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,240
Shanxi is their turf.

319
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,920
Perhaps some local soldiers
took some actions.

320
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,480
But once Zhuo leaves Shanxi,
there's not much they can do.

321
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,200
Your Highness,
your son-in-law is waiting outside.

322
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,599
Let him in.

323
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,880
Father, I've heard something.

324
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,000
The guards dispatched by the Department
have gone to Shanxi.

325
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,880
They've had a conflict
with some swordsmen

326
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
and even alarmed
the 43rd Association of Beiyang Army.

327
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,759
I don't know what caused the conflict.

328
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,559
I didn't want to tell you so soon.

329
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,240
But since you know, I'll tell you.

330
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,440
Zhuo Bufan and his people
from Rongtian Ridge

331
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,960
are following my order
to search for the Altar Treasure.

332
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,840
The Altar Treasure?
Isn't that just a legend?

333
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,760
But this legend has been sought
by the Department for over a century.

334
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
They just haven't found it yet.

335
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,920
I have obtained a clue.

336
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,920
There is someone who holds the secret
to unlocking the treasure.

337
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,400
He wants to tell
Tongmenghui this secret.

338
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,639
But if Tongmenghui
gets financial support,

339
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,199
it will ruin our grand plan.

340
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,039
Exactly, so I intervened.

341
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:49,440
The reason I used Zhuo Bufan's people,
but not your military forces,

342
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,840
is because everything you do
would draw attention of the Department

343
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,440
and even alert the generals
of Beiyang Army.

344
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,199
Father, why do we have to
prevent Beiyang Army from noticing?

345
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,199
I'm staging a coup. After that,
Beiyang Army will be watching.

346
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,000
Once they find
their interests cannot be assured,

347
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,559
they will reinstate the Aisin-Gioro clan
under the guise of restoration.

348
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:28,159
Haichao, your status in Beiyang Army
is not yet high enough.

349
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,360
You are not convincing enough.

350
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,400
You can lead the army
to assist the coup,

351
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,920
but you can't convince
the entire Beiyang Army.

352
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,639
If Beiyang Army launches a restoration
after the coup,

353
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,400
both of us will
bear the infamy of being rebels.

354
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,440
So I need to eliminate
this hidden danger in advance.

355
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,599
Father, you have a plan?

356
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,360
My plan is very simple.
Just guarantee their interests.

357
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,079
Altar Treasure is a great fortune.

358
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,440
If we get hold of it,

359
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,320
we'll have a bargaining chip
against Beiyang Army.

360
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,920
Aren't you moving back in with them?

361
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:22,320
In this world, who else can be trusted?

362
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,280
That old man has been using
me all along.

363
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,679
He kept such a big secret from me.

364
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:33,239
My career and my safety
mean nothing to him.

365
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,159
My status in Beiyang Army
is not high enough?

366
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:40,400
If I were in a high position,
it would not be him to take charge.

367
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:46,360
I have shared ups and downs with him
and also trusted him with all my heart.

368
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,240
But he still treats me as an outsider.

369
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:53,860
Then don't blame me
for anything that will happen.
