(Fenzhou, Shanxi)

2
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,559
You must try the food here.

3
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,399
Another time, maybe.

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,320
- I'm still working.
- Well.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,640
You still need to eat.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,440
Come. No matter what,
we still have to eat, right?

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,559
Before I find Zhuo Bufan
and his fellows,

8
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,920
I really don't feel like eating.
Thanks anyway.

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,840
Haven't we been searching nonstop?

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,359
Come on. Sit.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,312
Don't worry. We are conducting
strict checks on all traffic arteries.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
As long as those
from the Rongtian Ridge show up,

13
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,240
they'll certainly not be able to escape.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,039
Alright, let's eat. Find the records
from temples everywhere soon.

15
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,759
The order was already given. Here.

16
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,359
I don't smoke.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,399
Server! Menu.

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,039
Coming.

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,000
What would you like to eat?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,319
Come on. Order as much as you like.

21
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,280
These two signature dishes.

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,840
Stop! Don't run!

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,200
Move aside!

24
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:14,079
(Fenyuan Restaurant)

25
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,040
Stop!

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,640
Catch her!

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,799
Stop!

28
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,879
- Move aside!
- Move aside!

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,599
What's going on?

30
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,000
Those are guards from a brothel.

31
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,159
Someone didn't pay?

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,760
You might not know.

33
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,840
That brothel has gotten
a new batch of girls.

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,519
I hear they are all quite good.

35
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,159
The madam was just about
to train those girls,

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,319
but one of them ran away,
and these guards are chasing her.

37
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,280
Stop!

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,200
Then isn't this girl going to suffer
if she's caught and taken back?

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,120
Yeah. Look, they caught her.

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,079
Don't move.

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,239
This poor girl.

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,200
Run. Go. Behave yourself.

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,680
Run! Go!

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,439
Mr. Wang.

45
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:22,912

46
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,400
=Episode 15=

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,879
I'm not bad, right?

48
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,039
You've just fixed a pot.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Try restoring the base as well.

50
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,759
Who am I? I'm a genius.
You know what a genius is, right?

51
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,519
A genius is someone with good luck,

52
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,600
talent and...

53
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,439
And a lot, in short.

54
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,319
In essence, it's an astonishing talent.

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,920
You. Just hear me out.

56
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,959
Actually, I already know
the origin of the porcelain jar.

57
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,079
I just haven't told Men Sandao.

58
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,639
You know it?

59
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,800
I've been wanting
to talk to you about this.

60
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,800
You're just too impatient.

61
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,000
Say it.

62
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,560
I've always considered
you a close friend.

63
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,759
But you always misunderstand me.

64
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,360
If you don't want me
to misunderstand you, tell me now.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,839
Imperial guards, the Beiyang Army
and martial arts masters

66
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,240
are all frantically searching for it,

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,319
so it must be extraordinary
and very valuable.

68
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,560
This must be a big fortune.

69
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,120
If I can't make a profit from it,

70
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,360
wouldn't it be a regret,
a misfortune or a tragedy in life?

71
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,839
How unlucky that would be.
Don't you think so?

72
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,040
Do you really know
the secret on the porcelain jar?

73
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,240
Miss Liu, we've known
each other for so many days.

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,600
Have I ever said anything boastful?

75
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
You actually don't believe me?

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,639
Now we're both locked up together.

77
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,639
Can't we be honest with each other
and share what we know?

78
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,079
So what exactly is it? Tell me.

79
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,439
Then I'll tell you
about the secret of the porcelain jar.

80
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,959
If I tell you, will you tell me?

81
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,959
I am a man of my word. I'm all ears.

82
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,240
It's okay. I suppose it's a long story.

83
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,519
Take your time, as the night is long.

84
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,120
Fine, I'll tell you.

85
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,600
Tell me.

86
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
I am from the Tongmenghui.

87
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,959
The Tongmeng... The Tongmenghui?

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560
The rebels, traitors?

89
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
Miss Liu, it's a serious subject.

90
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Reckless talk could cost you your head.

91
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,024
I came here on a mission.

92
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,920
I came to Shanxi to look
for a secret treasure.

93
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,199
What are you laughing at?

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,959
What mission? Coming
to Shanxi for a secret treasure?

95
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,439
Even if there were one,
it certainly wouldn't be in Shanxi.

96
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,160
Everyone here has real skills,
and every family has good things.

97
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,800
Whatever was underground
would have been taken long ago.

98
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,480
Wait. The treasure isn't in Shanxi?

99
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,759
Shanxi is just a clue, right?

100
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,279
The porcelain jar itself is the clue?

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,360
Miss Liu, let's talk about it.
It'd be a good deal.

102
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,600
Let's start with the size.

103
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,439
How much is the secret treasure
we're looking for worth?

104
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,560
Lin Haohan, as long as you tell me
the secret of the porcelain jar,

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,879
I can offer the highest price.
I'll make sure you won't be at a loss.

106
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,399
Stop giving me this empty talk.
You're not even as rich as I am.

107
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,279
You don't believe it?

108
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,079
Surely not! From Shanghai to Shanxi,
I've been paying for all your bills.

109
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,000
I secretly went through your luggage.
You hardly have any money.

110
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,639
I'm telling you,
I'm a member of the Tongmenghui.

111
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,480
I know that.
Who are you trying to scare?

112
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,639
The Tongmenghui is led
by Mr. Sun who aims to overthrow

113
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,679
feudal rule and establish
a democratic government.

114
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,080
I read books and newspapers.
Of course, I know.

115
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,679
Mr. Sun is super rich. Do you know that?

116
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,759
Mr. Sun...

117
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,399
It seems so.

118
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,639
So, as long as you tell me
the secret of the porcelain jar,

119
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,200
Mr. Sun will surely reward you
with a huge fortune in the future.

120
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,879
That's unreliable.

121
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,080
You don't trust Mr. Sun?

122
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,360
I don't trust you. You've tricked me
several times already.

123
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,320
Let me tell you. If I tell
this secret to Men Sandao,

124
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,559
he will definitely be overjoyed.

125
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,759
And if I ask, he will give me a deposit.

126
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,432
Besides, he is an imperial guard.
He's surely richer than you.

127
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,456
And you. You're going to pay afterwards.

128
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:29,120
That sounds unreliable.

129
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,000
Who can say for sure about the future?

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,720
Who knows if you will pay?

131
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,039
We will absolutely
honor our commitments.

132
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,519
Do not lie to me. I am a businessman.

133
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,639
I absolutely won't engage
in unreliable affairs.

134
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,919
Fulfill your promise now

135
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,704
or I'll have to talk to someone else.

136
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,320
We're stuck here.
I can't fulfill it now.

137
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,159
Now...

138
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,240
I have an idea.

139
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,799
Miss Liu,
if you give me some sweetener...

140
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I might consider it.

141
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,720
You scum, loser,
money-grubbing lowlife. You wish!

142
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,000
It's just business. I made my offer.

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,080
We can still be friends
even if we don't reach an agreement.

144
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,976
Don't curse once you hear my offer.

145
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,559
Forget it, Miss Liu. It seems
you don't want to do business with me.

146
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,720
I should go to Men Sandao then.

147
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,759
Wait, you can't tell Men Sandao.

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Why not?

149
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,320
Someone! Lin Haohan
is having an episode!

150
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,919
What's wrong?

151
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,519
There.

152
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,919
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

153
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,759
She's run off. Chase her!

154
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,919
Listen carefully.
First, you absolutely cannot escape.

155
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,519
Second, Zhuo Bufan
and his fellows are in Shanxi.

156
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,519
It'll be even worse
if you fall into their hands.

157
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,760
Third, I've given you a chance.
If you want to leave,

158
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,039
just tell me all the secrets
about the treasure.

159
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,368
As long as you do it,
I will let you go immediately.

160
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:27,456
Take her back.

161
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,440
Muqing, I got beaten up.

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,559
Watch her closely. If she
runs away again, you'll be done for.

163
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,159
- Yes.
- Yes.

164
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,039
Muqing, I...

165
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,559
You can't even escape.

166
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,000
Getting caught again so soon.

167
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,559
Miss Liu, no offense,
but is this how you do business?

168
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,879
Don't you even honour a contract?

169
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,960
Would others of the Tongmenghui
deceive people like that?

170
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,200
I guess you won't give me anything.

171
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,799
I might as well sell
the information to Men Sandao.

172
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,864
At least the people of the Department
won't attack me behind my back.

173
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,279
Lin Haohan, you are a Chinese person
who has returned from overseas.

174
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,799
You've been exposed to new things.

175
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,600
How can you have no awareness at all?

176
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,759
If you have even a bit of conscience,

177
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,879
you must be clear
about what we are striving to do.

178
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,024
To rescue the countless compatriots
oppressed by the Qing Imperial Court.

179
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,120
To establish a powerful
and democratic nation.

180
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
If you reveal it to the court's minions,

181
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,600
I will definitely kill you.

182
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,440
How long has it been since you ate?

183
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,480
Several days. I got caught by them
as soon as I arrived in Anyang.

184
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,279
Why didn't you listen
to me and stay in the inn?

185
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,480
When I went back, the waiter
said you had already left.

186
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,440
I didn't listen to you.
I wanted to follow you secretly.

187
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,200
But you walked too fast,
and I couldn't keep up.

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
(Wine)
(After I arrived in Anyang alone...)

189
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,759
Miss, where are you going?

190
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,559
(I met a lady who said she was looking
for someone to share a ride to Shanxi.)

191
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,399
Want to share a ride?

192
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,919
(I was tricked by her.)

193
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,440
- Really?
- Let's go.

194
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,039
Let's go.

195
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,279
Thank you.

196
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,679
(They are human traffickers.)

197
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,159
(They took us to Fenzhou
to sell to a brothel.)

198
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,159
(I just managed to run away.)

199
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,120
If I hadn't met you, I don't know
what would have become of me.

200
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,279
Let me tell you what would happen.

201
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,280
Upon entering the brothel,
the madam would first inspect your body.

202
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,848
If you are a virgin,

203
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:22,159
she'll get you a nice piece of clothing
and label you with a high price.

204
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,519
And if not, she will give you
some passable clothes.

205
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,864
Then someone will teach
you how to serve men.

206
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,559
If you learn well, you won't be beaten.

207
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,960
If you don't, it wouldn't be surprising
for you to be beaten to death.

208
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,168
Those who are unwilling
to serve men will be tied up

209
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,200
and tormented by the men of the brothel

210
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,440
until their mind is completely numb.

211
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,200
Then you'll give in.

212
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,159
But you're really too lucky.

213
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,840
Our second lieutenant
has taken a liking to you.

214
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,000
You must be grateful
and serve Mr. Wang well.

215
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,080
It's a blessing

216
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,720
that you met Mr. Want today.

217
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,279
Ding Yu,

218
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,600
Miss Lin and I have known
each other for a long time.

219
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,960
What does it mean?

220
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,879
The two of us came together
from Dagu to Shanxi.

221
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,480
We just got separated along the way.

222
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,120
I understand. I'll shoot you dead today.

223
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,799
Don't kill anyone.

224
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,039
Ding Yu, let it go.

225
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,080
Your girlfriend?

226
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,840
You don't trust me again.

227
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,120
I do, and I don't at the same time.

228
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,440
I've questioned
those guards of the brothel.

229
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,992
Exactly as you said,

230
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,919
they bought you along with the madam
from the human traffickers.

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,960
The injuries on your hands are real.

232
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,320
Although the human traffickers
weren't found,

233
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,919
I believe everything you said.

234
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,399
You just feel everything
is too coincidental.

235
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,720
Yes, it's too coincidental.

236
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,360
Let me tell you the truth.

237
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,159
Even without those human traffickers,
I would still come to Fenzhou.

238
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,440
Go on.

239
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,599
I know Rongtian Ridge and the Department
are both searching for the treasure

240
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,480
and haven't found it. I will do it too.

241
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,559
You don't need to look at me like that.

242
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
I am not from the Tongmenghui
that you mentioned.

243
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,720
I just can't accept

244
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,559
the fact that they killed my family
when searching for the treasure.

245
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,119
I want revenge.
I want to find the treasure too.

246
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,240
Once I find it,

247
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,799
whoever killed my family,
I won't give it to them.

248
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,880
Can you do that?

249
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,359
I can't, but you can.

250
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,416
It's only been a few days.

251
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,960
You've gone from a constable
to a great general of the Beiyang Army.

252
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,640
Can't I just follow you?

253
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,200
What if I am not in this position?

254
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,559
Even if you're not,
you're still formidable.

255
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,839
I've never seen a pursuer like you.

256
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,680
I didn't let you follow me before
because I couldn't protect you.

257
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,720
Now I'm in the Beiyang Army.

258
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,759
If you want to follow me,
I won't drive you away.

259
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,000
As if you can.

260
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:21,240
You've changed.
Now you even buy clothes for me.

261
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,400
Ding Yu bought it. Without him
mentioning it, I wouldn't notice it.

262
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,559
What are you doing? Go to the inner room
to change, or I'll step out.

263
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,480
Back in Shanghai,
I already considered you a close person.

264
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,240
Do you still treat me like a stranger?

265
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,079
No, it's just inconvenient.

266
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,359
Martial Uncle.

267
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,960
Won't you rest for a few more days?

268
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,839
I've been resting every day
in the prison all these years.

269
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,240
I hear from Huanjie about
what you're doing. What's the next step?

270
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,599
Martial Uncle,
I'm still thinking about it.

271
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,960
We found a relic jar in a tomb
in Pingyao the other day.

272
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,720
But due to the situation,
we had to destroy it.

273
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,079
Do you know the origin of the relic jar?

274
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,720
Yes, I noticed a mark
on the base before it was destroyed.

275
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,119
(Made by the Great Zen Anhui Temple)
Great Zen Anhui Temple.

276
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,839
What's on your mind?

277
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,088
Since it bears the mark of the temple,

278
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,799
it's very likely
that the Altar Treasure is there.

279
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,920
And I have verified
that the temple is far away in Shandong.

280
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,216
The Beiyang Army
and the Department are watching us.

281
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,584
As well as the Japanese.

282
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,799
So, it's extremely difficult
to go there secretly.

283
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,960
That's what I was thinking about.

284
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,200
Have you come up with a solution?

285
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,480
I kind of have. I need your advice.

286
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:26,759
Right now, I'm their biggest target.

287
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,240
I can first lead a group
of people in another direction.

288
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,000
After I divert their attention,

289
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,880
Huanjie and Qin Tuo will escort you
to Shandong with the other disciples.

290
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,599
Later, we'll hurry to the Anhui Temple
to find the Altar Treasure.

291
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,039
Good. Let's do as you suggest.

292
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,079
You distract them,
and I'll take a stealthy path.

293
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,559
To better draw their attention,
take more people with you.

294
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,119
Okay.

295
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,319
But the Altar Treasure
is not in the Anhui Temple.

296
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,559
The Southern Shaolin
is also known as the Linquan Institute.

297
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,440
The Altar Treasure used to be called
the Linquan Treasure.

298
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,799
This legend has a history of 100 years.

299
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,680
Once, the Qing Imperial Court

300
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,799
sent countless imperial guards
in search of treasure.

301
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,184
But they always came back empty-handed.
Do you know why?

302
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:22,692
I didn't know before.

303
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,319
But after I got
the treasure map, I understood.

304
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,480
The map is incomplete.

305
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,000
We'll only find the other half
of the map in the Anhui Temple.

306
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,680
The map is not divided
into two parts, but three.

307
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,920
In Year 40 of Kangxi era, 3000 imperial guards
besieged the Southern Shaolin.

308
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,400
The monks were slaughtered,
and the temple was set ablaze.

309
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,759
The abbot and the Zen monastery
perished together.

310
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,799
(In In Year 40 of Kangxi era)
(Before dying, he entrusted the treasure)

311
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,680
(and the map
of hidden martial arts classics)

312
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:18,039
(to the Dharma, the Disciplinary
and the Bodhi Departments' chiefs.)

313
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,119
Each of them holds a part of the map.
You hold the passphrase. You head east.

314
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,640
Each of you takes a part. You go south.

315
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,279
You go west. You go north. Go now.

316
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,640
Amitabha.

317
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,559
The legend
has been around for 100 years.

318
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,759
Gradually, the Linquan Treasure
became known as the Altar Treasure.

319
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,599
With only one of the three parts,
no wonder the treasure cannot be found.

320
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,720
Even if we find the one
from the Bodhi Department in the temple,

321
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,960
it's in vain without the one
from the Dharma Department.

322
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,632
Even if you find all three parts,

323
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,640
without the mantra from the Prajna Hall,
it's still in vain.

324
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,759
Even so, we must continue the search.

325
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,880
Perhaps after finding the one
from the Bodhi Department,

326
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,400
we might obtain some new clues.

327
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,519
Go look.
This legend needs to be disclosed.

328
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,200
Such secretive news
about the three parts of the map.

329
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,680
How did you come to know that?

330
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,960
When I left, you all were still young.

331
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,480
Back then, I wanted to go out

332
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,799
and let the world see
our sect had unrivaled swordsmanship.

333
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:43,039
You became world-famous
soon after you left.

334
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,559
World-famous. Yes.

335
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,319
I thought I was.

336
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,440
But I just saw the corner of the world.

337
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,400
Come on. Show me your swordsmanship.

338
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,559
Okay. Sorry for my offense.

339
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,839
I lost.

340
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,480
Very good. You are much stronger
than my two junior brothers.

341
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,799
You are also much better than I am.

342
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,160
Your position
as the Sect Leader is indisputable.

343
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
But I lost.

344
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,039
If we used swords,
I'd be the one who lost.

345
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,799
I lost in the moves of the sword.

346
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,200
The technique you just used
isn't our style. What is it?

347
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
What sword move is that?

348
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,880
Impermanence.

349
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,440
Impermanence. No self. Suffering.

350
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,200
The Three Universal Truths technique
of the Bodhi Department.

351
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,440
The Southern Shaolin Bodhi Department.

352
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,200
When I thought I was famous
throughout the world, I met Cheng Yu.

353
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,519
Under his moves,
I couldn't withstand a single blow.

354
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,200
He made me realize
there's always someone stronger.

355
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,559
How could our sect possibly lose?

356
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,400
You think
the Rongtian Ridge cannot lose?

357
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,319
I have never let
the Rongtian Sword Sect lose.

358
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,799
The Rongtian Sword Sect.

359
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,599
Bufan, you are just
like I was in my youth.

360
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,319
You can't bear others
calling us the Rongtian Ridge.

361
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,000
Don't take it to heart.
You didn't lose to me

362
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,440
but to the thousand-year legacy
of Shaolin.

363
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,680
Speaking of which,
your sect's swordsmanship is stunning.

364
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,799
I have brought shame to our sect.

365
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,008
Come on.

366
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,119
Every day, you have
your sect on your lips.

367
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,319
Cheng Yu,

368
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,119
if someone else called us
the Rongtian Ridge, I would kill them.

369
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:54,000
With that logic, who knows
how many you would have to kill?

370
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:01,880
Mo Kun, if all you care
about is the sect's title,

371
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:07,559
your world is too narrow
and your skills will stop progressing.

372
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,000
Then what should I care about?

373
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,079
What about being the best in the world?

374
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,279
A weak sect can't be revitalized
by just one or two people.

375
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,160
Look at the sects lasting
for thousands of years.

376
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,359
They thrive on generations of disciples.

377
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,200
Your swordsmanship
is powerful, and so what?

378
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,799
A person who can't fight
can defeat you just with a firearm.

379
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,039
You can't stand it being called that
because you look down on it.

380
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,599
So the Rongtian Ridge
is still the Rongtian Ridge.

381
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,359
Cheng Yu lived beyond the frontier
because he was the inheritor

382
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:56,799
of the Bodhi Department's chief
who was sent north to hide the treasure.

383
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,920
Didn't you just ask me
how I knew about the treasure?

384
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,039
He told me.

385
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,920
Why would he so easily disclose
such a secret to you?

386
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,440
What of it if he told me?

387
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,559
Even he himself didn't know

388
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,160
where the inheritors to the Dharma
and Disciplinary Departments were.

389
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,279
Even if I tell you now,
would you be able to find them?

390
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,000
Cheng Yu and I became friends.

391
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,519
He introduced me to many people
and I witnessed many things through him.

392
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,400
One of the most powerful people
is named Shumulu Chatai.

393
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,480
He was the supervisor
of the imperial yamen at the time.

394
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,640
So he was the reason why you
were besieged by the Qing Imperial Court

395
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,279
for helping the Reformists.

396
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,000
Not exactly.

397
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,000
The Emperor has made up his mind.
He summoned Tan Sitong yesterday.

398
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,856
The Emperor said to him,

399
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,359
"Whatever changes you all desire,
feel free to tell me. I shall comply.

400
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,400
Should I err, you must tell me,
and I shall swiftly make amends."

401
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,039
Such a strong resolve.

402
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,119
The greater the resolve,
the more uncertainties there are.

403
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,480
Could there be uncertainties
in what the Emperor intends to do?

404
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,119
Yes, the Emperor can't have it
all his own way.

405
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,599
Otherwise, there would be
no need for reforms.

406
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,319
Scholars are passionate
and would like to shed blood.

407
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,400
Swordsmen should not bleed in vain.

408
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,799
The future is uncertain,
but we share the same will.

409
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,920
I'm not forcing you two.

410
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,960
You're not. That's what we want to do.

411
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,240
I don't understand
why a reform is needed,

412
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,240
but whatever Cheng Yu
plans to do, I will follow.

413
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,400
(Mr. Chatai has already passed away.)

414
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,039
(Before his demise, he told me to take
as many people as I could with me.)

415
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,200
(It's a pity Sitong refuses to leave.)

416
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,839
He says, "Reforms in all countries
commence with bloodshed."

417
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,720
"There's no bloodshed over reform in
China, so the country doesn't thrive."

418
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,839
"So please let me
be the first to bleed."

419
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,799
Now, the Qing Imperial Court
has blockaded the roads to the east.

420
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,559
We cannot take the sea route anymore.
Let's go beyond the frontier.

421
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,559
You lead the people to Shanxi.

422
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,079
My disciple Su Yunzhi will wait
for you there. I will catch up soon.

423
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:52,680
Alright.

424
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,599
These people are all seeds.

425
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,359
As long as there are seeds,
it can be reborn.

426
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,039
Sitong would like to face death.

427
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,279
Those who share
his aspirations are seeds.

428
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,839
His students are seeds.

429
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,119
Yang Changji, Cai E, they are young.

430
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,559
But they will sprout and grow up.

431
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,319
Once they grow up, they will be
the power that changes this world.

432
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
I somewhat understand you.

433
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,359
I know you're right,
but I can't disregard the sect.

434
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,480
Isn't letting everyone
in the world know about our sect

435
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,880
what my master and you hoped for?

436
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,039
You came out from the Rongtian Ridge

437
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:57,119
to let the entire world
know about your sect.

438
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,079
But have you thought about
whom exactly you want to let know?

439
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,639
Look at the world now. The country
is broken, and the people are in sorrow.

440
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,800
Even if you could become
the world's top swordsman,

441
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,039
what could you change?

442
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,136
I know you've won against many people.

443
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,400
But in the end,
what have you actually won?

444
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,360
The swords in our hands can take lives.

445
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,199
But they cannot change people's minds.

446
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,119
Those frail scholars hold
no swords in their hands.

447
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,039
But they desire to change the world.

448
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,159
They are changing the world.

449
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,679
They're smashing outdated notions

450
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,519
and paving the way for new ideas.

451
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,119
Mo Kun, this is what we should be doing.

452
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,000
To uphold justice.

453
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,039
Is there anything more heroic
than saving our country?

454
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,160
I'm telling you this

455
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,424
because I know you are secretly
under orders from Prince Qi

456
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,400
to revitalize the sect.

457
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,159
I am helping Prince Qi.

458
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,440
But it's just a transaction.

459
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,280
Do you know
what lies behind the transaction?

460
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:33,960
When I left back then, I thought
swordsmanship could change everything.

461
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,719
But the calamity 12 years ago

462
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,480
made me understand a thing.

463
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,159
If the country is weak,
all its people are helpless.

464
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:47,760
Swordsmanship cannot save a country.
A sword sect cannot strengthen it.

465
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,519
Only by reforming
can the country's fate be changed.

466
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,519
Up to today,
the Qing Imperial Court has decayed.

467
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,199
Only by overthrowing it
can the country be revitalized.

468
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,119
Bufan, I hope you can understand.

469
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,920
Finding the treasure and presenting it
to the nobles won't benefit the people.

470
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,719
Giving it to those
who can truly revitalize the country

471
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:15,079
is what we should do.
Only then it is a lofty ambition.

472
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:22,639
Thus, even if we lose our stronghold
and are forever nomadic,

473
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,639
we are the world's top sword sect
and will be renowned through the ages.

474
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,719
Bufan, let's do as you say.

475
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,119
You go to lure the enemy.
I'll go to the Anhui Temple in Shandong.

476
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,960
Martial Uncle.

477
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,480
Thank you, Martial Uncle.

478
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,360
Bufan, you did well.

479
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,719
Under your leadership,
the sect will surely grow stronger.

480
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,119
But you must remember what I have said.

481
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,880
The treasure should be given to those
who can truly revive the country.

482
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,159
Yes, I will.

483
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,736
(43rd Association, Shanxi Army)

484
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:05,960
Salute.

485
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,199
The men of the Rongtian Ridge left
by the west gate. They haven't gone far.

486
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,960
- Our men are watching them.
- We cannot let them escape.

487
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,559
- Go.
- Okay.

488
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,119
Are the clothes of Beiyang
so heavy that you walk so slowly?

489
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,840
I've already had two bowls of soup,
and you've only just caught up to here.

490
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:33,760
Continue.

491
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,880
Yes.

492
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,280
I'm heading over there.

493
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,232
You look so leisurely.

494
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:44,639
You've already caught them?

495
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,320
Of course not.

496
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,079
Then why not continue the pursuit?

497
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,639
Zhuo Bufan has been hidden from sight.

498
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,880
But today, he appeared
almost as if delivered to our doorstep.

499
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,679
So easy. Don't you think it's a trap?

500
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:00,840
I don't care. I'm gonna capture him.

501
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,639
Jialuo, you've been pursuing
Zhuo Bufan all the way from Dagu

502
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:06,656
to Shanghai and then to Shanxi.
You really can keep up the pursuit.

503
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,960
But besides chasing, use your brain.

504
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,239
Solving cases can't rely solely
on passion. One must be flexible.

505
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,760
You were stubborn before, which nearly
got you killed by Zhuo Bufan twice.

506
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,039
But at that time,
you had no other choice.

507
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:25,480
Now you have soldiers
and guns from Beiyang.

508
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,119
To continue being stubborn
would be stupid.

509
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:30,280
The Dagu murder case
is my responsibility.

510
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,599
I am determined to pursue Zhuo Bufan.

511
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,599
I will not and do not want
to overthink. Let's go.

512
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,639
Let me finish.

513
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,639
Zhuo Bufan and Huo Qin are heading west.

514
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,760
But Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo
are not among them.

515
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,280
So what?

516
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,480
You still don't understand?

517
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,200
I came upon receiving
news of Zhuo Bufan.

518
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,599
But I found
that not all of them were here.

519
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,880
Zhuo Bufan and some of them
are heading west.

520
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,960
Where is he going?
The Tibetan Empire? I don't believe it.

521
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,480
I stopped chasing to see
if he would change course.

522
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,280
Your men are watching them?

523
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,320
Isn't that obvious?

524
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,519
You suspect that they
have split into two to distract us.

525
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:21,152
Obviously. But such a simple issue.
Both of us can see through it.

526
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,280
Zhuo Bufan
would have thought of it, too.

527
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,079
He just wants to play a game with us
and let us guess.

528
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,280
Hurry up.

529
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,400
Jialuo, how is it going?

530
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,320
We found their traces.

531
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,760
A few of them changed clothes
and went east. Hurry.

532
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,112
Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo
just appeared in Han clothing

533
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:04,320
at the east gate and then headed east.

534
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,480
Another bowl of soup. So you think
we should split up to pursue them?

535
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,280
I'm not stupid.

536
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,199
Zhuo Bufan did that
to make us chase them separately.

537
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,679
If we really do that,
wouldn't we fall into their trap?

538
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,320
You're starting to use your brain.

539
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,079
So, whom do you think we should chase?

540
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,360
The Altar Treasure
is their primary target.

541
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,000
Logically, the most important matter
would be handled by Zhuo Bufan.

542
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,752
You said it, "logically".

543
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,280
Logically, Zhuo Bufan would be able

544
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,039
to think we could
see through their trap.

545
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,119
So Zhuo Bufan and his fellows
didn't hide their tracks

546
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,000
and showed up in Lingxi clothing

547
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,360
just for us to discover them.

548
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,440
But Yu Huanjie
and others didn't hide either.

549
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,400
You found them
just as they left the city, didn't you?

550
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,239
That's still Zhuo Bufan.

551
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,079
Men Sandao's men
are no longer chasing us.

552
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,760
They just sent a few to tail us.

553
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,119
They must have spotted
Yu Huanjie and Martial Uncle.

554
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,480
Would they see through it?

555
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,119
Zhuo Bufan didn't even
change his clothes.

556
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,039
Clearly, he's making
himself look like bait,

557
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,920
afraid that we won't chase him.

558
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,000
But he knows
I wouldn't be deceived so easily.

559
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:26,080
Just like you said.

560
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,039
Logically, he should personally
handle such an important matter.

561
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,159
But if he can think of it, we can too.

562
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,320
So he deliberately
made himself look like bait.

563
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,840
The more he looks like bait,
the less likely it's true.

564
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,360
So, you want to chase after
Yu Huanjie's party.

565
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:46,559
I want to wait longer.
