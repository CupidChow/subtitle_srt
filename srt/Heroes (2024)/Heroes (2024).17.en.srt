1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,519
Shanxi is governed
by the 43rd Association.

2
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,039
Once I'm out of Shanxi,
I'll act beyond my authority.

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,000
I must ask for permission.

4
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,079
General Long Chi is out on official duty
and not in camp.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,600
Deputy Ding Yu needs his permission

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,600
before he can lead troops to Fujian.

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,280
How did you come out without permission?

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,280
Me?

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,640
I am a constable
of the Dagu County Yamen.

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,640
- According to...
- According to the Qing Code,

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,119
you're pursuing a criminal
across provinces.

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,200
I have to recite the legal code
when talking to you.

13
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,359
However, I won't hate you when you don't

14
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,560
wear the Beiyang uniform.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,600
Thank you, sir.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,920
I'm glad to hear that.

17
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,320
Who is that woman?

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
She is the complainant
in the Dagu Murder Case of Nine Deaths.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,320
She is also the only survivor.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
She identified the crimes
of Rongtian Ridge.

21
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,799
I have already examined her in detail.

22
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:02,880
She's not suspicious.

23
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,560
Nor is she one of the Reformists.

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,400
If she were suspicious,

25
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,519
I would have thrown her in jail

26
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,879
or directly executed her.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
I trust you.

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,599
You're a man of integrity.

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,079
But aren't you a bit too good

30
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,079
to her?

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Do you like her?

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,079
Miss Lin has taken very good care of me.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,319
Are you in love?

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,480
No.

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,680
She and I...

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,319
Alright.

37
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,599
I don't care about that.

38
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,000
If you're fine, just take her with you.

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,519
It's getting late.

40
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,439
Go to sleep.

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,400
What?

42
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,640
Miss Lin is inside.

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,239
That's good.

44
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,079
You two sleep together.

45
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,120
How can I?

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,640
You want to sleep here with me?

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,120
It's a big place.

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,799
You sleep here, and I sleep there.

49
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,719
I won't take up space.

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,239
No matter what, you get out of here.

51
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,519
Can't you buy another ticket?

52
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,200
Don't tell me you've run out of money.

53
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,120
Didn't you take money
with you before leaving?

54
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,280
Have you decided

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
to spend my money all the way?

56
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,280
Fine.

57
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,919
You take this.

58
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,000
No, sir.

59
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:16,960
Don't give me your keys.

60
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,560
No.

61
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
I beg you to accept it.

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,439
- Thanks for not sleeping here.
- Sir.

63
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Get lost.

64
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,632
Sir.

65
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,800
Why do you...?

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,479
Didn't I arrange a room

67
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,879
for you and Lin Haohan separately?

68
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,479
No guards outside my room.

69
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,199
Are you asking for trouble?

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,400
You're uncomfortable
with no one watching you?

71
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Aren't you afraid I'll run?

72
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,759
You can try.

73
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,280
You're on a train. Where can you go?

74
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,599
You could jump out the window.

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,879
Go ahead.

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
If you dare to jump, I won't stop you.

77
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,280
Didn't you say you

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,919
and your people could die
for a just cause?

79
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,680
I know what you're thinking.

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
You want to find the Altar Treasure.

81
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,639
You know I'm looking for it too.

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,439
Even if I run away,

83
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,360
my trajectory will be similar to yours.

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,240
You have more information than I do.

85
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,199
And you can act much more conveniently
than I can.

86
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,240
If I follow you,

87
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,280
I'll be likely to find the truth.

88
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,439
So you believe

89
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,240
that even with no one watching me,
I won't leave.

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
You make a good point.

91
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,599
But it's all wrong.

92
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,439
You made it to Shanxi.

93
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,439
It means Tan Xian had told you
the secret before he died.

94
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,879
Zhuo Bufan also knows this secret.

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,360
That's why they also came to Shanxi.

96
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,879
We knew Tan Xian's secret

97
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,039
and came to Shanxi.

98
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,199
The clue about Fujian was found

99
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,319
by us after getting to Pingyao

100
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
and discovering the tomb
of Bodhi's inheritor.

101
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,800
On the surface,

102
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,199
Tan Xian's secret ends here.

103
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,879
But I don't think it's so simple.

104
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,879
Otherwise, just for digging a grave,

105
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,560
did Tan Xian have to go to Shanghai

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,919
and risk his life?

107
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
So, there's something

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
I don't know about Tan Xian's secret.

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
But you know

110
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,000
what it is.

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,879
Even if I know,

112
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,319
do you think I will tell you?

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,039
Of course, you won't.

114
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,479
And I'm not gonna ask you.

115
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,719
But when you have to

116
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,240
use this secret,

117
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,800
you naturally can't hide it anymore.

118
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,240
You don't have to laugh.

119
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,039
I know you well.

120
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,319
Yes.

121
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,479
You won't jump out the window.

122
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,879
But you really can risk your life

123
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,360
for your cause.

124
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,279
I believe that.

125
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,519
You captured many of my people?

126
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,959
From Tongmenghui?

127
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,240
You are the first.

128
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Then why do you believe?

129
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,040
Many people can lose their lives
for their causes.

130
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,959
I've long known it.

131
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,664
(Rich or poor,)

132
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,053
(all beings shall be equal.)

133
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:21,007
(Someone once told me this.)

134
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:22,848
(But back then,
I was naive and ignorant.)

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,400
(It was on this train
from Shanghai to Shanxi)

136
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,520
(that I brushed past this swordsman.)

137
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,360
(Suddenly,)

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,240
(I was reminded
of those words once again.)

139
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,720
(Everyone has a past.)

140
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
(Even a court's hound)

141
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,960
(has a past too.)

142
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
(My name is Men Sandao.)

143
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
(I spent 12 years in prison.)

144
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,000
(After leaving prison,
I found the world had changed.)

145
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,320
(In this nameless year,)

146
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
(everyone is doing their own business.)

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
(They do it for survival,)

148
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,760
(while I seek justice.)

149
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
(Nowadays,)

150
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,480
(being good is always harder
than being bad.)

151
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,640
(Retentive feelings can be gone,
and the clever will suffer.)

152
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
(So I thought)

153
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,400
(I would live a mundane life
for the rest of my life.)

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,440
(But when the gunshot rang out,)

155
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,240
(I kind of saw her again,)

156
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,080
(the one I've remembered for 12 years)

157
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,840
(but dare not mention her.)

158
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,800
(She looked very much like her.)

159
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,160
(The way they walk is similar.)

160
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,560
(I watched her for a while.)

161
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,320
(I know it was not her.)

162
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,960
(It's that I missed her.)

163
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,880
(I missed her, so she looked like her.)

164
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
(Things couldn't go back again.)

165
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
(Just as trains don't run backwards.)

166
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,960
(Timing is very important.)

167
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,040
(It won't work if it comes too early)

168
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,320
(or too late.)

169
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,552
=Heroes=

170
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,778
=Episode 17=

171
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,000
Yu Huanjie left us a secret letter.

172
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,560
Zhuo Bufan lured the enemy.

173
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,839
He took people
to Shandong's Anhui Temple.

174
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,199
And the next clue is there.

175
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,786
(April 1st, 1911, Yu Huanjie)

176
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,319
Shandong is controlled by the Japanese.

177
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,120
I've sent a secret telegram,

178
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,759
instructing them to watch closely.

179
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,639
Cancel it.

180
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,519
Yu Huanjie's information comes slowly.

181
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,079
He's the bait
we arranged to lure the enemy.

182
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,399
Lin Anjing has sent a message

183
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,800
saying that Zhuo Bufan

184
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,160
and his people have gone
to Fujian's Anhui Temple.

185
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,959
Men Sandao and Wang Jialuo

186
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,800
have already rushed over.

187
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,040
I have two beds in my room.

188
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,680
Why do you have to sleep here?

189
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,839
Why not?

190
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,079
I'm quite fine here.

191
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,519
Come in with me.

192
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,199
It's inappropriate.

193
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,639
What are you doing?

194
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,839
If you don't come in with me,

195
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,959
I'll stay here with you.

196
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,120
You're not like the constable
I thought you were.

197
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
You speak like a scholar.

198
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,800
Actually, I was originally a scholar.

199
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
I see.

200
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,200
My family lived
in the suburbs of Tianjin.

201
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,639
I come from a family of scholars.

202
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,639
But my family collapsed
when I was little.

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,000
My father was a Xiucai in 1877.

204
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,200
But after ten years of study,

205
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,320
he failed to get an official rank.

206
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,480
So he spent all his efforts

207
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
on you?

208
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,639
My father was strict when teaching me.

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,720
I've been good with Baguwen.

210
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,879
Now and then, my father would let me

211
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,759
take the simulated exams.

212
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,120
I'm sorry to hear that.

213
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
In 1902, I was ready

214
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,840
for the imperial examination.

215
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,039
But that year,

216
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,200
my mother passed away.

217
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,759
I had to observe mourning

218
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,759
for three years.

219
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,120
Three years later,

220
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,080
the imperial examination was abolished.

221
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,720
My father hoped
that I could attain scholarly honors.

222
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,320
Unexpectedly,

223
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
he suddenly died

224
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,679
in pain.

225
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,120
After I finished my father's funeral,

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,200
I had nothing left.

227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,960
I had to make a living.

228
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,679
So I found a job

229
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,759
in Dagu County Yamen.

230
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,559
(Originally, I wanted
to apply for a clerical position.)

231
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,840
(But they were recruiting constables.)

232
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,879
(I was just watching.)

233
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,799
(Somehow I got pushed
into the selection ground.)

234
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,040
Yes.

235
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,799
Hurry up and fight.

236
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm here to apply...

237
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,759
Don't waste time.

238
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,159
Hurry up and fight.

239
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,039
Well done.

240
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,639
Go on.

241
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,600
Sir.

242
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,200
I am...

243
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,039
I know you are capable.

244
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,360
But one fight is not enough.

245
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,112
Next one.

246
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:18,656
Fight him.

247
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:19,399
Come on.

248
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,080
I...

249
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,799
Go on.

250
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:41,320
Interesting.

251
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,200
You're good.

252
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,399
Come here.

253
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,960
What's your name?

254
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,679
Wang Jialuo.

255
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,399
Sir.

256
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,799
You're hired.

257
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,600
A constable.

258
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,639
W-Wang...

259
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,000
Wang what?

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,039
Wang Jialuo.

261
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,080
Yes, Wang Jialuo.

262
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,159
Sir, I am here to apply for paperwork.

263
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,159
I know what you're here for.

264
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,919
You take it down.

265
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,960
You have good skills.

266
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,440
If you do the paperwork,

267
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,960
isn't that a disgrace to scholars?

268
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,039
I think...

269
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,600
Young man.

270
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,799
Step forward.

271
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,240
Sir.

272
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
A constable is well-paid.

273
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,600
Your salary is double that of a scribe.

274
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,960
Be content with it.

275
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
I want to be a constable,
but they won't allow me.

276
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,759
Exactly.

277
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,399
Constables are powerful,

278
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,799
carrying a blade with them

279
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,840
and bringing all good stuff back home.

280
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,519
And they can act with impunity

281
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,080
and bully people.

282
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,279
How exciting it is.

283
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,279
Sir.

284
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,840
What I hate most
in my life is bullying people and acting

285
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,600
with impunity.

286
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,240
We are testing you.

287
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,519
- We're testing you.
- We're testing you.

288
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,120
Yes.

289
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,080
He's hired.

290
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
(But you are a scholar.)

291
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,679
(How come you know kung fu?)

292
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,679
Good.

293
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,000
(I had a serious illness at 10.)

294
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,639
(After recovering,
my body had always been weak.)

295
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,559
(The doctor advised me
to practice martial arts to keep fit.)

296
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,879
- Good.
- Good.

297
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,919
(But my family was too poor
to afford a martial arts teacher.)

298
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,879
I remember there was an old lunatic
in a broken temple

299
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,799
in my village.

300
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,639
He claimed himself
a martial arts master.

301
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,679
I learned from him for a few years.

302
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,480
Unexpectedly, I became much stronger.

303
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,399
Actually, I didn't even know
if my kung fu was good.

304
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,519
When I competed for a job,

305
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,679
I fought for the first time.

306
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,600
After that, I realized

307
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,279
I was the top martial artist
in Dagu County.

308
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,600
You're indeed awesome.

309
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,360
You beat so many masters
from Rongtian Ridge.

310
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,320
Yes, indeed.

311
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
When chasing the murderers,

312
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,000
I encountered real masters.

313
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
Honestly, their kung fu was better
than mine.

314
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,879
But I feel

315
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,799
they weren't that much stronger.

316
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,320
I could also be considered a master.

317
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,559
(In my life,)

318
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
(what I hate most is the reform
and the abolition)

319
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,320
(of imperial exams.)

320
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,960
It took away your chance
of taking the imperial examination.

321
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,960
Of course, you hate it.

322
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,039
It left all scholars with no prospects.

323
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,559
However,

324
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,639
whether I can
take the imperial examination

325
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,080
is not the most important thing.

326
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,840
Then, what is the most important thing?

327
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,879
The reform shook the imperial power.

328
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,399
Thus, it destroyed the country.

329
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,440
Anything that endangers
the imperial power

330
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,639
and the court is detrimental

331
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,559
to the people

332
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,360
and the country.

333
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,039
The ancients have made it clear.

334
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,080
Once rules are established,

335
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,399
why should they be changed?

336
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,039
The same laws.

337
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,919
The same royal family.

338
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,039
The country was prosperous

339
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,399
with great influence.

340
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,399
Why should we change?

341
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,000
We need to be strong.

342
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,080
But do we have to reform?

343
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,919
Nowadays, the nation is weak.

344
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,879
and people are in a panic.

345
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,440
It is not the imperial regime
that needs change,

346
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,600
but the people.

347
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,480
If every scholar is willing

348
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
to relieve the emperor's worries

349
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,120
and serve the court,

350
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,720
and if every martial artist is willing

351
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,600
to fight and risk their lives

352
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,960
for the nation,

353
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,000
there will be no threat to us.

354
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,559
I do my best to chase the criminal

355
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,240
not only to uphold the law
and regulations

356
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,399
but also to motivate myself.

357
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
A nation needs a ruler.

358
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,519
A court needs rules.

359
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
The law needs to be upheld.

360
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,080
A minister cannot be without integrity.

361
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,679
Even though I am just a lowly constable,

362
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,679
and I no longer have the chance
to be an official,

363
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,440
I would rather stay in the county yamen,

364
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,559
adhering to the rules,

365
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,039
upholding the law perseveringly,

366
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,279
and being righteous

367
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,679
and honest.

368
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,399
Jialuo.

369
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,360
I really did not expect

370
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,480
that you are a man like this.

371
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,080
Don't you know what kind of man I am?

372
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,159
I told Men Sandao

373
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,240
only to save you.

374
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,120
I was worried about your safety.

375
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,799
I even forgot to negotiate a price

376
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,600
with Men Sandao.

377
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,120
Obviously, I am a sentimentalist.

378
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,639
It shows my true affection

379
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,159
for you, Miss Liu.

380
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,399
I get it.

381
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,759
You would rather die than see

382
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,320
the court's henchmen
get the secret treasure.

383
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,120
But who knows what will happen?

384
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,200
Zhuo Bufan might get it

385
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,080
and make a fortune.

386
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,639
Or maybe no one can find it.

387
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,799
Everyone's hope is dashed.

388
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,200
Fortunately,

389
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,480
we are now following Men Sandao.

390
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,080
If the Imperial Household Department
finds it,

391
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,000
there should be a reward for us too.

392
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,639
Anyway, we can give Mr. Sun
half of what we earn

393
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,879
as a kind gesture.

394
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,279
Miss Liu.

395
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,480
What do you say?

396
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,799
You came to see me

397
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,919
just to tell me this?

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,320
I just wanted

399
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,919
to express my feelings for you.

400
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,039
Get lost.

401
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,080
Muqing.

402
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,600
Where do you expect me
to go on this train?

403
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,559
I can tell you're a little grumpy.

404
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,720
Once we get to Jiangning,

405
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
I'll get you some tea to cool off.

406
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,320
Actually, once we're in Jinling,

407
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,639
there's no need for tea to cool down.

408
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,879
I just want to tell you one thing.

409
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,600
Listen to me.

410
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
With my sharp eyes,

411
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,639
good skills,

412
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,919
and a loyal heart to the court,

413
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,080
I finally found the key clue

414
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,840
from the shattered porcelain

415
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,320
and successfully pinpointed the target

416
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,599
towards Anhui Temple in Fujian.

417
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,960
Given that,

418
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,759
I have done a good job, right?

419
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,000
If the secret treasure is found,

420
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,440
I should get a share, right?

421
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,440
You'll get a big reward
after finding it.

422
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,200
That's very generous of you.

423
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,799
Very generous.

424
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,480
How much can I be rewarded?

425
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:25,960
I know.

426
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,880
You have to ask your leaders

427
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,960
about it.

428
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,119
But I think

429
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,400
20 percent...

430
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,599
It's definitely a bit much.

431
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:35,640
10 percent?

432
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,480
10 percent is reasonable, isn't it?

433
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,599
Alright.

434
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,319
Get out of here.

435
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,960
Could we sign a written agreement?

436
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,920
It's not that I don't trust you.

437
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,599
I'm just worried.

438
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,640
I mean, just in case,

439
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,480
something happens to you.

440
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,799
What if others don't acknowledge it?

441
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,640
No worries.

442
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
If I have to die,

443
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,720
I'll chop you down before I die.

444
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,119
No, you won't.

445
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,599
You're not that kind of person.

446
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,519
Muqing.

447
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,359
If the treasure we find

448
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,480
contains antiques or such,

449
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,599
with my skills,

450
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,160
I can get a good price on them.

451
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,039
Lin Haohan!

452
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,119
Your nagging is giving me a headache.

453
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:16,680
Get lost.

454
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,960
Otherwise, I'll throw you out.

455
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,000
Muqing.

456
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,119
Calm down.

457
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't get angry.

458
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,039
No need to throw me.

459
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,480
We're almost there.

460
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,400
Eat some.

461
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,160
Mr. Zhuo.

462
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:37,119
Water.

463
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,400
Thank you.

464
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,759
Hang in there.

465
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,279
We'll take a train once we reach Xi'an.

466
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:07,040
(Zhenjiang, Jiangsu)

467
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,559
Food, please.

468
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
Jiangnan is a prosperous place.

469
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,599
But why are there beggars
and refugees everywhere?

470
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,839
Flood.

471
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,119
A dozen counties are suffering.

472
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,359
Houses have been washed away.

473
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,640
Farmlands have been destroyed.

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,759
Many people have been displaced.

475
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,680
If the disaster is so severe,

476
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,359
why hasn't the court provided relief?

477
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,440
Has it been reported?

478
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,200
This year's rainfall is about the same
as in previous years.

479
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,759
But the funding allocated by the court

480
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,119
for the construction of the dam

481
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,359
has been embezzled

482
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,079
by the local officials.

483
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,440
The jerry-built dam
couldn't resist the flood

484
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,400
even before the water levels rose.

485
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,400
As a result, an ordinary flood

486
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,359
caused a breach in the dam.

487
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,960
The local officials feared
that the court

488
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,039
would investigate their misconduct
in dam construction,

489
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,559
so they concealed the disaster.

490
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,680
The yamen had no money,

491
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,119
so they desperately pre-collected taxes,

492
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,920
forcing merchants

493
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,160
to pay the taxes for the next ten years.

494
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,599
Originally, the money was gathered
for disaster relief.

495
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,000
Unexpectedly, a drought struck Zhejiang.

496
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,519
The court allocated funds
for disaster relief

497
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,039
and exempted some taxes.

498
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,400
The Imperial Household Department

499
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,440
decided to let Jiangsu prepare the money

500
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,559
that Zhejiang should give
to the Empress Dowager.

501
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,079
As a result,

502
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,319
the situation becomes unmanageable.

503
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
But facing so many disaster victims,

504
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,400
the local officials couldn't handle it.

505
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,880
A few days ago,

506
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,960
they had to plead
with the Imperial Household Department.

507
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,119
They could no longer neglect it.

508
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,039
Otherwise,

509
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:26,960
they can't hide it
after too many deaths.

510
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm just a minor official

511
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,119
without much money.

512
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,440
I donated half a year's salary.

513
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:39,160
Otherwise, I couldn't have invited you

514
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,440
to this small tavern.

515
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,240
What are you talking about?

516
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,680
The food at small taverns is delicious.

517
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:49,960
Getai.

518
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Your friend is a real man.

519
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,039
Of course, he is.

520
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,480
He can offend his superiors
wherever he goes.

521
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,079
That's why he ended up like this.

522
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,960
Here's to you.

523
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,096
Sir.

524
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:05,839
The local officials have heard
you are here.

525
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,599
And they've come over.

526
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,000
They're here.

527
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:13,839
I will take my leave.

528
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,599
I can't stand their hypocrisy
and ugliness.

529
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,720
That's good.

530
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,119
Since they're here,

531
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,799
they will surely pay for this meal.

532
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,319
I can save some money.

533
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,599
Getai.

534
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,759
Young man.

535
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,440
Take care.

536
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,759
See you.

537
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,559
Getai.

538
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,640
Your friend

539
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,319
is interesting.

540
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,440
He's tough.

541
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,480
Greetings, sirs.

542
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,079
I should have greeted you earlier.

543
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:57,240
Sir, how could you eat
in such a shabby place?

544
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,039
Please come with me.

545
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,319
I have prepared a banquet
at the finest tavern.

546
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,279
We have urgent matters to handle,

547
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,880
so we won't bother you two.

548
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,559
Thank you, anyway.

549
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,759
You two.

550
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,640
I do have pressing matters to handle.

551
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,319
Otherwise, upon our arrival,

552
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,200
we should have visited you both first.

553
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,519
You don't have to, sir.

554
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,480
Work matters more.

555
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,920
But eating also matters.

556
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,640
Let's go.

557
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,960
But we've already taken our seats.

558
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,039
It might not be proper to leave now.

559
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,119
Why not send someone

560
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,680
to bring over the liquor and dishes

561
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,640
you've prepared?

562
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,559
That's a good idea.

563
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:35,799
One more thing.

564
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,920
Are there any local specialties

565
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,880
that I can eat on the road?

566
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,960
Yeah, there are.

567
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,119
Crisp meat, soy sauce duck,

568
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,279
glutinous rice cakes, pork knuckles,

569
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,720
ham, and sausage.

570
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,240
I'll have them buy some

571
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,960
for you.

572
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,960
That's very kind of you.

573
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,799
Thank you.

574
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,920
When you go to the capital,

575
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,680
you will be my guest.

576
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,240
Getai.

577
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,000
Please give the victims the food

578
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,240
and local specialties prepared

579
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,640
by those two fools.

580
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,799
I have bought several hundred buns

581
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,799
from the shop

582
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,960
and will give them as well.

583
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,160
I spent my own money.

584
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,119
There are so many disaster victims.

585
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,359
How can we save them all?

586
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,400
Oh right.

587
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,920
Mr. Cunqing has arrived.

588
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,519
Mr. Cunqing?

589
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,759
Why is he here?

590
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,839
He's here for disaster relief.

591
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,920
He hears that we are here.

592
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,400
And he's waiting for you.

593
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,400
I will come over
after I distribute the food.

594
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,920
Okay.

595
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,040
Come.

596
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:50,599
Let's go.

597
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Don't you think

598
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,640
the entire dynasty is hopeless?

599
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,400
The imperial family, local authorities,
and the county yamen,

600
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,400
it's all utterly corrupt.

601
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,440
The ruler doesn't care for people.

602
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,359
Neither do the officials.

603
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,480
How can such a dynasty be saved?

604
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,319
You actually think the same, don't you?

605
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,680
You talked and laughed
with those local officials

606
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,480
just to get some food
for the disaster victims.

607
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,200
You want to help them.

608
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,000
You can't see them suffer hunger
or cold.

609
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,799
But how much can you do?

610
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,880
Can you save them?

611
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,119
The dynasty is thoroughly rotten

612
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,200
and hopeless.

613
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,599
We have to overthrow

614
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,960
and rebuild it to make it rise again.

615
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,160
It sounds emotional.

616
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,680
But if you speak

617
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,920
such treasonous words again,

618
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,480
I'll send you to the capital
and give you

619
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,759
to the Ministry of Justice.

620
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,448
Go.

621
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,599
A mixture of sorrow and joy.

622
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,920
Why did you say that, sir?

623
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,400
We finally have some clues
about the Altar Treasure.

624
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,480
That's a good thing.

625
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,599
But no one knows

626
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,079
who will get it in the end.

627
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,039
This matter is difficult to deal with.

628
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,880
It's not easy

629
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,160
to come this far.

630
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,319
I may not be able to find it.

631
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,799
But I will not lose to others.

632
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,160
If we can't have it,

633
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,440
neither will anyone else.

634
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,480
Sir.

635
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,400
No offense.

636
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,640
Speak your mind.

637
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,119
Have you already confirmed

638
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,160
that Prince Qi intends to rebel?

639
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,759
Then why don't you capture him?

640
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,799
With the power of the imperial yamen

641
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,920
and your strategies,

642
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,200
it shouldn't be difficult.

643
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,000
Catching him is very easy.

644
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,440
I can do that at any time.

645
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,920
Are you concerned

646
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,880
about what to do after catching him?

647
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,160
Yeah, what should I do after that?

648
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,160
To be frank,

649
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,039
His Majesty is still a child.

650
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,200
And Prince Qi is the emperor's cousin.

651
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,400
He wants to stage a coup.

652
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,720
The whole court

653
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,880
understands their family relationship.

654
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,920
In terms of power in the cabinet,

655
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,960
he won't lose to Prince Regent Zaifeng.

656
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,440
In terms of military power,

657
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,920
he has a son-in-law from Beiyang.

658
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,480
He is very close with the envoys
from various countries.

659
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,559
Perhaps many people in the court

660
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,720
think he is more suitable
than the Xuantong Emperor.

661
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,400
Take a look at this.

662
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,400
I specifically chose a gift

663
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
for Prince Qi.

664
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,720
It was personally written by Ouyang Xun.

665
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,279
Lie Yukou by Zhuangzi.

666
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,119
Have you read it?

667
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,640
Zhu Pingman learned
to slay dragons from Zhi Liyi

668
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,000
at a great cost.

669
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
He spent three years on it

670
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,240
but had no chance to use his skills.

671
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,039
You tried to remind Prince Qi

672
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,160
not to slay the dragon.

673
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,279
Prince Qi is a wise man.

674
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,839
He quickly sent me this feather fan.

675
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,119
Zhuge Liang used a feather fan before.

676
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,400
He used to write an article.

677
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,400
The one

678
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,720
who can recognize the circumstances
is truly wise.

679
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,480
But some fail to do it.

680
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,279
In a word, Prince Qi warned me

681
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,640
to recognize the circumstances.

682
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,839
Today, whether the nation

683
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,359
or Prince Qi,

684
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,359
they both face a cruel reality

685
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,839
which is that the country

686
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,759
is already a mess.

687
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,160
And to clean up this mess,

688
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,680
nothing

689
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,359
is more important than money.

690
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,000
So now we must

691
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,160
find the Altar Treasure
as soon as possible.

692
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,960
This way, we'll save the nation,

693
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,480
the court,

694
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,440
the imperial yamen,

695
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,279
and ourselves.

696
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,319
Understood.

697
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,640
Conversely,

698
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,039
if Prince Qi gets the treasure,

699
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,160
he will win thoroughly.

700
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,119
I don't want to see him win.

701
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,839
But I also don't want him to lose.

702
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,720
The best we can hope is

703
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,400
that we ourselves have the treasure.

704
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,880
The court has the treasure.

705
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,359
That way, Prince Qi will have to
obediently stay in the cabinet

706
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,559
and serve the nation.

707
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,680
I'll put it more seriously.

708
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,359
The safety of the state

709
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:15,079
is on your shoulders.

710
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,759
Sir.

711
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,559
There is something I don't understand.

712
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,480
Along the way,
I've seen many disaster victims live

713
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
in misery.

714
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,680
Now that you are here,

715
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,400
why haven't you opened the granary
for relief?

716
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,440
I'm here to provide disaster relief.

717
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,920
I'm also waiting and anxious.

718
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,200
Have the disaster relief supplies
not arrived yet?

719
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,880
Yes,

720
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,759
the supplies have arrived
three days before us.

721
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,599
Then why not give them out?

722
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,960
The time isn't right.

723
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,039
What?

724
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,640
Timing.

725
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,680
Muqing.

726
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,079
Disaster relief is all about timing.

727
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,200
If a flood or drought occurs,

728
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,000
and the court immediately
provides relief supplies,

729
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,440
the common people won't appreciate it.

730
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,079
They might even blame you.

731
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,799
Why do you come so late?

732
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,359
Do you bring enough supplies?

733
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,160
They'll complain the rice is too coarse

734
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,680
and the vegetables are not fresh.

735
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,920
Is there any meat to eat?

736
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,720
And it might be best to give money.

737
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,960
We still have to wait a bit longer

738
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,440
until tens of thousands
of more victims die.

739
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,000
Then, when we give out relief supplies,

740
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,359
everyone will be grateful to the court.

741
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,920
They will appreciate it.

742
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,559
We've learned something

743
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,079
from thousands of years
of disaster relief

744
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,960
It's probably about human nature.

745
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,200
In one word,

746
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,960
foolish.

747
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,480
Sir.

748
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,400
Save us.

749
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Sir, please open the door.

750
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,359
Save us, sir.

751
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,960
- Sir.
- Sir.

752
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,079
Sir, I am
from the Jiangnan Weaving Bureau.

753
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Sir.

754
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,960
I beg you.

755
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,039
Save me.

756
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,039
Save my whole family.

757
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,400
What difficulties do you have?

758
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,839
I was originally the accountant
at the Jiangnan Weaving Bureau.

759
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,039
My name is He Fugui.

760
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,599
You used to work for the government.

761
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,319
Sir.

762
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,599
There's something you don't know.

763
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,920
The Jiangnan Weaving Bureau
made substantial profits every year.

764
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,240
But it had to give too much money

765
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,000
to the yamen.

766
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,599
So, even with yearly profits,
it ended up with yearly deficits.

767
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,759
The bureau had to be downsized.

768
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,319
I have been jobless for three months.

769
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,599
I really dare not tell my wife

770
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,440
who has just given birth to a child.

771
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,079
Now, I don't have a penny.

772
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,880
My wife has no breast milk.

773
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,039
I had to get three fish
on credit for nursing.

774
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,640
The child needs thick clothes
for the winter.

775
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,359
Sir.

776
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,279
I planned to beg in the streets.

777
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,960
But there are too many beggars.

778
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,039
I really don't know what to do.

779
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,440
Sir.

780
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
I just need four taels of silver.

781
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,079
It will help my entire family

782
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,119
get through the tough times.

783
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,119
I'm begging you, sir.

784
00:31:59,119 --> 00:31:59,839
Sir.

785
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,200
Here are four taels of silver.

786
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,640
Enough to buy three dan of rice.

787
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,559
It's enough
to feed six or seven hundred people.

788
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,640
Should the money be given to you first

789
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,799
or to the hundreds of people

790
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,440
to keep them from starving,

791
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,200
so they can look for ways
to feed themselves?

792
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,400
No, sir.

793
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,559
I only need four taels of silver.

794
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,680
You can't just stand by and not help.

795
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,519
It's not that I don't pity you.

796
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,000
I must think about
all the disaster victims.

797
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,759
Sir.

798
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,480
You can't just stand by and do nothing.

799
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,319
Sir.

800
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,640
Sir.

801
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,319
I have never skimped on paying taxes.

802
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,279
I have also helped yamen
make a lot of money at the bureau.

803
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,880
Now I have fallen on hard times.

804
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,359
I can't even
beg for four taels of silver.

805
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,079
You're forcing people into rebellion.

806
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,240
Rebellion?

807
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,279
You want to rebel?

808
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,079
You dare to rebel?

809
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,119
Take him down.

810
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,599
Sir.

811
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,119
Sir.

812
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,039
You can't just stand by and do nothing.

813
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,160
Sir!

814
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,640
You do your things.

815
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,799
The right time is coming.

816
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,240
Food will be distributed
before nightfall.

817
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,039
Please, sir.

818
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,000
- Sir.
- Sir.

819
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,279
Please give us some food.

820
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,680
Everyone, don't push.
There's enough for everyone.

821
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,319
Come on.

822
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,519
Hurry.

823
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,720
Line up.

824
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,240
Everyone, line up.

825
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,359
There's enough for everyone.

826
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,519
In good order.

827
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
This is the court.

828
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,160
This is the kindness.

829
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,000
I want food.

830
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,640
Many people will starve
because of this disaster.

831
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,359
Make way.

832
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,599
Even if the court is in a hard time,

833
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,960
it cannot neglect its people.

834
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Natural or man-made disasters.

835
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,039
When disaster strikes,

836
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,800
only the court can turn the tide.

837
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,344
Sir.

838
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:17,960
Give me food.

839
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,360
Please give us something to eat.

840
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,239
Let's go.

841
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,519
Please give us some food.

842
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,360
Miss Lin.

843
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,519
Thank you.

844
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:27,800
Xian Ge.

845
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,352
Sir.

846
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,920
Do me a favor.

847
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,480
Go to the Weaving Bureau

848
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,440
to inquire about
the former accountant, He Fugui.

849
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,519
Ask where his family lives.

850
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:39,440
Give the money to his wife.

851
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,960
Yes.

852
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,880
Do you think that giving money

853
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,679
will make you feel better?

854
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,599
In a decade or so,

855
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,119
He Fugui's child will grow up.

856
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,480
Do you think

857
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,679
he will remember you,

858
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,559
an imperial guard
who gave him a piece of gold?

859
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,519
Or will he remember

860
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,559
the court
that drove his father to death?

861
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,079
Four taels of silver
can't save He Fugui,

862
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,000
let alone the beggars
throughout the city.

863
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,119
A piece of gold

864
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,800
might save He Fugui's child

865
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,599
but can't save the countless children

866
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,400
in hunger and poverty.

867
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,559
The court is already hopeless.

868
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,920
People's lives are worth
less than the royal family's.

869
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,639
The commoners can't compete
with the power.

870
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,119
Given such a regime,

871
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,480
even if you get the Altar Treasure,

872
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,000
it can't save the nation.

873
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,800
The court's system is already broken.

874
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,840
Only by pulling it up by the roots

875
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,639
can you save it.

876
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,480
12 years ago, I served the late Emperor.

877
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,400
I heard him discuss reforms
with the Reformists.

878
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,199
And they once said the same things.

879
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,000
Reform to save the nation.

880
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,480
The late Emperor said

881
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,320
that was the fundamental strategy
for strengthening the country.

882
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,840
Back then, I was just an imperial guard.

883
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,480
(Whenever the late Emperor
and the Reformists discussed politics,)

884
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,239
(I was there.)

885
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:44,920
(After a while,)

886
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,559
(I naturally started to understand.)

887
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,000
The late Emperor said

888
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,800
every one of us had a thief
in our hearts.

889
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,559
It's easy to kill the thief
in the mountains

890
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,039
but hard to kill the thief in the heart.

891
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,880
What exactly is the thief in the heart?

892
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,440
I think the first thief is hypocrisy.

893
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,679
What we learn from Neo-Confucianism

894
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,719
is nothing more than

895
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,639
preserving the heavenly principles

896
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,639
and eliminating human desires.

897
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,760
But in retrospect,

898
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,760
have different rulers of dynasties ever

899
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,519
only relied on sages,

900
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,159
virtue, and morality

901
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,599
to govern and bring peace
to the country?

902
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,239
Empty talk of virtue and morality

903
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,000
cannot resolve a nation's crises.

904
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,519
Think about it carefully.

905
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
You read
the Four Books and Five Classics

906
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,000
and painstakingly study the Baguwen.

907
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,000
Can they resist
the West's powerful ships and guns?

908
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,280
Can they change the situation
where corruption runs deep,

909
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,840
land is consolidated,

910
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,360
refugees are all over the country,

911
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,840
and the nation is crumbling?

912
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,960
(I know I can't save
millions of children.)

913
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,320
I gave a piece of gold
to He Fugui's child.

914
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,920
It makes me feel

915
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,199
that I have fed

916
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,400
millions of children.

917
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,119
This is hypocrisy.

918
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,559
Mr. Muqing.

919
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,840
No Hound anymore?

920
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,639
You are not an ordinary hound.

921
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,519
In fact, you are open
to revolutionary thinking.

922
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:31,239
You've experienced
the Gongche Shangshu movement

923
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,519
and participated in the Wuxu Reform.

924
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,840
This was the biggest reform

925
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,760
in China for hundreds of years.

926
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,840
Although the reform failed,

927
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,159
you were a witness.

928
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,400
You know how powerful a change can be.

929
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,840
There are four groups

930
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,199
in the court

931
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,639
to affect the future of the nation.

932
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,320
First, the vested interests.

933
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,360
They're nobles and officials.

934
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,199
The conservatives.

935
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,360
Second, the advocates
for a nation strong in technology

936
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,679
and military.

937
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,559
Grand Secretary.

938
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,719
Yes, that's him.

939
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,000
But he did not succeed.

940
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,760
He failed to change China.

941
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:08,800
Third,

942
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:10,880
Emperor Guangxu

943
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,760
(and the Reformists,
like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao.)

944
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,840
(They advocated institutional reform)

945
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,559
(and taking the emperor as the core.)

946
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:20,480
You have also failed.

947
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,840
Your reform

948
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,400
lasted only 100 days.

949
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,400
103 days, to be precise.

950
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:26,840
That's right.

951
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,320
Fourth, Mr. Sun.

952
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,719
Actually, Mr. Sun, Kang Youwei,
and Liang Qichao

953
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,960
share the same views.

954
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,639
But what's different is

955
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,119
that Mr. Sun is devoted

956
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,800
to building a brand new world.

957
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,199
This world is composed of nationalism,
civil rights, and people's livelihoods.

958
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,360
Mr. Sun's ideal is

959
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,440
to end the feudal imperial system
that has lasted for thousands of years

960
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,480
and establish a republic.

961
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,840
Ending the feudal imperial system
that has lasted for thousands of years?

962
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,400
Mr. Sun's ideal is admirable.

963
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
His ideal is

964
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,519
that the four hundred million people

965
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,360
will not be hungry or cold.

966
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,639
Impressive.

967
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,840
Very impressive.

968
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,400
Mr. Muqing.

969
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,079
Just call me Hound.

970
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,559
You are not a mere hound.

971
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:21,199
You can understand our actions.

972
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,559
I hope

973
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,760
one day you can be one of us.

974
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,480
If I find the Altar Treasure

975
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,800
and give it to you

976
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,960
and Mr. Sun,

977
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,840
could Mr. Sun accomplish his ideal?

978
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,719
I cannot deceive you.

979
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,280
I do not know if Mr. Sun can realize it.

980
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:48,079
But there is one thing for sure.

981
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,679
Alive or dead,

982
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,480
we will all move towards this goal.

983
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,159
What is Tan Xian's secret?

984
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,599
If I don't know the secret,

985
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,159
how can I find the Altar Treasure?

986
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:08,239
Tan Xian's secret

987
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,639
is just the grave at Pingyao

988
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,559
That's all.

989
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:13,880
What do you call yourselves again?

990
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,159
We...

991
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:16,960
The Revolutionary,

992
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,880
right?

993
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,199
Revolution.

994
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,400
For what?

995
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Reform and constitutionalism.

996
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,360
Both were understood
and accepted by the late Emperor.

997
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,719
Naturally, I can understand as well.

998
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,320
But I don't understand Sun Wen.

999
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,280
Are you asking me to go against myself?

1000
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,280
You're a rebel.

1001
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
And I am an imperial guard.

1002
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,320
Our positions are opposed.

1003
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,880
I don't interrogate you

1004
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,239
for two reasons.

1005
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,239
Firstly, as I've already said,

1006
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,360
I don't believe that reform

1007
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,880
and change are treasonous things.

1008
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,159
I've also seen many

1009
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,559
who've died for reform

1010
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:51,119
and change.

1011
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,760
I've spent 12 years in prison for that.

1012
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:56,440
So, even though you are a rebel,

1013
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,480
I can have the slightest pity on you.

1014
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,119
Moreover, I firmly believe

1015
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,800
you're a person of strong will.

1016
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,719
And it's useless to torture you.

1017
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,639
I will act as if I haven't heard

1018
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,199
about your republican ideals.

1019
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,119
But if you say it again

1020
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,360
in front of me,

1021
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,039
I will teach you a lesson.

1022
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:15,639
Get out.

1023
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,440
I told you.

1024
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,000
You should still call me Hound.

1025
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:30,159
Two reasons.

1026
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,360
You only said one of them.

1027
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,000
You female revolutionaries

1028
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,239
behave unwomanly.

1029
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,599
I don't want to see your big feet.
