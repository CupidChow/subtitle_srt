1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,640
Zhuo Bufan secretly
accepted the order from Prince Qi.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,400
About that,

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,160
did you just find out

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,839
or did you just think of telling me?

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
When you came to see me
the day before yesterday,

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,359
I was still completely unaware of this.

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,199
The day before yesterday?

8
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,880
So, that means yesterday

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,240
and today,

10
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,719
you've been very busy.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,439
You were so busy that you
only thought of telling me till tonight.

12
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,759
Do you think what I did
was wrong, Mr. Xie?

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,799
No.

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,280
Prince Qi is your father-in-law.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,079
Yet you can tell me

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,960
about his secrets.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
To be honest,

18
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,280
I am quite surprised.

19
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,119
Besides,

20
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,280
I admire you.

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,439
Prince Qi used Zhuo Bufan and his people

22
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,719
to search for the Altar Treasure.

23
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,640
From what I see,

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,079
that is not necessary.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,319
It's just a legend.

26
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,280
I don't believe
he could find it so easily.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,680
This is not unnecessary.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,840
Doing this means
that Prince Qi has already figured out

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,120
a way to control and bribe Beiyang Army.

30
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,000
If he can't find it,
does that mean he has no other way?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,799
Do you want him to find it?

32
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,519
Of course not.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,319
Don't doubt me, Mr. Xie.

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,879
Firstly,

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,480
I am Prince Qi's son-in-law,

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,599
but not his son.

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,359
As Prince Qi's son-in-law,

38
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,599
value is more important than kinship.

39
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,120
Prince Qi only needs

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,319
me as a member of Beiyang Army.

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,239
I am quite aware of that

42
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,120
and I also don't like it.

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,159
Secondly,

44
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,159
it is Beiyang Army
that makes what I am today,

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,280
not Prince Qi.

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,439
Even because of such
a royal father-in-law,

47
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,200
some people in Beiyang Army
still speak ill of me.

48
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,400
Mr. Xie.

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,800
Both you and I know

50
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,840
that Beiyang Army is the key
to saving the Qing Dynasty.

51
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,960
Whether Prince Qi
can find the treasure or not

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
cannot change this fact.

53
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,919
So I am very clear

54
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,159
how to make the right choice.

55
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,759
Is there a third reason?

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,319
It's not really
a so-called third reason.

57
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,800
But it is some of my thoughts.

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,400
I think it's too late.

59
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,400
What Prince Qi did is too late.

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
Saving the Qing Dynasty is too late.

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,840
If it were a few years earlier,
there might still be hope

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,280
to solve the troubles of the court
through the political system.

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,680
But nowadays,

64
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,599
it's too late.

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,319
The extremely corrupted Qing Dynasty

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,000
cannot be saved simply.

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,840
Prince Qi is trying his best
to turn the table,

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,360
I admire it, but do not appreciate it.

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,560
Pushing aside my cup and chopsticks,
I can't eat.

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,080
Drawing my sword and looking round,
I hear my heart beat.

71
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,199
I remember you once studied abroad.

72
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
You are indeed open-minded

73
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,560
and quite practical.

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,080
What you said is good and correct.

75
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,080
With such a young general like you,

76
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,560
Beiyang Army is surely powerful.

77
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,960
The journey is difficult,

78
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,680
but that is the journey of Prince Qi.

79
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,560
As for you, General Zhong,

80
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,479
a time will come to ride the wind
and cleave the waves,

81
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,360
and you will set the sail
to cross the sea which raves.

82
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,120
My lady.

83
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
I have a question for you.

84
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,319
I just want to know your thoughts.

85
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,680
That's all I want.

86
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,480
Back then, Men Sandao was imprisoned
due to the reform

87
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,199
and thrown into prison.

88
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,240
How did you feel?

89
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,160
Don't overthink it.

90
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,959
I just want to know

91
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,120
how you felt back then.

92
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
If one day

93
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,879
I were imprisoned like Men Sandao,

94
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,560
what would you think
and what would you do?

95
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,279
What do you want?

96
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,959
I just want to know

97
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,079
if that day really comes,

98
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,000
what will you do?

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
What is this all about?

100
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,040
You are a general of Beiyang Army

101
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,480
and my father's son-in-law.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,480
How can you possibly become a prisoner?

103
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,199
(Back then, Men Sandao was imprisoned
due to the reform)

104
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,720
(and thrown into prison.)

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,879
(How did you feel?)

106
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,879
(The 22nd day of the 9th month,
24th year of Guangxu Era)

107
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,560
Don't even think about it.

108
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,240
There's not a slight chance.

109
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,279
Father.

110
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,519
Anxious.

111
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,000
Too anxious.

112
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,399
Kang Youwei is anxious.

113
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Liang Qichao is anxious.

114
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,160
Even Guangxu

115
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,439
gets anxious too.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Abolishing eight-legged essay writing
makes scholars dazed and disoriented.

117
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,759
Now the court
is laying off redundant staff.

118
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,639
Laying off those free-loaded officials
is a good thing.

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,759
But the Emperor has pushed it too hard.

120
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,000
His decree

121
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,879
made tens of thousands of officials
in the capital unemployed

122
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,519
without providing them
with any alternatives.

123
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,439
The imperial power has lasted
over a century.

124
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,959
Why did it change so hastily?

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,399
Those officials have lived an easy life
for too long.

126
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,040
Who wouldn't get threatened by this?

127
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,680
100 days.

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,439
It's been only 100 days.

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,279
A farce ends in dismal failure.

130
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,959
Shan.

131
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
Forget him.

132
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
Although he was

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,720
just an imperial guard
by Guangxu's side,

134
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,439
he was involved
in too many reform activities.

135
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,360
Earlier when Guangxu had mentioned

136
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,000
arranging a royal marriage for you,

137
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,920
I knew

138
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
that the reckless guy, Men Sandao,

139
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,839
was already in too deep.

140
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,360
Now, even Guangxu is imprisoned.

141
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,040
The Emperor of the Qing Dynasty
ended up like this.

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,920
Let alone the life

143
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
of a mere imperial guard.

144
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
Who can say he's innocent?

145
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,920
Who dares to speak up
for him at this time?

146
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,000
Men Sandao was only thrown into prison,

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,439
and was not brought out for execution
at the Meridian Gate.

148
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,680
That's already lucky for him.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,920
But he has no chance to be released
in his lifetime.

150
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
Fortunately,

151
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,959
you are not engaged to him.

152
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,319
Otherwise, that would be
the true misfortune.

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,279
Just cry.

154
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,720
Cry as you want, and then move on.

155
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,000
Forget him.

156
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Just pretend that he has
never appeared in your life.

157
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,200
Father.

158
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,480
Father.

(24 days before Mangzhong)

163
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,240
Anhui Temple.

164
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,032
I have never heard of it.

165
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,879
Have you?

166
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,039
I haven't either.

167
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,440
I have never heard of such a temple.

168
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,536

170
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,639
Excuse me.

171
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,519
Do you know where Anhui Temple is?

172
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,080
Sorry, I don't know.

(Quanzhou, Fujian)

174
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,440
Nobody knows.

175
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,960
Perhaps we are at the wrong place.

176
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:08,320
(Huang's Butcher Shop)

177
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,240
I'll go ask them.

178
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,639
Okay.

179
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,639
How is it?

180
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,919
No one here knows about Anhui Temple.

181
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,848
Sir.

182
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,519
Excuse me.

183
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,679
Do you know where Anhui Temple is?

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,600
Sir.

185
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,759
I'm talking to you.

186
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you know about Anhui Temple?

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,279
Are there any temples around here?

188
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,792
Get lost!

189
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,159
What do you mean by that?

190
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,039
You tell me.

191
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,720
You ask a butcher where the temple is.

192
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,120
What do you want?

193
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,879
What's wrong with me asking?

194
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,799
What's wrong?

195
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,679
You must be kidding.

196
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,399
I'm a butcher.

197
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,279
I see blood and take lives every day.

198
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,799
Why don't you go ask the nun

199
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,799
where her brothel is?

200
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,759
Why don't you go find a constable

201
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,759
and ask him where he robs?

202
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,679
How can you talk like that?

203
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,879
Watch your tone.

204
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,440
Huang Xing!

205
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,639
Let's go.

206
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,360
Let's go ask the others.

207
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,208
Let's go.

208
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:15,039
Sir.

209
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,799
Do you know where Anhui Temple is?

210
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,919
Have you heard of this temple?

211
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,279
No.

212
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,360
Are there any other temples around here?

213
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,559
There is one temple.

214
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,399
Steamed buns, please.

215
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,519
Alright.

216
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,919
Excuse me.

217
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,279
Do you know where Anhui Temple is?

218
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,919
I don't know.

219
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:31,960
I don't know.

220
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,519
Thank you.

221
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:52,960
Excuse me, sir.

222
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,440
Excuse me.

223
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,919
Do you know where Anhui Temple is?

224
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,279
Anhui Temple?

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,919
Who told you about Anhui Temple?

226
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,879
I am here on behalf of an old friend.

227
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,519
Your old friend has been dead
for a long time, hasn't he?

228
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,919
Why would you say that?

229
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Anhui Temple used to exist,

230
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
but it's long gone now.

231
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,120
It was renamed many years ago.

232
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,240
Now it is called Futu Temple.

233
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,720
Futu Temple is just a tiny temple,

234
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,639
with little incense serving.

235
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,720
There are barely any monks left there.

236
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,480
Who cares?

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,639
Do you know where Futu Temple is?

238
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,200
It's quite far anyway.

239
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,879
It's 200 or 300 li away from here,

240
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,320
located in the eastern part
of Fujian near the sea.

241
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,720
You should head east.

242
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,519
Thank you, sir.

243
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,879
Let's go.

244
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,080
Go.

245
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,320
Fujian is a brand new place to me.

246
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
I've never been here.

247
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
How can I know where Anhui Temple is?

248
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,559
Muqing.

249
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,360
Although I am a genius,

250
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,960
but I know little about here.

251
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
You should get the local official here,

252
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
and let him tell you everything.

253
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,200
By the way,
maybe we can get a free meal.

254
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,480
I am not counting on you.

255
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,639
I am just asking.

256
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,320
We've checked with the local yamen.

257
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,159
Fortunately,
we had them check in advance.

258
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,240
The Anhui Temple

259
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,688
is located a few hundred li in the east,
on a barren mountain by sea.

260
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,519
It was quite famous before.

261
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,000
Over 40 years ago,
a flash flood occurred.

262
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,360
For the safety of the people,
the abbot of Anhui Temple

263
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,799
blasted the upstream,
diverted the water,

264
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,200
and rerouted flood peak,

265
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,559
avoiding the villages on the other side

266
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,279
and leading the flood to the temple.

267
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,879
The entire temple
was completely submerged.

268
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:58,919
What?

269
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,960
They lost a great fortune by doing so.

270
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,519
Later, when the flood receded,

271
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,000
the temple was already submerged.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,720
Only a small land
was visible above the water.

273
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,279
It was difficult for those
who wanted to offer incense to get in.

274
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Gradually,
the temple lost its worshippers.

275
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,399
Afterwards, it was renamed Futu Temple.

276
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,399
The temple then fell into decline.

277
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
No more renowned monks were there.

278
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,200
Nowadays, few people know about it.

279
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,000
The local yamen

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,559
found it by going through many records.

281
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,679
Its name was changed.

282
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,240
That's right.

283
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,920
Right?

284
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,080
What do you mean?

285
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,480
Don't you remember?

286
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,159
44 years ago,
the imperial yamen failed to find Shovel

287
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,480
and several people also went missing.

288
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,039
It was also over 40 years ago

289
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,039
that Anhui Temple
was renamed Futu Temple.

290
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,279
That was because the Altar Treasure

291
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,679
was hidden in the temple.

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,519
So the temple was renamed
to disguise itself as a declined place

293
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,600
to deceive the public.

294
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,360
Running a temple
and collecting incense money

295
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,919
is a tax-free business.

296
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
Giving up such a profitable business

297
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,279
means that Altar Treasure
must be a huge fortune.

298
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,320
This money was spent too quickly.

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,120
It's because
you've kept too little for yourself.

300
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,639
Otherwise, how could you
be in such straits?

301
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:24,840
(Banknote)

302
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,360
Here.

303
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:28,279
No need.

304
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,960
Don't spend any of your money.

305
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,960
How long will it last before
you run out of yours then?

306
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,000
Maybe 10 days or half a month.

307
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,799
If we do run out of money,

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,480
I'll go to Prince Qi.

309
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:41,799
Will you?

310
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,200
You are too proud to do that.

311
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,120
I have always wanted
to get you a new sword.

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,240
The one you have is too shabby.

313
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,079
It's fine.

314
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,880
Anyway, no one can defeat me.

315
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,400
Besides, this sword

316
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,720
has been with me for many years.

317
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,880
You're the only one who doesn't care.

318
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,839
Even the sword of Yu Huanjie
is better than yours.

319
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,400
I've fought over 700 battles.

320
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,160
But their swords
were all better than mine.

321
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,799
I still remember
when I became a real swordsman,

322
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,519
the first opponent I encountered

323
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,799
was a young master from a wealthy sect.

324
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,400
His sword was fancy and gorgeous.

325
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,079
He said it was worth 300 gold.

326
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,119
Now look at mine.

327
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,880
I only spent two taels on it,

328
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,079
and it was forged by a blacksmith.

329
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,480
But I broke his 300-gold-worth sword

330
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,799
with just one move.

331
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
So since then,

332
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,759
I've had no more longing
for fancy swords.

333
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,200
You know what?

334
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,160
A swordsman in previous dynasty

335
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,319
fought over 800 battles with his sword

336
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,920
and had never got defeated.

337
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,599
And in the end,
he didn't even use a sword anymore.

338
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,440
A swordsman without a sword?

339
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,160
Yes.

340
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,119
What frustrates others the most
was that he took his rival's sword.

341
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,119
He said it didn't matter
who held the sword.

342
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,000
Just take it and make it yours.

343
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,359
With your swordsmanship,

344
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,440
you don't need to care about the sword.

345
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,119
But after all, you're our Sect Leader.

346
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,319
you should wield a less shabby sword.

347
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,480
Just look at your sword.

348
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,240
It's fine. I can sharpen it.

349
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,599
Yu Huanjie and the others are all gone.

350
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,680
Now, the disciples who follow you

351
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,440
are all your true followers.

352
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,552
Right.

353
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,319
They follow you wholeheartedly

354
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,599
and can keep their mouth shut.

355
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,640
Bufan.

356
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,720
Can I be by your side
as your junior now?

357
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,119
Aren't you working with the Department?

358
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,920
Why didn't you come to Fujian with them?

359
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,119
That annoying constable
from Beiyang Army.

360
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,144
Why can't he leave us alone?

361
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:02,720
I want...

362
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,400
Let's hurry up.

363
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:04,720
Wait for me here.

364
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,952
I will go after the murderer.

365
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,240
Ding Yu.

366
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,119
Jialuo.

367
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,920
Jialuo.

368
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,720
General Long Chi ordered me
to bring troops to help.

369
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,640
We marched overnight to catch up.

370
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,559
I was just thinking where to find you.

371
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,088
Well.

372
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,559
I've run into your wife.

373
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,599
If you had arrived earlier,

374
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,839
I would have caught Yu Huanjie.

375
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:07,839
It's okay.

376
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,039
Anyway, we have chased him here,

377
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,160
so we will catch him.

378
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,279
But you said that Beiyang Army
couldn't be dispatched.

379
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
General Long has already
pulled some strings.

380
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
As long as it's for tracing the clues
to the treasure.

381
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,599
Jialuo.

382
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,279
Dispatch them at will.

383
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,160
You make the call

384
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,920
from now on.

385
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,039
If it's really
as Martial Uncle Mo Kun said,

386
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,160
we can only find one map.

387
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,880
If we still can't find the treasure,

388
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,799
what should we do?

389
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,119
From the start, I have thought

390
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,440
it was not that simple.

391
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,960
But no matter how hard,
we need to keep going.

392
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,559
And I believe

393
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,640
even if there are
only two treasure maps,

394
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,079
we can still decipher something from it.

395
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,240
Leave now.

396
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,480
Okay.

397
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,039
Zhuo Bufan.

398
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,359
Zhuo Bufan.

399
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,200
You despicable wretch!

400
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,440
You are untrustworthy and disloyal.

401
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,480
How could you be so despicable

402
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,279
to cost the lives of Martial Uncle
and other disciples

403
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,960
just to pave your own path?

404
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,279
How could the Rongtian Sword Sect

405
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,680
raise such a scum like you?

406
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,559
I can't defeat you.

407
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,480
But today I will fight with my life

408
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,799
and seek justice for them.

409
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,200
Draw out your sword.

410
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:53,759
Huanjie.

411
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,359
Do it!

412
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,920
You scoundrel, draw out your sword!

413
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,599
Huanjie.

414
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,799
If stabbing me can quell your anger,

415
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,680
then feel free to stab me.

416
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,200
But you can't kill me.

417
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,279
I need to revitalize our sect.

418
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,519
Stop being such a hypocrite.

419
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,480
Huanjie.

420
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,759
- Huanjie.
- Huanjie.

421
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:14,319
You...

422
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,400
Let go of him!

423
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:16,759
Let go!

424
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,599
Huanjie.

425
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,119
When I first entered the sect,

426
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,559
you taught me rules,

427
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,599
and the basic sword techniques.

428
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,000
Although I am the Sect Leader,

429
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,640
in my heart,
like all the other disciples,

430
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,920
I hold you as my senior.

431
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,559
Back when we were in Shanxi,

432
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,599
I fooled you all.

433
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,599
It was my fault.

434
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,000
But I had no other choice.

435
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,319
If I hadn't done so,

436
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,799
we wouldn't
get rid of the imperial guards

437
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,039
and the Beiyang Army.

438
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,519
That day, when you, Martial Uncle,

439
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,039
and the juniors left,

440
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,200
I felt so much pain inside.

441
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,400
I often asked myself

442
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,079
if I made the right choice.

443
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,440
But after much thought,

444
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,400
I believe I did nothing wrong.

445
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,839
Everything I did is
for the sake of the sect.

446
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:09,160
You did nothing wrong?

447
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,200
Zhuo Bufan.

448
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,400
Martial Uncle has suffered
for so many years,

449
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,119
and he's just been released.

450
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,400
I haven't even had the chance
to take care of him,

451
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,440
and he...

452
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,400
Do you think this was just my own plan?

453
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,039
I know it all.

454
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,519
From the very beginning,

455
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,920
he planned to use himself as bait

456
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,759
and sacrifice
for the benefit of the sect.

457
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,160
Till the moment we parted ways,

458
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,119
he told me not
to hold any grudge against you.

459
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,759
Zhuo Bufan.

460
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,279
You are ruthless.

461
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,920
You'd better remember
what happened today.

462
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,920
Remember

463
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,680
that It was you who sacrificed the lives

464
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,319
of Martial Uncle, Qin Tuo,

465
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,640
and many disciples

466
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,480
to exchange for this opportunity.

467
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,079
What opportunity?

468
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,504
You've been so calculating

469
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:19,559
at the expense of the lives
of Martial Uncle and disciples.

470
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,400
And yet you still failed
to disappear without a trace.

471
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,480
What do you mean?

472
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,079
Just now

473
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,000
outside the city,

474
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,800
I encountered Wang Jialuo
with soldiers from Beiyang Army.

475
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,519
Even he could chase you here.

476
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,680
Will Men Sandao be far?

477
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,079
Fortunately, I escaped in time

478
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,079
and found you.

479
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,240
Zhuo Bufan.

480
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,559
If I didn't care about
our fellow discipleship,

481
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,839
I wouldn't have come
to tell you about this.

482
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,279
Just wait and see. Before dawn,

483
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,359
we might be surrounded with no way out.

484
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,440
If it's really as what you said,

485
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,559
then we must leave immediately.

486
00:25:58,592 --> 00:25:59,160
Huanjie.

487
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,039
I have found the exact location.

488
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,039
Let's set off overnight

489
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,920
and hurry to Futu Temple.

490
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,039
Remember.

491
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,319
The reason why
I am still willing to stay with you

492
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,359
is because I don't want Martial Uncle

493
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,240
and juniors to have died in vain.

494
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,720
When we find the secret treasure,

495
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,039
I will kill you with my hands
to revenge them.

496
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:30,359
Sect Leader.

497
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,000
You may leave.

498
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,160
Yes.

499
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,319
Yu Huanjie said that
just because he was angry.

500
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,240
I know.

501
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,480
Martial Uncle and juniors
sacrificed their own lives

502
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,160
to save Huanjie's life.

503
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,079
But it's all my fault.

504
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,200
What are you here for?

505
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Mr. Muqing.

506
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,240
You'd better call me a hound.

507
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,880
Don't say I'm not a normal hound.

508
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,039
No matter what,

509
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,400
I don't want to hear you talk anymore

510
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,759
about democracy,
progress and revolution.

511
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,799
If you've forgotten the punishment

512
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,119
I told you about before,
I can tell you again.

513
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,720
If not, then get lost.

514
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,319
Miss Liu.

515
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,072
Actually, I am yearning for progress.

516
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:13,319
I am also willing to chat with you
about democracy and progress.

517
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:13,920
Get lost.

518
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,000
And revolution.

519
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:30,368
(The 18th day of 4th month,
3th year of Xuantong era,)

520
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:32,128
(22 days before Mangzhong)

521
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:11,648
Go.

522
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:40,736
(Futu Temple)

523
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,960
Huang Xing.

524
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,000
Offer incense.

525
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,960
May I know your dharma name?

526
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,960
My name is Du E.

527
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,720
Master Du E.

528
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,240
I am Zhuo Bufan,
Sect Leader of the Rongtian Sword Sect,

529
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,599
entrusted by the chief inheritor
of Bodhi Department.

530
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,799
He has left something at your temple.

531
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,279
The passphrase.

532
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,039
I only saw the address

533
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,240
on that letter from Tan Xian.

534
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,839
I did not see the passphrase.

535
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,079
Master Du E.

536
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,079
I do not have the passphrase.

537
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
But I can only find this place

538
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,640
upon the request

539
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,799
of the chief of Bodhi Department.

540
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,759
Please do us a favor.

541
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,880
Master Du E.

542
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,920
We have traveled long to come here.

543
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,400
We must get that item.

544
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,720
Please do us a favor.

545
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,839
If you stay silent like this,

546
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,200
then do not blame me for being impolite.

547
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,279
I can kill you and burn the temple.

548
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,880
Search this place!

549
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Come on.

550
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,079
Bufan.

551
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,559
We've got company.

552
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,759
You finally came here.

553
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,039
Savage.

554
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
They are so savage.

555
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,319
They just fight.

556
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,480
All they know is to fight.

557
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,559
Can't they just talk through it?

558
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,519
It's all business.

559
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,400
Get up.

560
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,880
Get up.

561
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,719
Yes, Abbot.

562
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,559
This place looks really shabby.

563
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,199
It is so outside,

564
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,400
but it is also the same inside.

565
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,760
In every way,

566
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,159
it's not like a place hiding fortune.

567
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:29,039
Follow me inside. Just you only.

568
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,000
Getai.

569
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,119
You guys stay here.

570
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,480
Abbot.

571
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,280
You can't hand things over to officials.

572
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,320
It should go to the Bodhi inheritor.

573
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:48,608
I...

574
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:49,800
I should go inside.

575
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,728
The clue left by the chief inheritor
of Bodhi Department is in my hands.

576
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,519
His last wish

577
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,400
is to bestow the Altar Treasure
to Tongmenghui.

578
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,599
We can't give it to these officials.

579
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,679
How can you prove it?

580
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:08,880
This sentence

581
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,519
is a passphrase.

582
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,239
Passphrase.

583
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,519
I don't know when it will be of use

584
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,039
or how to use it.

585
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,840
But you must memorize it.

586
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,639
This is what Cheng Yu emphasized.

587
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,400
He said that it would be useful one day.

588
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:23,400
I memorized it.

589
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,719
You must not forget.

590
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,480
I remember every word of it.

591
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,840
I know the passphrase.

592
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,599
To get the secret treasure,

593
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,760
a passphrase is needed.

594
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:58,170
(Regardless of being poor or rich,
noble or lowly.)

595
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,448
Regardless of being poor or rich,
noble or lowly.

596
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,562
(All beings will be equal.)

597
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,599
All beings will be equal.
