1
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,160
You're finally back.

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,480
I've long awaited you.

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,440
If I weren't a loyal man,

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,199
I'd have left already.

5
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,359
Close the door.

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,320
Look at your smug face.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,479
Did you find anything out?

8
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,479
Nothing.

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,439
I didn't find too many clues.

10
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,840
You know I'm a modest person.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,359
According to the grain and pattern
of the wood,

12
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,520
after a series of calculations,

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,359
I can confirm

14
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,640
that the box set should have four parts.

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,600
And these two just happen
to be the first and the last.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,840
I've mentioned this material before.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,920
It's not considered very good.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,359
However, what surprises me

19
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,400
is the era.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,439
It likely dates to the Kangxi era.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,560
Although it's not exactly ancient,

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,319
it's still a century-old item,

23
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,599
which is somewhat interesting.

24
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,280
The craftsmanship

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,599
is not bad,

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,816
but it can't compare to that
of a master.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,840
It's probably the wood carving
from the Quanzhou area.

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,239
Even if there's something special,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,760
it's impossible to find out who made it.

30
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,799
Even if the person were confirmed,

31
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,239
he'd certainly be long dead by now.

32
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,319
Just tell me

33
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,319
what exactly is so special about it.

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,120
Special.

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,040
Indeed there is something special.

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,120
Only a genius like me

37
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,159
can discover

38
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,079
something special about it.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,439
It is the lacquer.

40
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,120
The lacquer?

41
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:45,879
Yes.

42
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,319
These two charred pieces of wood

43
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,480
seems to have been painted twice.

44
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,680
And obviously it was painted again

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
for the second time,

46
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,799
which was almost

47
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,920
decades after the first time.

48
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,040
So, this second coat of lacquer

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,680
must be done to cover up something.

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,879
What is it?

51
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,359
I don't know yet.

52
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,799
We'll see after we remove the lacquer.

53
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,159
I am a person of manners.

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,319
Without your permission,

55
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,719
I dare not damage your things.

56
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,280
Mr. Lin,

57
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,360
go head.

58
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,960
Alright.

59
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,960
Five.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,599
Bao.

61
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,719
What is this?

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,639
Muqing,

63
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,960
let's be frank since we're on one side.

64
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,400
This thing

65
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,680
is related to the Altar Treasure, right?

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Otherwise, you wouldn't offer
a price of one thousand taels.

67
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,919
For the sake of brotherhood,

68
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,879
I don't want

69
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,599
one thousand taels.

70
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,240
When you go searching
for the secret treasure,

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,319
please ensure I'm included.

72
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,439
You know me well.

73
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,479
Firstly, I have a discerning eye.

74
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,639
I can recognize all treasures.

75
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,360
Secondly,

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,120
including piecing together
the porcelain jar in Shanxi,

77
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,719
I've already helped you twice.

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,719
Furthermore,

79
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,400
without my discovery

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,479
of the second layer of paint,

81
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,080
Muqing,

82
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,199
these characters
would have remained unseen.

83
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,639
Although these few words

84
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,280
are kind of baffling,

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,800
if you take me along,

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,520
I'm sure I can be of help.

87
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,680
Isn't it always me

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,479
who unravels the key information?

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,680
As long as you agree to take me along,

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
I will surely do my utmost

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,680
to trace the origin of the set
of charred wooden box.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,080
Then you must...

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,840
Keep it a secret.

94
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,120
It must be kept confidential.

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,759
I won't tell a word of it to others.

96
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,479
Muqing,

97
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,280
you can trust me.

98
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,120
Getting rich quietly,

99
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,159
that's my good nature.

100
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
Four sealed parts.

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,800
I choose a simple and peaceful life

102
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,319
over official strife,
despite being laughed.

103
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,399
That is to say to Prince Qi

104
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,160
also has no chance to get it.

105
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,759
That's actually good news.

106
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,639
Sir,

107
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,399
I think it is not the time to give up.

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,120
Do you think there's still a chance?

109
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,519
Although Zhuo Bufan

110
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,879
possesses one of the four seals,

111
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,560
he may not necessarily win against us.

112
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,839
That's true.

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,240
But at least you get one first,

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
so that the Department

115
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
can be invincible.

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,759
Although now

117
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,319
the remaining seals' clues are unclear,

118
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,199
the information we've obtained

119
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,439
is much more than before.

120
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
I've had a feeling

121
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,600
that many clues have already been found.

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,759
Once we decipher one or two,

123
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,040
we can unravel the mystery.

124
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,000
As you're confident, I'll be at ease.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sir, I have promised to try my best,

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,600
so it is far from admitting defeat now.

127
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:11,008
=Heroes=

128
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:14,272
=Episode 23=

129
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,460
(24th day of the fourth month, 1911)

130
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,392
(Grain in Ear is 16 days away)

131
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,600
You want to join me in
finding the Altar Treasure?

132
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,480
Yes.

133
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,079
Haven't we already cooperated?

134
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,680
We tracked Zhuo Bufan together before.

135
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,879
Now, it's treasure hunting.

136
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,839
Indeed different.

137
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,120
So this time you come to me

138
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,480
as a soldier of Beiyang or...

139
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,720
The treasure belongs to the court

140
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,279
no matter whether I'm second lieutenant
of the 43rd Association

141
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,000
or a constable at the Dagu County Yamen.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,759
It's all the same.

143
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,480
I've never doubted

144
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,839
your loyalty to the court.

145
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,759
Mr. Muqing,

146
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,839
for our cooperation this time,

147
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,160
I hope we can be open and honest.

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
It seems you're quite confident.

149
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
Where have you been these days?

150
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,800
Zhuo Bufan found a clue

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,759
and went to Tianjin.

152
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,439
Therefore I followed him

153
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,319
only to find his target is the inheritor

154
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,120
of the chief of Dharma Department.

155
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,000
Did he find the man?

156
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,879
Yes.

157
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,360
Is the man dead?

158
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,879
Zhuo Bufan killed him.

159
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,160
Did Zhuo Bufan get anything?

160
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,079
He did not get the Dharma Seal.

161
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,279
But you got it?

162
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,040
So I hope this collaboration can

163
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,000
be open and honest.

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Good.

165
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,680
Be open and honest.

166
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,040
I remember you once said,

167
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,360
to open the Altar Treasure,

168
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
two treasure maps are required.

169
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
Now it seems that we may need three.

170
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,240
That was the past.

171
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,600
Now I can be sure

172
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,040
that a total of four are needed.

173
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,639
Four?

174
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,959
Zhuo Bufan has the Discipline Seal,

175
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,120
and you said

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,319
he almost got the Seal
of Dharma Department,

177
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,360
which ended up with you.

178
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,079
That's good.

179
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,480
You know about
the Seal of Bodhi Department.

180
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,360
Yes.

181
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,879
It was you who entered Futu Temple.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,920
So we're still one short.

183
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,879
No clues at all?

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,079
No clues at all.

185
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,519
Well,

186
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,079
what does your seal look like?

187
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,240
It's the same as yours.

188
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,879
How about showing it to me first?

189
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,360
Let me have a look first.

190
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
What's this?

191
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,480
This is...

192
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,679
Don't you know it?

193
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
It's the box for the seal.

194
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,568
Right.

195
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
You haven't seen it before?

196
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,399
I...

197
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,840
Right,

198
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,480
not all seals are placed in boxes.

199
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,879
Exactly.

200
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,720
The shorter one is the seal of
Disciplinary Department,

201
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,799
which is obtained
from the palace by Zhuo Bufan.

202
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,080
The longer one is the Bodhi Seal.

203
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,960
What does the characters on this mean?

204
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,240
I don't know.

205
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,759
They are intermittent.

206
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,440
I pondered for days
yet remained puzzled.

207
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,639
I'm still expecting

208
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,519
you could bring a section of the box

209
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,799
to gather a few more characters.

210
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,840
I know.

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Really?

212
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,279
Bao refers to Baohe Inn.

213
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,879
Five, the sixth day of the fifth month.
Three, the thirty-year appointment.

214
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,440
Baohe Inn.

215
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
The sixth day of the fifth month.
The thirty-year appointment.

216
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,799
When do these thirty years count from?

217
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,200
I don't know it.

218
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,000
However, for the precise time of
the thirty-year appointment,

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,919
I do know.

220
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,559
It's the year of Xinhai

221
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,240
that is this year.

222
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
How did you come to know this?

223
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Before the passing of Dharma's chief,

224
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,799
these words were left behind.

225
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,799
Since they're on the sealed box,

226
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,360
and also spoken by
the inheritor of Southern Shaolin,

227
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,240
this must be
the appointed time and place

228
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,039
for all the inheritors to meet.

229
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,639
If this appointment occurs once
every thirty years,

230
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,960
then counting back thirty years
from the year of Xinhai,

231
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,360
it would be

232
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,840
1881.

233
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Pushing back another thirty years
would be 1851.

234
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,399
Another thirty back would be 1821.

235
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,039
Then comes 1791.

236
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,600
1761.

237
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,799
And finally...

238
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,279
Which year?

239
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
1701,

240
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,799
which is when the court sent troops
to wipe out Southern Shaolin.

241
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,720
It's the year
when even the temple was burnt down.

242
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,480
Your analysis is right.

243
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,600
The year of Xinhai

244
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,039
marks another thirty-year appointment.

245
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,720
The sixth day of the fifth month

246
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,559
should be the specific time to meet.

247
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,639
On this day,

248
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,759
all four inheritors of
Southern Shaolin should appear.

249
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
The inheritor of
the Bodhi Department won't show up.

250
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,879
However, I can pretend to be him

251
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,639
to attend this thirty-year appointment.

252
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,080
The inheritor of Dharma is already dead.

253
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
But you obtain the seal,

254
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,559
you are qualified to go with me.

255
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,919
The Disciplinary Department's inheritor
has aligned with the court,

256
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,440
so I suppose he would not appear.

257
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
However, Zhuo Bufan holding its seal,

258
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,840
will surely be able to make it.

259
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,320
So that leaves one person remaining.

260
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,440
Someone we know nothing about.

261
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,080
The fourth seal.

262
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,559
The fourth seal.

263
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,960
Perhaps on that day,

264
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,000
all will be answered.

265
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,840
Where is Baohe Inn?

266
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,559
I sought you believing you'd know.

267
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,960
How would I know?

268
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,320
You are from the Department

269
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,279
and a master detective.

270
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,919
Can't you find out by investigating?

271
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,440
I've already told you the name.

272
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
You're sure to find it.

273
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Alright.

274
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,919
I'll look into it.

275
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,720
Me too.

276
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,360
Mr. Muqing,

277
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,879
once we find any information,

278
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,200
let's immediately share it.

279
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,039
Alright.

280
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,360
Let's be frank and open.

281
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,279
Frank and open.

282
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,000
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

283
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,360
Your Highness, Yu Huanjie is here.

284
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,919
Save it.

285
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,720
Go ahead and speak.

286
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,360
Yes.

287
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,919
What is it?

288
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,080
What are you...

289
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,080
Your Highness,

290
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,960
since being enlightened
by you last time,

291
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,000
I have been deeply moved.

292
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,919
You are the beacon of my life.

293
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,840
So, I shaved my hair upon returning

294
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,759
to show my determination.

295
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,440
I will unhesitatingly devote my life

296
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,639
to you with total loyalty.

297
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,399
Okay, now tell me.

298
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,519
Yes.

299
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,080
I...

300
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,279
No.

301
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,039
Your servant and Zhuo Bufan

302
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,360
have sought and investigated in Tianjin
for a long time.

303
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,759
Just tell me the result.

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,120
Just tell you the result.

305
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,919
The result is

306
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
we found that old lunatic.

307
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,960
He was very formidable.

308
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,440
But in the end, he was captured by us.

309
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,200
Nothing was gained?

310
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,759
Has Your Highness known it?

311
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,120
If you had returned with some info,

312
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,799
you wouldn't pull the long face.

313
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,480
Your Highness,

314
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,080
your servant feels extremely guilty.

315
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,080
That old man
has been insane for decades.

316
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,080
I've searched very carefully

317
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,279
on his body and in his residence,

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,919
but there was nothing at all.

319
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,879
Alright.

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,679
It's just an old story.

321
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,960
It's no surprise that it can't be found.

322
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,240
Stand up.

323
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,679
Why has Zhuo Bufan not reported to me?

324
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,200
Your servant has been trying the best

325
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,720
to serve Your Highness.

326
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,200
So upon my return,

327
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,960
I came immediately
to secretly report to you.

328
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,879
Zhuo Bufan...

329
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,799
Perhaps he's still pondering.

330
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,600
It could be

331
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,799
that he is trying to find an excuse

332
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,840
before he dares to face Your Highness.

333
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,440
An excuse?

334
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,440
What use are excuses to me?

335
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,720
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

336
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,960
Did you study abroad in Europe?

337
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,200
I first went to Japan,

338
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
then to the United States.

339
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,200
I also stayed shortly in Southeast Asia.

340
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,519
And I have been to Europe once.

341
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,200
Miss Liu, your experiences
are so abundant.

342
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,320
It's quite enviable.

343
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,679
Not at all.

344
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,480
I am but an ordinary woman.

345
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
I can't compare with you, a princess.

346
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,720
Your overseas experience

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,320
reminds me of someone.

348
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,559
Sun Wen.

349
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,919
No one else is here and nothing's taboo.

350
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,360
I am the daughter of a prince,

351
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,240
so I would know of
these people and affairs.

352
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
I didn't expect you to be concerned
with these matters.

353
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,960
However, my major is not medicine.

354
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,639
You seem to be very concerned as well.

355
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,919
Otherwise, how would you know

356
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,600
Mr. Sun studied medicine?

357
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,039
I studied abroad.

358
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,639
It's inevitable to hear about these.

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,639
That's true.

360
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
So, what are you planning to do

361
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,279
on your return home this time?

362
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,120
I haven't decided yet.

363
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,600
After many years abroad,

364
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,360
I'm not quite accustomed to be home.

365
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,279
So I have no plans now.

366
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,720
You just mentioned

367
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,919
that it's been a long time
since you had afternoon tea.

368
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,879
I thought you had been back
for quite some time.

369
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,759
Before returning,
I was in Southeast Asia.

370
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,080
It's not like Europe.

371
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,159
Few people there are used
to having afternoon tea.

372
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,000
That's true.

373
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,360
Who is the lady?

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,759
This is Miss Liu,
my classmate from my studies abroad.

375
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,279
This is my husband.

376
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,879
Hello, Miss Liu.

377
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,879
I'm Zhong Haichao.

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,080
Hello, Mr. Zhong.

379
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,600
Is Mr. Zhong a military man?

380
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,559
Haichao is a Beiyang commander.

381
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,000
You're indeed striking.

382
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,039
I won't keep you from your classmate.

383
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,320
Please sit.

384
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,639
Did your husband also study abroad?

385
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,159
He studied military management
in Germany.

386
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,480
Well-matched.

387
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,960
You both have studied abroad,

388
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,679
receiving advanced Western education.

389
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,279
One is the daughter of a prince,

390
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,720
and the other is an army commander.

391
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,519
You must be truly compatible.

392
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,039
What about you?

393
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,000
You don't look much younger than me.

394
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,920
Are you married?

395
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,640
No.

396
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
Do you have a fiancé?

397
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,279
No, not that either.

398
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,119
I've been moving around these years,

399
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,200
never settling down.

400
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,200
Where would I find a lover?

401
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,680
Only with a lover can one settle down.

402
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,319
Great, it suits you.

403
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,119
You're very generous.

404
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,279
I've already been much of
a disturbance by living here.

405
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,599
I'll be truly embarrassed

406
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,759
if I take your clothes.

407
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,319
It's fine.

408
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,279
I can't wear these clothes anyway.

409
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,599
Leaving them idle is a waste.

410
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,640
I've thought about giving them away,
but they're Western styles.

411
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,799
Not everyone finds it proper
to wear them.

412
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,680
I notice you hardly brought any clothes.

413
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,880
You can't always wear the same.

414
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,559
I left in quite a hurry.

415
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,960
Indeed, I didn't bring many clothes.

416
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,400
I was thinking about going out
to buy some when I find the time.

417
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,279
No need.

418
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,079
You couldn't buy clothes
like mine anyway.

419
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,799
Is Muqing your cousin?

420
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,039
Yes.

421
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,039
He was imprisoned in the past.

422
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,279
Do you know it?

423
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,720
Of course.

424
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,640
What do you think about it?

425
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,200
What could I possibly think?

426
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,880
I was studying abroad before.

427
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,519
I only knew
about this unfortunate event.

428
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,880
However, now that he has been pardoned

429
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,960
and restored to his position,

430
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,759
I just hope he can be safe and well.

431
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,880
Do you know
about his participation in the reform?

432
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,640
Heard of it.

433
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,079
Princess, you seem
to be quite concerned about him.

434
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,839
Muqing is an imperial guard,

435
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,640
which is quite
a different station from yours.

436
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,079
But somehow, I always feel

437
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,640
that you two are quite close.

438
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,519
Of course.

439
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
He used to be
by the late Emperor's side.

440
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,599
The late Emperor was my uncle.

441
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,039
We've known each other since childhood,

442
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,319
just like siblings.

443
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,119
I wouldn't have thought
that Muqing, a royal guard,

444
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,839
could have such a noble sister.

445
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,160
You always call your cousin

446
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,039
by his name?

447
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,359
Having been abroad for so long,

448
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,288
I've gotten used to calling people
by their names.

449
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,599
Right, that's true.

450
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,680
Even children abroad call their parents

451
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,200
by their names quite often.

452
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,880
Princess, you must be tired.

453
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,640
Then I won't bother you.

454
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,519
You rest for a while.

455
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,839
Then I'll have someone send them to you.

456
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,240
No need.

457
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,759
A few clothes aren't heavy.

458
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,960
I can take them myself.

459
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,720
Thank you, Princess.

460
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Men Sandao is an imperial guard.

461
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,839
It should be easier for him

462
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,599
to investigate.

463
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,400
Yes.

464
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,039
He can mobilize the Department's guards

465
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,752
to check early records of
the Ministry of Commerce and Revenue.

466
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,000
Then what are you still worried about?

467
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,480
I'm just upset.

468
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,079
Because I don't have
the Dharma Seal at all.

469
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,880
As long as Men Sandao and Zhuo Bufan
believe you have it,

470
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,680
it would be alright.

471
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,960
Zhuo Bufan doesn't really matter.

472
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,839
Since Men Sandao and I
are collaborating,

473
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,519
if he proposes

474
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,440
that we all take out the seals to check,

475
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
it'd be really hard for me to refuse.

476
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,559
Moreover,

477
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,880
if Mr. Muqing

478
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
finds out I'm lying,

479
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,440
I can't imagine how mad he would be.

480
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,279
Stop overthinking it for now.

481
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,599
Let's just take it one step at a time.

482
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,839
It's the only way.

483
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,519
You should rest now.

484
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm going to Ding Yu.

485
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,599
What do you mean?

486
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:37,359
It's inapp...

487
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,119
We've been intimate,

488
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
but now you're trying to say

489
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,720
it's inappropriate again?

490
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,119
No, I mean...

491
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:43,960
Inconvenient?

492
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,640
Are you making it inconvenient?

493
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,319
Wang Jialuo,

494
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,440
you're honest to a fault

495
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,240
that you're no longer honest.

496
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,279
Then what am I?

497
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,240
A table?

498
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,799
Wood.

499
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,960
I see your light is still on.

500
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,319
Maybe you can't sleep just like me.

501
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,680
So, I had someone make sweet soup.

502
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,359
Let's drink together and chat for a bit.

503
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,079
You might find it easier to sleep.

504
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,359
It's so late.

505
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,839
Isn't your husband home?

506
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
He often deals with official duties
at the military camp.

507
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,359
So, he mostly stays there.

508
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,000
He only comes home when he's free.

509
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,599
So he seldom comes home.

510
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,319
Will you be unhappy about that?

511
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,720
There's nothing to be happy about

512
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,400
nor is there anything
to be unhappy about.

513
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,039
These are turbulent times.

514
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,559
Soldiers must obey orders.

515
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,240
That's true.

516
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,279
Muqing is also very busy.

517
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,079
However, every time
he returns after work,

518
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,319
he always brings some pastries.

519
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,079
But your soup is better.

520
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,319
The pastries Muqing brings back
are often cold.

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,960
(Just tell me now,)

522
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,119
what is the Bodhi Seal?

523
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,119
So it'd be more convenient
to release you now.

524
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,920
Do remember

525
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,720
I'll have someone monitor you secretly.

526
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,279
If you're thinking of running away,

527
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,759
then you're wasting your energy.

528
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,920
Soup and pastries should be eaten hot.

529
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,000
Yes.

530
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,079
What's the point if they're cold?

531
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:35,880
(Starting immediately,)

532
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
(review all records
since the Kangxi era.)

533
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,400
(Find a place called Baohe Inn.)

534
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,279
Muqing,

535
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,039
don't be too anxious.

536
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,400
It's already the 24th day
of the fourth month.

537
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,680
In a few days, it'll be
the sixth day of the fifth month.

538
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,640
Can you believe it
if I say I'm not anxious?

539
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,000
Indeed.

540
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,759
This darn inn is really hard to find.

541
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,200
As long as it exists,

542
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,519
we will definitely find it.

543
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,119
Let's keep searching.

544
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,319
It is already the 25th day now.

545
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:35,014
(25th day of the fourth month, 1911)

546
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:36,128
(Grain in Ear is 15 days away)

547
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,519
A day apart feels like three autumns.

548
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,200
Three days apart
feels like several years.

549
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,759
Princess,

550
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,920
I didn't come to sell anything today,

551
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,160
but to bring a gift.

552
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,000
Why are you so generous today?

553
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,240
Princess, you know me.

554
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,680
I definitely have my purpose.

555
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,319
Since I'm doing business in the capital,

556
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,039
I hope to find a powerful backer.

557
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,240
After thinking twice,
if I could be close to Prince Qi,

558
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,319
I would have no worries
even if my legs being broken.

559
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
So I've specially prepared a gift,

560
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,359
a very generous gift.

561
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,240
I hope you can present it
to His Highness.

562
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,960
If His Highness accepts it,

563
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,839
then I could be
at ease, reassured, and content.

564
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,640
Ordinary items naturally won't suffice.

565
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,559
But this is extraordinary.

566
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,279
It's a famed master's carving
from Shoushan stone.

567
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,400
It's at least three hundred years old.

568
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
And it comes from no ordinary origin.

569
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,119
Who is it exactly?

570
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,359
It's a Southeast Asian merchant
dealing with antiques.

571
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,160
It's all jewelry and stuff like that.

572
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,920
The princess invited you to take a look.

573
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Thank the princess.

574
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,359
They are indeed quite beautiful.

575
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,279
Lucky always brings
something interesting.

576
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,440
Who?

577
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,000
His name is Lin Haohan.

578
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,599
He comes from Southeast Asia,

579
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,400
so he insists on being called Lucky.

580
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
Oh my.

581
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,680
My stomach is hurting again.

582
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,759
Tell the princess I can't come over.

583
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,519
I just need to rest a bit.

584
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,680
What is this?

585
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,079
It's for you.

586
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,079
From you?

587
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,960
A merchant.

588
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
He recently opened a shop,

589
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,680
a large antique and curio store,

590
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,079
which is just around Qianmen.

591
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,960
This is specifically for you, Father.

592
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,480
A merchant?

593
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,759
What good stuff can a merchant offer?

594
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,440
Put it away.

595
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,640
Father,

596
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,160
at least take a look.

597
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,759
He also said

598
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,920
this is a famed Shoushan stone carving

599
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,160
over three hundred years,

600
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,240
and its provenance is extraordinary.

601
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,920
It is said to be
a Buddhist artifact from Fujian,

602
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,000
a paperweight of
the former Southern Shaolin Abbot.

603
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,920
What is it called?

604
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,519
Lotus Step.

605
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,240
Lotus Step?

606
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,000
Prince Qi's Mansion?

607
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,880
To be precise, Wulan Shan's place.

608
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,519
Men Sandao actually took Liu Lin

609
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:07,960
to the home of princess.

610
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,640
Is the Department cooperating

611
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,160
with Prince Qi or Beiyang?

612
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,240
Men Sandao never mentioned it
to Wang Jialuo.

613
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,920
He didn't even mention

614
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,119
Liu Lin at all.

615
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,039
I asked the servants in the mansion,

616
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,119
they said Liu Lin was a classmate
of Wulan Shan during studying abroad,

617
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,599
who came back from abroad to visit her.

618
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,599
Wulan Shan told Zhong Haichao the same.

619
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,319
Zhong Haichao was unaware.

620
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,759
According to what I've gotten,

621
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,759
he was truly unaware.

622
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,960
So it was Wulan Shan

623
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,000
who fabricated an identity for Liu Lin.

624
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:43,920
Yes.

625
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,480
I didn't know Men Sandao and Wulan Shan

626
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,079
have such a close relationship.

627
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,359
At first, I was also puzzled.

628
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,240
So, I looked into it.

629
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,319
I had someone inquire
in the Imperial Household Department.

630
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Twelve years ago,

631
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Guangxu once wanted to act
as the matchmaker

632
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,160
and have Welan Shan marry Men Sandao.

633
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,319
Twelve years ago?

634
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
The year of the Wuxu Reform.

635
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,400
After the reform,
Men Sandao was prisoned.

636
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,079
If it hadn't been for this,

637
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,640
he would have been
the prince's son-in-law.

638
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,559
So, they had affection
for each other at that time.

639
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,359
Does Zhong Haichao know it?

640
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,160
It shouldn't be a secret anymore.

641
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,960
It's just that no one mentions it.

642
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,079
It was for paving the way for his career

643
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,079
that Zhong Haichao married the princess.

644
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,839
Men Sandao used the relationship

645
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,480
to hide Liu Lin in Wulan Shan's mansion.

646
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,680
He was quite clever.

647
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,079
I feel it's rather simple instead.

648
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,480
There are imperial guards
and Beiyang guards

649
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,960
in Wulan Shan's mansion,

650
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,240
but they will not necessarily
be on high alert.

651
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,640
After all, it is a prince's home.

652
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,079
Presumably those guards

653
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,960
have long been accustomed to peace.

654
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,440
Men Sandao won't
expose Liu Lin's identity,

655
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,880
while Wulan Shan will
only admit Liu Lin is her classmate.

656
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,119
Thus, defense won't be
intentionally bolstered.

657
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,400
Perhaps we should go to
her mansion to abduct Liu Lin.

658
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,559
It might be easier than
going to Men Sandao's home.

659
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,759
Okay.

660
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Get ready.

661
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,400
Act as soon as possible.

662
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,519
Find some martial artists this time.

663
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,240
Be sure not to expose yourself.

664
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,200
You just maintain your current state.

665
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,759
Huanjie.

666
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,519
Bufan.

667
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,440
Are you going to report to Prince Qi?

668
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,240
Yes.

669
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,160
Without any results,

670
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,759
we can't escape a scolding for sure.

671
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,279
But it'll be okay.

672
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,480
Well, Huanjie.

673
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,880
This time it'll be a rebuke,

674
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,640
so I'll go alone

675
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,960
without you.

676
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,960
That's good.

677
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,119
However, Bufan,

678
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,799
you must remember

679
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,119
to bear with it.

680
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,680
Don't make the prince angry.

681
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,359
I know.

682
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:21,079
But he has been waiting for a long time.

683
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,480
Let him wait.

684
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,279
Alright.

685
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,960
No need to serve tea.

686
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,279
Yes.

687
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,240
Mr. Zhuo,

688
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,799
the prince wants you to wait.

689
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,519
He is busy with official duties.

690
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,359
I shall wait then.

691
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,119
Mr. Muqing,

692
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,400
I received a tip

693
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,359
that someone had gathered
a dozen scattered forces

694
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,519
to act tonight.

695
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,920
How does that concern us?

696
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,920
It's said the organizer is a woman.

697
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,799
Well, isn't it either a man or a woman?

698
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,000
That Japanese woman?

699
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:09,920
Nobody has seen her.

700
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,640
It can't be sure.

701
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,559
However, they did kidnap someone before.

702
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,160
I fear just in case...

703
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,799
It seems they've already known

704
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,200
I've placed Miss Liu
in the prince's place.

705
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
They are quite bold,

706
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,039
daring to take actions there.

707
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,079
Let's go, Getai.

708
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,000
Change clothes and take a walk there.

709
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,599
Go ahead and have a look.

710
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,119
Excuse me.

711
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,480
Sugar-coated haws.

712
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,279
Sugar-coated haws.

713
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,279
All sorts here.

714
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,519
Come and see.

715
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,200
Sugar-coated haws.

716
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:55,839
Sesame cake.

717
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,000
A bowl of plain noodles, please.

718
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,119
Sesame cake.

719
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,240
Come on.

720
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,440
Two bowls please.

721
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,359
Alright.

722
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,640
This place was a good choice.

723
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,799
If it were me, I would choose here too.

724
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,440
The southwest corner of the mansion
is the back kitchen

725
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,920
with fewer guards.
Easier to cause chaos.

726
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,319
It's out-of-the-way.

727
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,160
When it gets dark,
there will be even fewer people.

728
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:23,880
A good choice.

729
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,359
I've spotted the forces as well.

730
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,720
Seventeen, right?

731
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,119
Counted already?

732
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,640
Muqing, don't say it just yet.

733
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,519
Let me have a try.

734
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,279
Those five over there pulling the cart.

735
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,400
It's almost dark.

736
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,720
Who would need
cart pullers at this time?

737
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,920
They're for the getaway.

738
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,720
Tie up Miss Liu
and carry her away on the cart.

739
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,079
It's too slow using a cart.

740
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,880
After the abduction,
there should be a car.

741
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,119
The cart is loaded
with weapons and ropes.

742
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
The wall-scaling abduction

743
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,240
can't do without these tools.

744
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,920
You're right.

745
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,599
Those two playing chess under
the tree to the west

746
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,839
are surrounded by five.

747
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,880
Seven in total.

748
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,000
We don't know whether it's good or not.

749
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,839
One of the onlookers
is carrying a lantern.

750
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,839
Has he figured it out

751
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,680
that the game would last until dark?

752
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,400
You have a keen eye.

753
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,880
I learn from the best.

754
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,960
It seems

755
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,000
my boys and I

756
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,079
also did a poor job back then.

757
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,640
And there, the one peeling radishes.

758
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,880
The radishes are almost
the size of carrots now.

759
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,400
Will anyone buy these?

760
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,960
There must be something off.

761
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,599
And the one over there with the hook.

762
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,640
As if he fears others won't know
what he does.

763
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,160
And those two at the noodle shop.

764
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,519
How long have they been eating?

765
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,680
The noodles must be mushy.

766
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,240
You said seventeen.

767
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,279
Where's the last one?

768
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,400
Your noodle tea is good.

769
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,960
Is it millet flour or sorghum flour?

770
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,480
It's millet flour.

771
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:16,840
Getai.

772
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,800
Don't you think the millet mush
is very good?

773
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,039
Yes, it's authentic.

774
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,239
But he doesn't even know

775
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,800
what flour this is made of.

776
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,760
It's dark under the lamp.

777
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,199
I actually overlooked you.

778
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,039
A hefty investment.

779
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,280
They're from Zhao's store,

780
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,960
where the price is not cheap.

781
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,559
You must have spent much buying these.

782
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,719
We don't have to buy them today, do we?

783
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Of course not.

784
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,199
Take this back and the boys can have

785
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,239
a bowl of authentic millet mush

786
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,639
if they are tired from interrogation.

787
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,960
You guys will act tonight, right?

788
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,800
Well,

789
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,440
why did you come so early?

790
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,079
You don't need to scout the place.

791
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,239
Let's take you all back.

792
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,760
Will you be tough to deal with?

793
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,639
It won't matter in that case.

794
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,079
There are still sixteen left.

795
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,960
There's always someone who'll cave.

796
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:08,960
Don't be still.

797
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,679
We still want two more bowls.

798
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,559
Come on.

799
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:13,880
They act now?

800
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,039
Go.

801
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,559
You all came back yesterday.

802
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,400
Why do you report back today?

803
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,000
Did you achieve nothing
in Tianjin Presidio?

804
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,960
Do you feel you've let me down?

805
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,480
The disciples and I

806
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,440
indeed found that madman
outside of Tianjin yesterday.

807
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,840
We also confirmed

808
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,920
he is the fourth-generation chief
of Dharma Department.

809
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,880
But he has been insane for forty years.

810
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,039
We couldn't get anything from him.

811
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,280
We could not find any clues either

812
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,760
in his residence or on his body.

813
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,639
I have spared no effort.

814
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,639
So it's not a matter of
letting you down.

815
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,079
You've thought for a whole day

816
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,320
and concluded
that you haven't let me down?

817
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,039
Then tell me,

818
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,960
after thinking for a whole day,

819
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,320
what is the next step in your plan?

820
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,639
I haven't thought of it yet.

821
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,480
What's Baohe Inn?

822
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,480
Baohe Inn?

823
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,840
You've thought for a whole day

824
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,119
but haven't figured out the next step.

825
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,960
But Men Sandao
in the Imperial Household Department

826
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,719
has stirred things up all day.

827
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,119
What has he discovered?

828
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,199
I don't know.

829
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,599
But someone came to report

830
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,960
that he has ordered
a search through historical records.

831
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,400
He has gone back two hundred years,

832
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,480
looking for a place called Baohe Inn.

833
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,239
This must be important information,

834
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,960
yet you have never even heard of it.

835
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Didn't you say that every step

836
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,880
you took was ahead of the Department?

837
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,920
For all the clues given to me,

838
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,440
I have investigated them thoroughly.

839
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,679
For that madman in Tianjin,

840
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,320
I've found out him in just half a day.

841
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,000
If Men Sandao's actions
are ahead of mine,

842
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,079
then it just shows
that perhaps the Department

843
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,360
has more information than you.

844
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,559
Nonsense.

845
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,840
What is that? Pick it up.

846
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:38,292
(Southern Shaolin's four chiefs with seals
go to Baohe Inn every 30 years.)

847
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:38,816
(The sixth day of the fifth month, 1701.)

848
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,159
You just mentioned Baohe Inn?

849
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:44,679
Right.

850
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,239
Where did this object come from?

851
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,199
It was sent by someone.

852
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,880
It is said from Fujian

853
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,360
and has ties to Southern Shaolin.

854
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,039
This is more than just ties.

855
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,960
This is a secret letter.

856
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,440
It reads

857
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,639
Southern Shaolin's
four chiefs with seals

858
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,199
go to Baohe Inn every 30 years.

859
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,320
The sixth day of the fifth month, 1701.

860
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,760
Every 30 years. 1701.

861
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,800
1731.

862
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:26,199
1761.

863
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,519
1791.

864
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:32,480
1821.

865
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,039
1851.

866
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,880
1881.

867
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,000
Then it's 1911.

868
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,119
This year.

869
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Even Heaven favors me.

870
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,800
So it seems that Men Sandao
is searching for Baohe Inn

871
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,320
to keep this appointment.

872
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,880
If other inheritors

873
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,880
can all appear on that day,

874
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,719
then all the seals can be obtained

875
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:09,400
and the Altar Treasure can be opened.

876
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,079
Then, this must truly
be the will of heaven.

877
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,400
I will certainly not fail you.

878
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:17,039
Not many days left
until the sixth day of the fifth month.

879
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,760
You had better hurry up and prepare.

880
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,559
But this Baohe Inn's location

881
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,199
remains unknown.

882
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:29,840
I will have someone
watch the Imperial Household Department.

883
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,960
Once Men Sandao finds it out,

884
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,320
you will be able to know.

885
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:35,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

886
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,199
Do not just sit and wait.

887
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,559
In case Men Sandao also cannot find it.

888
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,840
There are only a few days left
until the appointed date.

889
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,159
But my original thought was

890
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,719
to seek the inheritor of the defected

891
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,360
chief of the Disciplinary Department.

892
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,679
I wonder if any clues can be found.

893
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,239
That family has been investigated
by the Imperial Household Department

894
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,719
for decades.

895
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,519
Do you think there can be any findings?

896
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,719
By check carefully,

897
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,000
something can always be found.

898
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,920
No.

899
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,559
Start with Baohe Inn first.

900
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:19,920
Muqing.

901
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,559
We're lucky today

902
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,039
to encounter Mr. Zhuo as well.

903
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,679
Muqing, we didn't bring men.

904
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,216
How about...

905
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:29,824
No.

906
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,639
I want to have a try.

907
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,960
It's really such a small world.

908
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,440
Mr. Zhuo,

909
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,239
have you brought the seal with you?

910
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,440
Of course. It's so important

911
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:47,760
that I carry it at all times.

912
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,320
Would you be willing to hand it
over to me personally,

913
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,519
or shall I search for it
on your dead body later?

914
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,960
Well.

915
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,000
If you're willing
to surrender without a fight,

916
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,639
you'd be dishonoring your reputation.

917
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:06,679
Draw your sword.

918
00:41:42,974 --> 00:41:46,590
♪Blood refines the sword,
and wind forges the blade♪

919
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:50,264
♪I am still that person

00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:58,776
