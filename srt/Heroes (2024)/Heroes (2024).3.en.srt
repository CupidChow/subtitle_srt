1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,839
I've told you everything I know.

2
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,960
I don't know about the rest.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,640
Take him back.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:27,640
Okay.

5
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,120
- Get up.
- Get up.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,879
- Go.
- Go.

7
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,280
I know what the imperial yamen
is capable of.

8
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,399
I'd rather die

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,280
than be tortured in the torture chamber.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,640
Don't go.

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,239
- You...
- Xian Ge.

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,120
You are Wang Jialuo,
constable of Dagu County Yamen.

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,799
What do you want to say?

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,640
I'm investigating a murder case.

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,079
Chen Wu, who was just inside,

16
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,480
is the suspect I wanted to question.

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,640
Then go ahead.

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,840
But he's already dead.

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,239
He died during the interrogation.

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,879
You violated the Qing Code...

21
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,000
The Qing Code made for the common people

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,120
and for low-ranking constables like you
to conduct cases.

23
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,120
But we never

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,680
get restricted by the Code.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,599
Don't you know that?

26
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,040
How dare a menial constable

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,000
stand in our way?

28
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,920
Going back to the gambling house now
and moving the corpse

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,400
is what you should do.

30
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,319
Who is there?

31
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,919
Miss Lin?

32
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,680
What are you doing here?

33
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,840
I...

34
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,560
I heard you asking someone at the inn
about the gambling house,

35
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,479
so I followed you here.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,560
But I didn't dare to go inside.

37
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,159
I just found a person,

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,960
he should somehow

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
relate to the murderers
who killed your family.

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,039
But he's dead.

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,240
The Department officials tortured him.

42
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,319
What are those people?

43
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,439
The officials of the court.

44
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,479
High-ranking ones.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
So what are you planning to do next?

46
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,599
I'm going to Tianjin.

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
I just heard that person mention

48
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,400
a pawnshop in Tianjin.

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,479
It should be related
to those people from Lingxi.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
I might find some clues there.

51
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,319
I want to investigate the case with you.

52
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,719
I want to know why they

53
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,599
killed my family.

54
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,192
=Heroes=

55
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:11,456
=Episode 3=

56
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,079
Ordered by the Department,

57
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,600
we sent the bodies over right away

58
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
untouched

59
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,519
and let you to examine them.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,240
I dare not dissect the bodies on my own.

61
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,399
Judging from the appearance,

62
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,279
these people did not suffer
too many traumatic injuries,

63
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,160
but black blood ran out
from their mouths and noses.

64
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,279
There were also bruises
on their bodies and faces.

65
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,639
I think they

66
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,519
died of poisoning.

67
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,519
Sir.

68
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,759
These people were tied up
before they died.

69
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,240
If they were tied up,

70
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,399
the bruises left should be more orderly

71
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,639
and more dense.

72
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,199
You are right, sir.

73
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,160
But this...

74
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:12,839
Whip.

75
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,439
Whip?

76
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,319
A soft whip.

77
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,879
The bruise was not made by tools,

78
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,240
it was made by bare hands.

79
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,879
They were tortured.

80
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
They were murdered with poison.

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,920
They wanted to escape but failed.

82
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,399
Throttling the jawbone and neck,

83
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,759
was to coerce them for information.

84
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
Judging from their bones and muscles,

85
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,399
these victims knew Kung Fu.

86
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,959
The killer killed them all at once

87
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,079
without alerting the other people
in the inn.

88
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,839
That means this person
was not only skilled in using poison,

89
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,439
but his Kung Fu was also exceptional.

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,839
Then sir, in your opinion,

91
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,560
what poison was used on these people?

92
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,519
Lingxi strange poison.

93
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,160
Lingxi strange poison?

94
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
And the person
who took the pawn ticket from Chen Wu

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,199
was also disguised
as someone from Lingxi.

96
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,120
A martial arts master-hand from Lingxi.

97
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,879
Is there any master from Lingxi?

98
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,480
Zhuo Bufan.

99
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,800
Zhuo Bufan,
the Sect Leader of Rongtian Ridge?

100
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,800
He was already a grandmaster
over a decade ago.

101
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,759
His swordsmanship is unmatched.

102
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,519
However,

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,319
Rongtian Ridge is in the far Lingxi.

104
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,920
When Zhuo Bufan was young,

105
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,399
his swordsmanship was unparalleled.

106
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,160
He was also an unruly and untamed man.

107
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,399
Why did he kill them

108
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,519
without leaving his name?

109
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,079
Moreover, as a wandering swordsman,

110
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,480
how could he get involved in rebellion?

111
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,680
(Prison of Imperial Household Department)
The dreamy wish has never come true.

112
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,680
My talents are restricted to triviality
that I can't get rid of.

113
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Six years ago,
I knew that you served under Prince Qi.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,279
I kept you because I had other plans.

115
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,040
But now, you are not just hurting me,

116
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,160
you are jeopardizing
the whole Qing Dynasty.

117
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,879
Rebellion is a serious crime.

118
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,720
You and your entire clan
would be executed.

119
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,399
However, after all,

120
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,439
you have followed me for ten years.

121
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,000
I will give you one last chance.

122
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,680
As long as you are willing to confess,

123
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
you will be the only one to die.

124
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,080
The treasure map of Wenyuan Pavilion

125
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,320
is not complete.

126
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,360
There is one person
who knows the secret of treasure map.

127
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,000
Your Highness.

128
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,919
Greetings, Your Highness.

129
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,600
Your Highness.

130
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,000
Congratulations.

131
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,759
What is there to congratulate?

132
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,039
I just took one step forward.

133
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,879
Have a seat.

134
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,080
Please.

135
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,360
It's more than what you said.

136
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,840
The Department hasn't taken this step
in over 100 years.

137
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,960
If you didn't tell me the whole story

138
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,120
of the Altar Treasure

139
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,279
and that the treasure map
was hidden in Wenyuan Pavilion.

140
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,919
How could I have had the chance
to obtain it?

141
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,120
It is still too early to say that.

142
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,360
Obtaining the treasure or not

143
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,200
depends on Zhuo Bufan.

144
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,159
Now Zhuo Bufan already
has half of the treasure map.

145
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,879
With his capability,

146
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,799
I am sure he will get the other half.

147
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,039
What do you think of Zhuo Bufan?

148
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,240
A once-in-a-century genius swordsman.

149
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,679
You praised his skills, but not him.

150
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,279
What's your concern about him?

151
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,919
Everyone is greedy.

152
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,399
For such a great treasure,

153
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm afraid they can't help themselves.

154
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,240
Yes.

155
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,960
Such a huge treasure.

156
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,159
What's the harm
in sharing some with them?

157
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
Your Highness,

158
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,879
you must have
made a sweet deal with them.

159
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,879
It is for him,

160
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,799
but for me,

161
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,519
it's just a useless title.

162
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,399
Zhuo Bufan wanted a main altar

163
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
and to be recognized
as the first Sword Sect.

164
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,840
I said yes right away.

165
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,279
The lord has written back.

166
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,879
What did Prince Qi say?

167
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,480
He said

168
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,559
he was quite satisfied
with our current progress,

169
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,600
but we must keep going.

170
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,360
Okay.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,639
Huanjie.

172
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,559
We are handling this thing
for Prince Qi.

173
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,720
Only you, I, and Ms. Huo know about it.

174
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,759
I know.

175
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,919
I'm not telling the other disciples

176
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,759
because I want to keep it simple,

177
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,080
and don't want them to be panic.

178
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,240
I hope you can keep this secret for me.

179
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,639
Bufan.

180
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,480
After all,

181
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,080
I am also a senior
of Rongtian Sword Sect.

182
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,879
Of course, I will keep this a secret.

183
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,480
Rest assured.

184
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,360
Huanjie.

185
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,159
Just as we discussed yesterday,

186
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,279
Huanjie,
you take the waterway to Shanghai first.

187
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,320
Tang Yu.

188
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,360
Remember to prepare the clothes
for your meet-up.

189
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,200
We'll walk through Linqing and Huai'an
to reach Shanghai.

190
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,200
Leave the others to Qin Tuo.

191
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Mr. Zhuo.

192
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,519
Everyone, take care.

193
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,279
There are many highly-skilled swordsmen.

194
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,639
Why chose the desolate Rongtian Ridge?

195
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,360
Kneel down.

196
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:33,919
Kneel.

197
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,120
Why should I kneel? I...

198
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,600
Kneel down.

199
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,919
What are you doing?

200
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,399
I don't trust those
famous martial arts masters.

201
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,080
Zhuo Bufan is different.

202
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,440
He's a very proud man.

203
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,799
If it weren't for utter destitution,

204
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,960
he would never deign
to serve the powerful.

205
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,279
Perhaps some people

206
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,240
think serving me is an honor.

207
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,799
But for him,

208
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,639
it is a disgrace.

209
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,519
Rongtian Ridge

210
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,559
is the epitome
of poverty and desolation.

211
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,279
Even someone ambitious like Zhuo Bufan

212
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,639
cannot withstand the poverty.

213
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,320
Yielding once to change his future.

214
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,360
He knows what really matters.

215
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
Do you think

216
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
I'm a burden to you?

217
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,039
If I think so,

218
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,960
why don't I just be alone?

219
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,360
You and other disciples

220
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,960
are all my burdens.

221
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,200
You must remember,

222
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,039
Our Sword Sect is a sect.

223
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,960
Sword Sect exists
because of every one of you.

224
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,679
Alright, go pack.

225
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,919
We must set off now.

226
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,720
Huanjie.

227
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,000
You are the one
who taught me basic sword moves.

228
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,720
Whip techniques suit you better.

229
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,200
The master
made the right choice for you.

230
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,279
But I still prefer the sword.

231
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,399
Now is not the time

232
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,200
to do what you like.

233
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay.

234
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
We still didn't find the Altar Treasure.

235
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,759
We have looked everywhere.

236
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,279
But there is one person who knows

237
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,600
the secret of the treasure map.

238
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,879
And Prince Qi already knows about this.

239
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,519
This person was a supporter
of the Reform Movement of 1898.

240
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,080
And he fled to overseas
after Wuxu Reform.

241
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,000
He wants to offer this secret
to the Tongmenghui.

242
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,480
His name is Tan Xian.

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,480
And he will return to the country soon.

244
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,360
Prince Qi wants to find him.

245
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,480
Once he controls Tan Xian,

246
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,919
he will have in control

247
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,440
all the secrets about the treasure.

248
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,519
Prince Qi really wants to rebel?

249
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,159
Aisin-Gioro Zaiqi is always bold.

250
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,639
I don't know
if it's a fortune or a disaster.

251
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,559
This is a good opportunity anyway.

252
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,279
An excellent opportunity.

253
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,320
I want the secret treasure.

254
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,120
So does Prince Qi.

255
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,840
And the Emperor wants it.

256
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,000
This is life-saving money.

257
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,679
Cunqing takes very seriously
the theft of the treasure map.

258
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,360
In order to investigate this case,

259
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,519
we even released the prisoners

260
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,240
who were rebellious.

261
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,279
Are you implying Men Sandao?

262
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,600
Exactly.

263
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,159
Go to Tianjin immediately.

264
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,440
Find Men Sandao.

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,399
Ask him to do everything in his power

266
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,799
to locate the stolen treasure map.

267
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,440
Then I'll set off right away

268
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,080
to lend Zhuo Bufan a helping hand.

269
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,840
You can help him
but also don't let your guard down.

270
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,240
Remember.

271
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,799
Men Sandao

272
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,480
was once a supporter

273
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,960
of the Reform Movement of 1898.

274
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,120
So you must keep a close eye on him.

275
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,919
If he ever shows

276
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,039
any disloyalty to the Department,

277
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,240
kill him.

278
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:35,759
Will do.

279
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,399
Young man.

280
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,080
What clothes do you want?

281
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,559
Boss.

282
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,799
What do those overseas students wear?

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
Many students are wearing

284
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,559
those in the row of the back.

285
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,559
Boss.

286
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,039
Nine of these, please.

287
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,200
The rickshaw is here!

288
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,399
Make way.

289
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,600
Come on.

290
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,919
Make way.

291
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,559
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
Constable from Dagu.

292
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,440
I am on a case.

293
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,480
You are an official.

294
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,559
What would you like to ask?

295
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,120
A couple of days ago, did someone

296
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,559
leave an old leather hat here?

297
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Yes.

298
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,000
However, an imperial guard came earlier.

299
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,640
And he already asked about it.

300
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,759
Why are you asking again?

301
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,119
It doesn't matter.

302
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,960
If you ask me, that old leather hat

303
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,079
isn't even worth ten wen.

304
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,960
But the man who brought it here
didn't even want money.

305
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,720
Instead, he gave us money.

306
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,960
Thirty taels of silver.

307
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,680
He also asked us
to issue him a pawn ticket

308
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,799
and said that in a few days

309
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,279
someone would come with the pawn ticket
to redeem that hat.

310
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,480
He also emphasized

311
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,480
that we must take out
nine Tongbao coins.

312
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,440
Nine Tongbao coins?

313
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,519
Be more specific.

314
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,839
Three Shunzhi Tongbao coins.

315
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,400
Three Kangxi Tongbao coins.

316
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,359
Three Tongzhi Tongbao coins.

317
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,799
Is the hat still with you?

318
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,599
Someone came and took it away

319
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,400
early yesterday morning.

320
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,759
Who took that?

321
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,440
It was a young lady.

322
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,759
Be more specific.

323
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,880
What did she look like?

324
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,119
What she wore and what she said?

325
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,319
The woman

326
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,799
looked pretty young.

327
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,200
And what she wore?

328
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,000
How should I put it?

329
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,400
Anyway, she didn't look like one of us.

330
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,240
Did she look like she was from Lingxi?

331
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,359
Yes.

332
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,799
Sir, you are absolutely right.

333
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,119
This woman from Lingxi.

334
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,200
Do you know where she went?

335
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,480
She didn't tell me.

336
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,839
How would I know?

337
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,720
Then did you see which way she went?

338
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,319
She just went out.

339
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,759
Officer.

340
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,000
If you have nothing to ask,

341
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,799
please don't bother me here.

342
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,200
I am investigating a case.

343
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,400
Mind your attitude.

344
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,440
You are the constable of Dagu.

345
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,839
This is Tianjin.

346
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,440
That's right.

347
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,839
To be honest,

348
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,599
you are an officer,

349
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,440
so I spent so much time talking to you.

350
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,920
Normally, officers

351
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,039
usually are well dressed.

352
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,759
But you, on the other hand,

353
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,640
really surprise me.

354
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,079
I can see your body

355
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,759
through your robe.

356
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,119
My robe covers my whole body.

357
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,920
Rickshaw.

358
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,519
Sir.

359
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,440
Where shall we go?

360
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,160
To a clothing store.

361
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,640
Alright.

362
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,359
Make way,
the rickshaw is coming through!

363
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,240
Make way.

364
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,359
Make way.

365
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,880
Men Sandao.

366
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,359
An attendant
by the side of the late emperor.

367
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,599
You are truly the top master
of the imperial yamen.

368
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,599
May I ask who you are?

369
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,279
Two taels.

370
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,200
Two taels.

371
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,319
What?

372
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,400
I want to look at this banknote.

373
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,799
Have never seen a banknote?

374
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,400
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
Constable from Dagu.

375
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,440
I am on a case.

376
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,400
Oh, officer.

377
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,039
Help yourself.

378
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:15,520
(Banknote, five taels worth)

379
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,799
Who left this banknote?

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
A young lad paid with this for clothes
this morning.

381
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,200
Did he have a strange accent?

382
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,039
Yes.

383
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,359
Did you see which direction he went?

384
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,440
No, but he chatted with me

385
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,200
and asked me how to get to Linqing.

386
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,279
Linqing?

387
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,119
My robe was too torn.

388
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,519
So I just bought new clothes.

389
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,119
Sir.

390
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,680
How is your investigation going?

391
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,759
The murderers

392
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,240
must have gone to Linqing, Shandong.

393
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,960
This is urgent. I must hurry over there.

394
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,319
Otherwise, they may slip away again.

395
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Miss Lin.

396
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,079
You could either settle down in Tianjin

397
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,079
or go to Dagu.

398
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,160
Sir, I...

399
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,079
Once you get to Dagu,

400
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,359
You can go to Dagu County Yamen.

401
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,000
Just say I sent you.

402
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,279
They will get you settled.

403
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
Wait there for my message.

404
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:11,759
This money.

405
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,599
Take it to buy food on the way there.

406
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,319
Anyway, once you get to Dagu,
they will get you settled

407
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,039
and take care of you.

408
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,720
You are the only one I know now.

409
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,839
Let me go with you to Shandong.

410
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,599
I am on a mission now.

411
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,920
It's inconvenient to bring you.

412
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,119
Miss Lin.

413
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,599
Just wait for my message.

414
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,720
I will hunt down the murderers

415
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,519
and arrest them

416
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,119
to get you closure.

417
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,680
Officer.

418
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,759
Tell me.

419
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,920
Is there a person looking like a monk

420
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,640
staying here?

421
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,519
No.

422
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,119
Or have you seen people
with strange accent

423
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,839
in Lingxi attire?

424
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,119
Yes.

425
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,440
Those people

426
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,799
as you described

427
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,880
were staying at our inn.

428
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,759
Where are they now?

429
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,079
They have all left.

430
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,960
Do you know

431
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,200
where they were going?

432
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,960
I heard

433
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,480
that they were going to Shanghai.

434
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,370
(The 30th day of the 3rd month,
Year 3 of the Xuantong Era)

435
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,200
(40 days to Mangzhong)

436
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:26,874
(Taichang Restaurant)

437
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,400
Muqing, how did your investigation go?

438
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,720
It's quite complicated.

439
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,880
It sounds quite troublesome.

440
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:43,039
It's still better than having no clues.

441
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,079
Did Khankh confess?

442
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,079
You are smart, Muqing.

443
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,440
Tell me.

444
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:52,720
With the treasure map that was stolen
from the Wenyuan Pavilion,

445
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,400
we can't find the Altar Treasure.

446
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:55,839
So the Department

447
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,720
has looked for it for centuries
but found nothing.

448
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,640
But there is one person
who knows the secret of treasure map.

449
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,519
He is called Tan Xian.

450
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,039
A member of Tongmenghui.

451
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,839
He has returned from overseas.

452
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,799
And his purpose

453
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,920
is to make contact
with the rebels of Tongmenghui

454
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,319
and pass the secret of the treasure map.

455
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,839
Is Prince Qi one of them?

456
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,799
Of course not.

457
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,440
So, what Prince Qi wants
is the secret of the treasure map.

458
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,359
Mr. Cunqing also thinks so.

459
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,599
He had me bring some people over

460
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,000
to be disposed by you

461
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,279
on investigating
the stolen treasure map.

462
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,160
It must not fall into others' hands.

463
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,000
If Prince Qi found the treasure,

464
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,279
and wanted to rebel,

465
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,440
then no one could stop him.

466
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,000
I just said this was complicated,

467
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,200
but now I didn't think so anymore.

468
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,839
I found Chen Wu at Gegu.

469
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,920
It was he who took the treasure map
stolen from the palace

470
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,839
from the capital

471
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,319
to a pawnshop in Tianjin.

472
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,200
And then someone took the map.

473
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,720
It was a Lingxi woman who took it.

474
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,799
Lingxi?

475
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,039
The Dagu County Yamen
sent over nine corpses.

476
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,240
They all returned from Japan.

477
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,559
Getai, who do you think they are?

478
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,119
They returned from Japan.

479
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,680
Are they rebels from the Tongmenghui?

480
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,839
They all died of poisoning

481
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,440
by a strange poison.

482
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
From Lingxi?

483
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,039
There are few martial arts masters
from Lingxi.

484
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,000
Getai, who can you think of?

485
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,079
Zhuo Bufan.

486
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,880
From Rongtian Ridge.

487
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,519
Exactly.

488
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,079
I also think it's them.

489
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,960
In that case,

490
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,000
he is working for Prince Qi.

491
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,400
This is the only thing
that I can't understand.

492
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,839
Zhuo Bufan, as a peerless swordsman,

493
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,720
is unyieldingly arrogant.

494
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,680
How could he secretly serve Prince Qi?

495
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,119
I can't figure it out,

496
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,160
but it is a fact anyway.

497
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,279
So it was not complicated anymore.

498
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,599
Now there's only one clue left.

499
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,799
They must be planning at this moment

500
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,079
to impersonate the Tongmenghui members
to meet this Tan Xian.

501
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,519
Do you know their whereabouts?

502
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,079
I found out yesterday
that they are heading to Shanghai.

503
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,720
I've already had Xian Ge
to ready a boat.

504
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,640
We'll head straight south
from the Grand Canal

505
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,599
to Shanghai to capture them.

506
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,799
Good.

507
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,319
We are busy all night,

508
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,000
time to enjoy a proper meal.

509
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,880
These are two specialties
of our restaurant.

510
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,079
I assure you both will enjoy these

511
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,079
and want to come again.

512
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,039
Enjoy your meal.

513
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,440
If you need anything, give me a holler.

514
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,039
Wait.

515
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,799
Would you like...?

516
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,440
What is that smell on you?

517
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,119
On me?

518
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Must be the scent of the kitchen's food.

519
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,640
I'm not talking about the food.

520
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,039
It's flower scent.

521
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:41,880
Sir.

522
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,880
You're right.

523
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,640
I've just come down
from the private room upstairs.

524
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,839
The customer inside

525
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,000
smelled like flowers.

526
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,400
She even gave me a silver coin as a tip.

527
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,000
The coin has the flower scent, too.

528
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,759
Getai, you eat first.

529
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:56,920
Muqing?

530
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,039
Leave us two.

531
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,240
How come you're here?

532
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,759
How do you know I am here?

533
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,440
I was downstairs

534
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,400
and smelt the flower scent
I was once most familiar with

535
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,440
that I haven't come across
in a long time.

536
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,160
The scent of rosa rubus.

537
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,519
You still remember?

538
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,920
And you can even think it's me?

539
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:56,192
(14 years ago)

540
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,319
(What?)

541
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,440
(You don't recognize me
dressed like this?)

542
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,160
(Muqing.)

543
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,559
(Do you think I look good
in this outfit?)

544
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,920
(You are beautiful, princess.)

545
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,079
(You look good in anything.)

546
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,680
Then, do you like it?

547
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,440
Tell me.

548
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,039
No matter how you dress,

549
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,119
I don't dare to dislike it.

550
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,240
I, imperial guard Irgen-Gioro Muqing,
send my greetings

551
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,160
to you, princess.

552
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
I have broken in without your consent.

553
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I hope you can forgive me.

554
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,319
I really didn't expect

555
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,680
that you were pardoned
and released from prison.

556
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,960
And now you are even reinstated
as an imperial guard.

557
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,599
I thought

558
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,079
I would die in prison.

559
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,920
I never expected
I'd see the light of day again.

560
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,519
Muqing.

561
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,279
I'm happy for you.

562
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,200
How come you are in Tianjin?

563
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,279
I have errands to run
for the Department.

564
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,960
I'm just passing through.

565
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,559
I'll be leaving shortly.

566
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,359
Sorry for the intrusion.

567
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,200
I hope you will forgive me.

568
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,759
I shall take my leave now.

569
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,480
Muqing.

570
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,759
Is there anything else, princess?

571
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,839
There are just two of us here.

572
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,440
You don't need to call me that.

573
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,559
You are a princess indeed.

574
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,559
I dare not skip the formality.

575
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,000
I've heard that these past two years

576
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,720
you have been studying in England.

577
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,039
That's right.

578
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,880
My father also wants me to

579
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,480
study in Japan for another year.

580
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,680
He is indeed strict with you.

581
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,559
This is...?

582
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,400
A gift for you.

583
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,880
For me?

584
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,640
I brought it back from abroad.

585
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,119
No.

586
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,240
I can't accept it.

587
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,400
I bought this only for you.

588
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,839
It pairs with mine.

589
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,239
The Emperor just bestowed this to me.

590
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,440
Please accept it, princess.

591
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,199
Otherwise, I cannot accept your gift.

592
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,239
It's quite exquisite.

593
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,559
I can attach it to a necklace.

594
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,960
This ring

595
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,480
has the same fragrance as on you.

596
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,440
Does it smell good?

597
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,400
Do you know
what kind of flower scent this is?

598
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,239
Since it was the flower scent

599
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,239
that led you here,

600
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,599
then take this sachet with you.

601
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,000
It's made from the rosa rubus.

602
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,159
Thank you.

603
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,320
You don't need to say thanks

604
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,599
or call me princess.

605
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,880
Rosa rubus is also known
as equinox flower

606
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,719
and manjusaka.

607
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,679
It blooms upon destiny
and perishes upon destiny.

608
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,000
It doesn't force anything to happen.

609
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,000
It doesn't bloom in early spring.

610
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,559
It blooms at the end of spring.

611
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,280
When it blooms,

612
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,639
that heralds the end
of the blossom season.

613
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,960
This might sound melancholic.

614
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,760
But somehow I find it quite endearing.

615
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,039
These are the seeds of rosa rubus.

616
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,760
Sow them into the soil.

617
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,119
Soon, you'll see tiny white flowers.

618
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,280
They are quite beautiful.

619
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,599
(It doesn't bloom in early spring.)

620
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,679
(It blooms at the end of spring.)

621
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,000
This was what you told me.

622
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,199
You still remember that?

623
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,840
I'm glad.

624
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,480
The rosa rubus has blossomed
in the late spring.

625
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,920
The blossom season will end soon.

626
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,199
Those glorious and unforgettable moments
will fade away.

627
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,559
Muqing.

628
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,360
Take care.
