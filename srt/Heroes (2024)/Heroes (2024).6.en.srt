1
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,019
I am a constable of Dagu County Yamen,

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,220
Wang Jialuo.

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,499
I've chased criminals to this place.

4
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,100
Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo,
disciples from Rongtian Ridge,

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,460
they have committed the crime of murder.

6
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,740
Zhuo Bufan, master of Rongtian Ridge,
cannot escape blame.

7
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:33,900
Lay down your weapons now

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,100
and come with me to Dagu County Yamen
to stand trial.

9
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:39,740
If you refuse to surrender
and turn yourselves in,

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,740
according to the Qing Code,

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,660
you shall be executed.

12
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,219
Quickly, kill him!

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,100
Junior bro,

14
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,660
finish off this petty constable

15
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:01,859
and end this trouble.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,780
Protect him.

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,820
You're just a constable.

18
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,340
Is this a place you can come to?

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:27,980
Get away.

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,420
Don't disturb the imperial guards
at work.

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,700
Sir,

22
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,459
you do your job, and I'll do mine.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,459
I got nothing to do with your work.

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,260
And I ask you to leave me alone too.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,219
Ridiculous.

26
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,820
I am here to apprehend
the murderer of Dagu case,

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,379
acting in accordance with the Qing Code.

28
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:42,620
Whoever obstructs me

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,780
is the one ridiculous.

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,420
You are a mere constable.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
Why do you think you can capture
a master of Rongtian Ridge?

32
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,260
Having taken the king's grain,

33
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,219
whether I can do it is no important.

34
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:53,700
Trying to do it is what matters.

35
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:54,780
This...

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,260
Huang Xing.

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,820
You are arrested!

38
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:14,299
Constable!

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,420
Fifteen years ago,

40
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,500
the imperial yamen had a few

41
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,019
who could be counted as masters.

42
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,899
But now there truly are
no impressive figures.

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,779
If you want to stop us,

44
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,940
other than death,
what outcome could there be?

45
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:53,178
=Heroes=

46
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:56,864
=Episode 6=

47
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,539
You are from the imperial yamen?

48
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,019
May I ask your name?

49
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,419
Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

50
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,339
You are Men Sandao?

51
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,300
I thought you were no longer
in the imperial yamen.

52
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,260
For you,

53
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,940
indeed, it's worth my effort.

54
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,060
A hall of flowers
intoxicates all the guests.

55
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,740
A sword chills fourteen provinces.

56
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,779
Mr. Zhuo, your cultivation level

57
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,180
is more profound than I thought.

58
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,860
Good.

59
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,380
My next move is called Sword Waterfall.

60
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,940
There are six forms,
each with seven variations.

61
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,620
Be careful.

62
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,099
Why tell him his moves?

63
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,419
He has always respected his opponents.

64
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,579
Men Sandao is no ordinary man.

65
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,740
Our Faction Leader must respect him
very much.

66
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,820
Be careful!

67
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,019
You truly merit the title
of the yamen's foremost.

68
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,380
Complexity implies simplicity,

69
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,700
and great simplicity implies complexity.

70
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,019
You used the simplest, most direct way

71
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,899
to fend off my lethal moves.

72
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,060
You truly are worth my moves.

73
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,180
Within the imperial yamen,

74
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,459
how can there be someone so formidable?

75
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,979
Impressive.

76
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,300
He took so many moves
of our Faction Leader.

77
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,899
Be ready to follow my command.

78
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,380
If Muqing falls into a disadvantage,

79
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,500
we must help him quickly.

80
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,219
We must not allow Rongtian Ridge
to prevail.

81
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:35,419
Yes.

82
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,620
We must not be careless.

83
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,060
Be ready to join in at any time.

84
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
You are arrested!

85
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,500
After all, he is a constable.

86
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,979
We can't let the rebels
from Rongtian Ridge bully him like this.

87
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,100
Charge!

88
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,179
Kill them!

89
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,460
Let's hurry out
while they're distracted.

90
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,179
Follow me. Don't panic.

91
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:20,580
Charge!

92
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,100
What do we do now?

93
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,380
I don't know.

94
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:29,779
Let's play it by ear.

95
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,299
Capture them both now!

96
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,860
Your gun only has six bullets.

97
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:38,100
I have dozens of men here.

98
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,019
It's useless.

99
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,819
One bullet is enough.

100
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,419
Besides, I have six.

101
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:46,019
My task is very simple.

102
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:46,980
It is to protect.

103
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,659
But I'm not protecting him.

104
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,620
I'm protecting the intelligence
he possesses.

105
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,260
So if any accidents occur,

106
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,580
I will kill him right away

107
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,699
to prevent information leak.

108
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,899
You don't believe me?

109
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,500
Let your man take one more step forward
and see.

110
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:01,659
Go.

111
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,380
I won't waste bullets.

112
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,939
If you dare to move forward,

113
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:17,860
I'll kill him first and then kill you.

114
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,620
Killing him benefits no one!

115
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,460
Letting you have him
would be even worse for me!

116
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,019
Mr. Tan,

117
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:25,140
I have no other choice.

118
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,340
If I truly must kill you,

119
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,100
please understand.

120
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,860
I...

121
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,340
I understand.

122
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,019
Men Sandao,

123
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,100
It's better to tell your people

124
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,260
and mine to cease fire first

125
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:49,460
and unite to take them out.

126
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,659
Then we discuss who can have Tan Xian.

127
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:53,899
What?

128
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,899
Do you dare not to fight outsiders?

129
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
We're called imperial yamen.

130
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,539
We only strike outsiders.

131
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:01,779
Everyone, stop.

132
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:06,580
Cease fire!

133
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,019
Getai,

134
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,260
get the man first!

135
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,419
Disciples of Rongtian,

136
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:17,699
get the man!

137
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,260
Watch them!

138
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,140
The rest, follow me!

139
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:46,819
What do we do now?

140
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,500
Find a way to escape.

141
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,220
How?

142
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,299
There're so many people.

143
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,140
The situation ahead
may be even more complicated.

144
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,659
First, let's go back to the cafe.

145
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:56,460
Let's go.

146
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:46,980
What is this all about?

147
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:49,299
Do Shanghai people always
fight and kill like this?

148
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:50,659
Should I run

149
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,699
or just hide here?

150
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,260
They won't get in here, will they?

151
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,819
I'm a second-class imperial guard,

152
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:58,939
Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

153
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,299
Yesterday, an agreement was made
with the Public Council.

154
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,539
Today, the case must be handled here.

155
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:03,580
Good timing.

156
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:05,899
These two individuals

157
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,699
are coming with me.

158
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,580
I am the detective chief
of the French Concession.

159
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,899
You must be Mr. Tan,

160
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,699
and this lady must be Miss Liu.

161
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:44,419
I am ordered

162
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,100
to ensure both of your safety.

163
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,980
Time is pressing.

164
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,179
Please be sure to trust me.

165
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:56,980
Step back!

166
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,899
Move back!

167
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,019
Step back now!

168
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,260
Otherwise, I'll shoot!

169
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,100
Kid,

170
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,380
who are you talking to?

171
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
In front of you,

172
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,779
is a fourth-rank imperial guard.

173
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,299
This is the French Concession.

174
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,100
Your rank is useless here!

175
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,819
Withdraw.

176
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:47,899
Let's go.

177
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,019
Both of you, please.

178
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:02,539
Back off! Do you hear me?

179
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
Those two cannot leave!

180
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:11,419
Mr. Mu,

181
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:13,539
you don't have a say in this matter.

182
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Are you ready to be accountable
for freeing criminals?

183
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,020
I don't worry about that.

184
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,419
I am from the French Concession.

185
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,259
I'm acting on orders.

186
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:23,659
Mr. Mu,

187
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,100
if you take one step forward,

188
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,780
they will truly open fire.

189
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,100
Mr Mu,

190
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,340
I'm sorry.

191
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:37,899
Both of you, please.

192
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,340
Send someone after them right now.

193
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,780
I need to know where

194
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,739
they're taking Tan Xian to.

195
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,100
Muqing,

196
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,899
how do we deal with this

197
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,020
ignorant little constable?

198
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,540
Find a doctor to treat him.

199
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,739
If he can live, spare his life.

200
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,659
Why am I not allowed in?

201
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,580
Sir, please calm your anger.

202
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,340
These foreigners
simply don't understand etiquette.

203
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:40,340
Even if this is their place,

204
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:42,659
they can't just ignore
the courtesies, right?

205
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:44,739
No matter what happens today,

206
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,419
they should give us an explanation.

207
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,659
(Public Council)
Don't rush.

208
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,939
Stay calm.

209
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,899
I am a Chinese association officer
of the Public Council.

210
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,659
You have business here?

211
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:02,140
Sir,

212
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,259
the situation is like this.

213
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,259
Didn't we all agree on it yesterday?

214
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:09,380
Today, Imperial Household officials

215
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,620
went to Maiqi Road to handle a case,

216
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,459
and then people from the police station

217
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:13,699
arrested the suspects.

218
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,060
This matter has been messed up, right?

219
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:18,979
We'd like to ask
the Public Council's inspector

220
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:20,979
to have a word

221
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,060
with the police station.

222
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,459
Sir,

223
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,939
the police station also
has to listen to the Public Council.

224
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:28,939
What do you mean?

225
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:32,419
Are you saying
the police station went to Maiqi Road

226
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,620
under order from the Public Council?

227
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,300
I'll tell you the truth.

228
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:37,219
From the beginning, the Public Council

229
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,380
never wanted to take part
in your imperial court affairs.

230
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:40,899
So, yesterday,

231
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:42,939
they turned a blind eye

232
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:45,380
and let you make a fuss
within the French Concession.

233
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,100
But at noon today,

234
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,899
there was a sudden new order from above.

235
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,419
Public Council must, no matter what,

236
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:53,580
ensure the safety

237
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,020
of the man called Tan Xian.

238
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,620
He must not suffer any harm
within the French Concession.

239
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:01,259
Why?

240
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,219
That I don't know.

241
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,380
No use asking.

242
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,340
How can we change
what the foreigners have decided?

243
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,739
Sir,

244
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,340
this is the concession.

245
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,020
The Imperial Household Department
has no right to enforce the law here.

246
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:16,300
Here,

247
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,140
we must follow the foreigners' rules.

248
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:21,219
Alright.

249
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,179
Then tell me where Tan Xian

250
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:24,219
has been taken.

251
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,699
How could I possibly know that?

252
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,580
Oh,

253
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:29,340
sir,

254
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,939
I also advise you

255
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,419
to just give up on this matter.

256
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,580
Aren't they just some troublemakers
from Tongmenghui?

257
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,300
Offending the foreigners
over such a trivial issue,

258
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,140
it's not worth it.

259
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,499
This man has been seriously injured.

260
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,179
Hello,

261
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:46,340
my surname is Long,

262
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:47,699
with the given name of Xia.

263
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,419
Or you can call me Dragon Man.
[*Same meaning with his name in Chinese]

264
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,419
This restaurant
is in the French Concession.

265
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:55,020
You should know

266
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,179
that now,
both the royal court and the Japanese,

267
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,259
as well as the martial arts sects
are all looking for you two.

268
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,540
This is your luggage.

269
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,340
Your current situation
is very dangerous.

270
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:03,939
There's a ferry tomorrow morning,

271
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,820
from Shanghai to Hong Kong.

272
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,300
The police will escort you
until you board the ship.

273
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,140
Once you leave Shanghai,
you'll be out of danger.

274
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:13,100
But...

275
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,380
After you two board the ship tomorrow,

276
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,499
the police will no longer

277
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,939
be responsible for your safety.

278
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:08,899
We have already taken great risks

279
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:09,860
to come to Shanghai.

280
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,060
But we haven't made contact
with Tongmenghui.

281
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:13,580
The message can't be sent out.

282
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,659
If we return...

283
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,179
Earlier today, on Maiqi Road,

284
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:18,060
there were the court's henchmen,

285
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,899
the Japanese

286
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,140
and other forces.

287
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,620
So many people are coming after you.

288
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,020
It's evident that this matter

289
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,939
is riskier than we thought.

290
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:26,979
I'm worried

291
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,699
that he might have already
had an accident.

292
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,659
If we stay any longer,

293
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,899
I'm afraid your life will be at risk.

294
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,179
Liu Lin,

295
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:36,259
you are also a member of Tongmenghui.

296
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,300
I will tell you the secret.

297
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,739
My mission is merely to protect you.

298
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,739
Someone else
is responsible for meeting with you.

299
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:44,459
I can't

300
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,860
possess such confidential information.

301
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,540
Passing this message to Mr. Sun
would be easier for you

302
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:50,060
than for me!

303
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,499
Liu Lin,

304
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,659
maybe the person meant to meet me

305
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,219
has already encountered danger.

306
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,699
Maybe tomorrow,
I will also face misfortune.

307
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,140
The court's henchmen,

308
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:02,340
the Japanese,

309
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,899
and all the other forces

310
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:05,060
are restless now.

311
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:08,699
Whether I can board the ship tomorrow

312
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:09,739
is an unknown.

313
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,860
If, by any chance,
I encounter an accident,

314
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,140
the secret

315
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,780
may become an eternal secret.

316
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:17,219
How can it be sent to Tongmenghui?

317
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,979
How can it be delivered to Mr. Sun?

318
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,820
Liu Lin,

319
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,939
let me start from the beginning.

320
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,340
Twelve years ago,

321
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:36,100
the 24th year
of Guang Xu Emperor's reign,

322
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,499
it was the year of Wuxu.

323
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,780
The Wuxu Reform?

324
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:45,060
My father had an old friend,

325
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,140
named Tan Sitong.

326
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,060
One of the Six!

327
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,860
"Laugh at the sky with sword held high."

328
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:55,100
"To stay or to leave,
my heart lasts forever."

329
00:24:57,979 --> 00:24:59,219
(After the Wuxu Reform failed,)

330
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,340
(Tan Sitong)
(Mr. Tan was imprisoned.)

331
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:03,659
(My father was also
hunted by the court.)

332
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,499
(They hid)

333
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,140
(in a civilian house
in the southern city.)

334
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,659
(But unfortunately,)

335
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,899
(they were discovered
by imperial guards)

336
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,699
(and were besieged.)

337
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,899
(Just at their most critical moment...)

338
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:28,540
Benefactor,

339
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,739
we don't know your name yet.

340
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,459
We're all brothers who fear not death
for the sake of the people.

341
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,939
How can I be called benefactor?

342
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,100
I am Cheng Yu.

343
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:38,380
Mr. Cheng,

344
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,459
please accept my bow.

345
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:40,179
I dare not.

346
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:41,100
Please rise.

347
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,659
I was entrusted by Wang Zhengyi

348
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:47,860
to keep you guys safe.

349
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:48,860
Mr. Tan,

350
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:50,140
the situation is perilous.

351
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,300
We must leave now.

352
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,419
That year, with the help of Cheng Yu
and the others,

353
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:56,179
my father successfully
escaped to Southeast Asia.

354
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:57,979
Only later did he find out

355
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,739
Cheng Yu was a direct disciple
of Southern Shaolin.

356
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,419
He was the third-generation inheritor
of the chief.

357
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,659
Six years ago,
my father received a letter

358
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:09,259
and learned

359
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,419
Cheng Yu had already passed away.

360
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:13,659
(And before he passed away,)

361
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,780
(he left a shocking secret
to my father.)

362
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:21,820
(That year, Emperor Kangxi
led the Eight Banners soldiers)

363
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:23,419
(to attack Southern Shaolin)

364
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,219
(and burned it to the ground.)

365
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,219
(It was not because
he was scared of the people)

366
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,219
(from Southern Shaolin,)

367
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,739
(but was for pursuing a sum of treasure)

368
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,699
(hidden in the Southern Shaolin Temple.)

369
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,020
(This wealth,
known as the Altar Treasure,)

370
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,300
(after the fire of Southern Shaolin,)

371
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,140
(has been secretly preserved.)

372
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:43,780
Cheng Yu,
the inheritor of the Bodhi chief

373
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:46,540
was one of the guardians
of the treasure.

374
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,899
In the letter, Cheng Yu revealed
the secret of the Altar Treasure

375
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:54,899
to my father

376
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,060
and told him

377
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,499
to hand it over to someone

378
00:27:57,499 --> 00:27:59,300
who can use it
for the benefit of the people.

379
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:01,179
(The reform failed.)

380
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,620
(The current Emperor is under arrest.)

381
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
(Empress Dowager Cixi executed
supporters of the Reform.)

382
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,499
(Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao
fled overseas,)

383
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,620
(and Wang Zhengyi
urged Zhuangfei to leave,)

384
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,780
(but he said,)

385
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,179
(without the action-takers,)

386
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,380
(there is no plan for the future.)

387
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,659
(Without those who die,)

388
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:15,780
(there'll be no one coming after.)

389
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,860
(Some urged him to go to Japan.)

390
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,739
(He said,)

391
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:21,459
(reforms in all countries are inevitably
accompanied by bloodshed.)

392
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,780
(Look at the door, and long for refuge.)
(Today in China, there has been no one)

393
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,699
(Endure death, and wait for the outcome.)
(who shed blood because of reform.)

394
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,140
(Laugh at the sky with sword held high.)
(The nation isn't prosperous for this.)

395
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,780
(To stay or to leave,
my heart lasts forever.)

396
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,020
(So, let me be the first to bleed.)

397
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,419
(Years have passed.)

398
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:32,699
(Each time I see the sunset,)

399
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,580
(I am reminded of Zhuangfei)

400
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,219
(and the strong China he wished to see.)

401
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,100
(Zhuangfei did not live to see it,)

402
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,699
(nor have I.)

403
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,899
(But someday, someone will see it.)

404
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,820
(They will be marching on
over our blood.)

405
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,100
(The time will come
when wishes are fulfilled.)

406
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,659
(Mr. Tan,)

407
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,899
(the Altar Treasure
is enough to rival a country.)

408
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,380
(Yet, the country
is shattered beyond repair)

409
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,459
(and the people
barely survive hardship.)

410
00:28:56,699 --> 00:28:58,259
(If the treasure cannot be entrusted)

411
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:00,620
(to those
who can bring fortune to the people,)

412
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,699
(then centuries of legacy
are meaningless.)

413
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:07,540
(Please pass on the secret
I kept all my life)

414
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:10,459
(to the one who can rebuild the nation.)

415
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,179
(Sun Wen from Tongmenghui)

416
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,140
(is the man
the treasure can be entrusted.)

417
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,100
This entrustment is very important.

418
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,860
Mr. Tan, only you can accomplish this.

419
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,380
I, Cheng Yu, give my thanks.

420
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,580
So, giving this wealth to Tongmenghui,

421
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,860
to Mr. Sun,

422
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,580
was the last wish of Cheng Yu?

423
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:49,259
That's why I came to Shanghai

424
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,459
to hand over this secret to you.

425
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,739
This is the letter
Cheng Yu wrote to my father.

426
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,259
The letter says

427
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:03,820
Cheng Yu left clues to the treasure

428
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,699
in his own tomb.

429
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
He wanted us to find it.

430
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,459
Liu Lin,

431
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,060
the enormity of this treasure

432
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,739
is enough for Mr. Sun
to make his dreams come true,

433
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,979
to end the feudal rule China has endured
for thousands of years.

434
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,620
This is something
the court would never want to see.

435
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,380
Neither would the Japanese.

436
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,620
Even the underworld forces
are restlessly aspiring for it.

437
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,020
Now you know why

438
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,620
we are in such a plight?

439
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:32,300
I understand.

440
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,219
This is the location of Cheng Yu's tomb.

441
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:40,899
You must remember it.

442
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:44,179
I will.

443
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:49,620
This sentence

444
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,259
is a password.

445
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:53,620
I do not know when it will be needed

446
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,259
or how to use it.

447
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,060
But you must firmly remember it.

448
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,899
This was
repeatedly emphasized by Cheng Yu.

449
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,780
He said it would definitely be useful.

450
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,499
I'll keep it in mind.

451
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:03,979
Never forget it.

452
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:06,739
I'll remember it clearly.

453
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,419
What on earth happened today?

454
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,580
We caused such a commotion

455
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,219
and yet that Tan Xian still got away.

456
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,459
Bufan,

457
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,580
you are a peerless swordsman.

458
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,459
You were actually thwarted
by an imperial guard,

459
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,699
left unable to advance nor retreat.

460
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:26,219
He nearly lasted
a hundred moves under your sword.

461
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,699
You've compromised
the honor of the Rongtian Sword Sect!

462
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:30,179
Huanjie,

463
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,259
you saw the prowess of Men Sandao.

464
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,140
Apart from our leader,

465
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,419
who else could defeat him?

466
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,340
Moreover, if those police officers

467
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,100
didn't show up,

468
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:38,620
he would have definitely been defeated.

469
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:40,979
The outcome remains the same!

470
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,699
Bufan,

471
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:45,540
now Tan Xian
has disappeared without a trace.

472
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:46,939
What should we do next?

473
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,699
Don't worry, Huanjie.

474
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:54,699
Everything has been arranged.

475
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,219
Ms. Huo.

476
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:03,820
Ms. Huo.

477
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,340
Ms. Huo, did you use the bugs?

478
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,300
Rest assured.

479
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:18,100
When Tan Xian left,

480
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,259
I sprinkled
a specially scented powder on him.

481
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:23,179
The bugs
are attracted by the scent of the powder

482
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:24,499
and will follow Tan Xian continuously.

483
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,739
Huang Xing has already gone to find him.

484
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:31,659
Didn't you say

485
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:34,020
that you had already killed
that constable?

486
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,419
So the one that appeared today,

487
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:36,620
was he a human or a ghost?

488
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,140
Sorry, I failed.

489
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,699
Of course you failed.

490
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,620
I have followed your instructions

491
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:48,580
and let colleagues
in Shanghai investigate.

492
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,580
We found the hotel
where Tan Xian was staying.

493
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:54,219
Did you find them?

494
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:54,860
Yes.

495
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,739
Wonderful Hotel.

496
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:09,459
Muqing,

497
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,899
these foreigners aren't so capable.

498
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,459
They put Tan Xian

499
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,060
in a hotel within the concession.

500
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,419
Are there police guarding it?

501
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:17,939
Yes.

502
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,499
From outside the hotel to inside,

503
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,459
there are about twenty officers.

504
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,820
What's the big deal with a few guards?

505
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,899
Let's stir up some commotion first,

506
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,380
and then take advantage of the chaos
to break in.

507
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:30,340
These officers are not very skilled.

508
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,899
They can't stop us at all.

509
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:33,739
Let's find Tan Xian and take him away.

510
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:36,459
I believe we can interrogate
the secret out of him.

511
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:37,179
It won't work.

512
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:37,820
It won't work.

513
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,979
This is a concession after all.

514
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,459
After dealing with the Public Council
a few times,

515
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,540
I've found
they really don't consider this place

516
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,860
our territory.

517
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,860
If we really get into a conflict
with the police,

518
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:51,899
there will definitely be trouble.

519
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:54,620
Not to mention
there might be even worse consequences.

520
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:56,499
We can't just barge in.

521
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,140
We need to think of another way.

522
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:00,620
If we take him by force,

523
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,939
that would be like telling others

524
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:02,860
it was our doing.

525
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:04,060
This Wonderful Hotel

526
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,979
is now being watched
not just by the Japanese,

527
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,340
but also
by Imperial Household Department.

528
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,739
Then after we succeed,

529
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,219
won't they be after us instead?

530
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:10,780
Leader,

531
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:12,419
what do we do now?

532
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,419
We must get the man.

533
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,340
But we can't be
under the banner of imperial guards

534
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,140
and rushing in.

535
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,580
We can disguise ourselves for the task.

536
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,699
When we're done,
even if the police want to investigate,

537
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,379
we can deny everything.

538
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,819
They can't possibly

539
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,540
pin this on the imperial court,
can they?

540
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,299
Muqing, that's very clever!

541
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:33,259
Whom should we pretend to be?

542
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:34,900
Japanese, of course.

543
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,580
This blame,

544
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,420
we'll let them take it.

545
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,140
Have you lost your mind?

546
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,179
Trying to abduct him directly

547
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,060
is the same as
provoking the French police, isn't it?

548
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,420
What if

549
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,420
we disguised ourselves as someone else?

550
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:53,819
People from the Imperial Household
and Rongtian Ridge

551
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:55,500
all showed up on Maiqi Road today.

552
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:01,460
Do you mean to pretend to be
Imperial Household Department people?

553
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,779
We can't learn all their complex rules.

554
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,299
We won't look like them.

555
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,980
Let's pose as the people
from Rongtian Ridge.

556
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,779
How about we pretend

557
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:13,020
to be imperial guards

558
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:14,299
and go to the hotel,

559
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,739
pretend to negotiate with the officers

560
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,779
to attract their attention,

561
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,580
then take actions secretly,

562
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:22,580
and capture Tan Xian?

563
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,140
Once the man is in our hands,

564
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:26,140
is there anything
we can't get him to answer?

565
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,179
Qin Tuo,

566
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:37,900
later, you take some people over

567
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,140
to speak to those officers

568
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,420
in the hotel.

569
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:41,659
You must stall them,

570
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,900
even if you have to cause trouble.

571
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:45,179
Once successful,
immediately send a signal.

572
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:45,980
Understood.

573
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,659
Huanjie,

574
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:51,020
I'll take people straight up
when the time comes

575
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,219
and capture Tan Xian.

576
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:54,779
Huanjie, thank you.

577
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,659
Who are you?

578
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,219
We're Imperial Household Department.

579
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:22,699
We know that Tan Xian is right here.

580
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,060
We have some questions for him.

581
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,339
Please do us a favor.

582
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,460
Impossible.

583
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:27,580
We have orders from above.

584
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:29,259
No one is allowed to go up!

585
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,219
Leave.

586
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,580
Bro,

587
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:33,540
after all,
we work for the imperial court.

588
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:37,940
No one is allowed.

589
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,299
Without orders from Public Council,

590
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,179
not even the Emperor himself can get in.

591
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,659
If you don't leave,

592
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,420
I'll have to be impolite.

593
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,659
Then how do you intend to be impolite?

594
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,259
A group of folks have arrived outside.

595
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,580
They're barging into the hotel!

596
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,100
The Japanese have also stormed in!

597
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,500
Both groups are outside.

598
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:03,779
They have started fighting.

599
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,420
What's the situation?

600
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,940
It seems

601
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,659
everyone came up with the same plan.

602
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:49,659
They've all arrived.

603
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:52,379
All of them?

604
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,819
They're downstairs.

605
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,779
I think those officers

606
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:55,659
can't stop them.

607
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:58,219
You should go.

608
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,339
What did you say?

609
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,900
We can't both take the risk.

610
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:02,659
It's safer for us to go separately.

611
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,379
Anyway, I'm the biggest target.

612
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:04,940
I'll stay behind

613
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,420
just to attract their attention.

614
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,100
You should run.

615
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,739
Let's go together.

616
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:09,580
Neither of us can get away
if we go together!

617
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,779
Take off your suit and give it to me!

618
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:13,980
I'll run out wearing your suit.

619
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,339
They'll definitely chase after me.

620
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:17,060
You wait until it's safe outside,

621
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,940
and then find a way to escape.

622
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,339
What about you?

623
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,259
Don't worry about me.

624
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,859
I'm trained, and I have a gun.

625
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:23,179
They might not catch up with me.

626
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,819
Let's do this!

627
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:25,379
Come on!

628
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,460
If we delay any longer,
they're going to attack us!

629
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,020
So what do we do now?

630
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,819
Let them keep fighting.

631
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,659
We'll watch and wait.

632
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:39,739
How do we meet up?

633
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,259
We meet at the dock tomorrow morning.

634
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,500
The dock may not be safe, either.

635
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,739
Those officers

636
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,140
can no longer ensure our safety.

637
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,140
We'll meet at the station.

638
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,500
See you tomorrow.

639
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,940
You must be careful!

640
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,699
Remember,

641
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,420
if you don't find me at the station,

642
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,140
just go. Don't wait for me.

643
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,020
But...

644
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,859
No "but"!

645
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:04,779
It's agreed.

646
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,779
Mr. Sun once said

647
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,580
with four hundred million compatriots

648
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:12,819
and tens of thousands of miles of land,

649
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:15,020
surely one can strive to be mighty

650
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,980
and unrivaled in the world.

651
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:18,819
Everything we do today,

652
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:20,219
even if it means sacrifice,

653
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:21,779
history will remember.

654
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:24,339
No matter what the outcome,

655
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,739
I give thanks on behalf of all comrades

656
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:28,620
to you.

657
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,819
Tan Xian is about to run!

658
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:40,299
Catch him!

659
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:46,859
Move!

660
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:47,940
Capture Tan Xian!

661
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,900
Hurry up!

662
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:50,659
Quickly.

663
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,580
Who?

664
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:09,659
It's the waiter, sir.

665
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:13,100
What do you want?

666
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:15,299
I'm delivering your meal.

667
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:19,219
Delivering a meal? What meal?

668
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,819
I didn't order anything at all.

669
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:21,580
What meal?

670
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:23,859
Sir,

671
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,540
your friend placed the order for you.

672
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:30,140
Take it away. I'm not hungry.

673
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:33,020
Sir,

674
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:34,819
your friend has already paid for it.

675
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,739
I said I'm not hungry.

676
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,460
Take it away.

677
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:44,739
Sir,

678
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:47,259
then I'll leave the tray outside.

679
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,299
You can take it in when you want to eat.
