He shall be executed.

(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
I know I shouldn't beat you
when you're injured.

6
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,759
But I am also injured.

7
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:55,759
Moreover,

8
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,039
when you killed Zhuo Bufan,

9
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,039
his injuries were much more severe
than yours.

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,039
Unless

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,519
you kill me today,

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,159
I'm going

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,840
to capture you.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,799
You can't die.

15
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,400
I still want your Dharma Seal.

16
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,319
Do you think I have the seal?

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
I really don't have it.

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,264
Good.

19
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,480
Great.

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,439
There is no Dharma Seal in this world.

21
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,920
You'll never get the secret treasure.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,079
Those rebels from the Tongmenghui

23
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,200
also won't get it.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,000
Heaven bless the court.

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,319
Heaven bless the court.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,599
I haven't told you yet.

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,840
Wang Jialuo.

28
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,599
You have the seal.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You are the seal.

Yes.

35
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,424
Well...

36
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,600
If even this cannot be tolerated,

37
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,279
can it be called Buddha?

38
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,519
Thank you, abbot.

39
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,319
May you endure hardships and bitterness

40
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,920
for your revolution.

41
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,519
May you fail soon

42
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,680
for the Qing Dynasty you serve loyally.

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,519
I wish you lose everything

44
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,279
due to the revolution.

45
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,959
I wish the court you so staunchly defend
meets its end in the revolution.

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,279
We said it while drinking.

47
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,399
Why did you take it seriously?

48
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,720
You are really something.

49
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,800
You're shot by a bullet

50
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,759
through your body.

51
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,720
Yet you stayed quiet,

52
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,279
driving all the way here.

53
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,680
Such a long ride.

54
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,120
It's so bumpy.

55
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,959
You really have a high pain tolerance.

56
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,399
I truly believe

57
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,680
you can definitely endure torture

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,319
while talking about your revolution.

59
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,399
Liu Lin.

60
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,839
Don't worry.

61
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
When you come back,

62
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,600
this country will
become what you wish it to be.

63
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,240
It will

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,279
become better than you wish.

65
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,040
By then, the nation will be so powerful
that no one will dare to challenge it.

66
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,600
The Forbidden City will be open
to the public.

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,040
So will the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

68
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,959
The common people can visit it.

69
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,040
If I'm still around,

70
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,879
I'll take you to eat delicious food

71
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,199
and to visit fun places.

72
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,560
I'll make you happy,

73
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,199
and you won't have to
risk your life anymore.

74
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,040
I didn't expect you to drive so well.

75
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,920
I almost forgot.

76
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,240
You used to like foreign gadgets.

77
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,920
Back when you were in the palace,

78
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,319
you just rided bicycles.

79
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,959
One has to

80
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,519
learn advanced things.

81
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:08,839
Yes.

82
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:11,959
Muqing.

83
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,319
Let me teach you how to drive.

84
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay.

85
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,600
Is it dangerous for you to do this task?

86
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,839
No.

87
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,360
I will just send a telegram.

88
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,319
There's no danger in that.

89
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,800
And you?

90
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,200
What else do you have to do?

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,639
I...

92
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,639
There is one thing

93
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,000
I must do.

00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,904
(Telegraph Office)

95
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,159
Remember this, both of you.

96
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,240
Phone number?

97
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,120
Telegram.

98
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,720
The station of Beiyang Army

99
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,480
has telegraphs, right?

100
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,879
Yes.

101
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,279
That's good.

102
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,399
If anything happens to me,

103
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,720
send a telegram.

104
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,320
It's sent to Hong Kong.

105
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,159
Our people are there.

106
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,480
He will pass it to my master.

107
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,960
My master will know what to do.

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,799
What will happen to you?

109
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,120
Nothing.

110
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,399
Comrades.

111
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,559
Though I'm particularly afraid of death,

112
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,600
we are indeed risking our lives, right?

113
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,600
Don't be discouraged.

114
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
All of us will be safe.

115
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,559
We must be alive.

116
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,159
Alright.

117
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,039
We do what you said.

118
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,879
Yes, princess.

(Telegraph Office)

120
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Load the bullets in here.

121
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,879
Then close the magazine.

122
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,720
Pull the bolt to fire.

123
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,240
Pull the bolt again after each shot.

124
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,200
Put the gunstock against your shoulder.

125
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,240
Near your face.

126
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
Aim with one eye.

127
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,120
When you're aiming,

128
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,679
the notch at the back

129
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,519
should align with the front sight.

130
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,639
The three points form a straight line.

131
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,519
If the distance is far,

132
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,559
aim a bit above the target.

133
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,360
The further away, the higher you lift.

134
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,480
As to how much to lift,

135
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,559
you need to practice more
to get the feel.

136
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,120
All your teeth have been knocked out.

137
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
And you can still talk.

138
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,320
So annoying.

139
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,759
Where did I hit?

140
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,679
I was aiming at her mouth.

141
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,799
Did I hit her mouth?

142
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,399
It seems

143
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,120
I will have to practice more.

144
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,159
This thing is powerful.

145
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,000
If a martial artist
who has practiced kung fu for decades

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,559
meets a guy who doesn't know kung fu

147
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,519
but knows how to use a gun,

148
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,672
the martial artist won't win.

149
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,720
The world has changed.

150
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,639
If I don't learn this,

151
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,320
I will be beaten in the future.

152
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,679
Lucky.

153
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,759
Today isn't a lucky day.

154
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,840
Father.

155
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,720
What are you doing?

156
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,919
A major event is upon us.

157
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,399
The Beiyang Army should have sent troops
as agreed.

158
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,399
They suddenly changed their minds.

159
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,000
You already knew it?

160
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,200
Zhong Haichao.

161
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,720
In the end, you chose Beiyang Army

162
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,320
and betrayed me.

163
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,519
Was it ten years

164
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,960
or eleven years?

165
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,080
Ever since you just
joined the Beiyang Army,

166
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,799
I have been paving the way for you.

167
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,000
Your military rank has been rising
year by year.

168
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,759
Your actual power
has been increasing annually.

169
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I promoted you to a position
of great power.

170
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,279
Now, you are fully-fledged.

171
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,960
And you don't need me anymore

172
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
and are unwilling to yield to others,

173
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,296
right?

174
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,360
So,

175
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,919
you betrayed me.

176
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,960
Father.

177
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,720
It sounds inappropriate.

178
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,919
Indeed,

179
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,320
I am aware that Beiyang Army
won't send troops tomorrow.

180
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,120
But it's not something I can control.

181
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,759
Of course, it's not.

182
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,480
But you did not tell me earlier.

183
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,519
Father.

184
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,519
Don't tell me

185
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,919
that you found out
after you were in Fujian.

186
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,480
Betrayal.

187
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
It's a betrayal.

188
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,240
Your Highness.

189
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,000
When you chose me as your son-in-law,

190
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,759
you must have already anticipated this.

191
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,639
You chose me

192
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,679
because of my wisdom and ability.

193
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,080
A truly intelligent person

194
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,159
can't make the wrong choices.

195
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,200
A truly capable person

196
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,080
can't be controlled by others.

197
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:27,759
I admit

198
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,159
that you have cultivated me
over the years.

199
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,840
But if I were an incompetent person,

200
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,679
I'm afraid
you would have already discarded me.

201
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,559
A young man should stay ambitious

202
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,919
instead of complaining when in trouble.

203
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,840
Besides, over these years,

204
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,120
I have worked so hard
without any defiance.

205
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,360
But you have always been wary of me.

206
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,679
Just like this time,

207
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,360
if the Beiyang Army had not noticed it,

208
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,080
I probably wouldn't have known

209
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,600
that you ordered the Rongtian Ridge
to secretly search for treasure.

210
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,399
Oh, right.

211
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,000
You haven't told me yet

212
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,759
that you also have worked
with the Japanese military.

213
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,799
You seem to know quite a bit.

214
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,799
You would rather trust the Japanese

215
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,679
than the Beiyang Army.

216
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,879
If I'm against foreign intruders,

217
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,799
I will trust the Beiyang Army.

218
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
But if I'm against rebels,

219
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,639
foreigners are more reliable.

220
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:30,639
So,

221
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,799
the Qing Imperial Court
established the Beiyang Army,

222
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,600
but it could never control it.

223
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,720
And by the same logic,

224
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,679
the court doesn't trust Beiyang Army,

225
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,799
just like you don't trust me.

226
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,399
You are ungrateful.

227
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,480
You think you're right?

228
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,360
It's not that I'm ungrateful.

229
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,279
You're too wary.

230
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,240
It's not that Beiyang Army
is ungrateful.

231
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,480
The Qing Imperial Court is too feeble.

232
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,039
Your wariness and the court's weakness

233
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,519
make me and Beiyang Army feel hopeless.

234
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,960
Your Highness.

235
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,360
Today,

236
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,480
do you really think
you can make me believe

237
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,359
that you can turn the situation around?

238
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,160
Right.

239
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,000
At this point,

240
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,440
I indeed have no way to change anything.

241
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,480
But the dignity of the imperial family

242
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,799
cannot be insulted.

243
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
No one insults you.

244
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,759
At this point,

245
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,319
you're humiliating yourself.

246
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,200
So is the court.

247
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,720
It sticks to its old ways,

248
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,799
so it's humiliated by the great powers.

249
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,000
What do you think you are?

250
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,680
You're nothing but a dog.

251
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,279
I fail to tame you.

252
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,920
But the Beiyang Army fails too.

253
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,640
Haichao.

254
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,680
Stop!

255
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,799
Let her stay.

256
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,119
Spare her life.

257
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,319
Let her see the future world.

258
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,319
Do what the princess said.

259
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,079
Don't kill her.

260
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,720
Take her away.

261
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,920
Go.

262
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,240
Go.

263
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,119
I killed Zhong Haichao.

264
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't hate me?

265
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,319
When you made me marry Zhong Haichao,

266
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,119
I hated you then.

267
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
You are my daughter,

268
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,359
not a child from an ordinary family.

269
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,880
Born in an imperial family,

270
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,680
you have no choice.

271
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,279
You know my position.

272
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,319
And you should know the wishes
I want to fulfill.

273
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,920
You're a sensible girl

274
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,319
and can see the bigger picture.

275
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,400
Father.

276
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,839
You let me see the bigger picture?

277
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,839
It means you're unreasonable,

278
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,079
but you still push me.

279
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,119
I hate you

280
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,000
not because you forced me
to marry someone I didn't want to,

281
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,400
but because you forced me,

282
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,319
and you still pretended
to do it all for me.

283
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,960
Is it all for me?

284
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
You did it all for your wishes.

285
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:42,599
Or you did it all

286
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
for your desires.

287
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,359
You've grown up.

288
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,519
You have your own thoughts.

289
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,480
But your thinking is still not mature.

290
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,960
Idealism is wonderful,

291
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,160
but too unrealistic.

292
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,119
And it can't bear much weight.

293
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,640
Well,

294
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,200
if you can understand

295
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,920
how heavy the burden on my shoulders is,

296
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,839
I believe you will understand me.

297
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,880
Indeed, I can't understand

298
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,200
your thirst for power.

299
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,799
Alright.

300
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,119
I won't talk about it with you anymore.

301
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,079
Oh, right.

302
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
I know

303
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,160
you still have feelings
for Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

304
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,039
After returning to the capital,
you two get married.

305
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,359
Although he is not willing to follow me,

306
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,440
I am willing to accept him
as my son-in-law.

307
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,480
You just said I've grown up.

308
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:53,799
Yes.

309
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,720
I've grown up.

310
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,079
So, I don't need your approval

311
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
of my marriage.

312
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,240
Muqing can marry me

313
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,039
without your approval.

314
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,152
(The ninth day of the fifth month,
3th year of Xuantong era)

315
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:44,832
(two days before Mangzhong)

316
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,920
You're awake.

317
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,319
Where am I?

318
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,799
You're on the sea.

319
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,880
We're waiting for people.

320
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,119
Who?

321
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,000
Men Sandao.

322
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,039
Do you really betray the court?

323
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,400
Haven't I already told you before?

324
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
What about the Dharma Seal?

325
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,160
You got it?

326
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,240
Do you remember the day

327
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,319
when Liu Lin and I

328
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,880
could enter the Futu Temple
but you couldn't?

329
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,519
Liu Lin saw the letter left
by my master.

330
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,759
In 1851, Prajna, Bodhi,

331
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,640
and Dharma met for the thirty-year pact.

332
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,839
But the chief of Disciplinary Department
didn't appear.

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,519
So the three chiefs made a deal.

334
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,000
To avoid accidents,

335
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
they tattooed their respective patterns

336
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,079
on their disciples' bodies

337
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,359
to pass them down.

338
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:56,839
Wang Jialuo.

339
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,480
The Dharma Seal has been on you.

340
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,359
What about Lin Haohan?

341
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
He is Prajna's inheritor.

342
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,039
Though Lin Haohan has died,

343
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,519
Prajna's inheritors are about to arrive.

344
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,440
We are here

345
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,880
waiting for them.

346
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,480
The chief of the Prajna Hall
spread revolutionary ideas overseas.

347
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,559
He has many disciples.

348
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,079
Each of them

349
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,440
bears the Prajna Seal.

350
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,200
Hi, thank you for coming.

351
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,759
Hello.

352
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,680
Hello.

353
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,704
Hello.

354
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,079
I have already copied the tattoo on you.

355
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,400
Again,

356
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,400
I admire you.

357
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,839
Join us.

358
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,480
If you want to talk,

359
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,799
I'll talk to you about the revolution.

360
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,880
At first,
you may be reluctant to listen.

361
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,319
If you listen more,

362
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,920
you will gradually accept it.

363
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,960
I'd rather die.

364
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,160
Men Sandao.

365
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,359
Let's fight.

366
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,759
Why?

367
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,160
You haven't eaten for days.

368
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,240
You can't even stand steady.

369
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,559
Can you be my opponent?

370
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,279
Let's fight.

371
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,359
Alright.

372
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,359
Let's see what you can do.

373
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm telling you.

374
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,039
I'm not in a hurry.

375
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:06,839
I can wait.

376
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,839
I can gradually influence you.

377
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,720
When I'm tired,

378
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,759
I will tie you up

379
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,119
and throw you into the Futu Temple.

380
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,160
After some years,

381
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,359
you will understand

382
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,519
why we need a revolution

383
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,839
and why we must change the nation.

384
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,839
The ancients have made it clear.

385
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,799
Once rules are established,

386
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
why should they be changed?

387
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,200
I do my best to chase the criminal

388
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,839
not only to uphold the law
and regulations

389
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,039
but also to motivate myself.

390
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,559
I, Wang Jialuo,

391
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,880
fail the court.

392
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,440
(A nation needs a ruler.)

393
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,480
I let down the people.

394
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,519
(A court needs rules.)

395
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,079
I fail the emperor.

396
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,952
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
The law needs to be upheld.

397
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,799
I fail to fulfill my duty.

398
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,079
(A minister cannot be
without integrity.)

399
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,640
Do I have a reason

400
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,279
to live in this world?

401
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,279
Wang Jialuo.

402
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,680
Can you read it?

403
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,400
Lin Haohan has told me the way

404
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,319
to decode the seal.

405
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,359
The Discipline Seal appears
like mountains and waters.

406
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,960
In fact, it refers to Mount Huangmei

407
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
and Caoxi.

408
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,000
The Dharma Seal is a field of reeds,

409
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,599
suggesting the story
of crossing the river by a reed.

410
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,599
Therefore, the message conveyed
by the seal

411
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,640
is two places, Guangzhou

412
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,240
and Songshan Shaolin Temple.

413
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,480
The Bodhi Seal signifies the starting
and ending points of the treasure.

414
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,880
Tianzhu is the starting point.

415
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,640
And the Southern Shaolin burnt down
300 years ago

416
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,720
is the end.

417
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,640
Therefore, the three seals

418
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,799
indicate six locations.

419
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,759
Tianzhu,

420
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:03,880
Southern Shaolin,

421
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,200
Guangzhou,

422
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Songshan Shaolin Temple,

423
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,079
Mount Huangmei,

424
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
and Baolin Temple of Caoxi.

425
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,319
The Prajna Seal is an amulet,

426
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,640
implying guardianship.

427
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,599
So the central point
of the six locations...

428
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,160
Tianzhu and Baolin Temple of Caoxi,

429
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,599
Songshan Shaolin Temple
and Southern Shaolin,

430
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,640
Mount Huangmei and Southern Shaolin,

431
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,160
Baolin Temple of Caoxi
and Southern Shaolin.

432
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,200
So, that's how this works.

433
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,079
Here.

434
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,079
Master asked us to guard this place.

435
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
I never thought

436
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,559
that we'd been guarding the entrance

437
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,720
to the Altar Treasure.

438
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,960
It's been guarded for generations.

439
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,240
What we've been guarding
is the secret treasure.

440
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:57,984
(The 11th day of the 5th month,

I'm fine.

00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
You don't write anymore?

486
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:29,880
No, I don't.

487

Anyway, no one sees them.

488
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,840

No, I will not.

You don't write.

492
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,960
I can understand.

493
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,679
Two more gravestones.

494
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:21,639
No.

495
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,960
One is for Zhuo Bufan.

496
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,719
The other is for Wang Jialuo.

497
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,360
Without them,

498
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,480
we wouldn't have the chance
to open the Altar Treasure.

499
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,440
The number of tombstones

500
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,360
doesn't matter.

501
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,000
So many have died.

502
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,360
We don't even know who they are.

503
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,928
By the way,

504
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,039
where are you two heading next?

505
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,360
Are you returning to the capital?

506
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,856
No.

507
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,760
My place is just a birdcage
made of gold.

508
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,360
I finally flew out of it.

509
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,639
Why do I fly back?

510
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,304
And you?

511
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,719
Before leaving the capital,
I was a fourth-ranked imperial guard.

512
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,280
Now I have become an accomplice
of rebels.

513
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,719
Can I go back?

514
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,559
To be precise,

515
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,239
you are definitely a rebel now.

516
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,400
How can you see yourself
as an accomplice?

517
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,199
Where are we two going?

518
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,480
I'll go to Hong Kong.

519
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,639
Lin Haohan's fellows

520
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,639
are transporting the treasures.

521
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,039
I am responsible for supervising.

522
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,039
If I go with you,

523
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,199
I won't be of much help, right?

524
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,559
You go to Wuchang.

525
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,119
My friends

526
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,639
and comrades are there.

527
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,440
When I come back from Hong Kong,

528
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,559
I will come to find you.

529
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:55,712
Okay.

530
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I will wait for you.

531
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,719
You find a place

532
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,000
for us to stay.

533
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,719
I prefer a western-style house.

534
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,199
Okay.

535
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,519
I will plant flowers in the yard.

536
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,880
Red spider lilies.

537
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,239
Can I go with you?

538
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,320
I'm tired of slaughtering pigs.

539
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,280
I might as well join you
in the revolution.

540
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,039
After all, I'm good at killing beasts.

541
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,159
(December 30, 1911)

542
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,119
Is it especially lively in your place?

543
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,239
It's especially chaotic.

544
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,719
I think everyone is at a loss.

545
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,320
After so many years,

546
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,360
the Wuchang Uprising succeeded.

547
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,039
I'll be at a loss too.

548
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,239
Succeeded?

549
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,960
Isn't it a victory?

550
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,599
I think it is just the beginning.

551
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,440
Now it depends on the power of the army

552
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,360
to change the situation.

553
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,039
This is just one city.

554
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,239
To change a country,

555
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,920
it takes more people to wake up.

556
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,519
Hello?

557
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,159
The revolution in Wuchang will ignite.

558
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,360
I'm not sure if it can spread

559
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,639
throughout the country
or can truly change the nation.

560
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,960
I hope it can.

561
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,280
But given the experiences
over the past years, I think

562
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,320
we have to change

563
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,199
by completely
overthrowing the feudal dynasty.

564
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:27,760
Hello?

565
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:28,639
We can't be timid.

566
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,159
Hello, Muqing?

567
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:29,760
We can't give up.

568
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,320
Muqing.

569
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,480
If you think we have already won,

570
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,840
there will be a harder road ahead.

571
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,760
Anyway,

572
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,079
it's already started.

573
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,760
I believe in this.

574
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
I am willing to go on.

575
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,519
Muqing, what are you saying?

576
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,280
Hello, can you hear me?

577
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,280
I can hear now.

578
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,119
I'm saying the day

579
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,480
when we change the nation

580
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,599
will come.

581
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,800
The day when I marry you

582
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,039
will come too.

583
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,480
Wait for me.

584
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:35,246
(August 29, 1913)

585
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:37,636
(Men Sandao died
in the Second Revolution in Nanjing.)

586
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,726
(October 10, 1926)

587
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:41,296
(Wulan Shan followed the Fourth Army
of the Northern Expedition)

588
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:43,496
(and was shot by a stray bullet
during the general attack in Wuchang,)

589
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:44,960
(and died in Guangzhou one year later.)

590
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,858
(Since they parted in Fujian,
they've never met again)

591
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:59,072
