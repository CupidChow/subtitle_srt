1
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,160
When you asked for leave this afternoon,

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,079
I wrote something for you.

3
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,839
Get killed for stupid stuff.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,440
Get imprisoned for survival.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,320
No traitors can be loyal.

6
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,479
I think you know what I mean.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,119
How heartbreaking.

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,920
Back then, I thought highly of you.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,280
I promoted you, a Han Chinese,
to an imperial guard.

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,359
Later, when you failed
to find the Altar Treasure,

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,400
I gave you a chance and took you in.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Also I've been helping you
hide your identity.

13
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,519
I have treated you well
over these years.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,280
Unexpectedly, you betrayed me.

15
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,840
I employed Zhuo Bufan
to find the Altar Treasure.

16
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,359
At first, I thought you were reliable.

17
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,640
You provided quite a few clues.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,879
But later on,
I sensed something was off.

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,400
In fact, you've been hiding something.

20
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,799
At the critical moment,
you didn't try to help Zhuo Bufan.

21
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,319
Turns out you are using me.

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,719
The chief of the Disciplinary Department
can't fulfill the thirty-year pact,

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,560
so you need me to arrange for someone
to steal the seal from the palace.

24
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,960
I really don't want to ask you why,

25
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,640
but I really can't figure out

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,599
who you're really working for.

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,000
Could someone offer you more than me?

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,520
Those without a strong will
cannot achieve wisdom.

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,639
Those failing to keep their word
cannot succeed.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Jiang Hen, you let me down.

31
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,759
There is no place
for an untrustworthy man.

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,199
I feel guilty, Your Highness.

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,919
But I cannot break my promise
to a friend of mine.

34
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,319
Who is it?

35
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,000
Take him down.

36
00:04:48,920 --> 00:05:02,040
♪The wind sends the geese
across thousands of miles♪

37
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:24,040
♪One can drink in a tall building♪

38
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:58,560
=Heroes=

39
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:02,112
=Episode 26=

40
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,800
Look what I got.

41
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,480
I've quickly found many things
related to the Baohe Shop.

42
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,879
This was the best-selling jade
in the Baohe Shop.

43
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,560
It was very expensive

44
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,040
because the Baohe Shop
concocted a legendary story for it.

45
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,920
If the product involves a legend,

46
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
its price will skyrocket.

47
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,920
This stuff's quality is good,
but there are no inscriptions on it.

48
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,959
I have studied it but found nothing.

49
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,920
This is from the weapon shop
under the Baohe Shop. Look.

50
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,120
It was signed.

51
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,240
Their business is really big.

52
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,399
They even make money from warfare.
Really a role model for us.

53
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,800
However, I couldn't find anything
from this blade.

54
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,199
This is not money.
It's something for commemoration.

55
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,680
It's well made of high-quality material.

56
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,240
However, this thing isn't worth much.

57
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,560
What? You want me out again?

58
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,800
But it's small in quantity,
something of a rarity.

59
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,879
I heard the owner of the Baohe Shop died
when fighting the Japanese invaders.

60
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,879
After his death, 100 copper coins
were specially minted in his memory.

61
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,079
Why mint coins to commemorate him?

62
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,480
That's because he loved money.

63
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,160
This coin has a name, called Ze Ze.

64
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,600
The second Ze is the owner's name.

65
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,360
The first Ze means Chi Ze.
Do you know what it means?

66
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,064
I have to say I'm knowledgeable.

67
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,200
In ancient times, copper coins varied
in weight and thickness.

68
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
Bad merchants filed down thick coins
to make them smaller and thinner.

69
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,559
The filed-off copper
would be recast into new coins.

70
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,679
To prevent this,

71
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,799
Emperor Wu of Han ordered the minting
of coins with a red copper edge.

72
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,720
It's called Chi Ce,
also known as Chi Ze.

73
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,200
Lu You wrote in his poem,
"I don't care about Chi Ze"

74
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,279
"because I have
classic books on my desk."

75
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,120
The Baohe Shop commemorated its owner

76
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,320
with the Chi Ze made of pure gold.

77
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,399
Ze Ze...

78
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,919
It's you.

79
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,639
How did you get injured like this?
Come into my room.

80
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,039
It's too late. I've been poisoned.

81
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,679
The poison has attacked my heart.
I can't hold on much longer.

82
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,480
I'm Jiang Hen, working for Prince Qi.

83
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,360
My job is

84
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:13,399
to help Zhuo Bufan
find the Altar Treasure.

85
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,679
But you once helped me and Wang Jialuo.

86
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,720
Yes, there are three things
I must tell you.

87
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,679
Y-You must remember.

88
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,559
Go ahead. I will remember.

89
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,919
Firstly, I was an imperial guard
like you.

90
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,360
Over 40 years ago,
when I looked for the Altar Treasure,

91
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,600
I captured Su Yunzhi in Shanxi.

92
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,039
Later, I was defeated by Cheng Yu.

93
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,399
But Cheng Yu did not kill me.
Instead, we became good friends.

94
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,000
He has told me many secrets
of the Altar Treasure.

95
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,360
So I have to do something important
for Cheng Yu.

96
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,399
That is, just this year,

97
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,840
I must find four seals
to fulfill the thirty-year pact.

98
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Secondly, the Altar Treasure is guarded
by the chief of the Arhat Hall

99
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,759
with the eighteen Arhats.

100
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,320
To open it, the seals
of the Disciplinary Department,

101
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,279
Dharma Department,
Prajna Hall, and Bodhi Department

102
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,840
are required to know the location.

103
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,759
Since the 40th year of Kangxi,

104
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,320
the four chiefs have met every 30 years

105
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,799
to ensure the safety of the seals.

106
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,559
When fulfilling
the last thirty-year pact,

107
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,960
the chief of the Disciplinary Department
and Dharma Department didn't show up.

108
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,080
Cheng Yu, the Bodhi Department's chief.
After investigation, we found

109
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,759
the Disciplinary Department's inheritor
had turned to the court

110
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,200
and led the people from the Department
to kill the Dharma Department's chief.

111
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,600
The Dharma Department's chief
was missing in the end.

112
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,399
Now, another thirty-year pact
is coming this year.

113
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,200
If the seals cannot be gathered again,

114
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,399
the treasure may not wait
till the next 30 years.

115
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,799
It may forever become a legend.

116
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,240
That's why I've been pushing for it
in secret,

117
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,559
hoping to gather the seals.

118
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,399
You, Wang Jialuo,
and even Zhuo Bufan have clues.

119
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,000
That's why I've been helping you
secretly

120
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,200
in hopes
that the secret treasure may be found.

121
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,519
Now you know about the Baohe Inn.

122
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,480
But you do not know
that the Baohe Inn is just a code word.

123
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,159
It actually refers to an inn
near the original site

124
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,799
of the Southern Shaolin
in Fujian, called Ze Ze Inn.

125
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,760
Baohe Inn, the thirty-year pact,
and Ze Ze Inn. I've remembered.

126
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,559
What is the third thing?

127
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,200
Your master was the third generation
of the Bodhi Department.

128
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Cheng Yu is a great man.

129
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,120
He devoted his life to the future
of the nation and the people.

130
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,480
He left behind clues
to the Altar Treasure.

131
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,440
His wish is

132
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,919
to hand it over to the person

133
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,279
who truly can change the future
of the country and the nation.

134
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,519
That person is not Xuantong
or an Aisin-Gioro.

135
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,639
That person shall be
called "revolution".

136
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,159
Men Sandao,
if you find the Altar Treasure

137
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,279
and hand it over to the court,

138
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,279
Cheng Yu and I will not rest in peace,

139
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,320
nor will those
guarding the secret treasure.

140
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,039
Men Sandao,

141
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,759
don't let us down.

142
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,320
Muqing, we are friends.

143
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,159
I didn't hear what was just said.

144
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
Even if you heard it, it's okay.

145
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,639
Trust me. I will not say
a word to outsiders.

146
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,159
Muqing, you aren't involved
in the revolution, are you?

147
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,519
You're foresighted.

148
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,960
Jiang Hen indeed knows
where the Baohe Inn is.

149
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,559
I really didn't expect him
to tell Men Sandao.

150
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,960
I think he had no choice.

151
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,360
After all, he and Men Sandao
barely knew each other.

152
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,960
As you said, Jiang Hen is familiar
with Men Sandao's master.

153
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,559
But Men Sandao
doesn't know his master well.

154
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,720
Yes, but it's better to tell Men Sandao
than anyone else.

155
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,279
I intended to kill Men Sandao
and took his seal.

156
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,799
Even if Jiang Hen didn't tell him,

157
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,599
I believe he could find
the Baohe Inn's location.

158
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,359
There's one thing I can't understand.
Since Jiang Hen knew everything,

159
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,519
why didn't he tell Wang Jialuo directly
to look for his master?

160
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,799
At first, I didn't understand, either.

161
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,559
But later I thought
Jiang Hen had laid low

162
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,440
for most of his life, waiting for
the thirty-year pact to come.

163
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,559
He must have been preparing
for a long time.

164
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,559
He used me to get the Discipline Seal
from the Wenyuan Pavilion.

165
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,960
Then you went to get the Bodhi Seal.

166
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,839
In fact, he knew
the Dharma Seal was in Tianjin Presidio.

167
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,039
But that man is mentally sick,
and a madman can't keep an appointment.

168
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,160
And his disciple is a stubborn person.

169
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,519
The best way is to get him involved.

170
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
Since he planned it for a long time,

171
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,319
did he think of the involvement
of the Imperial Household Department?

172
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,319
Isn't Men Sandao the key person?

173
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,680
The Wenyuan Pavilion lost stuff,
and then Men Sandao left prison.

174
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,359
He planned it all well.

175
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,160
Without his secret guidance,

176
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,920
Men Sandao and Wang Jialuo
couldn't have made it this far.

177
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,000
But as a result,
they paved the way for you.

178
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,480
No, it's for you.

179
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,200
Are you going to the appointment?

180
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,039
Some days away from the appointed day.
I will go to Jiangnan first

181
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,799
to meet with the descendant
of Disciplinary Department's inheritor.

182
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:33,760
(The 28th day of the 4th month, Xuantong,
12 days away from the Grain in Ear)

183
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,119
Be an adult. Your husband will stay
in Fujian for one or two years.

184
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
You should go with him.

185
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,200
Fujian is a tough place, damp and hot.

186
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,079
The food is different
from that of the capital.

187
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Princess, you should not go and suffer.

188
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,359
Father, I asked her to stay
and accompany you.

189
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,039
She's been spoiled since childhood.
It's okay to have a rough time.

190
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,920
Haichao, come to the study
after you're finished.

191
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,480
Yes.

192
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,319
Excuse me.

193
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,920
The thirty-year pact?

194
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,880
So it's likely that everyone
who holds a seal will appear.

195
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,039
Our judgment is right.

196
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,039
It's the right decision
to take office in Fujian.

197
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,960
You're wise and far-sighted.

198
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,559
You work in Fujian,
so you have a reason for that.

199
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:56,680
You're far away
and don't have to be hesitant.

200
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,000
Understood. I will take care of it.

201
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,279
Zhuo Bufan is too proud.
We cannot fully trust him.

202
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,519
Yu Huanjie is irresponsible,

203
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,039
but the information
he provides is useful.

204
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll have him find you.

205
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,279
You can use him to keep track
of Zhuo Bufan's movements at any time.

206
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,000
What does Yu Huanjie want?

207
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,319
I promised him money and a good future.

208
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,160
Those who love money are simple.

209
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,319
I know what to do now.

210
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,680
Remember to keep an eye on Men Sandao.

211
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,680
Yes, no worries, Father.

212
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,240
Fujian again.

213
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,680
Yes, can't avoid making another trip.

214
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,039
Are you going with me?

215
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,039
Zhuo Bufan will surely go too, right?

216
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Absolutely.

217
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,920
It's quite funny.

218
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,799
Zhuo Bufan, you and I,
each of us has one seal.

219
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,000
The three of us are fake.

220
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,880
Yet, we await a Prajna inheritor
who has never been found or appeared.

221
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,559
Do you think that person will show up?

222
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,920
Do you think I'm a fortune teller?

223
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,799
Jialuo, we've been working together
for a few days.

224
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,039
Why don't you show me your seal?

225
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,880
Show me yours first.

226
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't have it on me.

227
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,759
Me neither.

228
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,336
I have a house and work here.

229
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,279
Wherever I place the seal,
it is safe and reasonable.

230
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,480
Do you have anything in the capital?
Do you have a residence?

231
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,720
If not on you,
where else can you put it?

232
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,359
For safety, let's wait
until we collect the four seals.

233
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,319
Is it unsafe to show it to me?

234
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,000
Leave our collaborative relationship
on one side.

235
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,839
I'm an imperial guard solely responsible
for finding the Altar Treasure.

236
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,920
You should cooperate with me.

237
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,720
You're right. The official letter?

238
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
Here we go again.

239
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
Unluckily for you, I actually have it.

240
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,200
Take a good look at it.

241
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,880
(Official Letter)

242
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Yes, it's from the Ministry of Justice
and the Imperial Household Department.

243
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,880
(The investigation of the case)
"Every local yamen obeys your command."

244
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,599
Alright, take out the seal.

245
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,440
No, I can't. Don't forget
I also work for the 43rd Association.

246
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,799
Apart from the Ministry of Justice
and the Imperial Household Department,

247
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,240
you need an official letter
from the Beiyang.

248
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,376
You...

249
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Wang Jialuo, this is your so-called open
and honest talk?

250
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,079
Alright, keep your seal.
I won't look anymore.

251
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,960
Muqing.

252
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,519
Please don't be angry.

253
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,440
Greetings, General.

254
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,799
I'm from the Beiyang Army.
Don't kneel. Get up.

255
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,279
Thank you, General.
His Highness has told me

256
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,680
to report directly to you
if anything happens in Fujian.

257
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,400
Once you are in Fujian,
you will be within my jurisdiction.

258
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:42,519
That's great.

259
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,839
However, you keep it from Zhuo Bufan.

260
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,240
I'm afraid he will become complacent
and not actively look for the treasure.

261
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,920
Understood.

262
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,839
Yu Huanjie, you are a smart man.

263
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,839
You don't need me
to explain further, right?

264
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,160
Rest assured.
If Zhuo Bufan gets any news,

265
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,319
I'll report to you as soon as possible.

266
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,599
Compared with the Beiyang,
the imperial yamen means nothing.

267
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,119
Throughout the whole nation,
no one can fight against Beiyang.

268
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,119
Yes, you're right.

269
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,480
No one can be against the Beiyang, so...

270
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,680
I'll report to you about any news.

271
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,359
In Fujian, I won't have time
to report back to Prince Qi.

272
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,680
So I can only report to you.

273
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,160
Very clever.

274
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,200
You deserve to have the money.

275
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,279
As for the future, Beiyang's future
means the nation's future.

276
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,200
Yes, I understand.

277
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,599
No one is stronger than Beiyang.
I'm at your service.

278
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,440
Zhuo Bufan indeed works for my father.

279
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,079
Zhong Haichao goes to Fujian
for the Altar Treasure.

280
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,319
Things between them are not that simple.

281
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,480
I think
they both have different motives.

282
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,480
I have an idea.

283
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,920
I think I should go to Fujian
with Zhong Haichao.

284
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:51,880
Why?

285
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,599
When he takes office elsewhere,
I should go with him.

286
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,839
Initially, I did not want to see him.

287
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
But now, I have important things to do.

288
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,640
Who else could obtain more information
from him than me?

289
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,359
Muqing will definitely go, right?

290
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,039
Certainly.

291
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,480
He will take you with him, right?

292
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Definitely.

293
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,000
So, you all are going.

294
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,680
I can't stay alone in the capital.

295
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,039
Once in Fujian, if I discover anything,
I could find a way to tell you.

296
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,039
It would be easier than telling Muqing.

297
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,839
What?

298
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,799
This is very dangerous.

299
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,240
You are willing to do it,
and I respect you.

300
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,880
Compared to you, I'm safer.

301
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,640
What danger do I have?

302
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,279
Even in Fujian, I am still a princess
and the wife of a Beiyang general.

303
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,480
You are in much more danger than me.

304
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,240
What is this? A reed?

305
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,200
It does make sense.
Crossing the river in a reed.

306
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,000
It makes sense for the Dharma inheritor
to use this as a sect's mark.

307
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,519
So no information?

308
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
Send the picture back to headquarters.

309
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,872
Find someone who knows Buddhism
to take a look at this.

310
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,960
Yes.

311
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:17,160
Won't Wang Jialuo be suspicious
if you're out?

312
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,119
Women always need to buy some rouge.

313
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,240
Go get some for Anjing.

314
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,359
Zhuo Bufan will go to Jiangnan to find
Disciplinary inheritor's descendants.

315
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,400
Do you want him to go?

316
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,792
He is capable.
Once he knows, we'll know too.

317
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,039
Yes.

318
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,279
If my guess is not wrong,

319
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,640
Zhuo Bufan must have gone
to check Baohe Inn.

320
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,240
That's right.
Wang Jialuo didn't find out.

321
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,799
However, Men Sandao will tell him
if he finds out.

322
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,480
What if Men Sandao can't find it
but Zhuo Bufan does?

323
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,079
Understood.

324
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,400
Can this still be used?

325
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,920
I was really freaked out.

326
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,559
What happened? Did something happen?

327
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,759
I ran into people from Rongtian Ridge
while I was shopping.

328
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,039
Rongtian Ridge? Where?

329
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,160
Right next to the grocery store.

330
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,960
When I came out after shopping,

331
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,920
I ran into two people
from Rongtian Ridge.

332
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,200
I almost bumped into them.
My stuff dropped and broke.

333
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,559
Luckily, they did not recognize me.

334
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,200
It's good that you are safe.
Did you see where they went?

335
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,200
I didn't. I didn't dare to follow them.

336
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,279
But I overheard that they were heading
to Jiangnan to find someone.

337
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,720
Jiangnan? Looking for whom?

338
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,960
I don't know. I heard

339
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,400
that they would go back to the inn
after shopping.

340
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
It should be somewhere
not far from here.

341
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,079
But I don't know the details.

342
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,440
I was too scared to follow them.

343
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,079
You must not follow them.

344
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,000
Remember, if you encounter them again,

345
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,640
you must avoid them, understood?

346
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,799
I know. It scared me.

347
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,680
Don't be afraid. You're safe now.

348
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,440
Have some tea.

349
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,839
Why don't you wear the ring
I bought you?

350
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,920
This is the first ring
I've ever received.

351
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
And it's the most important gift
in my life.

352
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,880
I don't wear it
for fear of scratching it.

353
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,039
Wear it if you want to.

354
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,079
I do want to wear it, of course.

355
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,079
When you're done with your business,
I'll go to Dagu with you and wear it.

356
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:23,640
Okay, stay in the room.
I'll go look for that inn.

357
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,680
Once in Fujian,
I will closely monitor Zhong Haichao.

358
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,880
If I can learn the information
about the Altar Treasure,

359
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,200
I'll find a way to tell you.

360
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,440
But how?

361
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:40,288
If I leave,

362
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,319
Muqing will confine you.

363
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,240
Can I tell him?

364
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,960
After all, he's still the court's hound.

365
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,640
How about I tell him
to let you stay with me?

366
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,960
He will definitely not agree.

367
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,640
What should we do?

368
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,480
If I discover anything,

369
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,000
I'll go back to the capital
and find you.

370
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,240
Muqing has no reason
to prevent me from seeing you.

371
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,839
But you must be extra careful.

372
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,000
You must not do anything dangerous
to get information.

373
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,079
No, I won't.

374
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,319
What danger could I be in?
I will only eavesdrop.

375
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,039
Even if someone discovers me,
who would dare to arrest me?

376
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,039
If you're in danger and have no way out,
come to my father.

377
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,640
Just say you're my classmate.
I will explain it to my father.

378
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,519
Although my dad is not a good person,
he does dote on me.

379
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,640
He will take care of my classmates.

380
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,799
Remember that.

381
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,720
Got it.

382
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,839
Have you found them?

383
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,799
Yes. They just left the inn.

384
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,359
But I've found out where they're headed.

385
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,720
Are they going to Fujian?

386
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,240
The inn's worker said
they went to Jiangnan.

387
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,880
I guess Zhuo Bufan
must have found new clues.

388
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
So will you go after them?

389
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Yes, even though I will eventually
encounter Zhuo Bufan in Fujian,

390
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,799
I still want to get more clues.

391
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:32,039
After all, Men Sandao will find out
that I don't have the Dharma Seal.

392
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,920
I need more chips.

393
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,119
Then I...

394
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,079
I'll take you with me.

395
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,319
But promise me.
When I'm pursuing Zhuo Bufan,

396
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,240
you must stay in a safe place
and wait for me.

397
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,279
Okay, I'll pack up quickly.

398
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:18,119
♪I'm picking the right one for me♪

399
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,039
Are you from Yangzhou?

400
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,960
I went to Yangzhou at the age of ten
and learned skills at Yunji School.

401
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,880
Later, I was sold to the capital
and met you.

402
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,519
What did you learn?

403
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,840
Playing musical instruments, painting,
calligraphy, poems, reading,

404
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,679
playing backgammon, and dominoes.

405
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,840
You're a first-class girl.

406
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
Others also learn them.

407
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,840
It's different. The second-class girls
can read a little.

408
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,800
The third-class girls can't read at all.

409
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,400
They just learn to make pastries
and do some needlework.

410
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,880
And those who can sing
can be considered as fine ones.

411
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,920
Yes, we learn singing.
If I don't sing well, I'll be punished.

412
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:15,079
There are four kinds of good singers.

413
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,950
Datong's women, Taishan's maidens,

414
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,679
Yangzhou's hookers,
and Hangzhou's boat girls.

415
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,960
I have heard it from others.

416
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,000
Those who sing well
tend to have a better fate.

417
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,559
So are you a good singer?

418
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,119
Anyway, I am lucky.

419
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,280
But the current nation has changed.

420
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,440
In the past,
you could never leave Yangzhou.

421
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,119
Where is your hometown?

422
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,800
Western Hunan. My family was poor,
so they sold me to Yangzhou.

423
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,440
Do you have any families?
Do you want to go back?

424
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,079
Forget it. They abandoned me.
Why would I go back?

425
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,599
Besides, my home is far away.

426
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,239
I don't even know how to get back.

427
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,039
It's not far.
I'll be transferred to Fujian.

428
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,480
It'll be closer
from Fujian to your home.

429
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,679
General, are you leaving?

430
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,719
I'm not leaving alone.
I am taking you with me.

431
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,280
My wife is not going to Fujian with me.

432
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,280
She won't come to bother me
in the next year or two.

433
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,599
I won't have to see my father-in-law.

434
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
I will cook for you.

435
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,239
Wherever I go, I'm the General
with people to serve me.

436
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,840
Do I need you to cook for me?

437
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,039
You take care of your delicate hands.

438
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,960
Don't let them get rough.

439
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,440
When do we leave then?

440
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,599
Tomorrow morning.
I have to go back later.

441
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:01,320
I have to put on appearances
at home tonight.

442
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,000
It's so urgent? I should hurry and pack.

443
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,199
No need. We'll buy what we need.

444
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,559
Everything will be well arranged
in Fujian.

445
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,880
(Revolutionary Army)
Can I take this book with me?

446
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,559
(Revolutionary Army)
It's a banned book written by rebels.

447
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:26,119
You seem quite addicted to it.
Take it with you.

448
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:34,336
Great! That's very thoughtful of you.

449
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,440
But Fujian is poor and tough.

450
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,480
The living conditions are worse
than those in the capital.

451
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
How can I let you suffer?

452
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
Do you think I can't endure it?

453
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,320
I think I can. I'd like to visit Fujian.

454
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,592
What's there to see in a poor place?

455
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,760
Fujian is hot and humid,
with lots of mosquitoes and miasma.

456
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,119
If I go to the rich land of Jiangnan,
I'll beg you to go.

457
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,320
You don't want me to go, do you?

458
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,519
Yes, I hope we can stay together.

459
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,079
I just fear that you will suffer.

460
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,239
No, I won't.

461
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,320
But I think you will.

462
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,440
How could I? You're working in Fujian,
not going to war.

463
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,000
You won't be living in military tents
in the wilderness, right?

464
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,039
Quanzhou has always been a major port.
I hear it's very prosperous.

465
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,760
Even so,
it can't compare to the capital.

466
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,840
Alright, Haichao,
I know you care for Wulan Shan.

467
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,480
But as your wife,
she should go with you.

468
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:36,079
Otherwise, people will say
the princess is spoiled.

469
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,840
You're right.

470
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,960
I told her not to be so willful.
She should go with you.

471
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,800
She figured it out herself.

472
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,320
She had packed up before you returned.

473
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,679
I fear she can't adapt to the life
in Fujian.

474
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,920
What are you doing here?

475
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,840
Today I have to hand her back to you.

476
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,639
You're going to Fujian?

477
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,599
When are you leaving?

478
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,280
Tomorrow.

479
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,440
If Liu Lin is willing to,
she can continue to live in my house.

480
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,440
You're busy, and people
in my house can take care of her.

481
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,880
No need. I can't trouble you anymore.

482
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,840
It's no trouble at all.

483
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:55,880
This is for you.

484
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,880
It's the fragrance of rosa rubus.

485
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,800
Haven't made it for a while.
I dried some when I was free.

486
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:15,159
Fujian produces daffodils.
When I'm free,

487
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,880
I can try making new stuff.

488
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,039
I won't ask when you will return.

489
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,000
I'll go to Quanzhou soon for business.

490
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,639
You're also going to Fujian?

491
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,159
Yes.

492
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,800
Great, if possible,
take Liu Lin with you.

493
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,760
She can come to see me.

494
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,039
Yes, take me with you, cousin.

495
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
Alright, cousin.

496
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,079
I want to talk to your cousin
before leaving. Talks between women.

497
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,800
Okay, I'll leave you to chat.

498
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,800
He's going to Quanzhou.

499
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,280
It must have to do
with the secret treasure.

500
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,519
He will surely take me with him.

501
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,719
Once in Fujian,
we'll have a chance to meet.

502
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,000
If I can't come to you,
I'll have someone look for you.

503
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,280
I'll send you a message.

504
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,199
Remember, if someone finds you
with this ring,

505
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,559
that will be the person I send.

506
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:36,639
You must be careful.

507
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,119
I know.

508
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,440
Mr. Mu has been guarding me
because of the secret of the Bodhi Seal.

509
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,719
Only I know the secret.

510
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:48,679
I know.

511
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,400
I'm telling you this secret.
You don't need to overthink it.

512
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,119
If anything happens to me,
