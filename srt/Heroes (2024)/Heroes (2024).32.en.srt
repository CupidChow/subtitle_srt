1
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,359
What is this for?

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,359
It's quite scary.

3
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,640
Guys,

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
you don't look like
you're welcoming me back.

5
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,560
Retreat!

6
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,640
Let's go.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,920
Muqing,

8
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,280
what are you doing?

9
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,239
Waiting for someone?

10
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,200
Be gentle.

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,879
My clothing is expensive.

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,920
Bro.

13
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,400
Sir. My lord.

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,799
Don't kill me. I am one of your people.

15
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,439
Shut up.

16
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,560
Okay, I will.

17
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,280
From now on, I ask, and you answer.

18
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,239
If you answer wrongly
or to my dissatisfaction,

19
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,079
you will die.

20
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,719
Can you not do this, please?

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,640
How would I know what would satisfy you?

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,000
I didn't want to suspect you.

23
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,000
But now I have no choice
but to suspect you.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,280
Who exactly are you?

25
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:57,239
I-I'm Lin Haohan.

26
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,959
It means my heart is like a vast forest.

27
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm Lucky.

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,599
It means good luck.

29
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,959
I deal in antiques overseas.

30
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,200
Tell me something I don't know.

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,760
What else can I say?

32
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,159
Since we met each other,

33
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,759
have we not always been inseparable?

34
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,360
Yes. There was a separation in between.

35
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,919
But that was a brief parting

36
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,120
for the sake of reunion.

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,960
I let you go.

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,159
Why did you come back?

39
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,879
Didn't you ask me to find ancient coins?

40
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,039
I found some.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
If I hadn't come back for you,

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,319
what else could I do?

43
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,439
If I headed straight back

44
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,400
to the capital,

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,560
wouldn't you ask me

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
why I ran?

47
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,800
You were aware of how dangerous it was

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
on the sixth day.

49
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,400
Why did you come back to take the risk?

50
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,319
We agreed to share the spoils together.

51
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,759
Why wouldn't I come back?

52
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,719
I do have a ten percent share.

53
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,199
Besides,

54
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,319
for the 30-year pact,

55
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,120
you're the one
who will fulfill it, not me.

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,439
The risk is yours, not mine.

57
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,639
In Ze Ze Inn,

58
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,039
whether it's my people,

59
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,240
Mr. Wang's people,

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
or Zhuo Bufan's people,

61
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,080
they're all waiting
for the Prajna inheritor.

62
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,120
What does that mean?

63
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,919
The Prajna inheritor?

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,960
Me?

65
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,840
If I were the Prajna inheritor,

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,439
could I just ask you for one-tenth?

67
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,000
I would ask for at least thirty percent.

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,199
I wish I were the inheritor of Prajna.

69
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,800
If I were the Prajna inheritor,

70
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,280
things would be simple.

71
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,879
For the 30-year pact,

72
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll just sit down.

73
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
No, I'll kneel down over there.

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,439
Gentlemen,

75
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,639
you go ahead and fight over it.

76
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,400
Whoever wins the fight,
I'll go with them.

77
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,319
I'll never cause trouble or play tricks.

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,400
I only need thirty percent.

79
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,719
Lin Haohan,

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,680
you have helped me
quite a bit these days.

81
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,039
I don't want to see you die
in Ze Ze Inn.

82
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,719
Just go.

83
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,639
If I can gather the seals
to find the treasure,

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,960
I won't skimp on your share.

85
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,599
Muqing,

86
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,879
is it so serious
that you bring up death?

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,800
It is that serious.

88
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Muqing,

89
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,479
then you must not die.

90
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:26,426

91
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:30,074

92
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:32,434
(The 5th day of the 5th month, 1911)

93
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:33,888
(Grain in Ear is six days away)

94
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,240
Tomorrow is a different thing.

95
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,759
If we can find this person today
and take them down in advance,

96
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,680
wouldn't things become much simpler?

97
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,000
Keep searching.

98
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,480
Guard the city's entry

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,399
and exit points tightly.

100
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,000
Understood.

101
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,319
Have you remembered clearly?

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,759
Yes.

103
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,319
I've remembered everything

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,160
without any omissions.

105
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,720
Zhong Haichao

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,759
will not be absolutely honest with us.

107
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Even if he really
finds the inheritor of Prajna,

108
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,879
he may not share the results with us.

109
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,240
Therefore, we must not take it lightly.

110
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,720
I understand.

111
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
No suspicious people were found.

112
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
Keep watching.

113
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,040
Yes.

114
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,000
Our people are keeping an eye out.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,680
We are investigating anyone
who seems problematic.

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,519
Whether to investigate or watch,

117
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,879
what's meant to come will come.

118
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,319
It happens only once every 30 years.

119
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,639
I guess he will come.

120
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,680
Let's go out.

121
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,639
Then let them search.

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,920
I don't believe the inheritor of Prajna
will be weak

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,360
and be found by them so easily.

124
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,839
Bufan,

125
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,199
you look a bit nervous.

126
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
How did you tell?

127
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,959
You've counted twice.

128
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,480
Then no more counting.

129
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,160
If it works out tomorrow,

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,639
we won't have to live
counting our money anymore.

131
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,936
(The 6th day of the 5th month, 1911)

132
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:33,356
(The Big Dipper rises,
pressuring the water)

133
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:34,592
(Fire signifies lifeblood
to produce fire)

134
00:07:55,168 --> 00:08:00,186
(Ze Ze Inn)

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,879
To the noodle stand.

136
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,919
The area outside Ze Ze Inn
is already a trap.

137
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,720
With so many people watching covetously,

138
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,600
I don't think the inheritor of Prajna
dares to appear.

139
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,200
Knowing this,

140
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,720
why don't you just withdraw your people?

141
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,519
If I withdraw and they don't,
it's still the same.

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,039
I have no choice.

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,519
At this critical juncture,

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,559
no one wants to be at a disadvantage.

145
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,080
Isn't Zhuo Bufan a master?

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,039
Why is he still so cautious?

147
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,000
Only one who's much more meticulous
than the average person

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,080
can be called a master.

149
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,799
A master is one who, at any time,

150
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,159
won't be at a disadvantage.

151
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,080
As long as there are conditions,

152
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,279
they must seize every advantage
of time, place, and human conditions.

153
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,960
You only know about revolutions.

154
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,600
How would you know what a master is?

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
Please, Master in heaven,

156
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
and my parents in heaven, bless me

157
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,159
to get all the seals of Altar Treasure
for the imperial court

158
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,879
and to protect this country's
peace and prosperity.

159
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,840
That must be the Discipline Seal

160
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,279
stolen from the Wenyuan Pavilion.

161
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,600
Master,

162
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,519
you've been peeking for a long time.

163
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,320
Have you found
any time, place, or human condition?

164
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,600
Of course.

165
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,039
Zhuo Bufan intentionally
turns his back to the gate.

166
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,919
He seems carefree.

167
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,120
But in reality, he knows

168
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,600
no one will attack from behind.

169
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,320
And either I or Mr. Wang

170
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,480
must sit opposite him.

171
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,919
Facing the gate,

172
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,440
although we can see outside,

173
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,840
we'll also be affected
by the outside situation.

174
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,480
Besides, the light can be blinding.

175
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,759
If I tell you now

176
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,440
that I am willing to help Tongmenghui,

177
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,679
would you believe it or not?

178
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,200
I won't reveal the secret
of the Bodhi Seal

179
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,000
to you.

180
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,519
Alright.

181
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,919
Let me instruct you on a few things.

182
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,840
Be sure to remember them.

183
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,080
Instruct me?

184
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,200
Mr. Muqing,

185
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,399
I am your prisoner.

186
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,440
Not your subordinate.

187
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,519
Why are you instructing me?

188
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,120
Starting now,

189
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,639
you are no longer my prisoner.

190
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,720
I am letting you go.

191
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,639
However, right now,
not only at Ze Ze Inn,

192
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,279
Quanzhou city is also on high alert.

193
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
You can't go that easy.

194
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,399
After noon,

195
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,919
I'll find a way
to remove the people outside.

196
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,759
But I can only remove my people.

197
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,399
Not Mr. Wang and Zhuo Bufan's.

198
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,960
In addition, there are Japanese
hiding in the shadows.

199
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,480
And perhaps
there are Zhong Haichao's people too.

200
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,320
They are all here?

201
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,279
Of course.

202
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,120
After dark, you can slip away
from the back of Ze Ze Inn.

203
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
You know some kung fu.

204
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:03,840
On the road,

205
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,279
notice if anyone is following you.

206
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,919
After making sure
you've shaken off all tails,

207
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,879
head to Huang's Butcher Shop
in the western suburbs.

208
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,360
Someone there will meet up with you.

209
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,120
Who is that?

210
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,679
Once you go, you'll know.

211
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,480
Be careful.

212
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,840
Why are you letting me go?

213
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,240
I can't go.

214
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,960
You can't go because of the Bodhi Seal.

215
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,679
Although you know what the seal is,

216
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,000
without me, you can't obtain it,

217
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:27,759
right?

218
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
I also want the Bodhi Seal.

219
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,279
I want all the seals.

220
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,799
So in fact, I'm letting you go

221
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,679
for your safety

222
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,720
and for the safety of the Bodhi Seal.

223
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,639
Whether you hope Tongmenghui will get it

224
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,080
or you don't want the court to have it,

225
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,200
there need to be clues
to the secret treasure first.

226
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,759
We both agree on that.

227
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,360
So

228
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,120
remember what I say

229
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,480
and do as I say.

230
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,080
I've been rushing around for years

231
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,600
and haven't had time to read.

232
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,960
Who would

233
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,240
have thought I could steal
half a day of leisure today?

234
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,919
It will never compete
with other stars in light.

235
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,919
It mirrors beautifully
with the clear river.

236
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,799
It makes the bustling
hurry more than an arrow,

237
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,960
only to squander one's life in vain.

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,600
What book are you reading?

239
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,104
(Stories to Enlighten Men)

240
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
Stories old and new?

241
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,120
I didn't expect you
to have such leisure.

242
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,240
A swordsman who competed with me

243
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,639
left me with this book many years ago.

244
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,559
After losing,

245
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,879
he threw down his sword
and fled without a trace.

246
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,159
He even abandoned his luggage.

247
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,600
I found this book in his bag.

248
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,639
It tells a series of short stories.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,879
It tells of the multitude of beings

250
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,960
and tales of the fleeting world.

251
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,080
There is a bit of caution in them.

252
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,759
Since it's leisure,

253
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,200
I should also have a pot of tea.

254
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,440
Waiter,

255
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,000
high mountain Tieguanyin.

256
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,559
You are now in Fujian.

257
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,759
Why don't you try the Tieguanyin?

258
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,399
Why don't you try my tea?

259
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,639
I guess your hometown tea

260
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,399
is not Duyun Maojian tea.

261
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,360
My hometown is in Meixun.

262
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,159
So I prefer Queshe tea.

263
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,000
Thanks.

264
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,320
Let's just stick
to our own preferred tea.

265
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,240
Aren't you afraid the tea is poisoned?

266
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,639
You are from Lingxi.

267
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,799
If you want to poison me,

268
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,919
I'm afraid I wouldn't have the ability
to detect it.

269
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,840
Do you think this will work?

270
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,000
Then what do you think will work?

271
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,159
By smelling it.

272
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,799
By smelling,
you can tell if the tea is poisoned?

273
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,159
I'm just smelling the aroma of the tea.

274
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,240
If the poison can be smelled
just like that,

275
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,879
there will be no aroma left in the tea.

276
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,360
Mr. Muqing, you are truly impressive.

277
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,879
If you truly produced a silver needle,

278
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,960
I would have underestimated you.

279
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,200
I do have a silver needle.

280
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
But it's only used
for examining dead bodies.

281
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,919
At most, a silver needle can test

282
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,919
for deadly poisons
like arsenic and cinnabar,

283
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,799
which are rarely needed in normal times.

284
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,120
That's true.

285
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,679
If arsenic or cinnabar
were put in the tea,

286
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,200
wouldn't it be a waste of good tea?

287
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,799
Rest assured.

288
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,000
There are those skilled in poison
within our sect.

289
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,519
If someone were to poison us,

290
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
she would know.

291
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,519
I guess you've never seen these before.

292
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,399
These boxes are for seals.

293
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,679
Indeed, it's the first time
I've seen them.

294
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,720
Why do you have two of them?

295
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,480
This one is from the Wenyuan Pavilion.

296
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,639
It contained the Discipline Seal.

297
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,559
It's now empty.

298
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,360
The size is just right.

299
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,119
But the box is somewhat bulky.

300
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,279
It's not very convenient for someone
to carry it with them.

301
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,559
Do you think

302
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,440
that by having both Discipline Seal
and Bodhi Seal,

303
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,000
one can find something?

304
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,599
There are four such seals in total.

305
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,440
Now you are short of two of them.

306
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,039
Do you really think
you can find the secret treasure?

307
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,200
I believe
you're thinking the same as me.

308
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,960
The inheritor of Prajna
most likely won't come.

309
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,440
And no one can get all the seals.

310
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,559
Before, we each had one-fourth
of the four seals.

311
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,200
Together, we have half of them.

312
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,519
Don't you want to give it a try?

313
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,680
Nobody knows

314
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,839
if the Prajna inheritor will come.

315
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,759
However,
the inheritor of Dharma is here.

316
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,400
That's right.

317
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,039
Jialuo,

318
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:55,960
good timing.

319
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,720
Have a seat.

320
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,839
Should I call you Constable Wang,

321
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,279
Officer Wang,

322
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,960
or the inheritor of Dharma?

323
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,039
If it weren't for you
driving my master to his death,

324
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,759
I might never have known

325
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,519
that he was the chief of Dharma,

326
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,000
nor could I have become
the inheritor of Dharma.

327
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,960
Since you mentioned your master,

328
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,279
tell me,

329
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,519
do you have the Dharma Seal?

330
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,759
I searched your master's place.

331
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,759
Of course.

332
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,519
Of course?

333
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,759
Mr. Muqing,

334
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,559
who told you

335
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,880
about the 30-year pact on the 6th
of the 5th month in the year Xinhai?

336
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,599
If it weren't for Wang Jialuo,

337
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,680
I would have no idea
about the 30-year pact.

338
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,759
It seems that in the unseen destiny,

339
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,480
Heaven's will was already decreed.

340
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,079
No need. I'm not used to drinking it.

341
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,720
Get me a pot of Gaomo tea.

342
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:26,656
(Ze Ze Inn)

343
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,759
Will that Prajna inheritor

344
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,359
not come after all?

345
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,240
You don't have to worry.

346
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,880
Whoever should come will come.

347
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,960
It's just noon.

348
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,400
The day is still long.

349
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,279
Be patient.

350
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,920
You followed your master for so long.

351
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,680
Hadn't he ever told you?

352
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,880
My master barely knew how to speak.

353
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,359
That's true.

354
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,240
Given your skills,

355
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,160
you do not seem like a Dharma inheritor.

356
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,720
It's trivial.

357
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,440
For the Dagu murder case,

358
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,680
only two suspects remain.

359
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,240
Five people have already perished

360
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,880
at my hands.

361
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,440
The five people you spoke of

362
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,079
are all brothers with whom
I've shared life and death.

363
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,920
Killing you now would be as easy
as flipping my hand.

364
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,599
You wouldn't hand over the Dharma Seal
to those soldiers.

365
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,400
It's either on you or in your room.

366
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Do you think
it would be difficult for me

367
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,920
to kill you and take the seal?

368
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:07,680
It would be difficult.

369
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,839
He is a man of the court.

370
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,720
If you lay a hand on him,
I cannot just stand by.

371
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,319
You can't even handle me alone.

372
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,200
Even if Jialuo's kung fu
is a bit lacking,

373
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,160
together, we are more than enough
to defeat you.

374
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,319
Moreover,

375
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,319
Wang Jialuo's kung fu
is not in the moves

376
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,440
but in fighting desperately.

377
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,720
That's true.

378
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,319
My chances of winning are slim
against the two of you together.

379
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,640
Then why not join forces with me

380
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,319
and get rid of him first?

381
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,079
Mr. Zhuo,

382
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,319
why do you think Mr. Muqing

383
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,319
has reasons to work with you?

384
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,119
Of course, he has.

385
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,240
One less competitor for the treasure
means one less threat

386
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,480
and a higher chance of winning.

387
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,759
I seek the treasure for the court.

388
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,960
Even if I obtained the secret treasure,

389
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,359
I would hand it over to Mr. Muqing.

390
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,599
Mr. Zhuo, you are right.

391
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,720
One less competitor for the treasure
means one less threat

392
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,856
and a higher chance of winning.

393
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:54,880
How about

394
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,359
we get rid of you first?

395
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,000
As Mr. Zhuo said,

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,079
his chances are slim
if you and I join forces.

397
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,960
But that doesn't mean
he would necessarily lose.

398
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,799
Would a world-renowned swordsman

399
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,480
lack the skill to save his own life?

400
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,400
I remember back in Shanghai,

401
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,559
you were no match for me.

402
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,568
That's right.

403
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
But a few days ago, in the capital,

404
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,039
you changed.

405
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,720
Right.

406
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,279
The Bodhi Seal is at Futu Temple.

407
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,119
So is the Bodhi inheritance.

408
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:29,680
Right.

409
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:30,960
The Sanyin Sword?

410
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,920
Yes.

411
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,839
Once the sword of Bodhi is wielded,

412
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,400
it does impress the world.

413
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,039
I've only learned one move.

414
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,440
One move?

415
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,279
Please enlighten me.

416
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,440
It's Wuchang.

417
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,799
All things are impermanent.

418
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,200
It's the first move of the Sanyin Sword.

419
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,599
Sanyin Sword's three moves

420
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,440
are Wuchang,

421
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,519
Wuwo,

422
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,640
and Nirvana.

423
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,960
What if one masters them all?

424
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,720
They can kill you easily.

425
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,920
This world

426
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,960
is so vast and broad.

427
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,720
And swordsmanship has no bounds.

428
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,680
May I have a demonstration now?

429
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,599
Now?

430
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,248
Now.

431
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,200
All things are impermanent.

432
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,319
The name fits the move perfectly.

433
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,359
It's already noon.

434
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,440
Aren't the two of you hungry?

435
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:57,024
How about this?

436
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,680
I'll treat you.

437
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,519
And him too.

438
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,799
Never mind.

439
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,079
He won't eat if you treat him.

440
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,079
Let me treat.

441
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,880
Consider that the meal is on the court.

442
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,319
Waiter.

443
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:15,520
(Ze Ze Inn)

444
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,240
By the way,

445
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,319
there's something I've always wanted

446
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,400
to say thank you for.

447
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,160
You want to thank me?

448
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,039
Nine people were killed at the Dagu Inn.

449
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
That was your doing, wasn't it?

450
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,680
Yes.

451
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,839
But also not.

452
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,559
I received a message

453
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,160
about nine people
who returned from overseas

454
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,599
and were going to Shanghai
to meet Tan Xian.

455
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,839
So I ordered my sect fellows
to intercept them

456
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
and retrieve the message.

457
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,960
I gave the orders.

458
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,480
Therefore, it was my doing.

459
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,359
But killing them was not my intention.

460
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,200
The team was led by Yu Huanjie,
my senior fellow disciple.

461
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,720
In his haste to extract clues,
he was overzealous.

462
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,160
But none of this was my intention.

463
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,480
However, as the head
of the Rongtian Sword Sect,

464
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,200
I cannot shirk my responsibility.

465
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,000
So it was reasonable that Wang Jialuo

466
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,119
wanted to arrest me.

467
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,039
Then you just...

468
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,319
Mr. Zhuo, do you know

469
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,079
that those nine people
were all from Tongmenghui?

470
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,839
No.

471
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,839
But the rebels should be executed.

472
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,799
Even if you were unaware,

473
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,880
you have still eliminated a threat
to the court.

474
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,880
Therefore, I must thank you.

475
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,559
You don't need to say this for me.

476
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,440
If Wang Jialuo wants to come after me,

477
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,960
let him.

478
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,880
It doesn't bother me.

479
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,559
There's justice in everything.

480
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,440
After all, you've made a contribution
to the court in this matter.

481
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
You can't be wronged.

482
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,720
The Dagu murder case
did involve members of Tongmenghui.

483
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,200
But not all nine were.

484
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,440
Among them was a family.

485
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,119
The Tongmenghui members
hid among this family

486
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,759
and came to Dagu under cover.

487
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,432
Moreover,

488
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,160
Rongtian Ridge is not the county yamen.

489
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,440
Murder is murder.

490
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,400
It doesn't turn into merit
because the victims

491
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,359
were from Tongmenghui.

492
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,359
If it's really as Mr. Muqing says,

493
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,400
you just need to follow me

494
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,759
to the Ministry of Justice
for an investigation to close the case

495
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
instead of repeatedly resisting arrest.

496
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,559
Wang Jialuo,

497
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,359
your being alive and sitting here now

498
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,799
is due to the 30-year pact.

499
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480
I can refrain
from mentioning past events.

500
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,519
But if you

501
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,319
say another word about Rongtian Ridge,

502
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,359
I will let you die right here and now.

503
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,319
I have reviewed the files
of all nine people.

504
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,039
They had been in Japan

505
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,880
and Southeast Asia over the years,

506
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
some studying, some working.

507
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,039
First,

508
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,359
there was not one family among them.

509
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,759
Not even their relatives.

510
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,200
Second,

511
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,319
there was indeed a man
surnamed Lin among them.

512
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,799
And he indeed had a niece

513
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:54,680
named Lin Anjing,

514
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,279
who studied in Japan.

515
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
But among the nine people
who boarded from Japan,

516
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,960
there was no one named Lin Anjing.

517
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,880
Are you saying Lin Anjing
is from Tongmenghui?

518
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,279
I mean, you have no idea
whether the 'Lin Anjing'

519
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,200
you know

520
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,319
is the real Lin Anjing or not.

521
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,640
Over the past month,

522
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,799
she has been with me all the time.

523
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,559
I've checked on her.

524
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,599
- She...
- How did you check?

525
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,480
You're practically living together.

526
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,759
What could you possibly find out?

527
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,279
Wang Jialuo, I don't care who you date.

528
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,119
But this Dagu murder case
you're fixated on

529
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,160
has other hidden circumstances.

530
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,599
Mr. Zhuo and Rongtian

531
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,720
are not the targets you should go after.

532
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,240
What's most important right now
is the Altar Treasure.

533
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,000
You are a man of the court.

534
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,640
Protecting the secret treasure
for the court is what you should do.

535
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
I'll go and ask her.

536
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,759
Stop right there.

537
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,519
If it were someone else,

538
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,559
I would say
that the Dagu murder case stops here

539
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,920
and no further investigation is allowed.

540
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,279
But you are Wang Jialuo.

541
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,599
I promise you

542
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,119
that when this matter is over,

543
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,000
I will let you
reinvestigate the Dagu murder case

544
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,720
until you get to the bottom of it.

545
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,319
Mr. Muqing, your words are not proper.

546
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,960
Why couldn't anyone else

547
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,160
get to the bottom of the case?

548
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,240
It's a matter of handling a case.

549
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,640
It should be seen through to the end.

550
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,400
No matter by whom.

551
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,680
Just tell me
if you will accept my offer.

552
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,240
I will.

553
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,720
Today, I will put aside other matters

554
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,039
and focus only on the 30-year pact.

555
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,359
But for the Dagu case,

556
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,279
whether it's the victims
or the suspects,

557
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,880
I will investigate thoroughly.

558
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,079
As I told you before,

559
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,680
even if you don't come to me,

560
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,079
I will come to you.

561
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,640
I don't understand

562
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,720
why you went through so much trouble

563
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,839
persuading him.

564
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,519
Let's set aside our differences for now.

565
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,200
I'd like to discuss cooperation
with you.

566
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,504
Okay.

567
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,440
If you want that,

568
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,160
kill him right now.

569
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,359
I won't move if you do it.

570
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,960
Or you can stand by and watch me do it.

571
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,160
He certainly won't survive.

572
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
No.

573
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,599
What I want is teamwork
between the three of us.

574
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,000
The Department wants the Altar Treasure.

575
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,079
All under heaven is the Emperor's land.

576
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,440
It's only right for the court
to retrieve the secret treasure.

577
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,640
Mr. Wang,

578
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
don't you agree?

579
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,319
Of course.

580
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,599
So what I and Mr. Wang want is the same.

581
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,559
That is, the secret treasure
should belong to the court.

582
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,519
Since it's a legendary secret treasure,

583
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,200
it must be a huge fortune.

584
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,160
As for how much fortune
there is exactly,

585
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,079
no one knows.

586
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,680
In my opinion, finding more or less

587
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,880
doesn't really matter.

588
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,559
So it depends on what you want,

589
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,640
Mr. Zhuo.

590
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,559
When my master was still alive,

591
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,039
what he talked

592
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,319
about the most with us every day

593
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,279
was making the Rongtian Sword Sect
a reputable and orthodox sect,

594
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,839
a sword sect known by all under heaven,

595
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,599
and the number one sword sect
in the world.

596
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:19,759
This has to be achieved by you,
step by step.

597
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,240
It seems that it can't be done
with money.

598
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,119
Prince Qi said

599
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,440
to confer Rongtian
as the top sword sect in the world.

600
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,079
Conferment?

601
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,400
Conferment is easy.

602
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,799
The Department can also handle it.

603
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,599
If you have merit for the court,

604
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,480
even the Emperor can confer Rongtian.

605
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
Prince Qi also said

606
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,880
to build a main altar for Rongtian.

607
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,440
That's stingy.

608
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,400
How can just one main altar be enough?

609
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,759
In addition to one main altar,

610
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,279
there must be generous rewards.

611
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,400
Of course,

612
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,680
how much the reward will be
is not for me to decide.

613
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,319
That depends on
how big the secret treasure is.

614
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
What if I carelessly say ten percent,

615
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,400
and that ten percent

616
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,119
would already be enough
to rival a country's wealth?

617
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,799
It's said that there are
even secret martial arts manuals

618
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,960
from the Southern Shaolin
in the Altar Treasure.

619
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,559
Nowadays, there aren't many people
in the court who practice martial arts.

620
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,279
Even if
I take these martial arts manuals back,

621
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,880
I won't be granted a higher rank
or noble title.

622
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,759
Does anyone in your yamen

623
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,000
want to become a martial arts master?

624
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,104
No.

625
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,400
If there were recipes, our magistrate

626
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,599
could have them.

627
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,880
Then they would be vegetarian ones.

628
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,839
What is there to eat?

629
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,319
Don't you want to be a master?

630
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
My master is gone.

631
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,319
I couldn't learn them.

632
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:32,559
Then I'll give these manuals
to Mr. Zhuo.

633
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,400
What do you think?

634
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,759
No problem.

635
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,160
But I need
to resolve the Dagu murder case.

636
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,200
If you are okay with that.

637
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,200
The two of us have agreed.

638
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,200
All the manuals will go to you.

639
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:48,839
Good.

640
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,880
Then that's a gentleman's deal.

641
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,519
Along the way,

642
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,599
your actions have been gentlemanly.

643
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,640
Since we're cooperating,

644
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,279
we will unite
against a common foe today.

645
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,960
Okay.

646
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,799
Even now,
with the three of us cooperating,

647
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,279
we still can't open the Altar Treasure.

648
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,680
Isn't it just noon now?

649
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,720
We can just wait
for the inheritor of Prajna.

650
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,319
When he arrives later,

651
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,559
we'll kill him directly.

652
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,000
Don't be so reckless.

653
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,119
Courtesy before force.

654
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,440
If he's unwilling to cooperate with us,

655
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,920
it's not too late to take him down.

656
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
In this situation,

657
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,519
do you think
the inheritor of Prajna will come?

658
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:50,880
Will he dare to?

659
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,720
If the inheritor of Prajna comes,

660
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,799
with the skills of us three,

661
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,000
we can easily subdue him.

662
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,640
If the three of us are no match,

663
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,920
there's no use
keeping those people outside.

664
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,319
Let them all retreat.

665
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,240
Xian Ge.

666
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,880
Ding Yu.

667
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:11,808
See you.

668
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,599
I've already ordered my men
to evacuate from Ze Ze Inn.

669
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,039
They won't come back tonight.

670
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,920
I've also told the men
from the Department

671
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,680
to go out and have fun

672
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,720
all night before returning.

673
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:23,039
People from the 43rd Association
will not show up today either.

674
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,359
Now, Ze Ze Inn is completely undefended.

675
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,599
Shouldn't we make it more conspicuous?

676
00:33:36,032 --> 00:33:40,698
(Ze Ze Inn)

677
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,599
I think I've figured it out.

678
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,000
With so many people
surrounding the place,

679
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,880
even if the Prajna inheritor
really came,

680
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,200
he would first ascertain the situation
from the shadows

681
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,200
before deciding whether to enter or not.

682
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,319
Their people
have really left completely.

683
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,640
They're hiding nearby.

684
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,719
What are they doing?

685
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,679
Are they writing?

686
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,880
Where do they get the mood

687
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,719
to actually be writing
at a time like this?

688
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:36,608
(Pact)

689
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,559
Mr. Zhuo, your handwriting isn't bad.

690
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,840
It's just so-so.

691
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,920
Should the addressee be 'Inheritor'

692
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
or 'Senior Brother'?

693
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:50,320
Prajna Hall's members
are seniors to the members

694
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,880
of Dharma, Discipline, and Bodhi, right?

695
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,719
'Senior Brother' shows respect.

696
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,280
And 'Inheritor' seems a bit rigid.

697
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,639
That's exactly what I mean.

698
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,159
Also, Mr. Muqing and I
calling someone 'Senior Brother'

699
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,519
would not be proper.

700
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,559
I don't really care.

701
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,719
It's all the same intent.

702
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,159
Then how about we just write 'Bro'?

703
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:05,719
'Bro'?

704
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,400
That doesn't sound good.

705
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:08,960
'Brother'?

706
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,760
Is that too casual?

707
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,480
'Fellow Taoist' would be inappropriate.

708
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,719
That's right.

709
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,119
Let's just write 'Brother'.

710
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
It sounds okay.

711
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,159
That's right.

712
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,719
It does sound somewhat cordial.

713
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,679
I have no objection.

714
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:31,200
(Brother)

715
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,239
Jialuo, don't move yet.

716
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,000
Mr. Zhuo, a little higher here.

717
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,000
Then move a bit to the right.

718
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:48,760
Over here.

719
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,880
Mr. Zhuo, a bit higher again.

720
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,079
Mr. Zhuo,

721
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,840
a little higher.

722
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,039
A little more to the right.

723
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,000
And a little higher.

724
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,519
Good.

725
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,039
Is that okay?

726
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:01,600
Okay.

727
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:03,936
Too far.

728
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,440
To the left.

729
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,599
What exactly are they up to?

730
00:36:16,736 --> 00:36:22,746
(Welcome, Brother Prajna Inheritor,
to the 30-year pact of Baohe Inn)

731
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,039
Very noticeable.

732
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
It's quite horizontal.

733
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,639
Then let's continue inside for tea.

734
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:34,960
Okay.

735
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,280
The Prajna inheritor
probably won't come.

736
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,760
Even if the three of us
withdraw our people,

737
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,159
Ze Ze Inn is still a tightly-knit net.

738
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,920
As soon as the Prajna inheritor appears,

739
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,079
not to mention us working together
to capture him,

740
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,440
I'm afraid
we will all be captured as well.

741
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:53,239
That's also true.

742
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,239
If I were the Prajna inheritor,

743
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,679
it would be safer not to appear
under these circumstances.

744
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,000
Not appearing doesn't mean not coming.

745
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,079
That's right.

746
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,000
He may be watching us from somewhere,

747
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,840
thinking about

748
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,320
how he can meet us safely.

749
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,639
Speaking of which,

750
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,079
Ze Ze Inn is indeed not a suitable place

751
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,239
for a meeting.

752
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,239
But at least he knows

753
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,360
that we are already here.

754
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,000
Our message
only welcomes the Prajna inheritor.

755
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,960
Then he must know the inheritors
of Dharma, Bodhi, and Discipline

756
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,079
are all here.

757
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,280
You want to tell him to change the time
and place of the meeting.

758
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,199
This is indeed a good idea.

759
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,000
However,

760
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,880
how can we
let only the Prajna inheritor know?

761
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,679
It's not hard
to let the Prajna inheritor know.

762
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,119
The difficult part
is how to keep others from knowing

763
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,280
that we have changed the location
of the 30-year pact.

764
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,039
The 'others' you said

765
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,280
are just those Japanese people.

766
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,840
I found it out yesterday.

767
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,000
They are at the hotel
on the street corner.

768
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,599
If you want
to eliminate them completely,

769
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,400
we can combine our people

770
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,679
and exterminate them in an instant.

771
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,760
If it's just them, I don't care at all.

772
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:57,960
There are also others?

773
00:37:59,119 --> 00:37:59,760
Beiyang.

774
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,079
Beiyang?

775
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,599
Not his Beiyang.

776
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,280
It's the local Beiyang garrison.

777
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:09,719
I see.

778
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:11,440
It makes sense.

779
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,920
Do you understand?

780
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,239
Beiyang would naturally be interested
in the treasure.

781
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:17,599
I am aware of that.

782
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,039
I just don't know

783
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,880
that there are others besides me today.

784
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,559
You're not entirely someone
from Beiyang.

785
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,840
Would they pin their hopes on you?

786
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,519
Then what do you suggest we do next?

787
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,320
Now all we can do is let them watch.

788
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,639
Till today passes,

789
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,079
and nothing comes.

790
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
There's still half a day
and a night left.

791
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,000
Then the three of us can only

792
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,760
act.

793
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,000
A pair in heaven suit.

794
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
As a small local constable,
you must be idle on regular days

795
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,519
to be so skilled at Pai Gow.

796
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,320
I'm just average.

797
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,719
It's mainly because
you two are really bad at it.

798
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:09,199
I'm done.

799
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,920
I'm done.

800
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,920
Zhuo Bufan

801
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,280
really doesn't know how to play.

802
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,199
He's been losing all along.

803
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:31,519
Don't move.

804
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,079
You still...

805
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,639
If your Elephant piece doesn't advance,

806
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,199
you might as well await your demise.

807
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,960
Mr. Muqing, you are a gentleman.

808
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,199
What about me being a gentleman?

809
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,599
One shan't comment
while watching a game.

810
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,840
Move the Horse.

811
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,760
It's your turn.

812
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,519
It's your turn.

813
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,280
Check!

814
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:55,800
Make your move.

815
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:26,119
How is it?

816
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,000
Have you rested well?

817
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,639
I took a nap.

818
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:30,679
I feel much better.

819
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,400
I was just thinking

820
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,159
about when I would see you next time

821
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,559
and what it would be like.

822
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
But I really want to

823
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,599
witness the Sanyin Sword.

824
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,639
With a real fight?

825
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:50,679
Yes.

826
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,920
We can't fight each other
with our lives right now.

827
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,960
Let's take it as a contest.

828
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,280
Okay.

829
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,400
To be able to fight

830
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,760
the world's top swordsman like you

831
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,239
is certainly a fortunate event.

832
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,000
The world's top swordsman...

833
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:16,800
When I was called

834
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,280
the world's top swordsman ten years ago,

835
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,599
I had just finished my training.

836
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,000
I was tasked by my master
to visit masters in various places.

837
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,719
I was in my late teens
to early twenties.

838
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,920
I was young and frivolous.

839
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,960
All I thought about was,

840
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,320
"It's great if I win.

841
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,800
And it's no shame if I lose."

842
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,159
So in my first three fights,

843
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,079
I defeated the top swordsmen of Bashu,

844
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,400
Guangdong and Guangxi,
and the Central Plains.

845
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,599
After that, no one dared to fight me.

846
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,360
It was many years later that I found out

847
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,960
that my top swordsman title

848
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,840
was bestowed upon me
by those three famous masters.

849
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,760
They thought losing

850
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,519
to the world's top swordsman
was not humiliating,

851
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,599
but losing to a newcomer

852
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,079
from the Rongtian Sword Sect

853
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,360
was too shameful.

854
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,320
I used to think

855
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,239
that Rongtian Swordsmanship
was really powerful.

856
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,519
But later, I realized

857
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,360
that it was just me who was strong.

858
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,280
I entered the sect when I was little.

859
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,079
I practiced sword drawing,
sword control, and word wielding

860
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,039
each for seven years

861
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,119
before I graduated.

862
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,400
The sect disciples and sect leaders
I defeated

863
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:22,639
weren't diligent
in practicing the sword,

864
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,039
and they squandered their own potential.

865
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,039
The nameless lacked great ambitions.

866
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,079
They muddled along.

867
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,039
And the famous were impetuous.

868
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,039
They lacked enhancement.

869
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,679
Therefore, even after I became

870
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,760
the world's top swordsman,

871
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,559
I still dared not slack off.

872
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,199
Every day in the morning and evening,

873
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,880
I draw my sword and wield it 600 times,

874
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,920

I truly became stronger and stronger

878
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,320
and hardly had an opponent.

Mr. Zhuo, by saying these words,

888
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,000
you deserve the title
of the world's top swordsman.

889
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,960
For more than a decade,

890
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,519
you've drawn and wielded your sword
countless times.

891
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,639
Mr. Zhuo,

892
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:23,760
I admire you.

893
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:28,159
You haven't met an opponent
in over a decade.

894
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:30,079
In today's battle, do you want to win

895
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,000
or lose?

896
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:33,239
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

897
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:34,719
To win is for the past.

898
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,000
To lose is for the future.

899
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,199
Well said.

900
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,719
People feel sad
when they are reminded of the past.

901
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,079
The reflection in the mirror
ages each year.

902
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,559
If it weren't for our opposing statuses,

903
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,360
perhaps we could have become friends.

904
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,400
I am just a martial man in jianghu.

905
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,800
How could I possibly become friends
with an official

906
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,679
in the imperial court?

907
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,199
If it weren't for this matter,

908
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,039
you and I would probably never have met
in this lifetime.

909
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,800
Weren't your martial uncle, Mo Kun,

910
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,840
and my former superior, Chatai,

911
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,280
friends?

912
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,920
