1
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,226
Master Du E.

2
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,346
One more time.

3
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:36,225
Master.

4
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:42,065
The next move I make
is called the Swordfall.

5
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:42,786
One sword...

6
00:00:42,786 --> 00:00:43,746
One sword with six moves.

7
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,106
Each move with seven variations, right?

8
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:49,985
Isn't it still just one sword?

9
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:52,945
You know the Rongtian Swordsmanship?

10
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:55,665
The Rongtian Ridge's swordsmanship
is overly complicated.

11
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:58,146
Mo Kun already knew this.

12
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:01,146
Do you know my Martial Uncle?

13
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:04,466
If Mo Kun is not
from the Rongtian Ridge,

14
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:07,386
I will show you no mercy.

15
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:14,786
May I ask
what kung fu you used just now?

16
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:16,586
Southern Shaolin's kung fu.

17
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:20,265
I have only learned the basics.

18
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,466
Is their kung fu really that powerful?

19
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,345
Your swordsmanship is okay,

20
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,065
but cannot compared

21
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:32,746
to the Sanyin Sword,

22
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:35,785
Sanyin Sword again?

23
00:01:37,186 --> 00:01:38,905
How powerful is it?

24
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,905
When the sword
of Bodhi Department is drawn,

25
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,545
no one can fight back.

26
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:11,545
If you want to leave, go ahead.

27
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,345
Otherwise, don't cross this line.

28
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:14,186
Cross the line,

29
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:18,016
and I'll cripple your cultivation.

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,040
(My name is Zhuo Bufan.)

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
(I can enjoy boundless scenes)

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,120
(and be extraordinary.)

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,360
(Only those who dare
to wander everywhere)

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,400
(are worthy of this name.)

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,880
(So in my whole life,)

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,800
(I bet on my life,)

37
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,600
(death,)

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,480
(and future.)

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,912
(Life is unfair,)

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
(and I fell on an evil time.)

41
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,400
(I do whatever I can to change my fate.)

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,018
(Everything is impermanent)

43
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,746
(and fickle.)

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
(I will decide my own life and death.)

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,706
(I bet on a promising future)

46
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,080
(and a great undertaking.)

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,280
(I want to protect the last hope
of our sect.)

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,880
(But I lost the bet)

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,520
(on her.)

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,600
(I thought we couldn't)

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,200
(meet the right one too late.)

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,320
(But actually,)

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,880
(meeting too early)

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,600
(also will not do.)

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,760
(I always remember
the first time I met her.)

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,720
(She stood beside the flowers,)

57
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
(smiling.)

58
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,920
(Later on,)

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,320
(even though she has been by my side,)

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
(she can't belong to me for a lifetime.)

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,160
(I can never give the answer.)

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
(When I was young,)

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
(I always pursued that answer.)

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,600
(But after a long time,)

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,640
(I only wish that there are no fights)

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,760
(and lovers can get together.)

67
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:44,730
=Heroes=

68
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:48,064
=Episode 19=

69
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,872
Regardless of being poor or rich,
noble or lowly,

70
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,866
all beings will be equal.

71
00:03:59,306 --> 00:03:59,825
Good.

72
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:01,665
That's it.

73
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:04,625
You come in too.

74
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:07,026
Both of you come in.

75
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:17,065
He has no passphrase.

76
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,026
He cannot enter.

77
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:19,905
Don't give him the item.

78
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:21,306
It's the last wish
of the Bodhi inheritor.

79
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:50,306
All of us.

80
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,025
Break in.

81
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:52,786
Wait.

82
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:56,546
This monk's kung fu is powerful.

83
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:57,906
We can't get in.

84
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:00,945
What do we do then?

85
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:02,786
Just watch the official
from the Department

86
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:03,505
get the clue?

87
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:04,825
All clues are indispensable.

88
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:07,465
Now, we have the treasure map.

89
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:09,786
Even if they obtain the secret,
they still

90
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:10,866
can't open the treasure.

91
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,625
Anyway,

92
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,265
we have equivalent leverage to use.

93
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:16,025
No one knows

94
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:17,625
who loses or wins now.

95
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:33,306
Abbot.

96
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:36,705
No matter what,
don't give it to officials.

97
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:42,065
Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

98
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:47,385
How do you know my name?

99
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:50,265
All things in this world
are predestined.

100
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:52,226
Your arrival here today

101
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:53,866
is both fate

102
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:55,746
and resolution.

103
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:32,226
Abbot.

104
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:37,426
Open it.

105
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:47,906
Read it.

106
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:53,585
I am the third generation
of Bodhi Department.

107
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:55,346
I've kept the Bodhi Seal...

108
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:59,186
(I've kept the Bodhi Seal
in Saibei Town for years.)

109
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,705
(Imperial guards were after me.)

110
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:03,465
(Just in case,)

111
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:07,825
(I hid the Bodhi Seal
in the Futu Temple.)

112
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:11,825
If I can't retrieve the Bodhi Seal,

113
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:14,226
my inheritor will surely come.

114
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:17,746
I will leave a passphrase for him.

115
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,825
Say the passphrase

116
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,145
and the seal can be returned.

117
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:25,025
Regardless of being poor or rich,
noble or lowly...

118
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,786
All beings will be equal.

119
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,226
In 1905,

120
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,746
I realized that I would die soon.

121
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:42,625
So I built a cenotaph
in Pingyao, Shanxi,

122
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,666
and left a Sheli Box inside.

123
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,505
I led the trail of the seal

124
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:47,906
to the Futu Temple.

125
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:52,906
(I entrusted it)

126
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,106
(to a reliable person)

127
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:59,346
(to handle the secret treasure.)

128
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:00,666
I firmly believe

129
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,705
that the person entrusted won't fail me.

130
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:11,145
The chief of the Bodhi Department

131
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:13,346
of Southern Shaolin left this scroll

132
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,866
before he left the Futu Temple.

133
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,265
He gave it to my master.

134
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,226
Since the chief said in this letter

135
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,546
only the person with the passphrase
could get the seal,

136
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:26,186
why did you let him in?

137
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,746
After reading this letter,

138
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:30,505
what do you think?

139
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,906
The handwriting looks familiar.

140
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:36,906
Think it over again.

141
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,265
Right.

142
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,065
Previously in Pingyao, Shanxi,

143
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:43,306
I saw the cloth when I opened the tomb.

144
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,266
I already knew

145
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:47,456
the chief of the Bodhi Department
of Southern Shaolin

146
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,705
was my master Cheng Yu,
the one who taught me

147
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:50,945
kung fu since I was little.

148
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:53,705
That's why I know

149
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:57,345
your name is Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

150
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,186
Answer your question.

151
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:01,985
You know the passphrase,

152
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,105
so you can enter

153
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:07,065
and get the information you should know.

154
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:08,546
Well,

155
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:10,865
he's Cheng Yu's disciple,

156
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:11,985
his inheritor,

157
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:15,026
so he can also enter.

158
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,225
Abbot.

159
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,585
You don't know me.

160
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:19,506
How could you know
I am Cheng Yu's disciple?

161
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,105
Is it because of my kung fu?

162
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:29,105
My tattoo?

163
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:43,666
Master, what is this?

164
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:46,705
My master tattooed this on me

165
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:47,906
when I was young.

166
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,105
I never realized it had this purpose.

167
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,906
Cheng Yu, the third generation
chief of the Bodhi Department,

168
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,985
had 11 disciples in his life.

169
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,626
But none of them is his inheritor.

170
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,225
He didn't decide who would
be the fourth generation inheritor

171
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:03,225
of Bodhi Department chief.

172
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,345
Before his death, he chose a disciple

173
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:07,906
to be his inheritor

174
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:11,026
of the mission.

175
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,026
My master passed away
in the Futu Temple?

176
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,930
(Su Yunzhi, Irgen-Gioro Muqing)

177
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,186
I know Su Yunzhi.

178
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:50,026
He is Shovel.

179
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:52,745
(Su Yunzhi)
I solved a case about him in Shanxi.

180
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:59,616
(Su Yunzhi)

181
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,945
Su Yunzhi is my eldest disciple.

182
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,865
He is kind and upright.

183
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,546
He doesn't fear brutal force,

184
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:17,146
matching the criteria for an inheritor.

185
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,426
However, after the Wuxu Reform,

186
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:22,865
to help the Reformists escape,

187
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:25,745
he was tragically killed
by imperial guards.

188
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:27,610
(Su Yunzhi)

189
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:52,386
(Irgen-Gioro Muqing)

190
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,825
This disciple is extremely talented

191
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:57,065
with exceptional martial skills.

192
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:59,065
And what's most precious is

193
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:01,225
he harbors lofty aspirations.

194
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:04,345
Sadly,

195
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:09,386
because of the reform.

196
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:11,465
he was imprisoned.

197
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:14,306
Muqing.

198
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:20,705
I entrusted you with the legacy
of the Bodhi Department.

199
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,186
(Irgen-Gioro Muqing)

200
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:24,386
I also entrusted you with the hardships

201
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:27,666
and suffering.

202
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:37,386
Once a lamp in the darkness

203
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:39,225
is lit,

204
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:41,266
it can break through the dark.

205
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:48,026
You are the inheritor
chosen by Cheng Yu.

206
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:55,105
Turns out I'm the Bodhi's inheritor

207
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:57,585
I've been looking for.

208
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:03,865
The fourth generation inheritor
of the Bodhi Department

209
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:05,536
of Southern Shaolin inherits the legacy.

210
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:20,465
At first, Shaolin

211
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:22,666
only had the Dharma Swordsmanship.

212
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,105
From 1522 to 1566,

213
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,865
Master Shiqugu's swordsmanship
was famous.

214
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,266
After being the chief
of the Bodhi Department,

215
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:32,386
he wrote down his ultimate skills.

216
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,315
(Sanyin Sword)
It is the Sanyin Sword

217
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,026
of Bodhi Department.

218
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:40,026
The reason why Cheng Yu's swordsmanship
was invincible

219
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:41,705
was that he used the Sanyin Sword.

220
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:43,865
Sanyin Sword

221
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,705
can only be learned by the inheritor.

222
00:13:57,705 --> 00:14:00,345
This is the Bodhi Seal?

223
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,065
He cannot have it.

224
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,386
Cheng Yu's last wish

225
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,786
was to give the seal to the Tongmenghui

226
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:05,945
to benefit the people.

227
00:14:10,386 --> 00:14:10,985
Abbot.

228
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:23,825
It is the same as the one
in the palace's Wenyuan Pavilion.

229
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:26,266
Both are kept in a charred wooden box.

230
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:35,776
This...

231
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,306
Years ago, the chief inheritor

232
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:42,065
of the Disciplinary Department
defected and sided with the court.

233
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:44,345
He handed out the Discipline Seal.

234
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,426
After that,

235
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,546
Cheng Yu was concerned
Bodhi Seal would fall

236
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:50,065
into other people's hands.

237
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:51,465
So, many years ago,

238
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:52,825
he destroyed it.

239
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,266
He used another method

240
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:56,506
to pass on the secret clues.

241
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:03,386
This letter

242
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:05,865
records the secret clues.

243
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,985
You failed to speak the passphrase.

244
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,266
According to the third generation
chief of the Bodhi Department,

245
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:14,825
the seal can only be given
to someone with the passphrase.

246
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:16,666
It's her.

247
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,546
I don't know the content

248
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:28,225
of the letter.

249
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:30,266
Only you can read it.

250
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,146
Have you already

251
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:43,345
remembered its content?

252
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:22,945
Fortunately, you restrained yourself.

253
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:26,906
Otherwise, the Bodhi Department
would have no inheritor.

254
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:32,896
Bufan.

255
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:35,186
Wang Jialuo is here.

256
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:03,345
Zhuo Bufan.

257
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:04,386
Yu Huanjie.

258
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:07,945
The Dagu murder case

259
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:10,146
can finally be closed today.

260
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:16,265
Closed?

261
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,066
Do you know who went in just now?

262
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:21,545
It's the woman

263
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,426
who appeared with Tan Xian
on the Maiqi Road.

264
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:25,745
She is a member of the Tongmenghui.

265
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:28,346
I guess she has obtained the treasure.

266
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:31,985
If Tongmenghui has the treasure,

267
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,985
they will inevitably fight
against the court.

268
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:37,066
Your court is doomed.

269
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:38,945
I won't let her get the treasure.

270
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:40,785
I won't let the court perish.

271
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:41,705
I won't

272
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:43,745
let the criminal off the hook.

273
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:45,952
Mr. Ding.

274
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,465
Keep a close watch
on the murder suspects,

275
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:49,826
Zhuo Bufan and Yu Huanjie.

276
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,192
Master.

277
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:57,344
Sorry to disturb you.

278
00:17:58,272 --> 00:17:59,455
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
I'm Wang Jialuo,

279
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:00,426
a constable of Dagu County Yamen.

280
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:03,146
I came all the way to catch
Zhuo Bufan and Yu Huanjie,

281
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:04,992
murderers of Dagu Murder Case
of Nine Deaths.

282
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:07,545
Also, I'm investigating the case

283
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:08,586
of the Altar Treasure

284
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:12,025
to prevent the national treasure
from being stolen by others,

285
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:13,265
endangering the court.

286
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:17,186
When did the constable's uniform change?

287
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:21,888
This is the uniform of Beiyang Army.

288
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:24,066
Coincidentally,

289
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,866
I became a second lieutenant
of the 43rd Association.

290
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:27,305
Whether a constable

291
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:27,945
or Beiyang soldier,

292
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:28,985
both serve the court

293
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,705
and should abide by the laws.

294
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:34,626
Master.

295
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:37,545
I guess

296
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:39,386
you stopped them.

297
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:43,745
But I need to enter for a fair search.

298
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:46,146
Please do not

299
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:47,626
stop me.

300
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:50,985
Whoever crosses the line

301
00:18:51,985 --> 00:18:52,745
will be taken down.

302
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,025
I know you're serious.

303
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,505
Zhuo Bufan's martial arts
are unparalleled,

304
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:14,225
but he failed.

305
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:16,305
Naturally, I am no match for you.

306
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:17,664
However,

307
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:19,906
I have a gun.

308
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:25,866
I don't believe any martial skill

309
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,025
can exceed the speed of a bullet.

310
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:28,785
Jialuo, you don't need to act.

311
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:30,025
Let them do it.

312
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,225
You guys go ahead.

313
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:37,472
If he dares to make a move,

314
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:39,186
shoot him.

315
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:54,426
I'll shoot you.

316
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:03,328
Don't move.

317
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:05,344
Put the gun down.

318
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:17,545
Put the gun down!

319
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,426
Master.

320
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:25,866
Sorry for offense.

321
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:26,826
Please do not hurt him.

322
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:28,186
Whoever crosses the line

323
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:29,505
will be taken down.

324
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:30,146
Master.

325
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,146
It's important.
I must go in for the investigation.

326
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:33,785
Go ahead.

327
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:37,545
Jialuo.

328
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,186
He is no ordinary person.

329
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,225
Zhuo Bufan has run away again.

330
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:47,985
Guys, chase him!

331
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:02,505
Even if the Altar Treasure is real,
neither you nor I can get it.

332
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:06,945
The treasure map on the banned book
shelf of Wenyuan Pavilion

333
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:08,265
has long been stolen.

334
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,826
That's why I was released

335
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,785
to investigate the case
after being imprisoned for 12 years.

336
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:14,186
It was stolen?

337
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:15,106
Zhuo Bufan

338
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,545
has the Discipline Seal.

339
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,346
If the Discipline Seal
in the Wenyuan Pavilion

340
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:20,146
hadn't been stolen,

341
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,305
you wouldn't have had the chance
to be released.

342
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,346
If you didn't come all the way here,

343
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:26,465
you wouldn't know

344
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:28,066
that you are
Bodhi Department's inheritor.

345
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:30,705
It is the entangled causes and effects

346
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:32,705
that have led to today's meeting.

347
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:35,025
The cause is the start.

348
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,465
The effect is the result.

349
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,066
The cause and effect

350
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:39,705
are far from certain.

351
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:41,745
Alright.

352
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:43,225
I have said what I should say.

353
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:46,586
You can't stay in the Futu Temple.

354
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,745
Where should I go?

355
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:50,265
You're a detective.

356
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:52,505
But I am not.

357
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:58,066
Thank you.

358
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:02,826
Just now you said

359
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:04,866
you were glad I did not make a move.

360
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,505
Otherwise, the Bodhi Department
would have no inheritor.

361
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:11,826
I wonder if you're trying to scare me

362
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:13,426
or if you can defeat me.

363
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,505
I never lie.

364
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,426
You refuse to give in.

365
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:38,666
That's very good.

366
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:40,265
One should not

367
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:41,985
admit defeat.

368
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:45,426
What kung fu is this?

369
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,666
Dragon-Subduing Skill
of Southern Shaolin.

370
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:52,225
Thanks.

371
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,265
If my rival is Cheng Yu,

372
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:56,745
I will be defeated.

373
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,745
You have obtained the Sanyin Sword.

374
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:01,225
Practice it well.

375
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:03,386
Do not let the Bodhi Department

376
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:04,346
lose its legacy.

377
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:07,666
My master passed away here.

378
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,426
Where is his spiritual tablet?

379
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:10,785
I want to pay my respects.

380
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:26,745
You found the Altar Treasure?

381
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:28,785
It's not that easy.

382
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:32,586
Our people.

383
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:34,848
They're pursuing the people
from Rongtian Ridge.

384
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:35,826
Zhuo Bufan must be alive.

385
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:45,426
How is it?

386
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:51,465
Zhuo Bufan and Yu Huanjie

387
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:52,265
have escaped.

388
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:58,346
Why we can't kill Zhuo Bufan?

389
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,465
I found another treasure map

390
00:24:15,465 --> 00:24:17,626
in the Futu Temple.

391
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:20,906
It's the Bodhi Seal.

392
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:23,025
This is only half of the whole map.

393
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:25,066
And the other half

394
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,025
is the one that was stolen
from the palace.

395
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:28,265
It's the Discipline Seal.

396
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:30,186
Now Zhuo Bufan has it.

397
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,465
To unlock the treasure,

398
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,186
we must combine the two seals.

399
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:37,826
If we fail to find the Discipline Seal

400
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,426
before killing Zhuo Bufan,

401
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,265
the hope of finding the treasure

402
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:42,705
will become very slim.

403
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:46,705
Finding the treasure is your job.

404
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:48,666
My job is to pursue the murderers.

405
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:50,426
Moreover, I think

406
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:52,545
finding the treasure
is not that important.

407
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,025
As long as Zhuo Bufan
doesn't get the treasure,

408
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,586
eliminating the threat to the court

409
00:24:56,906 --> 00:24:57,545
is enough.

410
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,066
Why are you so stubborn?

411
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,945
Catching a minor bandit

412
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:02,826
is no big deal.

413
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,265
Finding treasure for the court
is of utmost importance.

414
00:25:05,265 --> 00:25:07,626
Catching Zhuo Bufan
exemplifies the strictness of the laws

415
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:09,025
and the orderliness of practices.

416
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:11,626
Being resolute
is what an official ought to do.

417
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:13,505
You're a lowly constable.

418
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:15,505
Can you call yourself an official?

419
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:16,945
Given your insights,

420
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:19,705
you're not worthy of the high position
bestowed by the Emperor.

421
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:21,066
Enough, guys.

422
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:22,186
No need to argue.

423
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:23,426
We are on the same team.

424
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:25,465
Why do I have to work
with this stubborn man?

425
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,745
By the way,

426
00:25:31,826 --> 00:25:32,945
how did you get in?

427
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:34,346
What do you mean?

428
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:35,785
Futu Temple.

429
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,426
That monk is too powerful.

430
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:40,866
Both Zhuo Bufan and I couldn't enter.

431
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:41,826
How did you get in?

432
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,945
At first, he didn't get in either.

433
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:45,346
Later, a young monk came.

434
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:46,106
He let him in.

435
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:47,666
Young monk?

436
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:48,544
Yeah.

437
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:50,066
The abbot.

438
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:51,785
I don't

439
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:53,985
know why.

440
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,386
Let me tell you.

441
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,465
Liu Lin and I

442
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:00,426
entered the temple.

443
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:03,186
Liu Lin could enter
because she had the passphrase.

444
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:05,106
Tan Xian, the guy who died in Shanghai,

445
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:05,826
told her.

446
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:08,225
The young monk told me the secrets

447
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,305
of the Futu Temple.

448
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,025
The inheritor we looked for

449
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,586
in Shanxi is the third generation chief

450
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:16,545
of the Bodhi Department
of Southern Shaolin.

451
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,826
He passed away in Futu Temple.

452
00:26:22,386 --> 00:26:23,225
Did you get the seal?

453
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:24,705
I got nothing.

454
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,866
The Bodhi's inheritor
has destroyed the seal.

455
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:30,626
Why not kill Zhuo Bufan?

456
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:31,945
I have come this far

457
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:33,106
and had more and more clues.

458
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:34,666
I have to keep investigating.

459
00:26:35,465 --> 00:26:36,025
Alright.

460
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:37,545
You'll look for clues.

461
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:39,265
I'll look for the murderers.

462
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:41,626
I warn you.

463
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,545
I don't care about whom you arrest.

464
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:45,586
But I must get the Discipline Seal

465
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:46,426
from Zhuo Bufan.

466
00:26:47,945 --> 00:26:48,545
No problem.

467
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,906
Whether I capture or kill him,

468
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:52,785
as long as I see the item,

469
00:26:53,106 --> 00:26:53,856
I'll give it to you.

470
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,146
Why did you get in?

471
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,505
That woman had a passphrase.

472
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,505
But you didn't.

473
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,386
How did you get in?

474
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:17,426
40 years ago, the guards

475
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:20,106
from the Imperial Household Department
had investigated Futu Temple,

476
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:20,985
but found nothing.

477
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:22,906
The young monk let me in

478
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:24,346
just to make me give up,

479
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:26,346
because the secrets there are worthless.

480
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,106
Muqing.

481
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:40,945
Did you really find nothing?

482
00:27:56,626 --> 00:27:58,106
You indeed got it.

483
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:01,985
Take a look.

484
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,906
Whether I tell Wang Jialuo or not

485
00:28:03,906 --> 00:28:06,265
makes no difference.

486
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:12,186
It's really gone.

487
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:13,426
Yes.

488
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:16,186
However, I think

489
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:18,985
we're getting closer to the truth.

490
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:21,346
So, what's the next step?

491
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,112
Return to the capital.

492
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:24,626
I want to sort out all the clues.

493
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:25,984
What about Zhuo Bufan?

494
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:33,586
Here is

495
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,146
the most delightful thing.

496
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,066
Zhuo Bufan will surely think

497
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,985
I have the Bodhi Seal.

498
00:28:39,826 --> 00:28:41,386
He will definitely follow us.

499
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:41,985
So,

500
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:43,985
he has the Discipline Seal,

501
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:44,945
which is very safe.

502
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:47,146
What about Liu Lin?

503
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:49,305
Take her to the Ministry of Justice?

504
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:50,906
Keep her for now.

505
00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:52,305
I'm not sure if she knows

506
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:53,225
other secrets.

507
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:54,176
Okay.

508
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:56,066
By the way, Getai,

509
00:28:56,906 --> 00:28:59,025
don't mention Liu Lin to others for now.

510
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,666
After all, she's a rebel
from the Tongmenghui.

511
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,785
I don't want to cause any trouble.

512
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:05,785
Finding the treasure
is the priority right now.

513
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:07,346
I understand.

514
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:35,346
(The next move I make
is called the Swordfall.)

515
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:36,066
(One sword...)

516
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:36,985
(One sword with six moves.)

517
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,386
(Each move
with seven variations, right?)

518
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,346
Isn't it still just one sword?

519
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:00,505
You've been sitting here for long.

520
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:08,985
I know

521
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:11,386
that old monk made you upset today.

522
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:13,945
I'm not upset.

523
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:15,545
I'm really not upset at all.

524
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:19,808
Bufan.

525
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:21,346
It's okay.

526
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:24,066
There are few people
like him in the world.

527
00:30:25,386 --> 00:30:26,265
The world is too vast.

528
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:29,985
Martial Uncle Mo Kun showed me
the Sanyin Sword.

529
00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:33,545
Du E let me witness the legacy
of the Southern Shaolin.

530
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:37,225
He said when the sword
of Bodhi Department is drawn,

531
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:38,586
no one can fight back.

532
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:40,586
But our swordsmanship

533
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:42,146
is overly complicated.

534
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:44,906
I can understand

535
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:46,465
what he said.

536
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:48,225
And it makes sense to me.

537
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:49,586
Bufan.

538
00:30:50,505 --> 00:30:52,146
I'm really not sad at all.

539
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,225
I want to find the Altar Treasure
as soon as possible

540
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:56,386
and get the martial arts manuals inside.

541
00:30:57,826 --> 00:30:59,626
I want to make Rongtian Swordsmanship

542
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:00,545
different.

543
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:02,985
When the Rongtian Sword is drawn,

544
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:04,705
no one can fight back.

545
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:06,386
You can do it.

546
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:07,906
I trust you.

547
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:10,305
Right.

548
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,586
So, why should I be sad?

549
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:16,225
This is the real you.

550
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:17,906
This is Zhuo Bufan.

551
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,346
You refuse to lose.

552
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,225
You always win.

553
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:25,545
Even when facing someone stronger,

554
00:31:25,545 --> 00:31:26,945
you will feel more excited.

555
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:30,146
Back at the main altar,

556
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,586
you wanted
to challenge a famous swordsman,

557
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:34,545
As I saw you off,

558
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:36,066
I said that you would win.

559
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:38,465
You said something to me.

560
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:41,025
A broad chest harbors soaring clouds.

561
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:42,705
Determined eyes track the homing birds.

562
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:45,785
I asked if that meant
you would be victorious.

563
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:47,985
And you smiled and left.

564
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:50,785
I asked seniors about the meaning,

565
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:51,866
but they didn't know either.

566
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:53,945
After that,

567
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,745
I asked many people
before I finally understood.

568
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:59,066
Since then,

569
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:02,545
I've known you're a man
standing at the summit.

570
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,106
From the first step out of the gate,

571
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:08,225
you're a swordsman
who will reach the highest peak.

572
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:10,386
Bufan.

573
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,106
I believe

574
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:14,465
your swordsmanship will be famous.

575
00:32:22,386 --> 00:32:22,945
You two.

576
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:25,225
Could we stop sitting like this now?

577
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:26,305
It's tiring.

578
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:29,945
If anyone sees you,

579
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:32,705
you can explain
you're pursuing pleasure.

580
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,745
My hands are getting tired.

581
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:35,945
You're a martial artist.

582
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:37,225
Why are you worn out so soon?

583
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:38,945
You just mentioned

584
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:40,785
that Liu Lin came into the Futu Temple

585
00:32:40,785 --> 00:32:42,146
with Men Sandao.

586
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:42,720
That's right.

587
00:32:43,985 --> 00:32:45,426
It seems that Liu Lin

588
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:47,386
has useful clues.

589
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,305
Otherwise, Men Sandao
couldn't have taken her with him.

590
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:53,066
What's Zhuo Bufan's next plan?

591
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,066
To go to Shuntian.

592
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:55,505
First, report to Prince Qi.

593
00:32:56,386 --> 00:32:58,626
Second, Zhuo Bufan wants to find out

594
00:32:58,626 --> 00:32:59,586
more information,

595
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:02,186
trying to find

596
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:03,626
the remaining seal.

597
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:04,586
Third,

598
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:07,985
Men Sandao is likely
to return to the capital.

599
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:10,785
So, Zhuo Bufan also wants

600
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:13,586
to seize the seal from Men Sandao.

601
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:23,616
Shall we talk?

602
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:25,666
I dare not.

603
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,985
I remember your punishment.

604
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,386
It's good.

605
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:31,106
You are a rebel against the court.

606
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:32,666
I am an imperial guard,

607
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,545
a hound.

608
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:35,906
Right.

609
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:37,186
I'm a rebel

610
00:33:37,186 --> 00:33:38,985
who is falling into your hands.

611
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,866
I will be killed in the end, right?

612
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:41,626
What's there to fear?

613
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:42,666
Just be beheaded.

614
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,626
Revolutionaries don't
care about life anyway?

615
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:55,586
Sir...

616
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:57,186
Call me Hound.

617
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:58,186
Hound.

618
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:00,146
You are not an ordinary hound.

619
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,505
You don't want to treat me this way.

620
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:03,945
Even if I am not afraid to die,

621
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,305
you still cherish my life.

622
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:07,265
Are you really not afraid

623
00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:08,305
of death?

624
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,985
Are you gonna say

625
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:10,906
if I reveal the secret

626
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:12,705
of the Bodhi Seal,

627
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,186
you will immediately let me go?

628
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,386
You'll personally escort me to the dock,

629
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:18,945
buy me a ship ticket to Hong Kong, China
or Southeast Asia,

630
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:20,385
escort me away safely,

631
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,466
and give me some money

632
00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:23,785
as a token of your goodwill.

633
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:25,265
What a pity.

634
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:26,825
You're a revolutionary.

635
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:28,506
Saving your life can't tempt you.

636
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:29,946
Moreover,

637
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:31,825
the lives of revolutionaries

638
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:33,946
cannot be measured by money.

639
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:35,745
Your original mission

640
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:37,026
was to protect Tan Xian

641
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:39,546
and safely hand over the Altar Treasure
to Tongmenghui.

642
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,865
What is this treasure for?

643
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:43,200
It's for the revolution.

644
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,705
It's to overthrow
the Qing Imperial Court,

645
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:47,186
that is, the decaying court.

646
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,146
How could you possibly reveal the secret

647
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:50,666
to me, a hound?

648
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:53,425
In the Futu Temple,

649
00:34:53,745 --> 00:34:55,705
both you and I know the situation
about the Altar Treasure.

650
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:58,425
Zhuo Bufan has the Discipline Seal.

651
00:34:58,425 --> 00:35:00,745
Merely with the Bodhi Seal,

652
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,506
I surely can't find the treasure.

653
00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:03,146
Exactly.

654
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:04,905
The Department

655
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,705
has openly looked for the treasure

656
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:08,546
for over a century,

657
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,705
but they failed
because the treasure map was incomplete.

658
00:35:11,385 --> 00:35:12,506
Even if Tongmenghui

659
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:14,066
has half of the treasure map,

660
00:35:14,066 --> 00:35:15,466
we can only search furtively.

661
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:17,586
I'm afraid
it will take hundreds of years.

662
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:18,865
Then the revolution is hopeless.

663
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:19,705
Exactly.

664
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:21,666
This treasure map means nothing

665
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,546
to me and Tongmenghui.

666
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:25,986
I might as well trade it
for my life or freedom.

667
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,425
This is all for my own good.

668
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,225
If I lose my life for
such an insignificant thing,

669
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:33,265
I'll be helpless to the revolution.

670
00:35:33,905 --> 00:35:35,345
It's no use talking about these.

671
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:37,986
Even if I threaten to kill you,
you still won't tell me.

672
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,546
You must think now

673
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:41,425
that my master Cheng Yu,
the chief inheritor

674
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:42,825
of the Southern Shaolin,

675
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:44,586
is such a fool.

676
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:45,546
He chose me,

677
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,345
a hound,

678
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,586
as his inheritor.

679
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:50,146
Don't belittle yourself.

680
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:52,626
Since I'm so obstinate

681
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:53,705
and unenlightened,

682
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:55,506
you might have to keep me by your side.

683
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:56,946
Anyway, you don't think I'm a burden.

684
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,785
If you don't care, why should I?

685
00:35:58,785 --> 00:36:00,066
It's for my own good.

686
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,146
I'm a rebel.

687
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:03,385
If others catch me,

688
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:04,865
I'll be interrogated and punished.

689
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:06,186
I'll suffer torment.

690
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:07,146
It doesn't work.

691
00:36:07,146 --> 00:36:08,946
You're not even afraid of death.

692
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,506
So you've never told anyone

693
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:14,506
that I'm the one
who holds the secret of the Bodhi Seal.

694
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,265
Even your subordinates

695
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,865
and Beiyang Army
you're working with didn't know it.

696
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:20,345
I haven't told them,

697
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,026
because I want to keep this secret.

698
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:23,785
If others find it out,

699
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:25,825
more people will keep an eye on you.

700
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:28,345
If so, I'll be distracted.

701
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,066
So no worries.

702
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:32,305
I won't tell anyone you're the inheritor

703
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:33,146
of the Bodhi Department.

704
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,865
I'll not cause you any trouble.

705
00:36:38,026 --> 00:36:39,506
Talking with a clever person like you

706
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:40,626
is quite troublesome.

707
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:42,626
You've said everything I wanted to say.

708
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:44,745
Haven't you said what I wanted to say?

709
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:52,305
You really can't tell me?

710
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:57,865
I'm truly not afraid of death.

711
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:13,385
Don't move.

712
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,066
Miss Lin.

713
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:16,905
I can do it myself.

714
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,568
I...

715
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:20,986
I can't help you with the big matters,

716
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,546
but I can help you with small things.

717
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:25,792
Be good.

718
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:26,912
Don't move.

719
00:37:29,026 --> 00:37:29,626
Okay.

720
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:30,666
I-I won't move.

721
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,506
Go on.

722
00:37:34,905 --> 00:37:35,546
Say what?

723
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:39,186
You don't trust him?

724
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:45,425
Muqing is a gentleman.

725
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:46,905
If he hides the information

726
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,865
of secret treasure from me,

727
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:49,705
I can understand.

728
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:52,586
Aren't you two cooperating?

729
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:54,546
It doesn't mean sharing everything.

730
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,466
If he wants to capture Zhuo Bufan,

731
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,146
isn't it a good thing for you?

732
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,066
His goal is to find the treasure.

733
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:05,946
If Zhuo Bufan is caught by him,

734
00:38:05,946 --> 00:38:07,506
in exchange for the seal,

735
00:38:08,305 --> 00:38:09,865
Muqing will certainly agree

736
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:10,745
to release Zhuo Bufan.

737
00:38:12,345 --> 00:38:13,186
Will he?

738
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:13,905
Yes, he will.

739
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,946
Muqing does appreciate me,

740
00:38:17,785 --> 00:38:18,865
but that's all.

741
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:21,146
In major issues,

742
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:21,905
he has no choice.

743
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:23,425
You are right.

744
00:38:24,865 --> 00:38:27,425
If Zhuo Bufan collaborates
with the Imperial Household Department,

745
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:30,905
he could use them to eliminate you.

746
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:34,265
So I must find Zhuo Bufan first

747
00:38:34,986 --> 00:38:35,986
to take the advantage.

748
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:38,106
Fortunately,

749
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:39,785
you have Beiyang Army's guns.

750
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:42,825
Beiyang Army is
looking for the treasure too.

751
00:38:43,385 --> 00:38:45,066
After finding the treasure,
Beiyang Army can work

752
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:47,705
with the Imperial Household Department.

753
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:50,186
After all, they all serve the court.

754
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:55,466
I have let Ding Yu send people
to investigate it,

755
00:38:56,026 --> 00:38:58,425
but there are no traces
of people from the Rongtian Ridge.

756
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:00,626
I don't know where they will go.

757
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:04,066
Doesn't the Department look for them?

758
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:07,986
I guess Muqing
deliberately doesn't look for them.

759
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:10,905
As Muqing said,

760
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:12,146
there are two seals.

761
00:39:12,146 --> 00:39:13,705
Zhuo Bufan certainly needs the one

762
00:39:13,705 --> 00:39:14,946
in Muqing's hands.

763
00:39:15,506 --> 00:39:17,546
Didn't he find nothing at Futu Temple?

764
00:39:19,265 --> 00:39:20,466
Even I don't believe it,

765
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,865
let alone Zhuo Bufan.

766
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:24,506
And Muqing knows

767
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:25,986
Zhuo Bufan won't believe it.

768
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:27,785
Therefore,

769
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:30,745
Muqing is waiting for Zhuo Bufan
to come to him.

770
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:33,146
But Zhuo Bufan doesn't go to him.

771
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:34,986
I don't think

772
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:36,626
Zhuo Bufan is afraid of Muqing

773
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:38,546
or the masters in the imperial yamen.

774
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:40,106
Will he be wary of you?

775
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:41,186
You have a gun, after all.

776
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:43,345
At first, I thought so too.

777
00:39:43,345 --> 00:39:44,705
But later I don't think so.

778
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:47,785
Although Zhuo Bufan is wary of our guns,

779
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:48,825
he's not afraid.

780
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:51,225
Treasure matters to him.

781
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,026
He can't be afraid.

782
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:53,946
So...

783
00:39:53,946 --> 00:39:54,745
So,

784
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:57,385
Zhuo Bufan should have more clues.

785
00:39:58,745 --> 00:40:00,626
Though he gets nothing from Futu Temple,

786
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:02,586
he won't give up.

787
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:04,066
Since what happened in Shanghai,

788
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:06,345
the Rongtian Ridge has been acting

789
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:07,705
ahead of the Department.

790
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,905
Is Zhuo Bufan waiting for Muqing
to come to him?

791
00:40:11,026 --> 00:40:12,385
Zhuo Bufan is proud.

792
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:14,186
He will not think that way.

793
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:15,466
Moreover,

794
00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:19,506
I don't
want the Imperial Household Department

795
00:40:19,506 --> 00:40:20,506
to meet with Rongtian Ridge.

796
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:22,705
After all, they might cooperate.

797
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:25,146
It's such a large treasure.

798
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:27,466
If the Rongtian Ridge gets a bit of it,

799
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:30,026
I'm afraid it will suffice for them.

800
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:33,546
I think

801
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:35,905
I should find Zhuo Bufan
and the others first.

802
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:37,345
That's good.

803
00:40:38,026 --> 00:40:39,385
In the beginning,

804
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:40,745
my target is Zhuo Bufan

805
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,186
and the Rongtian Ridge.

806
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:00,066
Besides,

807
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:03,825
I've promised you

808
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:07,265
I'll bring the murderers to justice.

809
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:13,506
I've always believed in you.

810
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:34,385
According to Zhuangzi,

811
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,345
a fish trap is used to catch fish.

812
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,026
After that, you forgot the trap.

813
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,586
You're such an untrustworthy person.

814
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:41,865
What are you talking about?

815
00:41:42,506 --> 00:41:43,865
You forgot the trap.

816
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:44,946
I mean,

817
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:46,905
you cast me aside after using me

818
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,066
and broke your promise.

819
00:41:48,745 --> 00:41:49,986
You repaid kindness with enmity,

820
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:51,345
and burned bridges.

821
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:52,466
So were you used

822
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:53,546
or I burned bridges?

823
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:56,106
It doesn't matter.

824
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:57,066
What's important is you.

825
00:41:57,385 --> 00:41:58,905
You're so ungrateful.

826
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:02,825
Without me,
could you think of the Futu Temple?

827
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,586
Without me, could you
have obtained the crucial clues?

828
00:42:05,986 --> 00:42:07,225
Right now,

829
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,586
you even refuse to see me.

830
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:09,265
Don't forget

831
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:11,066
we used to share one bed.

832
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:12,106
Now,

833
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:13,186
we talk through a window.

834
00:42:15,305 --> 00:42:16,946
I can see nothing through this window.

835
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:21,385
Lin Haohan.

836
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:23,745
I know what you're thinking.

837
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:25,705
Let me tell you the truth.

838
00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:27,425
There is no treasure in the Futu Temple.

839
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,066
I knew it.

840
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:31,186
The treasure is definitely not there.

841
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:33,066
So give up.

842
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:34,705
Miss Liu.

843
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:37,865
Have you forgotten who I am?

844
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:39,186
I have sharp eyes

845
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:40,865
for treasures.

846
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:42,666
You uttered the passphrase

847
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:44,506
and entered the temple with Men Sandao.

848
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:46,146
But what happened after you came out?

849
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,385
He didn't kill you.

850
00:42:47,385 --> 00:42:48,626
Nor did he send you to prison.

851
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,186
Don't tell me

852
00:42:51,546 --> 00:42:53,106
the Buddhist has changed him.

853
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:57,865
I am a smart person.

854
00:42:58,106 --> 00:42:59,425
I'm very clever.

855
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:00,986
On second thoughts,

856
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,905
I figured it out.

857
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,946
The one who obtained the secret
at the Futu Temple

858
00:43:05,946 --> 00:43:06,865
is only you.

859
00:43:07,225 --> 00:43:09,305
Men Sandao knows nothing at all.

860
00:43:10,225 --> 00:43:12,385
So after we left the Futu Temple,

861
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:14,186
he had to keep you by his side,

862
00:43:14,186 --> 00:43:15,785
waiting for you to spill out the secret.

863
00:43:16,186 --> 00:43:16,736
Or you need

864
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:19,106
to lead him to the next place.

865
00:43:19,705 --> 00:43:20,946
So now,

866
00:43:20,946 --> 00:43:23,425
you absolutely cannot escape.

867
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:28,345
You are Men Sandao's important captive.

868
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:29,066
Miss Liu.

869
00:43:29,946 --> 00:43:31,225
We've traveled together all this way.

870
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:34,186
You know my character.

871
00:43:37,586 --> 00:43:39,466
I have no character at all.

872
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:40,986
I only want money.

873
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,265
Between money and women,
I definitely choose money.

874
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:46,986
So for the sake of money, I've decided

875
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:53,345
to join the Tongmenghui.

876
00:43:54,986 --> 00:43:55,520
So,

877
00:43:56,626 --> 00:43:57,785
I am your companion.

878
00:43:58,265 --> 00:43:59,946
You can tell me the secret.

879
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:02,666
I will help you find the treasure.

880
00:44:11,586 --> 00:44:13,026
Trust me.

881
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,106
Even if you don't trust me,

882
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:15,865
you must believe in the power
of the treasure.

883
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:18,146
Once I find the treasure,

884
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:21,506
on behalf of you, I will hand it over
to our people

885
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:23,265
and our leader,

886
00:44:24,106 --> 00:44:24,986
Mr. Sun.

887
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:31,680
I only want a 20 percent of share.

888
00:44:34,745 --> 00:44:35,905
Liu Lin.

889
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:37,865
You have your beliefs.

890
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:39,705
And you should trust me.

891
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:41,705
I have faith too.

892
00:44:43,345 --> 00:44:45,705
Money is my faith.

893
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:56,865
Liu Lin.

894
00:44:57,626 --> 00:44:58,666
Please believe

895
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:01,946
that the darkness is temporary.

896
00:45:02,986 --> 00:45:05,026
Darkness will eventually be broken
by dawn.

897
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,265
Dawn is coming.

898
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:18,066
If you think 20 percent is a bit much,

899
00:45:18,506 --> 00:45:19,425
10 percent

900
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,626
is also okay.

901
00:45:20,626 --> 00:45:21,466
