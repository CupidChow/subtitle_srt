1
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,039
(Sanyin Sword)
(Knowing past lives denotes Fate Level.)

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,879
(Predicting the future
denotes Vision Level.)

3
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,039
(Eliminating hassle
denotes Clearance Level.)

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,600
(Passing three levels leads to Sanda.)

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,679
(Fang Junyu,
the previous dynasty's swordsman,)

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,879
(created the Sanda Sword
based on Buddhism.)

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,240
(His disciple, Master Shi Qugu,)

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,759
(converted to the Southern Shaolin)

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,880
(and became the chief
of the Bodhi Department.)

10
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,399
(He evolves the swordsmanship
with three signs)

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,880
(into the Sanyin Sword.)

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,759
(The first move,)

13
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,159
(Wuchang.)

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
(The Wuchang Technique is concise.)

15
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,640
(Its core lies)

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,479
(in finding the enemy's flaws)

17
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,640
(to conquer them.)

18
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,200
(Always let the opponent strike first.)

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,600
If a swordsman

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,200
makes powerful and stunning moves,

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,799
the point is not to draw the sword

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,359
but to conceal it.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,000
Before the sword is unsheathed,

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,439
no one knows where it will strike

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,879
or the direction of the attack.

26
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,040
Thus, there are no flaws.

27
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,920
No one can escape.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,480
Find the flaw and strike swiftly.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,680
And the outcome becomes clear.

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,079
Next, the attack path
is a spiral straight line.

31
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,480
How to achieve
the ultimate attack speed?

32
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,480
The distance between the sword blade
and the flaw

33
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,040
is the shortest straight line.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,920
Wuchang Technique's attack path

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,519
must be a direct line.

36
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,280
Between the two points,

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,560
the fastest is neither an arc
nor a straight line

38
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,879
but a spiral straight line.

39
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,519
So when the Wuchang Technique
is executed,

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,400
the wrist performs a rotation
close to a full circle,

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
moving in a spiral straight line

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,360
to maximize speed and destructive power.

43
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,240
The second move, Wuwo.

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,360
Martial arts philosophy originates
from the principle of Wuwo.

45
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
Respond with a single technique.

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,639
Meet myriad changes with constancy.

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,159
The Wuwo Technique
is the strongest defensive move.

48
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,560
Since it is defensive,

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,840
it demands the largest defensive area.

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
For a sword,

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,599
it can be seen as a line.

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,479
Dots move to form a line.

53
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,560
Lines move to form a surface.

54
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,680
And a circle

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,159
is the largest shape it can be.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,919
Constant rotation
increases its gravity acceleration.

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,800
While defending,

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,240
we turn the opponent's attack
into a reactive force.

59
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,599
(The third move,)

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
(Nirvana.)

61
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,840
(The martial arts philosophy originates
from the tranquility of nirvana.)

62
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,360
(The core strategy lies
in rapid change.)

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,639
(In the moment of action,)

64
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,439
(the sword's path
takes various changes.)

65
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,000
(Each change conceals a deadly threat,)

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,719
(leaving the opponent no opportunity
to respond.)

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
(The merit of the Wuchang Technique)

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,439
(lies in its concept-oriented approach.)

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,879
(Operating the swordsmanship
through subtle tactics.)

70
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,479
(A learner with basics can do it.)

71
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,919
(There's no need to practice
for years or even decades.)

72
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,240
(There are no requirements
for physical fitness or inner strength.)

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,199
(However, Wuwo and Nirvana Technique
cannot be quickly mastered.)

74
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,800
(One must practice daily
to make incremental progress.)

75
00:05:56,224 --> 00:06:00,416
=Heroes=

76
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,840
=Episode 21=

77
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:07,538
(21st day of the fourth month, 1911)

78
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,160
(Grain in Ear is 19 days away)

79
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,519
Sir, take care.

80
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,120
Sirs.

81
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,000
Please come in.

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,879
The bill, please.

83
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,639
Coming.

84
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,439
Sirs.

85
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,519
Your tea.

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,680
Enjoy.

87
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,800
Muqing.

88
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
You seem quite calm.

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
Do you think
I should be torn with anxiety?

90
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,639
I have worked
with Mr. Cunqing for many years.

91
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,319
He must be anxious now.

92
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,879
The Grain in Ear is coming soon.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,399
If we can't find it,

94
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,959
Zhuo Bufan can't find it either.

95
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,040
It's no use to be anxious.

96
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,879
It's the same for Zhuo Bufan.

97
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,800
Last night,

98
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
I re-deduced the entire incident.

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,920
We made no mistakes or omissions

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,800
throughout the process.

101
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,399
So we need new clues

102
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,680
to continue forward.

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
The same goes for Zhuo Bufan.

104
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,879
Speaking of which,

105
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,160
Zhuo Bufan and the people behind him

106
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,360
are more anxious than us
and Mr. Cunqing.

107
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,519
After several battles,

108
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,480
the leverage in his hands

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,800
is still the Discipline Seal.

110
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,399
But now we know

111
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,600
that there are not only one

112
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,959
or two seals.

113
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,360
So, regarding the clues for the treasure

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,680
Zhuo Bufan has made no progress

115
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,879
and not gained any advantage at all.

116
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,600
We seemed to return without success.

117
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,399
In fact, we've ascertained
all the forces involved.

118
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,079
I've also kept Liu Lin by my side.

119
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,839
If we can't get information,

120
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,759
others won't either.

121
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,279
If someone
from Tongmenghui finds Liu Lin,

122
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,920
we can take the chance
to catch them all at once.

123
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,879
That's right.

124
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,160
Zhuo Bufan is definitely eager
to find the seal.

125
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,199
And the people behind him
will be eager to help him.

126
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,240
They're anxious,

127
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
so we don't need to be.

128
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,079
We're not waiting for the fruit

129
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,879
but we're waiting at ease.

130
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,399
It's the best choice right now.

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,319
I have no clues.

132
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,319
You have

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
been there.

134
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,639
After the Imperial Household Department
failed in treasure hunting,

135
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,079
this matter is on hold.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,959
And the records are ambiguous.

137
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,360
I don't believe

138
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,680
that there's no chance

139
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
to find the treasure.

140
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,480
You're right.

141
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,920
To be frank,

142
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,879
there is one thing,

143
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,279
but it's not a clue.

144
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,000
An old story.

145
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,399
You can investigate it.

146
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,879
What is it?

147
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,759
Xu He, the chief inheritor

148
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,080
of the Disciplinary Department
of Southern Shaolin, turned to the court.

149
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
He told me something.

150
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,639
He said

151
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,840
that he had seen the third generation
of Dharma Department's chief inheritor.

152
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,080
The inheritor was a Nian rebel.

153
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,559
In 1865,

154
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,759
it was he

155
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,919
who killed Sengge Rinchen

156
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,840
during the Caozhou battle

157
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,320
against the elite Mongolian cavalry.

158
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
In 1868,

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,679
the Eastern Nian Rebellion was besieged
by Li Hongzhang's Huai Army.

160
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,039
The breakout failed,

161
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,759
and the army was annihilated.

162
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,360
At that time, the inheritor
was seriously injured.

163
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,000
He turned to his fellow.

164
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,600
But he did not know

165
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,600
that his fellow had sided
with the court.

166
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,399
So right after the inheritor
entered his house,

167
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,519
the people from the Department arrived.

168
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,519
Six masters led dozens of guards

169
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,480
to ambush him.

170
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,399
(However, the inheritor's kung fu
was formidable.)

171
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,039
(He was wounded)

172
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,399
(in the ambush)

173
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,960
(but resisted desperately.)

174
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,559
(He killed the defected chief
of the Disciplinary Department)

175
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,360
(and many guards.)

176
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,759
(He escaped from the hands)

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,200
(of the six masters.)

178
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,039
(The six masters chased after him)

179
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,000
(all the way to Tianning Temple
in Dongying.)

180
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,440
(Eventually, in the nearby suburbs,)

181
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,559
(they intercepted him.)

182
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,600
(Both sides engaged in a bloody battle.)

183
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,559
(Four of the six masters died.)

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,039
(The inheritor was struck
by 19 strokes,)

185
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,200
(fell into the river,
and was swept away by the water.)

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,240
By the water?

187
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
They didn't find his body?

188
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,432
No.

189
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,039
Fall into the river?

190
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,960
So no one knows if he is dead or alive.

191
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,879
Yes.

192
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,840
How skilled were the six masters

193
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,320
in martial arts?

194
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
One of them

195
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,440
is Luan Yi,
the later high-ranking imperial guard.

196
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,679
The other one

197
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,360
is me.

198
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
A master, indeed.

199
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,080
Back then, to avoid future troubles,

200
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,720
Luan Yi and I

201
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,279
searched along the river for many days

202
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,679
till the estuary.

203
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,200
But we did not find his body.

204
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:58,039
But when you reported back
to the Imperial Household Department,

205
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,559
you said you killed that person.

206
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,879
We were young and afraid of punishment.

207
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,519
After all,
it was a complete annihilation.

208
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,679
If we could not kill that person,

209
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
we were to blame.

210
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,639
Over these 43 years,

211
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,679
Luan Yi and I have always felt

212
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,240
that we failed to kill that inheritor.

213
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,639
It's been over 40 years.

214
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,919
Even if that person is still alive,

215
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,159
he should be
in his sixties or seventies.

216
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,159
So,

217
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,159
this is not a clue.

218
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,840
It's just an old story.

219
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,600
You brought it up.

220
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,360
Because it's an old issue,

221
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,240
it may not have been properly resolved.

222
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,759
Your Highness is wise.

223
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
Dharma's chief.

224
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,840
Dharma Seal.

225
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,399
Investigate it in the Tianjin Presidio.

226
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,840
This person's surname is Zhang.

227
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,960
If he's still alive,

228
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,320
he should be
in his sixties or seventies.

229
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,039
I have already

230
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,879
found the clue you wanted.

231
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,399
May I meet the two surviving masters
from the imperial yamen?

232
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
The two people

233
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,559
didn't die 43 years ago.

234
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,279
Do you think
they could still be alive now?

235
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,799
Since it's an incomplete clue
from 43 years ago, how do I

236
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,039
continue the investigation?

237
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,759
Zhao Fu.

238
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,816
Your Highness.

239
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,320
Your Highness.

240
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,600
Get to the point.

241
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,240
I used to be a clerk
in the Tianjin Presidio.

242
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,159
20 years ago,

243
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,440
I joined the annals of the counties
surrounding Tianjin Presidio.

244
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,080
On the outskirts of Wuqing County,

245
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,679
I ran into an old madman.

246
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,120
He was delirious.

247
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,399
But he told people
that he was a martial arts expert,

248
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,399
a grandmaster,

249
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,879
thus he became a laughingstock.

250
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,279
I was interested in him.

251
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:01,879
So I observed him.

252
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,080
I happened to see him catching rabbits
in the wilderness.

253
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,679
He moved swiftly.

254
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,360
It's baffling.

255
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
The old lunatic

256
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,799
was homeless.

257
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,080
The wilderness,

258
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,240
ruins,

259
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,279
streets,

260
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,519
and the bushes

261
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,639
were all his shelter.

262
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,039
Some said

263
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,799
he painstakingly

264
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,480
picked fresh fruits

265
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,559
and took them to temples to pay respect.

266
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,480
I believe

267
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,919
he is not ordinary.

268
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,759
You may leave.

269
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,600
Such clues

270
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,840
are incomplete for you?

271
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,159
Sixi meatballs, crispy pork,

272
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,879
pork with sauce, sauteed shredded pork,

273
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,519
mixed vegetables,

274
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,720
and f-fried sheep fillet?

275
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,159
Give it a try.

276
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:00,960
Stir-fried pork.

277
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,759
We must try the roast duck.

278
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,960
Ding Yu.

279
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,080
There are just three of us.

280
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,159
Too much food.

281
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,159
It's alright.

282
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,080
Pea flour pastry,
fried stuffed bun, Rolling Donkey,

283
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,000
and Douzhi.

284
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,720
How about it?

285
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,919
Waiter!

286
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,360
We're ordering dishes.

287
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,159
Coming.

288
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:18,679
Sirs.

289
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,440
Listen.

290
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,919
Sixi meatballs,

291
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,759
crispy pork.

292
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,304
Wait a moment.

293
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,440
I saw an old acquaintance.

294
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:31,296
(Baoxinglong)

295
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,960
Senior.

296
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,559
Senior.

297
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,039
Greetings.

298
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,039
Who is your senior?

299
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,279
You have saved my life twice.

300
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,039
I am grateful to you.

301
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,960
That's because you shouldn't die.

302
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,279
I just came across you.

303
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,720
I didn't mean to save you.

304
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,039
Whether it was an unintentional act

305
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,039
or not,

306
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
you saved me, anyway.

307
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,919
You've come from Shanxi
to the capital so quickly.

308
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:06,000
Have you caught the person
you are after?

309
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,600
Not yet.

310
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,879
The people I'm after
have also come to the capital.

311
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,840
But I still haven't found them.

312
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
I ask for your advice.

313
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,840
On what?

314
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
You helped me twice.

315
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,480
Otherwise,
I couldn't have had any clues.

316
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,360
Although I don't know who you are

317
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,360
or what you're up to.

318
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,080
I can't deny
that you've been helping me.

319
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,399
When I don't know what to do now,

320
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,240
you appear.

321
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,799
Aren't you here to give me advice?

322
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,039
You can't be just a local constable.

323
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,639
You should go home.

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,679
Yes.

325
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,200
Once the case is closed, I will go home.

326
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,519
Didn't you ask me to enlighten you?

327
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm telling you to go home.

328
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,159
You're too slow.

329
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,279
Must I spell it out for you?

330
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,919
Go back to Dagu.

331
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,480
The person you're chasing is there.

332
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,279
Zhuo Bufan has gone to Dagu?

333
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,480
The case started from Dagu,
and he has returned there.

334
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,840
This is...

335
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,720
Don't ask me.

336
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,279
Figure it out yourself.

337
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:07,879
Senior.

338
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,159
You must know a lot.

339
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,080
Can you tell me more?

340
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,840
The future is unpredictable.

341
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,519
Hard times make people gloomy.

342
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,759
You bear a mission
and a heavy responsibility.

343
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,120
Wang Jialuo.

344
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,279
You must survive.

345
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,864
Senior.

346
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,960
The Douzhi tastes terrible.

347
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,919
I've arranged everything.

348
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,799
Your assignment to the south

349
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,919
has also been issued.

350
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,480
Set off as soon as possible.

351
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,640
Yes.

352
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,480
Do you understand

353
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,720
the arrangement?

354
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,480
I understand.

355
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,480
You ask me to leave

356
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,240
to wait...

357
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,119
When the rebellion starts,

358
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,319
I can avoid suspicion.

359
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,559
That's right.

360
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,839
At the same time,
you can command the troops

361
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,519
in the south to back me up.

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,079
If bad things happen,

363
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,480
I'll have a way out.

364
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,920
Everything will

365
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,920
go smoothly.

366
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
I've always felt

367
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,359
the Altar Treasure
will eventually reappear

368
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,200
in Fujian.

369
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,640
So when thinking whether you should go
to Jiangsu and Zhejiang,

370
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,680
or Fujian,

371
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,920
after careful consideration,

372
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,480
I decided

373
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,319
to let you go to Fujian.

374
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,279
Father.

375
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,319
And the people you sent
to track down the Altar Treasure?

376
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,319
Zhuo Bufan failed at Futu Temple.

377
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,799
The clues there fell

378
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,039
into the hands
of the Imperial Household Department.

379
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,480
Don't worry.

380
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,640
The item is
with the Imperial Household Department.

381
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,559
It's not hard to get it.

382
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,200
However, unexpectedly,

383
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,279
Zhuo Bufan sent me a message.

384
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,920
I originally thought

385
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,640
that finding the other half
of the treasure map

386
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,279
would reveal the truth.

387
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,519
But now I know

388
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,359
there are three parts
to the treasure map.

389
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,799
Did Zhuo Bufan find out

390
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,039
the whereabouts of the third map?

391
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,200
There's a slight possibility

392
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,160
that it's in the Tianjin Presidio.

393
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,039
Zhuo Bufan went to investigate it.

394
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,920
Tianjin happens to
be where my troops are stationed.

395
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,680
Should I arrange for someone
to check it out?

396
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,359
No.

397
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,799
Just pretend you know nothing.

398
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,400
Beiyang is already taking action

399
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,599
on the treasure.

400
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,319
If you act,

401
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,440
it will attract a lot of attention.

402
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,160
And it might even

403
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,839
alert the opposition.

404
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,920
I used outsiders

405
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,720
just to avoid arousing suspicion.

406
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,200
Is Zhuo Bufan reliable?

407
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,480
There are no reliable people

408
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,599
but reliable leverages.

409
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,839
Your father-in-law
sent Zhuo Bufan to Tianjin?

410
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:35,960
Yes.

411
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,200
I see.

412
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,279
You don't need to worry about it.

413
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,440
Someone is on it.

414
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,480
Mr. Xie.

415
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,720
Do I need to send someone...?

416
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,264
No need.

417
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,960
Someone is
in charge of the secret treasure.

418
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,920
You don't have to intervene.

419
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,119
Do you know

420
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,759
why your father-in-law wanted you
to go to Fujian

421
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,759
and we agreed to let you go?

422
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,568
I don't know.

423
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,880
If I don't trust you,

424
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,160
can you be transferred to Fujian

425
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:16,480
so quickly?

426
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,519
Beiyang fully trusts you.

427
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,079
Your transfer to Fujian

428
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,319
seems like your father-in-law's move.

429
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,680
But actually, it's our biggest chip.

430
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,680
Don't ruin the whole plan

431
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,359
for some trivial matters.

432
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,839
Understood.

433
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,319
Thanks for your advice.

434
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,240
Men Sandao kept Liu Lin

435
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,839
by his side

436
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,599
instead of sending her
to the Ministry of Justice.

437
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,039
It means this woman

438
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,279
surely holds some important secrets.

439
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:51,559
Men Sandao cannot always
keep her by his side.

440
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,039
He can't take her
with him to the palace.

441
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,440
Are you thinking of abducting her?

442
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
This woman

443
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,920
probably will not cooperate
with Men Sandao.

444
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,680
It makes sense.

445
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,839
Men Sandao has to

446
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,920
keep her with him.

447
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,839
He can't get the information
he wants to know.

448
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,319
We can try the hallucinogen.

449
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,119
Now that things have come to this,

450
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,079
perhaps

451
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,720
we can use it to get answers.

452
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,839
Yes.

453
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,519
Then I'll arrange it.

454
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,319
Be careful not to clash

455
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,240
with Men Sandao.

456
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,640
Be careful.

457
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,000
Help!

458
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,319
They don't seem like your people.

459
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,519
Perfect timing.

460
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,759
Let me try the blade.

461
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,960
(The first move, Wuchang.)

462
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,200
(The Wuchang Technique is concise.)

463
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,279
(The martial arts philosophy originates
from impermanent things.)

464
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,440
(Always let the opponent strike first.)

465
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,559
(Before the sword is unsheathed,)

466
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,880
(no one knows where it will strike)

467
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,240
(or the direction of the attack.)

468
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,480
(Thus, there are no flaws.)

469
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,640
(No one can escape.)

470
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,200
(How to achieve
the ultimate attack speed?)

471
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,000
(Between the two points,)

472
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,720
(the fastest is neither an arc)

473
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
(nor a straight line)

474
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,000
(but a spiral straight line.)

475
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,720
(The second move, Wuwo.)

476
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,799
(The Wuwo Technique
is the strongest defensive move.)

477
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,319
(Since it is defensive,
it demands the largest defensive area.)

478
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,440
(For a sword,)

479
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,240
(it can be seen as a line.)

480
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,240
(Dots move to form a line.
Lines move to form a surface.)

481
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,319
(Turn the square into a circle,)

482
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,680
(thus forming a powerful shield.)

483
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,559
Retreat.

484
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,039
You just utilized Sanyin Sword.

485
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,799
But I used a blade.

486
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,079
No wonder it's not powerful.

487
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,640
Isn't this powerful enough?

488
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
If so, why did you get hurt?

489
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,680
Bear with it.

490
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,759
Who are they?

491
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,480
Many people want to capture you,

492
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,559
like Rongtian Ridge,

493
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,559
the Japanese,

494
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,720
and maybe Beiyang.

495
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
They're not Beiyang Army.

496
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,599
Beiyang has guns.

497
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,519
You can't defeat guns.

498
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,559
Who knows?

499
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,440
It's not Rongtian Ridge either.

500
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,480
They don't have that many men.

501
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,279
Moreover,

502
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,920
you cannot beat Zhuo Bufan.

503
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,519
It's still uncertain.

504
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,559
Only the Japanese could use this.

505
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,039
You were quite good at hitting them.

506
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,279
They don't have any experts, right?

507
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,279
What are you saying?

508
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:17,880
Don't move.

509
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,880
They're also looking for the treasure?

510
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,720
Isn't that obvious...

511
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,160
Don't move. Bear the pain.

512
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,759
If I'm captured by the Japanese,

513
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,720
it's no different
from being imprisoned by you.

514
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,680
There's a huge difference.

515
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,160
If I find the secret treasure,

516
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,799
the court can restore and recover.

517
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,680
If Beiyang finds the secret treasure,

518
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,200
they will become even more arrogant.

519
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,200
But no matter who
finds the secret treasure,

520
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,519
it's no good for the Japanese.

521
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,359
So for them,

522
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,559
it's best if no one finds it.

523
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,839
If I were Japanese,

524
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,359
capturing you would be

525
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,440
more prudent than killing you.

526
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,200
Then why didn't they just kill me?

527
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,720
Everyone has greed.

528
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,200
Perhaps they wanted

529
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,400
to pry some secrets from you.

530
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,640
Have you studied medicine?

531
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,240
No.

532
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,880
I have treated the injuries

533
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,799
of my comrades.

534
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,720
Those injuries

535
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,400
were mostly caused

536
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,480
by the court's lapdogs like you.

537
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,640
Could you call us Hounds?

538
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Don't call me a lapdog.

539
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,119
That's too harsh.

540
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,400
You Reformists have great courage

541
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,160
but overestimate yourselves.

542
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,359
A hundred or even dozens of people

543
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,559
dare to start a rebellion?

544
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,799
The dynasty is over 100 years old.

545
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,480
With internal strife
and external threats,

546
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,519
the country's power is waning.

547
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,359
But it can't be overturned by Sun Wen,

548
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,200
a guy who fled overseas.

549
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,960
Nor reckless Reformists

550
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,079
can shake it.

551
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
It's just a minor wound.

552
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:51,880
It's not serious.

553
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,279
But if left unattended,

554
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,319
it will get infected and rot

555
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,440
in a few days.

556
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,240
If you keep ignoring it,

557
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,359
the arm will soon become useless

558
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,039
and be amputated.

559
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,440
If you don't treat it,

560
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,559
you will die as a result.

561
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,319
Mr. Sun and the revolutionaries

562
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,559
initiated revolts time and again.

563
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,319
Seemingly it only

564
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,359
causes a small wound.

565
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,880
But the court no longer knows

566
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,000
how to treat it.

567
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,440
One day,

568
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,559
this wound will spread.

569
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,960
It will grow larger

570
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,640
and ultimately be fatal.

571
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,519
It's like the difference
between you and me.

572
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,400
Mr. Muqing.

573
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,279
You are very powerful.

574
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,359
Your strength makes many people fear.

575
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
But I have never been afraid of you.

576
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,799
That is the power of revolution.

577
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,799
I know

578
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,240
I cannot shake you at this moment,

579
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,319
but I will never give up.

580
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,920
Even at the cost of my life, I will try.

581
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I firmly believe

582
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,920
that I will ultimately win.

583
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,559
What is the purpose of doing this?

584
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,839
Can you watch and do nothing

585
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,920
when the nation
and its people are in trouble?

586
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,960
Why did the reform occur
during Guangxu's regime?

587
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,920
Who will benefit?

588
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,119
Who will suffer losses from it?

589
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,839
Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao

590
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,039
used to talk about these questions

591
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,440
with the late Emperor.

592
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
The reform benefits the country

593
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,440
and the people

594
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,279
at the cost
of the imperial family's interests.

595
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,000
For this reason,

596
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,680
the reform only lasted 100 days.

597
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,680
I am Manchu.

598
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,960
Though I am Manchu,

599
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,119
I know

600
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,440
if the court still regards the state

601
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,839
as private property

602
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,440
and maintains the imperial system

603
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,279
instead of choosing constitutionalism,

604
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,799
the nation will ultimately fall.

605
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:40,680
Mr. Muqing.

606
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,160
I've said it many times

607
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,480
that you are not an ordinary hound.

608
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,759
In fact, you've admitted the need
for change.

609
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,400
You know it.

610
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,960
The current court is struggling.

611
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,559
Yet at this time, they still refuse to

612
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,680
give up the slightest benefits,

613
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,640
leading the nation
into a desperate situation.

614
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,319
This country is full of hope.

615
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,559
But the court is hopeless.

616
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,640
You must believe in Mr. Sun
and Tongmenghui.

617
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,279
I don't.

618
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,240
Sun Wen has neither troops nor guns.

619
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,000
He only has passionate

620
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,440
but mindless lunatics like you.

621
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,160
I do not believe that Tongmenghui

622
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,440
has the ability to change the nation.

623
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,240
I accept what you think.

624
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,640
But I do not accept what you do.

625
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,480
Striking a stone
with an egg yields no result.

626
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,319
You have instigated dozens of uprisings,
both large and small.

627
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,559
Each of them is a total failure

628
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,119
and a total annihilation.

629
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,039
After all this time,

630
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,920
what has changed?

631
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,640
Enlighten the people.

632
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,079
Every act of rebellion and struggle

633
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,359
enlightened the people.

634
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,160
Save it.

635
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,160
You really can't make it.

636
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:35,880
It's okay.

637
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,920
One day you will believe us.

638
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,440
Do you know that Prince Regent Zaifeng

639
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,039
is also actively
promoting constitutionalism?

640
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,519
And he has already twice

641
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,279
changed the scheduled date
for constitutionalism.

642
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,960
It's moved up from 1917 to 1913.

643
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,240
The court is not full of conservatives

644
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,440
trying to preserve their interests
like you think.

645
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,680
Some actively resort to the reform.

646
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,039
I'm bound to support constitutionalism.

647
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,519
But I will never allow you people

648
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,839
to attempt to overthrow the court.

649
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,119
I bear no malice towards you

650
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,319
because I know
you are not doing this for yourselves.

651
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,960
You do it all for the country
and the people.

652
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,480
But you are oversimplifying things

653
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,799
and acting too extremely.

654
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,079
If you want to serve the country
and the people,

655
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,440
just behave yourself.

656
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,640
Don't cause trouble for the court.

657
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:16,880
Prince Zaifeng...

658
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,319
Prince Zaifeng will
eradicate the internal strife

659
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,519
and promote constitutionalism.

660
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,839
Given that you dressed my wound,

661
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,880
I just gave you a chance
to talk about revolution.

662
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,240
If you say it again, see you

663
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,400
in the torture chamber.

664
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,359
Wait.

665
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,920
I didn't start it.

666
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,839
It was you.

667
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,319
You asked me if I had studied medicine.

668
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
I said I had helped my comrades

669
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
deal with injuries.

670
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,279
Then you just started nagging,

671
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:47,880
speaking ill

672
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,680
of Tongmenghui.

673
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,039
Considering your injury,

674
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,200
I just talked a little with you.

675
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,400
Now, you are finished

676
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,720
and then start to blame me?

677
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:55,960
Why are you angry?

678
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,440
I didn't say I was going to torture you.

679
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,559
You said you spare me this one.

680
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,319
Why?

681
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,279
You started it.

682
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,480
Why am I to blame?

683
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,720
Alright.

684
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,519
Pretend I never said it.

685
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
How could I?

686
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,680
You have already said it.

687
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,200
Can you take back your words?

688
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,119
So what do you want?

689
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,640
I'll save the chance for next time.

690
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,079
Look how petty you are.

691
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,519
You're all so small-minded.

692
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,599
Can you guys change the nation?

693
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,839
Make way.

694
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,240
A dozen or so men went with you, right?

695
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,039
15 people.

696
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,799
15 people couldn't beat one person?

697
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,039
Are the imperial guards so formidable?

698
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,640
I didn't expect Men Sandao's kung fu

699
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,759
to be so powerful.

700
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,400
Had I known this,

701
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,720
we should have killed Liu Lin.

702
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,880
Forget it.

703
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,319
You did your best. It's not your fault.

704
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,200
Men Sandao

705
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,960
is stronger than we thought.

706
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,200
Anyway, he can't keep Liu Lin

707
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,839
by his side every day.

708
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,119
We can find another opportunity.

709
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,559
Given Men Sandao's wisdom and ability,

710
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,359
we failed this time.

711
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,599
If we want to find another opportunity,

712
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,519
it will become very difficult.

713
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,079
I will send someone
to keep an eye on them.

714
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,390
(22nd day of the fourth month, 1911)

715
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,770
(Grain in Ear is 18 days away)

716
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,208
(Dagu, Tianjin)

717
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,359
You really are a scholar.

718
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,240
You just realize that?

719
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,000
When I'm not on official business,

720
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,240
I don't wear the constable's uniform.

721
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,799
With your outfit

722
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,240
and the books in this room,

723
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,400
if you don't tell,

724
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,440
who would know you're a constable?

725
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,079
My father has taught me to read
since I was little.

726
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,720
I've become used to it.

727
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,640
When I'm not busy,

728
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,160
I don't even know what to do
if I don't read.

729
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,240
Don't you practice martial arts?

730
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,079
Dagu is a small place.

731
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:11,839
There aren't many bad people.

732
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,144
Practicing martial arts
is more of a waste.

733
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,359
Sometimes I go to see my master.

734
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,599
I will practice with him.

735
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,559
He will admonish me.

736
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,519
How?

737
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,039
My master has a lisp.

738
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,880
He just hits me.

739
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,359
He will admonish me

740
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,400
if I don't practice hard.

741
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,920
Who is your master?

742
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,640
You're so powerful.

743
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,240
Your master must
be a martial arts expert.

744
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,119
I don't know.

745
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,480
I've asked him several times,
but he won't tell.

746
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,519
But I guess

747
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,640
he was a martial arts expert before.

748
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,599
Unfortunately, he injured his brain

749
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,880
and became deranged.

750
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,319
Now,

751
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,640
he doesn't even remember who he is.

752
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:06,440
In my second year as a constable,

753
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,199
I caught a few bandits.

754
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,920
I was awarded.

755
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,440
So I built a house for my master.

756
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,519
This one.

757
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,920
I thought if he lived closer to me,

758
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,440
I could take care of him.

759
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,519
Unexpectedly,

760
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,599
he just took a glance inside

761
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,840
and never went in again.

762
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,599
I failed to persuade him.

763
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,480
Fortunately, his kung fu is great.

764
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:30,239
So running around hasn't been a problem.

765
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,960
That's why I occasionally go to see him

766
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,239
and buy him some food.

767
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,639
Are you going to see him this time?

768
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,760
To be honest,

769
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,079
I don't even know what to do.

770
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,800
The senior I met before
asked me to come back.

771
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,599
I've seen him twice.

772
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:52,920
He's advised me twice.

773
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,639
There must be a reason for it.

774
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,679
So I came back.

775
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,800
Since I don't know what to do,

776
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,639
I'll go see my master.

777
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,119
How come

778
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,920
Ding Yu doesn't come back with you?

779
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,199
Why so many questions today?

780
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,960
The 43rd Association
can't enter the capital.

781
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,079
Yu went to notify them
to arrive tomorrow.

782
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,840
But even if they're here,

783
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,000
I don't know what to do with them.

784
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,880
Then just stop thinking about it.

785
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,920
Give yourself a break.

786
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,920
I'll boil some water.

787
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,480
You usually cook yourself?

788
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,559
In Dagu County Yamen,

789
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,360
our county magistrate loves to cook.

790
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,440
When we're not on official duty,

791
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,840
he cooks in the backyard.

792
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,199
He also studies various recipes.

793
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,920
We just eat with him.

794
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,199
I don't need to cook.

795
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,719
You told me

796
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,000
you are the strongest
in the county yamen.

797
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,360
Of course.

798
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,320
My master taught me.

799
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,639
So what sect is your master from?

800
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,760
How should I know?

801
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,400
You know kung fu.

802
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
You can't even tell?

803
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,880
I really can't tell.

804
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,320
Even Muqing can't tell what kind

805
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
of kung fu I practice.

806
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,320
So what do you normally practice?

807
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,559
Running.

808
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:33,880
Running?

809
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,480
(If I run too slowly,)

810
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,039
(my master will hit me with stones.)

811
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,320
I'm running.

812
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,968
Master.

813
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
(He's very strict.)

814
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,599
(If I slack off, he'll hit me.)

815
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,400
Hungry?

816
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,400
I'll get you some food.

817
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,360
I'll cook.

818
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,880
Cooking is a woman's job.

819
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,000
Gentlemen stay away from the kitchen.

820
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,599
Aren't you a scholar?

821
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,800
Mencius said

822
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,360
when the gentleman saw the animals,

823
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,679
he couldn't bear to see them die

824
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,880
or eat their meat.

825
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,440
So the gentleman stays away
from the kitchen.

826
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,519
In a word,

827
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,840
no slaughter.

828
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,880
It's not that I mustn't cook.

829
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,559
I found a box of liquor in the kitchen.

830
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,960
Dagu County Yamen
distributed them during the festivals.

831
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,719
I rarely drink when I'm alone.

832
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,559
Today you're not alone.

833
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,840
Let's have a drink.

834
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,464
Okay.

835
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,880
Here's to you.

836
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,320
To me?

837
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,679
Why?

838
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,840
Without you,

839
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,679
I don't know what would happen

840
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:42,800
and where to go.

841
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,719
I don't know if I can survive.

842
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,800
Don't be discouraged.

843
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,559
The justice exists in this world.

844
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,400
I only believe you can uphold justice.

845
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,599
More?

846
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,360
Eat some dishes.

847
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Try this.

848
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,000
I made it.

849
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,280
I want to drink.

850
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,079
I feel sad.

851
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,480
What's wrong?

852
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,239
Rest assured,

853
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,239
I will bring Yu Huanjie and Zhuo Bufan

854
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:39,960
to justice.

855
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,719
Only the two of them are left
in the Dagu Inn case.

856
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,199
I believe you can catch them.

857
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,000
But I'm sad

858
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,840
not because of them.

859
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,920
I feel sad

860
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,719
because of myself.

861
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,159
Yourself?

862
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,039
What happened?

863
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,559
You can't get it.

864
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,880
When the thing one wants to do

865
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,320
and the thing one is actually doing

866
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,079
are completely different,

867
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,320
it will be heartbreaking.

868
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:28,920
How so?

869
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,639
Don't worry about me.

870
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,519
I just want to drink.

871
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,079
Once I'm drunk,

872
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,280
I'll forget everything,

873
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:40,800
I'll join you.

874
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,679
Fine wine is worth a lot of money.

875
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:57,199
Many young men love to venture outside.

876
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,079
Wang Wei.

877
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,320
Journey of Youth.

878
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,199
Good for you.

879
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,559
I'm intoxicated
by the beautiful scenery.

880
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,159
Leaning against a tree, I fell asleep
until the sunset.

881
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,280
Li Shangyin.

882
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,000
Drunk under the Flowers.

883
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,360
I'm drunk, watching stars in the water.

884
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,079
I'm lying by the river of stars.

885
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,159
Tang Wenru.

886
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
Longyang County's Green Grass Lake.

887
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,880
Ask a difficult one,

888
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,000
or you'll drink all the wine.

889
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,039
You ask.

890
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,599
After drinking, I sing loudly.

891
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,880
Don't think about anything.

892
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,760
Bai Juyi's After Being Drunk.

893
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,519
It's hard?

894
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,719
I let you win.

895
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,679
You drink.

896
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,559
I drink.

897
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,440
Look at the bustling street.

898
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,616
The poor can't afford to get drunk.

899
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,920
Dai Shulun's Persuading Lu San to Drink.

900
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,840
I know.

901
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,400
Let's drink.

902
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,360
Leaning against the high tower,
the breeze blows towards me.

903
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,559
Looking far away,
endless melancholy permeates the sky.

904
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,719
The sun set,
casting lingering light on the grass.

905
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,280
Who can understand how I feel?

906
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:44,079
I wanted to indulge myself
and get drunk.

907
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,079
But when I raised my glass,
I lost interest.

908
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,079
I am wasting away without regret.

909
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:12,960
For you, I would rather be haggard.

910
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,690
(23rd day of the fourth month, 1911)

911
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,280
