1
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:20,359
Don't cross this line.
Cross this line, and I'll kill you.

2
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,399
I told you
if you cross the line, I'll kill you.

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,560
(Wu Shuangbao made his move
and subdued Luan Yi.)

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,920
(Futu Temple)
(Among all, only I and Luan Yi are still alive.)

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
Wu Shuangbao
imprisoned Luan Yi in the temple.

6
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,599
He let me go after I recovered.

7
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:26,439
I knelt to thank him for saving me twice
and promised to retreat from then on.

8
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,599
Did you put Luan Yi's
waist token back in the inn?

9
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,599
Yes, Wu Shuangbao told me to do that

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,319
to mislead the imperial guards
who were looking for Luan Yi.

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
And he even...

12
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,680
(All are equal regardless of status)

13
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,879
engraved these words on it.

14
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,040
I followed Wu Shuangbao's orders
and put the waist token back in the inn,

15
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,280
and I saw
the imperial guards taking it away.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,359
After that, I wanted to return
to my hometown to avoid trouble,

17
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,040
but I feared
that my village would be implicated.

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,199
Later on, I simply
thought of going to Southeast Asia,

19
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,639
but my malaria wasn't healed,
and I still had knife wounds.

20
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,759
Later, I was ill after getting caught
in heavy rain in Quanzhou.

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,680
I wandered the streets alone
like a beggar.

22
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,759
If it weren't for Daidi to step on me...

23
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,479
Daidi gave me
a bowl of hot meat swallows,

24
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,439
and it made me alive.

25
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,639
Since then, I've remained
in the brothel doing odd jobs.

26
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,120
Have you seen Luan Yi since then?

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,919
Luan Yi was imprisoned
in Futu Temple for three years,

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,240
He found inspiration in Buddha's light
and converted to Buddhism.

29
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,400
Converted to Buddhism?

30
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,120
Wasn't his Dharma name Du E?

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,039
How do you know?
Have you been to Futu Temple?

32
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,599
If you want to leave, go ahead.
Otherwise, don't cross this line.

33
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,599
Cross the line,
and I'll cripple your cultivation.

34
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,000
I have been to Futu Temple,

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,919
but I did not know
that Master Du E is Luan Yi.

36
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,519
Is Wu Shuangbao, the Xianghua monk,
the inheritor of Prajna Hall's chief?

37
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,199
He is the third-generation chief
of Prajna Hall in Southern Shaolin.

38
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,519
He carries the mission
of guarding the Altar Treasure.

39
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,399
The reason he told me this

40
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,000
was because after he subdued Luan Yi,

41
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:30,820
he feared the secret would leak.

42
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,639
So, he left quietly.

43
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,839
What about the abbot of Futu Temple?

44
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,519
The abbot of Futu Temple
passed away many years ago,

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,199
and I don't know the abbot after him.

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,399
I last saw Luan Yi
at Futu Temple ten years ago.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,519
He told me not to come
to Futu Temple anymore.

48
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,600
You went to see him?

49
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,920
I never understood why Wu Shuangbao
would carve such words.

50
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,480
The reason why many generations
of the four halls' chiefs

51
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,839
spent their lives on the road
and guarded the secret willingly,

52
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
was to wait for the perfect moment,

53
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,319
and entrust the secret treasure to one
who can free all from suffering,

54
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,279
not for the sake
of his glory and wealth.

55
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,199
Only those concerning about
all beings can save them.

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,279
And what about you?
What are you going to do?

57
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,199
I'll stay right here,
guarding this line.

58
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,079
Sir, I have a question.

59
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,319
Go ahead.

60
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,040
I've lived in seclusion here
for 43 years, and never exposed.

61
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,040
How did you find me?

62
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
Because of Daidi.

63
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,199
Daidi?

64
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,320
I just found out that her name is Daidi.

65
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,759
Everyone called her Qing before.

66
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,240
That's right.

67
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,240
Isn't it because of this woman

68
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,399
that you never left
this brothel for a lifetime?

69
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,879
She's been dead for ten years.
Why haven't you left?

70
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Firstly, this place
holds all my happy memories.

71
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,800
I spent the first half of my life
serving the court,

72
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,160
but I only knew to serve,
not understanding why.

73
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,079
I have lived in the brothel since then,
and met many people.

74
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,839
Later, I came to realize
what people desire

75
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,560
is simply some freedom
and moments of peace.

76
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,480
Having drinks and meals

77
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,720
with Daidi

78
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,759
is my freedom.

79
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,720
Taking dreams for real-life events,

80
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,000
or seeing real life as a dream?

81
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,680
As the life itself is but a dream,

82
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,879
why care about real-life events?

83
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,639
Sir, you are so knowledgeable.

84
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,120
And secondly?

85
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,240
Secondly, I made
a necklace for Daidi back then,

86
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,759
and it served as
a token of affection between us.

87
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,879
But then one day, Daidi fell ill.

88
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,120
To seek a physician
to get medicine for Daidi,

89
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,279
I had no choice
but to pawn the necklace.

90
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,160
Now that Daidi is no longer alive,

91
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,120
all I hope

92
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,759
is to redeem that necklace one day.

93
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,199
You asked me earlier
how I managed to find you.

94
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,920
It's because of this necklace.

95
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,879
The pawnshop demands two hundred taels.

96
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,639
But you're just a handyman at a brothel,

97
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,320
so you'll never
manage to redeem it back.

98
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:59,200
Sir, why do you want
to find the Altar Treasure?

99
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,679
The court needs it.

100
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,120
But the people don't.

101
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,559
The Altar Treasure

102
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,600
maybe could improve
the court's conditions,

103
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,840
but wouldn't change the court into
the one that the people need.

104
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Wealth must be given to those
who can free all from suffering.

105
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,440
I'll pretend to not have heard
your heinous words.

106
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,519
Sir, you are exactly like I was
when I was young.

107
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,000
Firmly carrying out the court's tasks,

108
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,279
but being lost.

109
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
Because the current Qing Dynasty

110
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,799
is no longer worth the lives
the younger generation.

111
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,519
I told you that I'll pretend
to not have heard that.

112
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,919
Even if you're right,

113
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,159
I'm a Manchu after all.

114
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,320
Hesheli... Hesheli is my surname.

115
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,759
I haven't mentioned this
for over 40 years.

116
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,279
I am from the Plain Yellow Banner.

117
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,799
All are equal regardless of status.

118
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:36,512
=Heroes=

119
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:40,160
=Episode 30=

120
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,120
I have to admit this wine is not bad.

121
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,879
Right, let's drink here again next time.

122
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,480
Is what he said all true?
You can tell, right?

123
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,360
Every word is true.

124
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,919
Then we investigated for nothing.
It is pointless.

125
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,399
Right.
We've circled back to Futu Temple again.

126
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,519
I just never expected
that Du E is Luan Yi.

127
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,960
It doesn't matter anymore
if it's Luan Yi or Du E.

128
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,799
Could Luan Yi
be the inheritor of Wu Shuangbao?

129
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,679
Even if Wu Shuangbao influenced him,
he wouldn't pass on the legacy to him,

130
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,240
leave alone
the young abbot of Futu Temple.

131
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,919
If he were, he wouldn't have given
the legacy to me and the secret to you.

132
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,440
Haven't you noticed
throughout our entire journey,

133
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,480
we haven't got in touch
with Prajna's inheritor?

134
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,039
Wu Shuangbao vanished 43 years ago.

135
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,639
Where would he go?

136
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Over 40 years without a trace,

137
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,759
he must have gone overseas.

138
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,096
His inheritor is from overseas?

139
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,399
It doesn't matter where he is.

140
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,480
What's important is that Wu Shuangbao
was safe and sound 43 years ago,

141
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
and the Prajna seal is also intact.

142
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,759
Wu Shuangbao must have an inheritor,

143
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,559
and the inheritor must know
about the thirty-year pact.

144
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,600
Investigating Luan Yi was not in vain.

145
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,759
At least now I can be certain
that Prajna's inheritor will appear.

146
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,320
What do you mean by real life and dream?

147
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,919
Over 1,000 years ago,
a scholar asked a Zen Master,

148
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,559
"Taking dreams for real-life events,
or seeing real life as a dream?"

149
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,360
What was the answer?

150
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,840
Whether the real life
is ultimately but a dream,

151
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,480
or within a dream
that lies the real life?

152
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,559
The Zen Master replied to the scholar,

153
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,960
"As the life itself is but a dream,
why care about real-life events?"

154
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,240
Be born without a trace
and return to dust in death.

155
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,120
In this vast world,
this real life is but a dream.

156
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,279
From birth to death,
only one thing remains the same,

157
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,840
which is the inability
to escape confusion.

158
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,559
Why then care about
the meaningless matters?

159
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,320
If so, why do you still care so much?

160
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,279
Care about what?

161
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,879
Care about the meaningless life.

162
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,039
Care about the court
that can't free you from confusion.

163
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,879
Think about Luan Yi and Lin,
and then look at you.

164
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,840
Learning and showing off right away?

165
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,720
Then why do you care so much?

166
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,399
Not only is Tongmenghui meaningless,

167
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,519
it's also fundamentally illusory.
Besides...

168
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,519
- After tonight...
- Stop.

169
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,159
I didn't say anything,
and I didn't bring anything up.

170
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,559
I didn't talk to you about revolution.
So, don't count it.

171
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,440
What I'm talking to you about today is

172
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,200
a conversation between
Bai Juyi and Bird Nest Zen Master.

173
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,080
Why asked me if you already know?

174
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,240
I do know, but you don't.

175
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,799
If you really knew,
you wouldn't care that much.

176
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,480
I didn't talk about revolution
with you today.

177
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,039
Muqing, you should be reasonable.

178
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
I should just be an ordinary hound.

179
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:52,096
(Qingfu Building)

180
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,559
Madam, hold on,
I'll go and announce your arrival now.

181
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,759
Why do I need to be announced
to see my husband? Move aside.

182
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:11,360
(Barracks)

183
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,440
Who is it?

184
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,960
I'm asking you who it is.

185
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:39,720
You... Madam, why are you here?

186
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,639
So I'm not allowed here?

187
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,600
No, it's just that it's so late,
and it's unsafe for you to come.

188
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,440
You're inconvenient?

189
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,120
Not at all.

190
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,720
No rush, I'll wait for you
in your office.

191
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,079
Madam. Madam.

192
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,279
Just say it.

193
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,960
Open the door,
I'll come in and tell you.

194
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,319
You speak first, and I'll decide
whether to open it or not.

195
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,079
Madam, please don't be angry.

196
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,480
I... I just had a few drinks tonight,

197
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,839
and I'm a bit drunk.

198
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:53,079
I can't believe I trusted you
for having too much work,

199
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,160
and yet you've already
in bed at this hour.

200
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,079
Hear me out, I...
I just went to rest for a moment.

201
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,839
I am about to work in a bit.

202
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,880
I have been so busy with work recently.

203
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,744
(Muqing, Liu Lin,
and Lin Haohan headed to Tulou Inn)

204
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:12,608
(in Quanzhou of Fujian
to find clues two days ago.)

205
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,039
Tell me how you have been busy.

206
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,720
I...

207
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:22,048
(Fujian Quanzhou Tulou Inn)

208
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,519
Is the Beiyang Army
going to fight or to train troops?

209
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,920
When you go to Fujian, is it to guard
the border or to conduct drills?

210
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,400
I don't think you're that busy.

211
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,039
These military matters

212
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,799
aren't like what you see.

213
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,920
There are many things I can't tell you.

214
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:44,920
Madam.

215
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,359
I know what other generals are like.

216
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,160
I've said before that if you want
to take a concubine, I won't stop you.

217
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,296
But considering that I'm
the daughter of a prince,

218
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:56,772
don't make my father lose face.

219
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,799
You can stay here,

220
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,920
but don't make a big scene out of it.

221
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,480
I don't want others to think
I'm ridiculous when I come to see you.

222
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,640
What are you talking about?
You're overthinking.

223
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,744
I won't argue with you.

224
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,424
I waited in your office
rather than barging into your room,

225
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,000
so as to save dignity
for both you and me.

226
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,599
Okay, I'm leaving. Get some sleep
when you're done working.

227
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,640
Madam, it's so late.

228
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,240
Why not stay in the camp for tonight?

229
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,839
Madam, how about
I go home with you today?

230
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,039
Madam, rest early when you get back.

231
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,799
After I'm done,
I'll come home and accompany you.

232
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:42,359
Drive.

233
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,240
Madam. Be careful on the way.

234
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:54,272
(The third day of the fifth month,
3th year of Xuantong era)

235
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:55,424
eight days before Mangzhong)

236
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,400
How did you find me?

237
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,920
I saw a secret report
in Zhong Haichao's documents.

238
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,839
They have local intelligence agencies.

239
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,480
They informed Zhong Haichao
of the Department's presence here.

240
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,359
I think you must be here too.

241
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,359
So, I found the people
who send vegetables here every day,

242
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,079
and I followed them and sneaked in.

243
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,440
This is too risky for you.

244
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
What's there to be risky?
What could happen if they find out?

245
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
Muqing wouldn't dare to arrest me.

246
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
Would Zhong Haichao dare to penalize me?

247
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
I have news to tell you.

248
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,400
Last night, I peeked
at Zhong Haichao's documents.

249
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,839
Beiyang Army has been monitoring
the progress of the treasure hunt.

250
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,839
If Muqing makes key progress,

251
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,200
Beiyang Army will act recklessly.

252
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,319
Beiyang Army is capable of turning
against the Qing Imperial Court.

253
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,792
Thus, even for
the Imperial Household Department,

254
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:46,480
when it comes to key issues,
they have nothing to be afraid of.

255
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,319
Beiyang Army also wants
to find the secret treasure?

256
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,240
I wasn't sure before,
but now I'm sure that they want it.

257
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,559
Let them think, maybe it'll end up
with everyone just thinking about it.

258
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,160
The Discipline Seal
is in Zhuo Bufan's hands.

259
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,799
The Dharma Seal is with Mr. Wang.

260
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,079
Prajna's inheritor
has completely disappeared now.

261
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,240
However, Men Sandao
has recently found some information.

262
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,000
He thinks the Prajna inheritor
is likely to appear at this gathering.

263
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,880
Has Muqing changed his mind?

264
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,720
I think so. He is now
in a very contradictory state.

265
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,279
There will likely be a major change.

266
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,136
Are you confident?

267
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,480
Now that you're here,
you'll be more confident than I am.

268
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,319
Do you want to see him?

269
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,920
Now, I should pay more attention
to Zhong Haichao and others.

270
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,440
It might be safer for you.

271
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,240
As for Muqing, I believe in him.

272
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,560
Mr. Mu doubted us before.

273
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,200
About what?

274
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,279
He thought we
were talking about revolution.

275
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,536
But I've covered it up

276
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,440
by saying that I know about your past.

277
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,599
Saying that would fool him.

278
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,200
However, I still believe in Muqing.

279
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,240
Do you think he'll choose us?

280
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,039
Don't you think that he actually
joined the revolution earlier than us?

281
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:23,936
(Qingfu Building)

282
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:44,420
(Prosperity and Longevity)

283
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,792
(The Heroic Spirit of Minyue)

284
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,359
People from the south are not tall,

285
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,960
so this outfit is too big on you.

286
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,480
As if you know everything.

287
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,839
You haven't eaten this early, have you?

288
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,839
I hear this restaurant
has good rice dumplings and beef soup,

289
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,079
which is a famous local breakfast.
Want to try?

290
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,079
How did you find me?

291
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,079
I've been waiting for you.

292
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,880
Waiting for me?
Did you know I would come?

293
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,440
Of course.

294
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,279
What made you think that?

295
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,576
If not for Liu Lin,
what are you doing here?

296
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
Didn't you notice that I didn't even
arrange guards at her door?

297
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,279
It was just for you to meet her.

298
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
But I didn't expect
that you'd dress up like this.

299
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,319
Then tell me how I exposed myself?

300
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,079
I discovered something unusual
between you and Liu Lin

301
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,359
when we met before I left the capital.

302
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,799
After you left, I interrogated her.

303
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,880
Liu Lin made up an almost perfect lie,

304
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,920
and she thought she'd fooled me.

305
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,119
You said it was perfect.
So, what gave it away?

306
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,480
You've known her for only a few days.

307
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,799
No matter what,

308
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,920
there's no way
you'd tell her about our past.

309
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,880
The only premise for you
to establish trust in such a short time

310
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,400
is that both of you are comrades.

311
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,079
Initially, you said
you wouldn't come to Fujian.

312
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,832
Yet, in just a few days,
you changed your mind.

313
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,616
Nobody could make you come
if you didn't want to.

314
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,880
So it was your own initiative to come.

315
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,079
You came because
you knew about the secret treasure,

316
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,359
so you want to help Liu Lin.

317
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Helping Liu Lin
means helping Tongmenghui.

318
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,200
What does Tongmenghui do?

319
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,440
It's about rebelling, revolutionizing,
and overthrowing the Qing Dynasty.

320
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,519
You are the daughter of Prince
and the wife of Beiyang General.

321
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,480
Overthrowing the Qing Dynasty
means overthrowing your home and family.

322
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,759
If you're doing this, it only shows
that you're in Tongmenghui.

323
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,079
Princess Wulan Shan,
you are a reformist.

324
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,000
Muqing, are you going to arrest me?

325
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,799
What do you think Liu Lin is capable of?

326
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:47,559
She's only full of zeal
and firm resolve.

327
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,359
She can't accomplish this.

328
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,000
Tongmenghui sent nine people from Japan.

329
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,960
They were all killed by your father's
people as soon as they returned.

330
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,119
Liu Lin is just a bodyguard
accompanying them for the meeting.

331
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,304
She doesn't know anything.

332
00:26:58,304 --> 00:27:01,160
All alone without even
a single companion.

333
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,119
Facing the swordsmen of Rongtian Ridge,

334
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,088
the guns of Beiyang Army,
the hidden attack of the Japanese,

335
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,440
and me, a hound from the court.

336
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,880
Which one can she defeat and handle?

337
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,184
Is there even any chance she'll win?

338
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,359
Are you suggesting that we give up?

339
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,120
What else besides giving up?

340
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,039
If she had even
the slightest possibility of success,

341
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,599
I wouldn't stop her from getting killed.

342
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,960
If she has no chance of winning,
neither do you or anyone.

343
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,799
None of you know about the Bodhi Seal.

344
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,960
Yes, she knows, then what?

345
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,559
Can she get
Zhuo Bufan's Discipline Seal?

346
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,839
Can she get Mr. Wang's Dharma Seal?

347
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,400
Even I'm not confident I could get it.

348
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,960
Let alone the Prajna Seal

349
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,759
that nobody knows
whether it would appear or not.

350
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,960
I believe you can get it.

351
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:51,440
Do you think
I'll hand it to you if I get it?

352
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,240
Wouldn't you?

353
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,720
What you said to me
when we parted in the capital...

354
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,759
I don't want to hear you
call me princess.

355
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,160
I didn't reply to you then.

356
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,519
Now I'm telling you. Wulan Shan,
I don't want to call you princess.

357
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,920
I didn't want to 12 years ago,

358
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,279
now I don't want to,
and even less so in the future.

359
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,559
If everything had been different,
I wouldn't be just a princess to you.

360
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,720
The past is just the past.

361
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,000
The reform failed back then.

362
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,880
Looking back now,
I know failure was inevitable.

363
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,872
No one was prepared.

364
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,920
Neither the late Emperor nor Kang Youwei
and Liang Qichao were.

365
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,160
Everyone was only
thinking of the reform,

366
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,119
but no one thought
about what to do after the reform.

367
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,799
Liang Qichao once said
he wanted a Young China.

368
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,839
Back then, the late Emperor was young.

369
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,079
But it failed,
so now I am still a princess to you.

370
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,279
So what's the point of guarding
this dynasty that let you gain nothing?

371
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,519
Do you love this dynasty?

372
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,000
But aside from the pain,
what else has this dynasty given you?

373
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,079
Whether this dynasty
gives me anything or not,

374
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,000
I was born in this dynasty,

375
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,559
which was not for me to choose.

376
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,839
In this dynasty, you're the princess
and I am a servant.

377
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,519
I must forever call you princess
and always bow to you.

378
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,240
That is why I am willing
to make changes for you.

379
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,000
I was by the late Emperor's side
when I was 16,

380
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,880
and listened to their discussions
about change.

381
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,039
The late Emperor conducted reform
and failed when I was 18.

382
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,440
For 12 years,
I have pondered the reason daily.

383
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,960
What this dynasty taught me
is that change is very difficult.

384
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,519
(I can't believe you say such things.)
Even the Emperor knew that.

385
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,019
(It would have been better)
But it needs to change.

386
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,960
(to find me at the dried fish stores.)
For with change, there is hope.

387
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,240
You asked me aside from the pain,
what else has this dynasty given us?

388
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,440
It has also given us hope,

389
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,920
the hope that we must seek change.

390
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,880
I was released from the prison.

391
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,799
I knew that Prince Regent Zaifeng
was advocating constitutionalism.

392
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,599
I know that he wants
to initiate change against the tide.

393
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,039
Mr. Cunqing said finding the secret
treasure could save the court.

394
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,440
So, I'll look for it with all my might,
no matter how difficult.

395
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:50,480
Because I hope
that the court can change.

396
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,799
But as of today,
I feel that hope is dim.

397
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,200
I see the Beiyang Army
that won't heed commands,

398
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,519
the weak and powerless concessions,

399
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,079
the local officials who just scrape by,

400
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,279
and the numbness
and acquiescence of people.

401
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,720
The people are muddleheaded.

402
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,880
No one tells them how to change.

403
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,799
It's not that no one
is trying to tell them.

404
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,440
Right. I know there's a group of people
attempting to wake them.

405
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,640
With repeated failures,
their resolve only strengthens.

406
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,680
They will die
but are not afraid of death.

407
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,119
They move forward undeterred,
one after another.

408
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,480
I used to think
these revolutionaries were all crazy.

409
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
Why did they regard
their lives so lightly?

410
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,880
Now I understand.

411
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,799
Their deaths are to wake the people.

412
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,559
In fact, Mr. Tan said so 12 years ago.

413
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,079
Reform has never come about
in any country without sacrifice.

414
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,960
No one in China in modern times
sacrificed himself for the reform.

415
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,279
This is why the country does not thrive.

416
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,599
Therefore, I request that the sacrifices
begin with myself.

417
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,490
(The righteous Zhang
was sheltered from the persecution.)

418
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,424
(The tenacious Du Gen endured
great pain before achieving his goal.)

419
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:16,294
(Let the sword fall on my neck,
I am laughing at the sky.)

420
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:17,440
(Leaving or staying, we will all be
as fearless as the grand Kunlun Mountain.)

421
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,480
When many of my comrades
were arrested, they were fearless.

422
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,720
They said Mr. Tan gave up his life

423
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,784
to wake the true revolutionaries
among the people.

424
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,559
He is the idol of all idealists.

425
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,240
Muqing, you too.
He got killed and you were imprisoned,

426
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,720
so you have long been a revolutionary.

427
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,799
Muqing, you are a person with faith.

428
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,240
You were willing to follow
the late Emperor to reform 12 years ago.

429
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,920
At that time, you already had faith.

430
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,039
I don't know what faith is.

431
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,000
I thought the late Emperor
was remarkable 12 years ago.

432
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,480
He wanted to change
and wanted a powerful country.

433
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,559
He gave me hope to marry you.

434
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,559
Twelve years later,
I became an imperial guard again,

435
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,359
and you're still the princess.

436
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,599
I've only believed
two things in my life.

437
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,039
One is to change the world
and the other is to marry you.

438
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,359
But both failed.
Until experiencing this heartache,

439
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
I'd never have believed someone
could be so grief-stricken.

440
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,079
When I was released from prison,
I was nothing but a walking dead.

441
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,359
You were already someone else's wife,
and I couldn't marry you anymore.

442
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,720
And changing the world means
to shatter everything you have.

443
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,839
I could no longer do it.

444
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,119
After capturing Liu Lin,
I can't bear to punish her.

445
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Because I know she wants
to change the world, I can't hate her.

446
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,960
Seeing her weak yet struggling,
I admire her.

447
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,159
One day, I wondered
if you were doing well.

448
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,119
You should be living well.

449
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,400
Your father is Prince Qi,
powerful and influential.

450
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,320
Your husband is in Beiyang Army,
holding military power.

451
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,239
Everyone thinks
you must be a happy woman.

452
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,280
Yet I suddenly recalled
your smile 12 years ago

453
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,599
when the late Emperor let me marry you.

454
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:36,679
I have never seen
you smile so happily since then.

455
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,320
Your husband from Beiyang Army
was chosen by your father.

456
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,199
Because he needed Beiyang Army,
but do you like him?

457
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,559
For 12 years, you didn't have any kids.

458
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,039
Wulan Shan, you don't like him at all.

459
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,679
You dislike him
yet are unable to change it.

460
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,159
Do you still like being the princess?

461
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,760
This status has become the shackle
that deprives you of freedom.

462
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,960
Being unable to choose and incapable
of choosing. Can you really be happy?

463
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,679
You are not a conservative woman.

464
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,480
You studied abroad
with thoughts of your own.

465
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,960
You dared to transgress taboos with me
and to rebel 12 years ago, so...

466
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,719
Wulan Shan, sending Liu Lin
to your residence is me gambling.

467
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,559
I bet that you're a reformist.

468
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,079
Since you are,
I have nothing to worry about.

469
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,559
As long as I find
the Altar Treasure, it's yours.

470
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,719
Muqing.

471
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,079
Even if I can't find it,
no one else will.

472
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,599
Don't tell Liu Lin about this.

473
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,519
She can't keep it a secret
after knowing.

474
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:54,400
You...

475
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Be careful.

476
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,159
How could I say such useless words?

477
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,079
I will be careful, and you must be too.

478
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,320
Don't come looking
for me or Liu Lin again.

479
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,039
It's too complicated and dangerous here.

480
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,000
You have no idea
if someone is tracking you.

481
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,639
Are you finished eating?
If so, you should go back now.

482
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,760
Muqing.

483
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,920
What if we fail this time?

484
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,559
I said I've only believed
two things in my life.

485
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
So what if I fail again?

486
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,559
