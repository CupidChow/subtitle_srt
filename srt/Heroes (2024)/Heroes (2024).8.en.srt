1
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,290
Sir,

2
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,530
someone came just now

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,929
with a letter for you.

4
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:21,250
Who sent it?

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,369
I don't know.

6
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:23,810
You may leave.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,410
Yes.

8
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:03,360
(Address: No. 12 Nanjing Road, Shanghai)

9
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,649
Stand up.

10
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,170
Don't stand there.

11
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:16,450
Come and sit.

12
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,930
My aunt is getting married,

13
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,849
so I came to Shanghai
to attend her wedding.

14
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:32,969
The imperial inspector
from the Patrol Yamen has come to visit.

15
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,730
I heard from him

16
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,250
that you were in Shanghai too.

17
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:38,409
What a small world.

18
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,890
I couldn't help wanting to see you.

19
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,209
Thank you, princess.

20
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,209
No need to say that.

21
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,129
It's been so many years.

22
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,409
You've gotten so formal.

23
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,810
I wonder how long you're going to stay
in Shanghai this time.

24
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,250
Not for many days.

25
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,569
I'll be heading back soon.

26
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:13,489
This is for you.

27
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,610
I didn't do anything for you.

28
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,090
I can't accept

29
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,569
such a valuable gift.

30
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,169
You forgot it?

31
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,409
I owe you a necklace.

32
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,009
It's just a repayment.

33
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:44,889
Thank you, princess.

34
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:31,930
How dare you?

35
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,050
How dare you touch the princess?

36
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,169
Let go!

37
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,729
Apologize to the princess now.

38
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,610
Sorry for offending you.

39
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,610
Please forgive me.

40
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,289
What are you yelling about?

41
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,210
Without him just now,
I would have fallen and hurt myself.

42
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,889
Please calm your anger.

43
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,330
This servant touched you.

44
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,409
That was improper.

45
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:55,849
So it would be proper if I fell?

46
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:56,889
Do you even have a brain?

47
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,409
Rise.

48
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,210
Don't punish him.

49
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:06,449
Right.

50
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,650
Thank you.

51
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:09,729
What's your name?

52
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:11,729
His name is Irgen-Gioro Muqing.

53
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:12,689
I didn't ask you.

54
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,569
Greetings,

55
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,569
princess.

56
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,530
Alright.

57
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,250
Without you,

58
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,650
I wouldn't be fine now.

59
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,610
I damaged that.

60
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,209
I'll compensate you with a better one.

61
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,769
Stop staring.

62
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,850
That is the daughter of Prince Qi.

63
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,009
You.

64
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,850
If others had seen that,

65
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,889
you would have been in trouble.

66
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,250
I understand.

67
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,930
Thank you very much.

68
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:13,594
=Heroes=

69
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,666
=Episode 8=

70
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:52,810
Who is it?

71
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:55,529
Sir, don't be afraid. I...

72
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:57,250
Understood.

73
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,329
Not bad.

74
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,170
It's just that you're dressed
a bit conservatively.

75
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,769
What are you thinking?

76
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:11,689
When did you move in?

77
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,449
I just moved in

78
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:14,569
today.

79
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,329
I've just checked in.

80
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,970
I just had a bath,

81
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,410
and here you are.

82
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,610
Tell me.

83
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
What's your price?

84
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,009
After you moved in,

85
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,569
did you notice anything unusual?

86
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,490
Unusual things?

87
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,170
There is one.

88
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,050
A great beauty

89
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,009
suddenly appeared in my room.

90
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,009
That is the most unusual thing.

91
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,850
Lady, how should I address you?

92
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,569
How old are you?

93
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,370
Are you a local or from out of town?

94
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,649
As for me,

95
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:51,569
I came from Southeast Asia.

96
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,209
I specialize in the antique
and jewelry business.

97
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:55,730
Look.

98
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,490
I brought these goods
from Southeast Asia.

99
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,529
Valuable.

100
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,569
If you're too shy to quote a price,

101
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,810
I'll choose one for you.

102
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,490
You won't be at a loss. How about it?

103
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,209
Let me start with a self-introduction.

104
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,209
Lin Haohan,

105
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,610
which means to dwell
in the vast and boundless.

106
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,250
Of course,

107
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,730
you can also call me
by my English name, Lucky.

108
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:20,930
Lucky.

109
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,769
In Chinese,

110
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,529
it means good luck.

111
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,129
It's lucky for me

112
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:29,170
to meet you today.

113
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,889
And it's lucky for you to meet me.

114
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,170
Since we're so lucky,

115
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,649
let's have fun together.

116
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,689
Lady,

117
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,970
the price can be negotiated.

118
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:38,689
Lady.

119
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,730
It's me,

120
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:46,809
Liu Lin.

121
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,649
We met several different groups

122
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,169
of people on Maiqi Road,

123
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,450
including guards from the Department,

124
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,169
Japanese,

125
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,610
and a martial arts sect.

126
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,690
They are all after us

127
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,769
to track down the secret treasure.

128
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,970
We didn't meet that handler.

129
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,409
I wasn't with Tan Xian.

130
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,409
I suspect that Tan Xian
has already encountered trouble.

131
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,970
If he falls into the hands

132
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,730
of the Qing Imperial Court
or the Japanese,

133
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,649
I'm not sure if he can keep the secret.

134
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,809
Go back?

135
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,610
I can't go back now.

136
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,730
I must stay here.

137
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,809
He told me the clue before we separated.

138
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,649
But the clue is very vague.

139
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,129
If the handler gets it,

140
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,570
he might know how to find it.

141
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,049
But now I can't find him,

142
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:31,330
and he can't find me either.

143
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,330
I cannot leave.

144
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,610
Tan Xian told me the clue is in Shanxi.

145
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,409
I must go to Shanxi.

146
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:38,970
I have to

147
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,090
get the clue before others do.

148
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,529
At least I won't let it

149
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,570
fall into others' hands.

150
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,730
I've got money today.

151
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,850
I'll take you guys out for fun in a bit.

152
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:56,610
Change into Han people's clothes

153
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,889
so as not to be recognized.

154
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,289
Huanjie.

155
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,009
Are you going out?

156
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:02,970
Yes, I am.

157
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,850
Zhuo has repeatedly instructed us

158
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,610
not to go out.

159
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:08,649
Wait.

160
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,129
Even if Zhuo Bufan is the Sect Leader,

161
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm still his senior brother.

162
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:17,809
I'm gonna take my buddies

163
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,049
out for a feast

164
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,730
and see the bustling world of Shanghai.

165
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:23,330
Any problem?

166
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:26,090
What if...?

167
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,210
What if?

168
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,690
Why so many "what ifs"?

169
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,929
Qin Tuo,

170
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:34,409
am I really that stupid?

171
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,289
He's so stupid.

172
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,169
Guess where Yu Huanjie and others went

173
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,250
after they had

174
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,049
their fill at the hotel?

175
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,289
Having satisfied hunger,
they'd think of lust, yeah?

176
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,490
Exactly.

177
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,570
They immediately went
to a brothel thereafter.

178
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,169
Muqing,

179
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:58,889
do you think Zhuo Bufan

180
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,970
would go with them?

181
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,169
Him?

182
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:03,769
He would not.

183
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,730
Keep it.

184
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,210
The money given by Prince Qi

185
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,809
is enough for us to get by for a while.

186
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,730
I gave more than half to Yu Huanjie.

187
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,169
I hope he can spend it frugally.

188
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,409
Why did you give it to him?

189
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,210
When I came back just now,

190
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,169
I found the light
in his room was already out.

191
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,529
Did he go to bed that early?

192
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,730
You've already given him the money,

193
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:34,610
and you still expect him

194
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,289
to stay put inside the room?

195
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:38,730
Can't you just stop indulging him?

196
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:41,970
It's not for him.

197
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,970
It's for our sect.

198
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:48,289
Our sect.

199
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:49,730
If you were tougher,

200
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,730
who wouldn't respect you?

201
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,129
Even if you stand still,

202
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,649
Yu Huanjie can't defeat you.

203
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,009
Relying on being the eldest disciple,

204
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,330
he can just offend you every day?

205
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,090
All you know is to give way.

206
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,129
What final gains can you have
after all this yielding?

207
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:01,970
Is this what you end up with?

208
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,090
It's already not easy for us all

209
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,570
to still be together.

210
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,889
Now, we live in a destitute
and drifting life.

211
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,330
A sect isn't complete

212
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,450
unless everyone's there.

213
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,970
As the Sect Leader,

214
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,649
shouldn't I give way?

215
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,929
Everything I'm doing right now

216
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,769
is solely to enable our sect

217
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,009
to return to its peak.

218
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,649
Return to the peak?

219
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:46,970
What defines the peak?

220
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,730
When I joined,

221
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,409
it was already a declining sect.

222
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,769
Rongtian reached its peak
because of you.

223
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:54,570
You became the strongest in the sect

224
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,809
and in the world.

225
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:56,970
You brought its peak.

226
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,769
But you.

227
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,370
All you know is to give way

228
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:06,850
and to endure.

229
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,009
You've even conceded

230
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,690
me to your master.

231
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,649
Without my master,
there wouldn't be our sect.

232
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:20,610
Right.

233
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,570
We wouldn't be
who we are today without him.

234
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,570
You should yield.

235
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,730
You ought to yield everything.

236
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,610
And you're capable
of yielding everything.

237
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,649
I know how hard
these years have been for you.

238
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,169
And I know the pain you're carrying.

239
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,809
But trust me.

240
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,610
I will put an end to these days soon.

241
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:50,690
Your Highness.

242
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,610
You seem very surprised.

243
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,529
I did not expect you to come in person.

244
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,169
Do you know who I'm taking you to meet?

245
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,690
I don't know.

246
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,610
But certainly not an ordinary person.

247
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,330
Otherwise, you would not
come personally.

248
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,889
He is no ordinary man.

249
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:43,584
(Banknotes)

250
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,970
The Commander of the imperial guards,

251
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,490
Irgen-Gioro Muqing,

252
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,450
nicknamed Men Sandao.

253
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,129
Thank you.

254
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,049
(Do you know who that person is?)

255
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,730
No.

256
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:54,289
In the past 20 years,

257
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:58,129
who are the most terrifying assassins?

258
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,889
These past 20 years,

259
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,370
there haven't been
any shocking assassins.

260
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,730
But the most fearsome

261
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,970
and horrifying among them

262
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,450
is Qian Qi.

263
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,690
Is he the person we just saw?

264
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:14,929
Is he different

265
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:16,809
from what you expected?

266
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,849
I just didn't expect to meet
such a legendary figure

267
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,369
in a place like that.

268
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,490
Qian Qi wasn't meant
to be in the outside world.

269
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:30,730
In fact, he was a killer trained

270
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,250
by the Imperial Household Department

271
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,250
who specialized in assassination.

272
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,250
In 1881,

273
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:43,490
Empress Dowager Ci'an, who jointly ruled
with Empress Dowager Cixi,

274
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,650
suddenly died.

275
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:46,170
The cause of death became a mystery.

276
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:49,930
It was that year he escaped
from the Imperial Household Department.

277
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,009
3 years later,

278
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,730
suddenly in the outside world,
there appeared

279
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,650
an assassin known as Qian Qi.

280
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,609
A fierce killer,
never misses his target,

281
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,970
and is incredibly expensive.

282
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,210
I have heard of a few cases
he was involved in.

283
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,890
If they're not rumors,

284
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,009
his skills are indeed extraordinary.

285
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,289
About 10 years ago,

286
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,369
someone wanted revenge on him

287
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,089
but didn't find him.

288
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,130
So that person killed his wife

289
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,009
and young son instead.

290
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,569
Qian Qi was traumatized.

291
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,089
In a state of mental stupor,

292
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,769
he was ambushed by his enemies.

293
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:28,009
After that,

294
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,210
(he became what you just saw.)

295
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,049
(In his current state,)

296
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:34,849
(can he still kill people?)

297
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:35,970
(Yes.)

298
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,970
(And even more efficiently)

299
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,009
(at a higher price.)

300
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,690
(But all the money he receives)

301
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,168
(Memorial tablet of Qian Qi's wife)
(is burnt as offerings)

302
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,609
(to his wife and child.)

303
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,049
(I see.)

304
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,529
What are you laughing at?

305
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:57,890
I'm thinking

306
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,250
if he kills Men Sandao,

307
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,730
we'll get rid of a headache.

308
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,009
It's a good thing.

309
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,289
But if he's killed by Men Sandao,

310
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,289
it'll be a kind of release.

311
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,089
Still a good thing.

312
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,849
Do you think Qian Qi
can kill Men Sandao?

313
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,490
When we saw him just now,

314
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,369
he appeared to be slow.

315
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,569
But in fact, he is not.

316
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:24,769
But facing Men Sandao,

317
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,210
I don't think he stands
a big chance of winning.

318
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:31,410
Actually, I do not hope

319
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,289
that Qian Qi will
certainly kill Men Sandao.

320
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,650
I just hope he can stop
the imperial guards

321
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,089
from chasing you

322
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:43,769
and give you a break

323
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,769
so that you can get
to Shanxi as soon as possible.

324
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,809
What a beauty.

325
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,289
Yu Huanjie,

326
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,769
the eldest disciple of Rongtian Ridge,

327
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,410
six years older than Zhuo Bufan.

328
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,250
When Zhuo Bufan joined the sect,

329
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,089
it was you

330
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:42,410
who taught him the rules of the sect

331
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,529
and the introductory sword techniques.

332
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,369
But you didn't expect

333
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,089
that the little kid
who followed behind you

334
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:52,609
would go

335
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,569
from an unremarkable junior brother

336
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,890
to the top master of your sect
in just 10 short years.

337
00:21:58,089 --> 00:21:59,210
In terms of swordsmanship,

338
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,930
he has even far surpassed

339
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,569
the previous Sect Leader,

340
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,849
your master,

341
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,089
let alone you.

342
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,410
So, in the end, he became
the new Sect Leader,

343
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:14,569
while you, his senior brother,

344
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,529
could only be under his command.

345
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:22,730
Actually, not only your life

346
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,450
didn't turn out the way
you wanted it to.

347
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,289
Your sect is likewise,

348
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,009
isn't it?

349
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,130
You find it hard

350
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,930
to make a name

351
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,849
for your small sect.

352
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,569
Your master endured hardships

353
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:40,970
and spent his whole life's efforts

354
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,490
to establish your headquarters
in Lingxi.

355
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,809
But only a few came to join.

356
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,650
For years, the business was bleak

357
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,849
and you couldn't make ends meet.

358
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:52,089
When your master passed away,

359
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,009
the sect was already a complete mess.

360
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,250
Having no choice,

361
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,690
Zhuo Bufan had
to rent out the headquarters

362
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:01,410
to a winery to use it as a workshop.

363
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,769
Only then could you people
barely scrape by.

364
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,450
All of you

365
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,569
had to roam around all these years.

366
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,690
What exactly do you want?

367
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,650
I'll tell you what will happen.

368
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:27,009
If your sect rises to great heights,

369
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,089
Zhuo Bufan will be hailed
as a Grandmaster of his generation,

370
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,730
achieving greatness
no less than the founder.

371
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,410
But if your sect declines,

372
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,730
Zhuo Bufan will be the last Sect Leader.

373
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,329
Whether it's a success or a failure,

374
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,009
he will be the only one remembered.

375
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,529
And you.

376
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:45,730
Even if you're the eldest disciple,

377
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:47,529
you'd be just

378
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,529
an ordinary one.

379
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,210
No one will know you.

380
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,529
No one will remember you.

381
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:56,009
You want to buy me over?

382
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:56,849
If a person

383
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,690
can still be of use,

384
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,210
it means they're not
completely a failure.

385
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,730
If they can't,

386
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:05,289
that's truly

387
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,970
a failure.

388
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:17,890
If you choose to cooperate with me,

389
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,369
your future

390
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:21,650
will be different.

391
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,089
With the support
of the powerful Japanese Empire,

392
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,490
the rise of a small sect

393
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,769
is a piece of cake.

394
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,690
I can help you ascend
to the position of Sect Leader.

395
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:36,930
What do you want me to do?

396
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,410
If you still don't know by now

397
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,769
what I want you to do,

398
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,970
what use could you possibly be?

399
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,410
To find the Altar Treasure?

400
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,009
No way.

401
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,849
No.

402
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:01,369
You don't need to answer me right now.

403
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,450
After all, you haven't found it yet.

404
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,289
Yu Huanjie,

405
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:12,569
I hope you will consider

406
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:14,250
my words seriously.

407
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:15,930
You can come to me at any time.

408
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:18,849
My promise is valid

409
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:23,210
until the Altar Treasure shows up.

410
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:37,450
Huanjie,

411
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,650
where have you been?

412
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:43,130
I've taken the buddies out

413
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,289
to eat and take a walk.

414
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,410
Are you not clear
about the current situation?

415
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,769
The Japanese and those
from the Department are everywhere.

416
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:52,289
What if they discover our whereabouts?

417
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,289
What if...

418
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:57,049
Why so many "what ifs"?

419
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,730
Can't you just hold back for now?

420
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,730
Do you really have to go out now?

421
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,329
I'll go out

422
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,769
when I decide to.

423
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:05,170
You just can't control me.

424
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:06,529
Zhuo Bufan,

425
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:07,690
don't forget

426
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:10,769
I am your senior brother.

427
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,609
Why are you criticizing me

428
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,210
about going out?

429
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,490
Fine.

430
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:16,650
Let's not talk about this.

431
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,289
Pack your things now.

432
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:18,944
We're leaving.

433
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:19,529
Now?

434
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:20,849
Where are we going at this late hour?

435
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,529
We were supposed to rush to Shanxi.

436
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,130
And you ate out

437
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,049
with the buddies.

438
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:26,410
Once our tracks are discovered...

439
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:29,529
We gotta leave

440
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,849
to avoid future troubles.

441
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,289
Alright.

442
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:33,930
You are the Sect Leader.

443
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,329
Whatever you say goes.

444
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,009
Make way!

445
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:40,210
I'm going to change my clothes.

446
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,049
Hurry up.

447
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,730
(The 5th day of the 4th month, 1911)

448
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,720
(Mangzhong is 35 days away.)

449
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,890
(Zhuo Bufan and his fellows)

450
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,170
(secretly left last night.)

451
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,569
(They were heading westward.)

452
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,089
(My men followed them,)

453
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,170
(but shortly after they left the city,)

454
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:22,650
they entered a forest.

455
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,650
The fog in that forest was too dense,

456
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,730
and they moved too fast.

457
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:28,890
So...

458
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:29,809
Your men lost them?

459
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:30,930
Yes.

460
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,210
But looks like

461
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,289
they are

462
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:35,769
heading northwest.

463
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:38,529
Should I send more to follow them?

464
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:40,369
We may still be able
to find their trail.

465
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,809
Zhuo Bufan is no ordinary person.

466
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,890
If we follow too closely, we'll be made.

467
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,250
If we are too far behind,
we'll end up like last night,

468
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,250
getting shaken off.

469
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,089
Alright, you may leave.

470
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:54,970
Getai,

471
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:57,210
do not send anyone
to track Zhuo Bufan anymore.

472
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,690
Immediately send letters to notify

473
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,609
the yamens in Jiangsu,
Henan, Shanxi and other places.

474
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,609
And have the officials closely monitor

475
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,890
the movements of them.

476
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,769
Good idea.

477
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,170
Even if Zhuo Bufan and his fellows

478
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,970
are extremely secretive,

479
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:16,250
unless they don't eat, drink

480
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,130
or stay at hotels,

481
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,930
they will inevitably
give themselves away.

482
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,130
Where is Mr. Muqing?

483
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:30,890
Sit.

484
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,049
Eat.

485
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:54,569
Take it slow.

486
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:56,049
It's better with a bit of vinegar.

487
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,210
Thank you.

488
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,369
I've seen many constables.

489
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:03,970
But I've never met someone

490
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,609
as capable as you before.

491
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,210
How did you target Rongtian Ridge?

492
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,289
On the day of the murder case in Dagu,

493
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,369
I already caught up
with them at the dock.

494
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,809
But I was alone and couldn't take on

495
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:17,650
all six of them.

496
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:18,970
One against six,

497
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,690
and all masters from Rongtian Ridge.

498
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,049
You're quite remarkable
to have survived.

499
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,650
How did you manage
to follow them to Linqing later?

500
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,450
The night you killed Tang Yu.

501
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:29,170
When they were in Tianjin,

502
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,450
they used a banknote marked
with the Lingxi seal,

503
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:34,009
so I discovered their trail.

504
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,410
Did you manage to trace them to Shanghai

505
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,650
through the clues on Tang Yu as well?

506
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:42,849
Good.

507
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,809
You're a keen observer with a sharp nose

508
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:48,650
and a knack for analysis

509
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,809
and judgment.

510
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:51,450
I really appreciate you.

511
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,049
With your skills in pursuing them,

512
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,569
you are

513
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:01,609
comparable to the masters
of the imperial yamen.

514
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,890
Your working as a lowly constable

515
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,369
in Dagu County Yamen

516
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:08,329
is truly a waste of talent.

517
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,769
What waste can there be?

518
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,009
Being a constable is not disgraceful.

519
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,569
Of course, it is not disgraceful.

520
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,769
What is disgraceful
is to stay in a dog's den

521
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,210
with the skill to conquer dragons.

522
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:21,769
But it'll be different if you join
the Imperial Household Department.

523
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,410
It wouldn't be disgraceful.

524
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,009
Instead, it'd bring honor
to your family.

525
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,690
Stay and work for me.

526
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,650
I'll formally transfer you

527
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,369
to the Department
after I return to the capital.

528
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:35,210
I'll give you the position
of a Blue-Feathered Guard,

529
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:36,490
a sixth-grade official.

530
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,289
Are you still not satisfied?

531
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,769
Even if you wait for 20 years
in Dagu County,

532
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,289
you might not get

533
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,089
a big promotion.

534
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,289
I'm afraid I might never have

535
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,089
such a good opportunity
again in my life.

536
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,730
You're a talented person.

537
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,410
And I do not wish
to see talent go to waste.

538
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,809
Hurry up and eat.

539
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:00,369
Once you're done, change your clothes.

540
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:09,890
Did I say yes?

541
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:12,410
The murder of nine

542
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,089
occurred within my jurisdiction.

543
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:15,890
No murderer is pardoned.

544
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,170
Pursuing the criminal is my sworn duty.

545
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:21,769
How can I give up the case at this time?

546
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:22,809
What do you want?

547
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:26,329
Mr. Muqing,

548
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:28,609
I am immensely grateful
for your appreciation of me.

549
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:31,450
But I must capture those
who need to be captured

550
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,690
and bring the case to a conclusion.

551
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:34,410
You still want to continue?

552
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,769
I have to.

553
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:36,650
Are you crazy?

554
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,410
No.

555
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,289
Mr. Wang,

556
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:44,769
you reject me?

557
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:45,609
Mr. Muqing,

558
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:47,089
I do not mean to be disrespectful.

559
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,250
It's just that I can't quit at halftime.

560
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,890
Please forgive me.

561
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,410
You...!

562
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,650
How can you be so stubborn?

563
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:57,329
What will it take for you to stop it?

564
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,170
Not unless I am dead.

565
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:04,490
Zhuo Bufan and his fellows

566
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,289
slipped away secretly last night.

567
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:07,410
They headed west.

568
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,809
Have Men Sandao and his men

569
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:10,289
made any new moves?

570
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,730
They still

571
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,450
stay at the Xundao Street Inn.

572
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:14,569
No movement over there.

573
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,329
Could it be that Men Sandao and his men

574
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,369
have not found any traces
of Zhuo and his fellows?

575
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,890
I guess so.

576
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:26,009
That's not right.

577
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,690
Given Men Sandao's abilities,

578
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:31,089
they wouldn't fail to find Zhuo Bufan.

579
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:32,650
Could it be that

580
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:36,609
Zhuo Bufan and his fellows
decided to set off overnight

581
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:38,329
intending to shake off
Men Sandao and his men?

582
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:41,009
Why do you think
Zhuo Bufan left suddenly?

583
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:44,769
When we met Yu Huanjie last night,

584
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:46,970
he did not agree to cooperate with us.

585
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,009
Would he tell Zhuo Bufan?

586
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,970
Yu Huanjie would not.

587
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,410
I trust my judgment very much.

588
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,490
Find someone to keep an eye on him.

589
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,609
I need to know
their movements at all times.

590
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,529
So do we stay in Shanghai?

591
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:08,650
That's right.

592
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:10,690
But I need to see someone first.

593
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:21,050
What are you here for?

594
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,369
I am taking a bath.

595
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,090
Who exactly are you?

596
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,170
What do you mean?

597
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:32,250
Still want to deceive me?

598
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:35,409
I have already found out

599
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,769
the nine people who died in Dagu Inn

600
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,929
were all rebels from Tongmenghui.

601
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,449
So

602
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:50,170
you are their accomplice?

603
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:54,489
You are also a rebel from Tongmenghui?

604
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,210
No, I am not.

605
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:00,530
I...

606
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:03,289
I just didn't tell you the whole truth.

607
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:07,010
Among the nine people killed
in Dagu Inn,

608
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,010
there were members of Tongmenghui.

609
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:11,329
But only two of them.

610
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,449
The rest were all my family.

611
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,809
They were in Japan
for business and study.

612
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,489
Those two Tongmenghui members
followed us

613
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:20,849
just to use us to cover their tracks.

614
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,210
My family never thought

615
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,730
that there would be such great danger.

616
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,530
Who knew they would be implicated
and lose their lives?

617
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:28,570
I am not a member of Tongmenghui.

618
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,730
Nor am I a rebel.

619
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,570
If your words are true,

620
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,610
why did you follow me to Shanghai?

621
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,730
You said

622
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,170
you would definitely help me catch

623
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,889
the murderer of my family.

624
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:39,130
You said you would grant me justice.

625
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,010
You are lying.

626
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,809
Before arriving in Shanghai,

627
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:43,210
we had already parted ways.

628
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:44,610
Even if you knew

629
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,969
that my destination was Shanghai,

630
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:48,130
how could you possibly know
the exact location

631
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,730
was Maiqi Road in the French Concession?

632
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:52,769
Not to mention that even I didn't know

633
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:54,809
the handler Zhuo Bufan
and his fellows were looking for

634
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:58,210
was in a café on Maiqi Road
in the French Concession.

635
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:58,969
But you

636
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:02,809
just happened to appear there.

637
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:12,969
It was you.

638
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,610
I'm giving you one last chance.

639
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:26,409
(Tell me the truth.)

640
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,969
Are you a member of Tongmenghui?

641
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:34,730
I was...

642
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,130
I was studying in Japan.

643
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,090
Of course I know of Tongmenghui.

644
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,289
Some of my classmates
were in contact with Tongmenghui.

645
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,730
But I am not.

646
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,489
Then why were you

647
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:52,449
in the café on Maiqi Road?

648
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,929
Don't tell me it was just a coincidence.

649
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:59,010
On the ship returning home,

650
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,289
I heard those two Tongmenghui members

651
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,730
mention the café on Maiqi Road.

652
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,650
I didn't pay much attention

653
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,409
until you mentioned

654
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,530
you were coming to Shanghai
to investigate the case.

655
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,929
On the third day of the month,
I arrived in Shanghai.

656
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,050
I went straight to that café.

657
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,530
I just wanted to try my luck

658
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,489
to see if I could meet

659
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:20,170
the person Tongmenghui wanted to meet.

660
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,010
Why did you want to meet that person?

661
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:24,929
I just want to know

662
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:28,090
what exactly the reason

663
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,610
for my family's tragic end is.

664
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,849
Do you think I believe you?

665
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:31,889
You don't have to believe me.

666
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:35,050
But think about it carefully,

667
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:38,170
I've been following you all the way.

668
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,449
If I were a person from Tongmenghui,

669
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,250
I would be avoiding you.

670
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,849
Back in Gegu...

671
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,570
Please let this officer use my room.

672
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,489
(When there was no available room,)

673
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,130
(it was I who offered you
to stay in my room.)

674
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,250
(In Tianjin, you asked me to leave,)

675
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,650
(but I secretly followed you
all the way.)

676
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:00,730
(If I were from Tongmenghui,)

677
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,289
(why would I do that?)

678
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,170
(Would there be any need
for me to do so?)

679
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,409
You've been pointing a blade
at me since the moment you entered.

680
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,690
You didn't trust me from the start.

681
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,250
So many coincidences.

682
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,329
How can I believe you?

683
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:21,889
You don't have to believe me.

684
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,650
After all, my family is dead.

685
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,650
I am all alone in the world.

686
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,610
I have nowhere to go.

687
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:38,090
Mr. Wang,

688
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:42,489
thank you for your care all this time.

689
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,289
Go ahead.

690
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,130
Send me to reunite with my family.

691
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,969
Put on your clothes.

692
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,690
Back then on Maiqi Road,

693
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,010
didn't you notice me?

694
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,130
I saw you.

695
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,690
But they took you away.

696
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,690
I didn't know where to find you.

697
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,650
Why do you still stay

698
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,170
in this hotel in Shanghai?

699
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,969
I have nowhere to go.

700
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,650
My family is all gone.

701
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:23,010
I don't know where to go.

702
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:25,849
I don't know what to do next.

703
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,449
You don't trust me.

704
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:44,250
Fine.

705
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,210
Okay.

706
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:47,170
Do it!

707
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,650
Hurry up and put on your clothes.

708
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:53,849
You did nothing facing my strike.

709
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,170
I believe you.

710
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:58,289
You are just an ordinary woman.

711
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,730
If you don't kill me, take me with you.

712
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:03,849
Taking you with me?

713
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:05,650
Anyway, if you don't take me with you,

714
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,050
I will still follow you.

715
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,449
Miss Lin, I'm hunting a murderer.

716
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:09,530
It's not a sightseeing trip.

717
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,570
You can't endure the hardship.

718
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,130
From Tianjin to Shanghai,

719
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,050
I've made it all the way here.

720
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,289
And you still don't think I can?

721
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:18,010
No.

722
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:19,570
It's inconvenient for me

723
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,570
to take a girl with me.

724
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,809
Turn around.

725
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,769
Miss Lin, have you finished dressing?

726
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,570
Turn around and look at me.

727
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,449
You are a woman.

728
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,730
Miss Lin.

729
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:58,050
Is it still inconvenient now?

730
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:58,769
I...

731
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:00,050
Either kill me

732
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,170
or take me with you.

733
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:01,849
Miss Lin, I...

734
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,610
I am not going to kill you.

735
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,769
Then take me with you.

736
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:06,289
Not now.

737
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:08,289
I still don't know where Zhuo Bufan

738
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:09,090
has gone.

739
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,530
Go investigate it now.

740
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,010
I'll wait here for you.

741
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,929
Come back and take me
with you once you've found out.

742
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,489
I will investigate it.

743
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:16,409
I will.

744
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:23,050
You...

745
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,210
Be careful.

746
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:28,730
Wait for my message.

747
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:29,570
Okay.

748
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:43,889
He's gone.

749
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:53,849
Very good.

750
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,170
Now you have the chance

751
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,570
to get close to Mr. Wang again.

752
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,210
Do you think he is still valuable?

753
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,969
Yes, he's very valuable.

754
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,969
Just a few days ago,

755
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,329
I still underestimated him.

756
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,369
But now, I don't think so.

757
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,210
Judging from the siege
in the Concession,

758
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,409
it's very likely
that Men Sandao and Mr. Wang

759
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,449
are both after Zhuo Bufan
and looking for the Altar Treasure,

760
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:18,929
one overtly and the other covertly.

761
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:20,690
As long as you follow him,

762
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,090
you will definitely
obtain important clues.

763
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,369
If my guess is correct,

764
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:30,730
Mr. Wang now

765
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,409
is going to see Men Sandao.

766
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:33,769
Do you think

767
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:36,250
Men Sandao has more clues?

768
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,250
So you need to get all the clues

769
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,289
he knows from Mr. Wang.
