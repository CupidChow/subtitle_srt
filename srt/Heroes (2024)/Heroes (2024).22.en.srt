1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,280
You can see me clearly from your room.

2
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,679
Even if someone comes,
you will certainly notice.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,320
No need to guard the door, right?

4
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,679
You're overthinking it.

5
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,600
I'm practicing kung fu.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,159
I get up at this time
every day to practice kung fu

7
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,320
until dawn.

8
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm not like you revolutionaries.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,039
You can get up whenever you want.

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,679
I am under house arrest right now.

11
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,679
When I joined the revolution,

12
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,079
I often stayed up all night.

13
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,719
No revolution for you anymore.

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,920
Go to sleep.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,960
Don't disturb my practice.

16
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,920
You are so quiet.

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,600
What kung fu is it?

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,799
You won't understand anyway.

19
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,719
Really?

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,040
Holding breath?

21
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:08,832
Get lost!

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,560
Anyway, I'm already awake.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,319
How about we talk?

24
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,680
I still have one chance
that you gave me.

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,280
Liu Lin.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,120
You are a rebel.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,200
I have treated you nice enough.

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
I really won't

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,400
tell you the secret of Bodhi Seal.

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,200
Then don't talk.

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm planning to move you
to another place.

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,439
Why?

33
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,959
You've already been targeted.

34
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,560
It's no longer safe
for you to stay here.

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,000
I can't spend every day
just to watch over you.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,560
So, I have to find you

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,920
a safer place to stay.

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,239
Where is it then?

39
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,239
As a rebel,

40
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,040
there certainly aren't
many places you can go.

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,239
The Ministry of Justice has cells.

42
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,239
And the Department
has a place to detain criminals.

43
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,680
The cells in the Ministry of Justice
are slightly bigger.

44
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,480
The food at the Department
is slightly better.

45
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,159
Choose one.

46
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,599
Mr. Muqing?

47
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,599
Do you really want to imprison me?

48
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,159
Are you scared?

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,040
You are supposed to
face death without fear.

50
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,200
Going to the prison should

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,599
make you feel like coming home?

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,954
=Heroes=

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,648
=Episode 22=

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,959
What is your name?

55
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,399
My name is Zhang Xiaoyun.

56
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,519
Don't you know?

57
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,160
(Six years ago)

58
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,439
I'll ask you again.

59
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,240
What is your name?

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,519
Who are you working for?

61
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,480
My name is Zhang Xiaoyun.

62
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,199
You once said

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,040
I am your woman.

64
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,319
My woman

65
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,360
wouldn't burst into my study

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,720
in the middle of the night.

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,759
My woman

68
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,399
couldn't have such a thing.

69
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,279
Expo pocket watch camera.

70
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,680
Produced in New York, USA.

71
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,240
It uses a special miniature film.

72
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,439
The lens is hidden
in the watch's winding crown,

73
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,759
with focal length of 25 mm
and aperture f/16.

74
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,439
This was

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,399
just produced this year.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,879
Not something that everyone can get.

77
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,600
And yet you're already using it.

78
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,199
Pretty impressive.

79
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
I don't know.

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,199
Speak up.

81
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,759
Who gave it to you?

82
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,160
The British?

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,079
The Germans?

84
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,279
Or the Japanese?

85
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,079
Do you know?

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,079
My ancestral home is in Hubei.

87
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,040
That's why there's the character 'Xian'
in my name.

88
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,199
You're called Xiaoyun.

89
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,199
I remember when we first met,

90
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,360
you said there is a poem
about our names.

91
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,000
What is it?

92
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,600
The winds are fierce at Xian Mountain.

93
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,600
The big sails look like flying birds.

94
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,399
I still remember the first time we met,

95
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,639
you bumped into my car
in the Concession.

96
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,120
Then we encountered
at a Western restaurant.

97
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,120
Gradually, you became my girlfriend.

98
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,439
You were very clever.

99
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,319
I almost fell for it.

100
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,399
I almost fell for it.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,560
You won't talk, right?

102
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,040
I will ask another question.

103
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,319
Do you really like me?

104
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
Yes.

105
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,839
I also think so.

106
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,360
But it's strange.

107
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,439
You're here to steal information.

108
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,839
Why do I always have this feeling

109
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,040
that you're really
falling in love with me?

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,959
I like you.

111
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,160
Like me?

112
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,600
Do you like me?

113
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,319
Then tell me your name.

114
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,319
And who do you work for?

115
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,680
What information do you want to steal?

116
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,439
Speak.

117
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,199
It was your first mission

118
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,360
and it was quite difficult.

119
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,199
But you completed it

120
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,600
and did a fairly good job.

121
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,439
Although you made some mistakes
in the beginning,

122
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,480
but the result was perfect.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,839
We got everything we needed.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,199
After you were captured,

125
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,759
you kept your mouth shut.

126
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,800
This

127
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,879
is commendable.

128
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,399
So I have a special gift for you.

129
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,839
Follow me.

130
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,919
Come in.

131
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,159
Your first mission.

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,799
Your first man.

133
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,799
Do you know why you could make it?

134
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,759
He has already suspected you.

135
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,840
But he wanted to own you.

136
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,559
And that's why he gave you a chance.

137
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,639
It's human nature.

138
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
Even the most rational ones,

139
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,120
when they are in love,

140
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,840
they can be swayed by desire.

141
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,200
But after desires are fulfilled,

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
they will

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,679
become rational again.

144
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,399
So remember.

145
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,519
A man who likes you

146
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,200
doesn't mean he won't abandon you.

147
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,320
Human nature is something
that can never be changed.

148
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,960
Remember this.

149
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,600
And you won't be hurt.

150
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,840
I am now handing him over to you.

151
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,639
How you deal with him

152
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,600
is up to you.

153
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,720
Torture him?

154
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
Retaliate against him?

155
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,399
Kill him?

156
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
Then you will get over it.

157
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,679
The first mission ended perfectly.

158
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,759
From now on,

159
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,639
you'll be invincible.

160
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,039
The winds are fierce at Xian Mountain.

161
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,639
The big sails look like flying birds.

162
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,360
Leaning on the window, I ask my friend.

163
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,639
Will you be homesick
and return home like Zhang Han?

164
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,240
Wang Jialuo.

165
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,919
You are so shameless.

166
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,240
You don't deserve to be a noble man.
Shameless. Vulgar.

167
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,080
How could I do

168
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,759
such an ignoble thing?

169
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:44,559
I...

170
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,679
It's not just you.

171
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,200
I am also shameless, right?

172
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,080
No.

173
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,679
Miss Lin.

174
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,519
It's my fault

175
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
for disgracing you.

176
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,960
I...

177
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,759
We like each other.

178
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,720
So it happened naturally.

179
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,559
How can that be a disgrace?

180
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,279
No.

181
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
It doesn't work without
a marriage contract and a matchmaker.

182
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,559
Besides, you are the victim in my case.

183
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,399
How could I...

184
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,320
It happened anyway.

185
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,759
You don't like me?

186
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,080
I...

187
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,159
I dare not say.

188
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,799
No matter what, I am your woman now.

189
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,519
I like you.

190
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,039
I am willing to be with you.

191
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,360
What else to be afraid of?

192
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,360
I am not afraid.

193
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,799
I just think

194
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,840
that what I have done

195
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,399
was too absurd.

196
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,679
Too absurd.

197
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,720
If you didn't turn around and hug me,

198
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,639
that would be really absurd.

199
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,960
Miss Lin.

200
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:26,799
Jialuo.

201
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,720
I am willing to be with you.

202
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,919
I can't be happier

203
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,600
for staying by your side.

204
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,240
Let alone crazy
highly skilled martial artists.

205
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,960
There are few crazy people out there.

206
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,440
We've already been to a few counties.

207
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,799
and searched the countryside.

208
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:34,879
Perhaps

209
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
this person doesn't exist.

210
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,759
Perhaps

211
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,559
that old madman
could have died a long time ago.

212
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,960
We've been searching for so long.

213
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,200
We should keep going.

214
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,200
Even if this person is dead,

215
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,480
there must be some trace of him, right?

216
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,039
Huanjie is right.

217
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,960
As long as we want to find him,

218
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,519
we can find him sooner or later.

219
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,279
Well.

220
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,000
A madman skilled in kung fu

221
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,679
surely won't remain unknown.

222
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,559
At least, the villagers in the area
would know this person.

223
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,080
Since this person has existed,

224
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,519
we will find out.

225
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:18,240
Right.

226
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,759
So everyone has to try harder

227
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,000
and keep on searching.

228
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,008
Of course.

229
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,720
Perhaps

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,279
this could be the key clue.

231
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,320
How old is she?

232
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,759
In her twenties.

233
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,960
What's her name?

234
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,960
Liu Lin.

235
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,240
Your distant relative's daughter?

236
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,432
Yes.

237
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,960
She has come to you?

238
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,519
Yes.

239
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,080
I've been too busy lately

240
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,000
at work.

241
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,039
After several thoughts, I thought
you are the perfect choice.

242
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,240
You

243
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,240
really don't know how to lie.

244
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,679
Your distant relative

245
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,279
probably doesn't even know

246
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,919
that you've already
been released from prison.

247
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,360
You are a bannerman.

248
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,519
Since when

249
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,440
do you have Han distant relatives?

250
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,279
A girl in her twenties.

251
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,559
Your distant relative trusts you so much
to leave her in your care?

252
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,720
Stop making sounds.

253
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,559
I don't care who she is.

254
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,839
Since you asked for my help,

255
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,359
I will surely help you.

256
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,519
Thank you very much, princess.

257
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,279
However,

258
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,839
I can't say I do you a favor.

259
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,680
Just hand her over to me,

260
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,400
and consider her as my friend.

261
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,480
Has she been educated?

262
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,440
Yes.

263
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,640
She has also studied abroad.

264
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,759
Okay.

265
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,359
Then she is my overseas classmate.

266
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,960
Princess Wulan Shan?

267
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,079
Right.

268
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,112
You...

269
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,039
I don't mean to belittle you.

270
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,920
Even if you are a fourth-rank
imperial guard,

271
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,519
how do you know a princess?

272
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
We've known each other for long

273
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,599
since we were little.

274
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,160
We're friends.

275
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,079
In a feudal dynasty,

276
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,599
it's quite rare for masters and servants

277
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,920
to become friends.

278
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,000
You are so mean.

279
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,799
Wulan Shan studied in Britain.

280
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,160
She's not like the other princesses.

281
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,200
Then she didn't join you in the reform?

282
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
She is a lady.

283
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,519
What about it?

284
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,119
A lady once ruled the nation
behind the curtain.

285
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,720
You are talking nonsense.

286
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:24,960
I just don't understand

287
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,640
why you confine me
to the princess's residence?

288
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,920
Just send me to Ministry of Justice.

289
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,480
That is easier.

290
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,160
If you tell me right now

291
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,400
what the Bodhi Seal is,

292
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,279
I will release you.

293
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,279
Isn't that much simpler?

294
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,279
Then I will go to the princess's place.

295
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,160
Pack your things.

296
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,440
Nothing to pack.

297
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,839
Remember.

298
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,720
I will have someone watching you.

299
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
If you want to escape,

300
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,759
save you strength.

301
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,240
Mr. Muqing.

302
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,400
There are Japanese outside.

303
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,000
Also Rongtian Ridge and Beiyang Army.

304
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
It doesn't matter who caught me.

305
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,119
But being caught by you
is somewhat better.

306
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,720
After all, you're not a usual Hound.

307
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,799
Remember what I've told you.

308
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,640
When you go to Wulan Shan's place,
just say you're her overseas classmate.

309
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,400
Bear in mind.

310
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,559
Do not mention me in front of anyone.

311
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,000
Got it.

312
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,119
You've said it several times.

313
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,119
Wulan Shan knew you sent me, right?

314
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,440
Of course.

315
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,759
Where is it?

316
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,680
Right there.

317
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,240
That old madman's martial arts

318
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
are very good.

319
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,039
We've finally found him.

320
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,880
Judging by this person's
figure and pace,

321
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,000
he resembles Du E from Futu Temple.

322
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,000
He must also be
practicing Shaolin kung fu.

323
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,160
It's definitely him.

324
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,039
I'll go capture him.

325
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,160
This person has such chaotic tactics.

326
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,000
Why is he so formidable?

327
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,480
Chaotic?

328
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't think so at all.

329
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,680
Are you the inheritor
of Dharma of Southern Shaolin?

330
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,048
Bufan.

331
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,880
His kung fu is good.

332
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,519
He's already delirious.

333
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,799
It's no use interrogating him.

334
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,759
It's over 30 moves now.

335
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,119
He can still stand there

336
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,000
after 30 moves.

337
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,480
Huanjie.

338
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,680
Mr. Zhuo will do the Swordfall move.

339
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,519
Huanjie.

340
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:52,672
Come.

341
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,559
Sugar-coated haws!

342
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,704
The back door of the restaurant is here.

343
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,200
Get on.

344
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,680
Fresh vegetables!

345
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,839
Go through the back door.

346
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,680
Are you sure no one is following?

347
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,319
I shook them off back at the restaurant.

348
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,319
Then why the fuss?

349
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,200
Just to be safe.

350
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,440
Sugar-coated haws!

351
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,759
We've arrived.

352
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,824
(Qingfeng Teahouse)

353
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,599
Greetings, princess.

354
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:47,720
Hi.

355
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,480
My name is Liu Lin.

356
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't be so rude.

357
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,079
She is not.

358
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,640
She is my classmate
from my studies abroad.

359
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,599
There's no need
for such cumbersome etiquette.

360
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,119
Please sit.

361
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,480
Muqing.

362
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,359
Have a seat.

363
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,359
Don't worry.

364
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,960
At my place,

365
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
I will take care of her.

366
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,400
Thank you, princess.

367
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,400
Are you leaving the capital soon?

368
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,240
Perhaps.

369
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,119
It's not yet certain.

370
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,319
You have been recently

371
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,519
staying in the mansion, right?

372
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,440
I should have been.

373
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,759
But

374
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,000
my husband received a transfer order
from the Beiyang Army.

375
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,392
He was appointed
to a position in Fujian.

376
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,559
Will you go with him?

377
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,200
He did discuss it with me.

378
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,319
But I haven't agreed yet.

379
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't really want to
leave the capital.

380
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,240
Do you want me to leave the capital?

381
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,279
I wouldn't dare interfere
with your decision.

382
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,559
Just follow your heart.

383
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,440
Just follow my heart.

384
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,559
If I really can do that,

385
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,039
what troubles would there be?

386
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,119
I just passed by the pastry shop

387
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,680
and bought some pastries.

388
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
These are all your favorites.

389
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,039
Have a taste.

390
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,400
Here.

391
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,640
Try it.

392
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,079
When I didn't have classes back then,

393
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,519
I would often sneak out to buy pastries.

394
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,279
It's quite amusing thinking of it.

395
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,400
There are all kinds of pastries

396
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,599
at the residence.

397
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,920
But I just think

398
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,039
that the ones sold in shops
taste better.

399
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,440
Muqing used to buy them

400
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,680
and secretly bring them to me.

401
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,200
He dared not to carry them.

402
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,759
So he always tucked them
inside his official uniform.

403
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,400
Every time I see him walking towards me

404
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,440
like nothing happened,

405
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,559
and took out pastries from his clothes.

406
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,319
I found it particularly amusing.

407
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,799
It was many years ago.

408
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,319
You still remember.

409
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:19,759
How could I forget?

410
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,519
Do you forget?

411
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,280
I dare not.

412
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,359
I dare not forget.

413
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,920
Get on the sedan chair.

414
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,160
I've told them you are my classmate
from my studies abroad.

415
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,079
What's wrong with
walking you to the room?

416
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,519
We need to make it look real.

417
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,839
This room was kept

418
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,799
for my overseas classmates
to stay in when they return.

419
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,640
No one has ever come.

420
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,680
You're the first one.

421
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,480
Everything is new.

422
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,160
Help yourself.

423
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,440
The phonograph is from England.

424
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,000
Those scented candles are from France.

425
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,720
If you don't like the scent,

426
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,799
you can have servants change it.

427
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,079
Everything is great.

428
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,160
Thank you, princess.

429
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,480
I've already caused enough trouble.

430
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,880
It's no trouble at all.

431
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,480
Muqing asked me for help,

432
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,799
so I surely will take care of you.

433
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,599
But he must have told you

434
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,960
not to mention him in front of others.

435
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,799
When it's mealtime or teatime,

436
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,000
the servants will invite you.

437
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,680
If you would like to come, join me.

438
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,039
If not, have it sent to your room.

439
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:05,920
Thank you.

440
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,480
If you need anything, just tell us.

441
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,200
Help yourself.

442
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,839
Aren't you going to ask

443
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,440
what our relationship is?

444
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,400
He has told me.

445
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,519
You are the daughter
of his distant relative.

446
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:32,839
Bufan.

447
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:36,599
I am okay.

448
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,240
He is a lunatic.

449
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,759
Using insects on him is useless.

450
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,599
I didn't get anything useful.

451
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
He has already gone crazy.

452
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,519
But still, he hurt me so badly.

453
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,440
If he is of clear mind,

454
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,640
I'm afraid I can't defeat him.

455
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,039
Shaolin's martial arts

456
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,680
is truly formidable.

457
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,519
Is your injury

458
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,920
serious?

459
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,000
This is also the worst injury

460
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,839
I've had over so many years.

461
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:09,680
Don't worry.

462
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,759
I will recover in a few days.

463
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,759
He doesn't know what the pain is.

464
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,279
What is it, Huanjie?

465
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,599
He said nothing
even though I tortured him.

466
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,839
I told you he's a real madman.

467
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,079
Have you searched everywhere?

468
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,119
It's completely empty.

469
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,480
What kind of clue is this?

470
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,359
Keep going?

471
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,279
How should we do that?

472
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,079
I'm going to give it another try.

473
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:46,592
Huanjie.

474
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,039
He is the chief inheritor
of Dharma Department.

475
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,640
It's tragic enough for him

476
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,759
to end up like this.

477
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,440
Just spare him.

478
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,200
Bufan.

479
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,640
He is just a madman.

480
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,279
Why do you care?

481
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,720
Are you sure it's Rongtian Ridge?

482
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,400
They are the only ones
who wear Lingxi attire.

483
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,279
Speaking of which,

484
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,559
our soldiers just bumped into them,

485
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,480
so they followed them.

486
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,400
Those smart guys weren't discovered.

487
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
I've already summoned them.

488
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,839
Did they head to west outskirts?

489
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,376
Right.

490
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,119
The soldiers told me
they stopped at a shabby temple.

491
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:21,920
A shabby temple?

492
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,240
A shabby temple?

493
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,400
Your master often
stays at a shabby temple.

494
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,904
Zhuo Bufan is looking for my master?

495
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,480
Seriously?

496
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:30,920
Your master?

497
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,079
Bufan.

498
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,799
He won't talk.

499
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,519
Kill him anyway.

500
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,279
Huanjie.

501
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,200
Forget it.

502
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,072
We got company.

503
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:48,920
Mr. Zhuo.

504
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,359
Zhuo Bufan.

505
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,359
Yu Huanjie.

506
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,519
Where is my master?

507
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,424
Master?

508
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,079
The man inside is your master?

509
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,319
If anything happens to him,

510
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,920
I'll eliminate the Rongtian Sword Sect.

511
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,319
So, he is your master.

512
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,519
Don't move.

513
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,039
One more step forward,

514
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,440
I'll kill you.

515
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,039
No wonder.

516
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,599
A county constable

517
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,400
came all the way to hunt us down.

518
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,599
A county constable

519
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,240
has such good martial skills.

520
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,720
A county constable

521
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,680
dares to confront Rongtian Sword Sect.

522
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,799
Wang Jialuo.

523
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:53,880
You hid yourself deeply.

524
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,640
What have I hidden?

525
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:55,640
Zhuo Bufan.

526
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,720
My master is not a normal person.

527
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,400
As a Sect Leader,

528
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,000
how could you make a move
on an elderly man?

529
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,519
That's right.

530
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,440
Even if the chief inheritor of
Dharma Department has gone mad,

531
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,559
he is still not a normal person.

532
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:07,920
Dharma Department?

533
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,400
Stop pretending.

534
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,279
The Dharma Seal is in your hands, right?

535
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,119
You are the Dharma inheritor.

536
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,480
Indeed, there's not an outsider here.

537
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,680
You didn't want me.

538
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,039
You wanted my Discipline Seal.

539
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:23,920
Zhuo Bufan.

540
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,200
I don't care about any seals.

541
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,960
Today I must first arrest you.

542
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,640
Wang Jialuo.

543
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,359
You'd better have your people
put down their guns

544
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,640
and back off.

545
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,920
If you resist arrest,

546
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,039
I will order them
to shoot every one of you.

547
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,920
Don't forget
your master is still in my hands.

548
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,800
Master.

549
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,599
Wang Jialuo.

550
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,240
I won't say it again.

551
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,720
You despicable guy!

552
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:07,584
Okay.

553
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,720
Okay.

554
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,400
Have them put down their guns.

555
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,279
Step back.

556
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:19,920
Jialuo.

557
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,720
Ding Yu, heed the order.

558
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Without guns,

559
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,720
what else can you do?

560
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,000
Dharma inheritor.

561
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,640
You really disgrace the heritage
of the Southern Shaolin.

562
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,559
I am the constable
from the Dagu County Yamen.

563
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,640
Then come and arrest me.

564
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,279
I will.

565
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,359
If you don't come to me,
I will come to you.

566
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,359
I will certainly get the Dharma Seal.

567
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:08,800
However,

568
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,920
it's best to keep your guns

569
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,199
with you day and night.

570
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,079
I will surely

571
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,559
bring you to justice.

572
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,719
Let's go.

573
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,360
Master.

574
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,320
Everyone, grab your guns.

575
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,199
Chase after them.

576
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,288
I'll take you to a physician.

577
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:44,800
Go.

578
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,376
Jialuo.

579
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,679
I'll get a physician here.

580
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,199
Hurry up.

581
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,039
Master, sit down.

582
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,280
Jialuo.

583
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:08,960
Jialuo.

584
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,360
Master.

585
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm here.

586
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,160
Shoulder.

587
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:13,728
Shoulder.

588
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,599
Jialuo.

589
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,960
I am here, Master.

590
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,119
Hang in there.

591
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,559
The physician will be here soon.

592
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,920
You will be fine.

593
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,840
The year of Xinhai.

594
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,440
The sixth day of the fifth month.

595
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,480
Baohe Inn.

596
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,320
The thirty-year appointment.

597
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,039
Master, save your energy.

598
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,719
The sixth day of the fifth month
in the year of Xinhai.

599
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,320
Baohe Inn.

600
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:07,119
The thirty-year appointment.

601
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,920
I've remembered it, Master.

602
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,848
I remembered it.

603
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,440
Master.

604
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,440
Master.

605
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,480
Master.

606
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,000
Master.

607
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,920
I will avenge your death.

608
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,840
I will avenge your death.

609
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,920
Master.

610
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,480
Rest in peace.

611
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:23,880
Dharma inheritor.

612
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,599
I have never thought

613
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,679
that I am

614
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,280
the chief inheritor of Dharma.

615
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,840
You were just investigating a case.

616
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
But now you've got involved

617
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,280
in such a major issue.

618
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:44,800
Perhaps

619
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,880
this is destiny.

620
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,480
Destiny?

621
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,840
But I know nothing at all.

622
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,719
What exactly is the Altar Treasure?

623
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,599
If I haven't had chased the murderers,

624
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,400
I might never have known.

625
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,800
What kind of inheritor am I?

626
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,480
When I met my master,

627
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,639
he was already mad.

628
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,400
I guess even he didn't know.

629
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,239
Am I his inheritor?

630
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,119
Am I really your inheritor?

631
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,840
Even if I am,

632
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,280
I must be the most useless one.

633
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,679
Secrets.

634
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:44,519
Legacy.

635
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,159
I have nothing.

636
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,800
Then what exactly
did your master tell you

637
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,320
before he died?

638
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,280
The year of Xinhai.

639
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,400
Sixth day of fifth month.

640
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,760
Baohe Inn.

641
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,039
The thirty-year appointment.

642
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,760
Master never said such things.

643
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,360
I don't know

644
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,400
what Baohe Inn is?

645
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,440
Since your master was the chief
of the Dharma Department,

646
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,719
could that Baohe Inn

647
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,639
be the place where he hid his secrets?

648
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,559
The sixth day of the fifth month
of the year of Xinhai.

649
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,280
Were you supposed to go there
at this time?

650
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,760
If so,

651
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,800
then this is the clue
to the secret treasure.

652
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,000
Exactly.

653
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,800
But what about
the thirty-year appointment?

654
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,280
Before he died,

655
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,239
he also pointed

656
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,079
at the tattoo on his shoulder.

657
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:45,599
Tattoo?

658
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,119
What tattoo?

659
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,079
It's no longer visible.

660
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,159
But that tattoo

661
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,159
is not unfamiliar to me.

662
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,320
That was many years ago.

663
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,599
I was still young.

664
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,360
When I didn't want to study,
I would go to him to learn martial arts.

665
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:05,880
When I was tired,

666
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,960
I would just sleep on the ground.

667
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,400
One time,

668
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,000
I was awoken by a sharp pain.

669
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,719
I looked up

670
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,840
and saw him inking a tattoo

671
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,679
at my shoulder, just like his own.

672
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,400
You have one too?

673
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,599
In my memory,

674
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,480
only in that instant

675
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,880
my master was lucid.

676
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,480
Then he went mad again.

677
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,360
Do you know what that tattoo means?

678
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,199
I guess

679
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,679
it might be some sort of mark
of our martial sect.

680
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,000
You can't tell, right?

681
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,440
I can't tell.

682
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,679
Jialuo.

683
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:12,119
You should stop thinking about it.

684
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,800
No, I can't.

685
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,719
Although I don't know
what my master went through

686
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,880
in his whole life.

687
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,960
Since I am his inheritor,

688
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:26,039
I should carry on his cause.

689
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,400
Besides,

690
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:30,840
I have to avenge

691
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,079
my master's death.

692
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,800
The Dagu murder case

693
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:35,960
cannot be left unresolved.

694
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,119
It's good.

695
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,256
Zhuo Bufan is responsible for both.
