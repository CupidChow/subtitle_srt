00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,640
already been so idle
that they had to spar

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,960
to kill time?

00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,239
Zhuo Bufan is known as
the best swordsman of the Qing Dynasty.

Men Sandao is the best imperial guard
of the Imperial Household Department.

6
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,240
I wonder which one of them

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,600
will be better?

The court is very impersonal, isn't it?

35
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,199
Yes.

36
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,840
Since it's called the court,

37
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,439
inevitably, people are indifferent

38
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,280

How about it?

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,199
Alright.

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,200
(My name is Zhuo Bufan.)

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,080
(I have high ideals.)

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
(I'm destined to be unusual.)

69
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,520
(Only those who dare
to wander everywhere)

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,560
(are qualified to bear this name.)

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,040
(Thus)

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,960
(I risk my life,)

73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
(death,)

74
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,640
(and future.)

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,080
(Life is unfair,)

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,408
(and I fell on an evil time.)

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
(Yet I insist on fighting against
the world with my own sword.)

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
(Life and death are unpredictable)

79
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,920
(in the fleeting vanity of the world.)

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,760
(I determine my own destiny.)

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,960
(I bet I will have a bright future)

82
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,240
(with a promising career.)

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
(I shall guard the last hope
of my sect.)

84
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,040
(But I lost the bet)

85
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,680
(on her.)

86
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,760
(I thought we couldn't)

87
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
(meet the right one too late.)

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,480
(But the fact is the opposite.)

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,040
(Meeting too early)

90
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
(won't work either.)

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,920
(I always remember
the first time I met her.)

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,880
(She stood beneath the flowers)

93
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,720
(with a smile
as warm as the spring breeze.)

94
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,160
(But afterwards,)

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,480
(even though she has been by my side,)

96
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,560
(I cannot give her the promise)

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,320
(or the answer.)

98
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,680
(In my youth,)

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,560
(I was always
searching for that answer.)

100
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,760
(But having lived long
in the tumultuous world,)

101
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,800
(I only wish that there are no fights)

102
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,920
(and lovers can get together.)

=Episode 33=

105
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,120
You must have been using this sword
for a long time.

106
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,199
Indeed.

107
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,319
I don't like a blunt sword.

108
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,000
So I must sharpen it after each fight.

109
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,439
Over a long time,

110
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,399
it becomes thinner and lighter.

111
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,319
Ordinary swordsmen

112
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,680
might think it's too light to handle.

113
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,800
Those renowned swordsmen

114
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
all want a famous sword for themselves.

115
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,879
You are different though.

116
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,240
Who would have thought that
this is the sword of the best swordsman?

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,079
A famous sword is useless.

118
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
A swordsman with skills
can fight with any sword.

119
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,519
Jialuo is right.

120
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,639
I believe you can only
be called a swordsman

121
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,040
if you can handle any kind of sword.

122
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,720
Don't call me the best swordsman.

123
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,439
That's just a useless title.

124
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,399
Since people recognize you as that,

125
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,399
I am still impressed.

126
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,759
Besides,

127
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,160
it was not me who suppressed you
in the fight today,

128
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,120
but the thousand-year legacy
of the Bodhi Department.

129
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,959
I have only learned
a thing or two from it.

130
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,959
If you have mastered the Sanyin Sword,

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,439
I believe

132
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,240
that you could trounce me.

133
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,319
So I think

134
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,879
once you master all its techniques,

135
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,720
fight me one more time.

136
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,240
I can't wait.

137
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,240
It's a deal.

138
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:31,920
Mr. Zhuo.

139
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Try this.

140
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,279
Take one, Jialuo.

141
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,600
Thank you.

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,224
(Welcome, Brother Prajna Inheritor,
to the 30-year pact of Baohe Inn)

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
What did you draw a line for?

144
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,279
Think carefully.

145
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,360
See if you can recall anything.

146
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,720
You can leave.

147
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Otherwise, don't cross this line.

148
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,439
If you cross it,

149
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll cripple your cultivation.

150
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,720
Futu Temple?

151
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,800
Exactly.

152
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,439
If you just draw such a line,

153
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,480
do you think Prajna inheritor

154
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,879
will understand
what you're trying to say?

155
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
43 years ago,

156
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,720
Luan Yi,
the chief guard of the Department

157
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,079
chased after a Xianghua monk
called Wu Shuangbao.

158
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,959
But unfortunately, he was imprisoned
in the Futu Temple by Wu Shuangbao.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,160
Wu Shuangbao also drew a line

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,480
in the Futu Temple

161
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,240
to confine Luan Yi
in the temple ever since.

162
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,959
Ever since?

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,560
Du E?

164
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,639
Wu Shuangbao is Prajna inheritor.

165
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
Yes.

166
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,480
But Du E can't be the Prajna inheritor.

167
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,759
Of course, he can't be.

168
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,199
But both Luan Yi

169
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,959
and the young abbot of Futu Temple

170
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,720
know the kung fu of Prajna Hall.

171
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,839
I have fought with him.

172
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,240
Bufan also has.

173
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,639
Yeah.

174
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,399
At that time, I had no strength

175
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,480
to fight back at all.

176
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,480
That move

177
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,319
of seizing your weak point
with bare hands

178
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,879
is called Dragon-Subduing Skill.

179
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,920
This is the skill
Wu Shuangbao left at Futu Temple.

180
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,399
What he left behind

181
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,480
also included this line.

182
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,799
So when the Prajna inheritor
sees this line,

183
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,720
that person will understand
we refer to Futu Temple.

184
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,879
So are you suggesting

185
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
that after we get out, we part ways,

186
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,279
get rid of the trailers,

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,639
then meet at Futu Temple?

188
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,399
That's exactly what I mean.

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,759
Only the three of us know about this.

190
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,480
You mustn't tell anyone else.

191
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,879
At this very moment,

192
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,919
I trust no one.

193
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,799
Not even your woman can know about this.

194
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:09,879
Alright.

195
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:14,688
(Ze Ze Inn)

196
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,178
(Welcome, Brother Prajna Inheritor,
to the 30-year pact of Baohe Inn)

197
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,039
Will the Prajna inheritor still come?

198
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,840
Don't worry.

199
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,000
Whether he comes or not,
we will see how it plays out soon.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,159
Be patient.

201
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,159
It's already this late.

202
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,320
I don't think he will come.

203
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,240
I agree.

204
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,879
Is Sei I Shinpu still here?

205
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,320
Yes.

206
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,279
Good.

207
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,919
Once they start fighting,

208
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,039
let them be.

209
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,000
Understood.

210
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,960
Even if Sei I Shinpu is killed,

211
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,840
don't do anything.

212
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,840
Yes.

213
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,519
What's the matter?

214
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,240
What's going on?

215
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,840
Nothing.

216
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,320
Just a bunch of fools
fighting against each other.

217
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Let them be.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,480
The sixth day almost comes to an end.

219
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,440
Well.

220
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,000
Should we leave
once the new day arrives,

221
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,240
or should we

222
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,879
continue the act a bit longer?

223
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,519
We have all been acting

224
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,000
for such a long time.

225
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,799
Actually, when it got dark,

226
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,000
we could have left, right?

227
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,399
How about this?

228
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,600
Bufan will bang the table, stand up

229
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,639
and leave in anger.

230
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,840
Then Jialuo,
you will pretend to quarrel with me.

231
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,559
And each of us
leave without looking back.

232
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,440
That's okay.

233
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,039
I didn't expect

234
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,720
they would make an entrance this way.

235
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,320
It surprised me too.

236
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,679
However,

237
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,039
these people look weak.

238
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,519
I just slapped you a few days ago.

239
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,879
Have you already forgotten the pain?

240
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,600
How could you hit a woman?

241
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,759
I didn't think of them as people.

242
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,840
That's true.

243
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,320
Together then.

244
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,960
Of course.

245
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,879
We are a team.

246
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:37,799
What?

247
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,720
You are poisoned.

248
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,919
Actually, not poisoned.

249
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,200
You are drugged

250
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,759
by a synthetic drug.

251
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,799
It's more effective
than those knockout drugs

252
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,600
or arsenic of yours.

253
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,600
This kind of drug starts to take effect

254
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,840
three hours after entering
the human body.

255
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,960
It slows down the blood circulation

256
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,559
while paralyzes the heart.

257
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,399
It will also cause dizziness, nausea,
and blurred vision.

258
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,840
To put it simply,

259
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,440
it means you can't

260
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
exert your peerless martial skills.

261
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,480
We have checked all these dishes.

262
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,159
How could we be poisoned?

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,519
A competent constable.

264
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,799
An imperial detective.

265
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,519
And a sect leader
skilled in poison making.

266
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,200
To poison the three of you

267
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
was indeed not an easy task.

268
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,200
Come on out.

269
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,279
Dai Si?

270
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,919
Mr. Zhuo.

271
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,799
Try this.

272
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,960
Jialuo.

273
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,080
Thanks.

274
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,919
The Prajna inheritor
didn't show up anyway.

275
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,600
The treasure can't be opened.

276
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,720
Your seals

277
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,039
are meaningless now.

278
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,279
Leave the seals to us.

279
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm afraid if we hand them over,

280
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,200
you won't let us leave alive.

281
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,759
You are smart.

282
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,200
Then let's not waste our time.

283
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,159
Just kill them all.

284
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,279
Yes.

285
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,559
Go through the back door.

286
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,320
There's a car to pick you up.

287
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,799
Mr. Lin?

288
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,639
He's using Prajna Hall's kung fu.

289
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,399
You?

290
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,960
Can you stop us all by yourself?

291
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Take this as the line.

292
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,679
If you cross it,

293
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,080
I'll kill you.

294
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,440
Leave!

295
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,320
He is...

296
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,279
He is the Prajna inheritor.

297
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,080
Go.

298
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,039
Let's go!

299
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,104
Go.

300
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,440
Kill him.

301
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,200
Don't let them go.

302
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,712
Go.

303
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,279
If you cross the line,

304
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll kill you.

305
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,200
Move.

306
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,112
Come on.

307
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,119
Get in the car first.

308
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,808
Quickly.

309
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:04,960
Move.

310
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,400
Isn't she a rebel from Tongmenghui?

311
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,960
She made the right choice

312
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,920
and works for me now.

313
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,799
Then why is she
in Beiyang Army's uniform?

314
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,039
Because the Beiyang Army
also wants to take us out.

315
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,359
Only by wearing their uniform

316
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,319
and driving their vehicle can we escape.

317
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,240
Did you know all along

318
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,359
that Mr. Lin is the Prajna inheritor?

319
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,519
I knew earlier than you.

320
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,680
But not that much.

321
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,319
So you've been acting all day today.

322
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,160
I've played along with you the whole day

323
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,119
and still been drugged.

324
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,440
If we hadn't put on an act,

325
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm afraid we would have been dead.

326
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,079
How did you know
about Mr. Lin's identity?

327
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,799
I had a guess.

328
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,200
I just guessed it right.

329
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,000
Lin Haohan.

330
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,039
You have helped me
quite a bit these days.

331
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,440
I don't want to see you die
in Ze Ze Inn.

332
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,079
Just go.

333
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,000
If I can gather all the seals
and find the treasure,

334
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,400
I won't skimp on your share.

335
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,039
Muqing.

336
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,279
Don't say something so serious.

337
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,240
It is that serious.

338
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,279
Muqing.

339
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,359
Then you must not die.

340
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,359
I found out that over 40 years ago,

341
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,920
the Prajna inheritor
was named Wu Shuangbao.

342
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,200
After he escaped the pursuit
of the Department,

343
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
he just vanished.

344
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,759
I guess he went East.

345
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,839
The last wish of Bodhi chief

346
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,680
was to hand over the treasure
to the Reformists.

347
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,559
I think the Prajna inheritor
wants the same.

348
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,839
After more than 40 years abroad,

349
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,200
he and his inheritors

350
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,200
may have long joined Tongmenghui.

351
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,759
I am the Bodhi inheritor.

352
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,000
I inherited the Bodhi legacy
at Futu Temple.

353
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,160
I have resolved
to follow my master's command.

354
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,839
As long as I obtain the treasure,

355
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,559
I will hand it over to Tongmenghui.

356
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,720
To the reformists
who can change the world.

357
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,680
That is to say,

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,640
if the Prajna inheritor is here,

359
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:20,440
he will be the comrade who can fight
side by side with me.

360
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,160
For the 30-year pact,

361
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,000
he will join me in doing our utmost

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
and take all the seals.

363
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,559
Lin Haohan.

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,839
I've told you such a big secret.

365
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,359
You understand, right?

366
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,160
I understand.

367
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,039
If you are the Prajna inheritor,

368
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,720
you will live.

369
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,960
If you're not,

370
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,240
I will have to kill you.

371
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,079
If you say so,

372
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,960
I have to be no matter what.

373
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,160
That's right.

374
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,519
I am the Prajna inheritor.

375
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,759
Then show me.

376
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,279
That's right.

377
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,720
I have fought with someone
with Prajna legacy.

378
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,200
Dragon-Subduing Skill.

379
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,680
Want to learn it?

380
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,839
I'll teach you.

381
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Are you going to Futu Temple?

382
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,799
Yes.

383
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,240
Muqing.

384
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,240
Stop the car.

385
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,039
I must go back to find Ms. Huo.

386
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,119
Bufan.

387
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,200
Listen to me.

388
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
Dai Si has now sided with the Japanese.

389
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,519
My disciples may be in danger.

390
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,519
As the sect leader, I must go back.

391
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,079
I will meet with you at Futu Temple
tomorrow night.

392
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Take this.

393
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,680
If I don't make it tomorrow night,

394
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,240
the Discipline Seal is yours.

395
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,880
Aren't you afraid
I'll take the seal and run away?

396
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,559
No need to go deep into the mountain.

397
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,119
A gentleman can rest in the pavilion.

398
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,680
Muqing.

399
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,960
You are a gentleman.

400
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,359
We have already agreed to collaborate.

401
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,839
You wouldn't go back on your word.

So, I entrust it to you.

Things of the sect might be minor
compared with the Altar Treasure.

410
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,839
But for me, they are significant.

411
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,319
So, I will handle it myself.

also didn't know where the seal was.

455

Then why did you come to Fujian?

456
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,640
What are you here for
if you don't have the seal?

457
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,559
Great.

458
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,359
It's meaningless

there's still no hope.

You started with faint hope

without any clues.

462
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,160
Yet now you already
hold two seals in your hand.

00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,759
And the Prajna inheritor
has already appeared.

464

There's only one seal unfound.

Mr. Muqing, I believe in you.

466
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,200
You'll surely find the treasure.

467
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,319
What's the point?

468
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,640
You are the Dharma inheritor.

469
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm the least useful one!

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,759

What is the legacy?

472
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,559
I know nothing about it.

473
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,359
Mr. Muqing.

474
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,039
I am incompetent.

475
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,880
You can only pursue the seals

476
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
all by yourself now.

477
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,720

478
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,960
I will still go to Futu Temple
tomorrow night.

479
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,480
Zhuo Bufan's seal
is already in your hands.

480
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,440
So it will mean something to the court.

481
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,400
I still have to
arrest the Dagu case murderers.

482
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,799
Wang Jialuo.

483
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,400
When we were in the capital,

484
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,440
you should have told me.

485
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
We could find it together.

486
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,599
But now there's no time left.

487
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,799
Please forgive me.

488
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
I did lie to you
when we were in the capital.

489
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,079
I...

490
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,200
Had no choice.

491
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,519
Now.

492
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,599
What is done is done.

493
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,559
Please forgive me.

494
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,839
Perhaps when you meet Mr. Lin,

495
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,079
there will be some new clues.

496
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,240
Mr. Muqing.

497
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,119
Take care.

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,640

499
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,319
Didn't you

500
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,160
tell them the reason?

501
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,319
I told you to leave.

502
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,480
I didn't know you would come back.

503
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,440
We never abandon our own comrades.

504
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,599
If I hadn't come,

505
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,279
you might have been killed
by the Japanese.

Sei I Shinpu and those rabbles

509
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,839
are no match for him.

510
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,519
You two fooled me down and out.

511
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,960
I didn't fool you.

00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Not a single person was there.

556
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,039
Just dead bodies left.

557
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,240
But I checked.

558
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,119
They are all Japanese.

559
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,519
Right.

560
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,519
What about their leader?

561
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,359
Not here.

562
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:12,880
Mr. Zhuo.

563
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,279
What's going on?

564
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
All the dead are Japanese.

565
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,759
I will check on Ms. Huo.

566
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,119
Are you alright?

567
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,839
I'm fine.

568
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,599
Is it done?

569
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,799
It will be done after tonight.

570
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,160
That's good.

571
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,400
That evil witch.

572
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,359
I didn't know she was a spy.

573
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,359
She caught me off guard.

574
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,359
She was bribed by the Japanese.

575
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,160
She betrayed the sect.

576
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,640
I'm fine.

577
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:08,680
Bufan.

578
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,519
Are you sure we can make it?

579
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,160
We will find out tomorrow night.

580
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,440
The disciples have already returned.

581
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,279
Wait for me here.

582
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,920
Where are you going?

583
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,759
- Bufan.
- I...

584
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,839
Bufan.

585
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,279
General Zhong wants to see you.

586
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,000
General Zhong?

587
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,920
The prince's son-in-law.

588
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,000
The general of the Beiyang Army.

589
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,319
She might

590
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,000
have gone outside.

591
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,200
The room is tidy.

592
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,759
The doors and windows are also intact.

593
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,240
There is no sign of a break-in.

594
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,000
Jialuo.

595
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,480
She's definitely not in danger.

596
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,240
She is probably just hungry

597
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,319
and has gone out for food.

598
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,039
Jialuo.

599
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,000
Don't worry.

600
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,720
When cleaning up the bodies,

601
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,000
I checked carefully.

602
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,279
She wasn't there.

603
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,000
What about Sei I Shinpu and Yeshang Han?

604
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,000
The two Japanese leaders.

605
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,400
There are no women there.

606
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,160
All are men.

607
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:25,920
Jialuo.

608
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,160
Go back.

609
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,799
I'm fine.

610
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,039
They're just minor injuries.

611
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,519
It's nothing.

612
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,279
You drove them all away?

613
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,079
I thought

614
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,960
you should be safe.

615
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,799
Then I ran.

616
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,640
There were many of them.

617
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
I was not capable
of driving them all away.

618
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,920
Didn't I tell you

619
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,680
to wait for me at Futu Temple?

620
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,920
Luckily we didn't listen to you.

621
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,160
Wait for what?

622
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,000
To collect your corpses?

623
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,320
Wulan Shan heard the conversation

624
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,880
between Zhong Haichao and Sei I Shinpu.

625
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,760
They said they would kill all of you.

626
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,159
That's why we went to save you.

627
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,159
It was she who planned it.

628
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,000
She also prepared
the Beiyang Army uniform and the car.

629
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,119
Don't look at me like that.

630
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,599
I am not your suspect.

631
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,480
I have already revealed my identity.

632
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,159
If we really fight,
you might not defeat me.

633
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,679
Now you know

634
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,519
I am no longer the ordinary Hound.

635
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,039
That's right.

636
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,400
Since I am on board with you now,

637
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,280
shouldn't you tell me more?

638
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,519
Sure.

639
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,960
If there's anything you want to know,
just ask.

640
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:47,559
Also,

641
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,559
don't say you are on board.

642
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,679
We should call each other comrades now.

643
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Is Wu Shuangbao
your master or your senior master?

644
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,239
Master.

645
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,000
That old man is now in Southeast Asia

646
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,239
living a leisure life.

647
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,159
He's in good health.

648
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,480
Since that's the case,

649
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,679
then you should know better than us
about the Altar Treasure.

650
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,000
You know about the four seals

651
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,320
and know about the thirty-year pact.

652
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,519
Of course.

653
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,159
You can't see the whole picture,

654
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,159
so you've been making useless efforts.

655
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,760
Fine.

656
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,159
Why were you the second contact?

657
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,519
You are good.

658
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,280
That's a good question.

659
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,719
About this,

660
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,559
I have so much to say

661
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,880
before I can make myself clear.

662
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,320
Let me think where to start.

663
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,559
If I'm not mistaken,

664
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:38,000
(1 AM, in the lobby phone booth)
(Tan Xian got a note at the hotel,)

665
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,159
(and the phone call
came at one o'clock.)

666
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,280
Who are you?

667
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,079
(The person on the other end
of the phone was you.)

668
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,039
(Afterward, for the safety
of the seals,)

669
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,800
(you began to
stage numerous coincidences.)

670
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,440
(You traveled with us all along)

671
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,960
(and offered clues at critical moments
again and again.)

672
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,119
(On the train to Fujian,)

673
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,039
(you were the one who eavesdropped
on top of the train, right?)

674
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,800
(But there's one thing
I can't figure out.)

675
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,159
You were overseas.

676
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,719
Wu Shuangbao was overseas.

677
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,280
Tan Xian and his father
were also overseas.

678
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,679
I am sure you know each other
during those 30 years.

679
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,880
If Tan Xian wanted to
entrust the secret to Tongmenghui,

680
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,480
he could have just
given it to you overseas.

681
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,519
Even if the secret treasure
is hidden in Fujian,

682
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,159
you could also gather the items first,

683
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,480
and then go to Fujian to look for it.

684
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,920
Why did you go all the way to Shanghai
to meet each other?

685
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:27,679
And.

686
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,880
Even if you had to meet in Shanghai,

687
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,199
it was reasonable for you to go
as the Prajna inheritor.

688
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,239
Why did you have
nine Tongmenghui members

689
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,880
who are not very skilled in kung fu
from Japan

690
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,519
go to Dagu?

691
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,719
That didn't make sense.

692
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,159
Isn't it better to go to Shanghai
directly by boat?

693
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,679
You should know, if you make it simpler,

694
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,760
it will be safer.

695
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,639
And then there's her.

696
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,199
Tan Xian needed someone to protect him.

697
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,400
Why did you arrange such a person

698
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
who knew nothing
about the Altar Treasure?

699
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,559
Was she that good?

700
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,840
Can she defeat you?

701
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,920
Or me?

702
00:36:59,199 --> 00:36:59,840
Isn't she good?

703
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,199
Yes.

704
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,440
She is good.

705
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,519
What's good about her is that

706
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,639
she knows nothing at all

707
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,599
and she has no fear.

708
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,320
Even if that will cost her her life.

709
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:20,800
Lin Haohan.

710
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,559
Your whole plan is a setup, right?

711
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,760
You are the most suitable choice.

712
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,599
You are smart.

713
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,519
The plan was proposed
by your master Cheng Yu.

714
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,719
Many people are involved in this plan.

715
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,079
Your master.

716
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:38,800
My master.

717
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,000
Master Du E.

718
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That is, Luan Yi.

719
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,239
Also Tan Xian and his father.

720
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,679
Jiang Hen and me.

721
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,400
But the most important person
in the whole plan

722
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:48,199
is you.

723
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,760
Men Sandao.

724
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,760
Because I am a Bodhi inheritor?

725
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,119
Because you are not
a normal Bodhi inheritor.

726
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,400
You're also the top imperial detective.

727
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,440
Both of our masters have said

728
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:05,239
the thirty-year pact of the year Xinhai
must be fulfilled.

729
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,719
If not,

730
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,159
the Altar Treasure
will never see the light of day.

731
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,679
To speed this up,

732
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,360
first was to gather all the inheritors.

733
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,679
You were in prison.

734
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,719
We had to get you out.

735
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,360
The theft of Wenyuan Pavilion
was the first step.

736
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,400
It was to force the Department

737
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,960
to release you to help.

738
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,880
Zhuo Bufan was chosen by Master Du E,

739
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,119
that is, Luan Yi.

740
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,280
He was chosen
because of his martial uncle, Mo Kun.

741
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,119
Master Du E said

742
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,960
if Zhuo Bufan can be of use to us,
that would be best.

743
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,760
If not,

744
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,519
then he would silence Zhuo Bufan.

745
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,480
After he picked Zhuo Bufan,

746
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Jiang Hen managed

747
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,440
to introduce him to Prince Qi

748
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,320
and make him a mercenary for Prince Qi.

749
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,239
His first stop

750
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,639
was Dagu.

751
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,920
So the identities of those contacts

752
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,800
were leaked by you to Prince Qi.

753
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
The role of those nine people

754
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,079
was to draw out the Dharma inheritor.

755
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,000
No one knew

756
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,920
that Rongtian Ridge
would kill them all at once.

757
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,440
But it was also because of the murder,

758
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,920
you've targeted Zhuo Bufan.

759
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,000
The Dharma inheritor
has also been involved.

760
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,960
Zhuo Bufan is right.

761
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,039
Everyone is involved.

762
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,639
When you saw me in Shanghai,

763
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,239
why didn't you tell me who you are?

764
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,800
Why should I tell you?

765
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,920
We still didn't get the Bodhi Seal then.

766
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,440
Nice act.

767
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,280
If not,

768
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,480
you would have been exposed.

769
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,119
So all these years you've been trading.

770
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,760
It's all a cover
for your identity, right?

771
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:34,760
Yes.

772
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,880
But this cover
has been quite profitable.

773
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,519
Of course.

774
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,639
It is mostly
because of the support of you,

775
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,599
Princess.

776
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,519
In the past,
I didn't know we were comrades.

777
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,159
If you buy things in the future,

778
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,400
I will give you a discount.

779
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,519
Don't laugh.

780
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,800
I'm serious.

781
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,760
Forget it.

782
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,800
I'm quite willing to
let you make more money.

783
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,000
It's not just me.

784
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,039
Most of the goods sourcing
in the Southeast Asia

785
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,559
are handled by my master.

786
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,039
He is the real boss.

787
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,679
I'm just the errand runner.

788
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,519
It's more than that.

789
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,199
You also have to pry for information.

790
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,480
That's true.

791
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,519
I do both things well.

792
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,599
Genius.

793
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,039
Since the Bodhi Seal
is in the Futu Temple.

794
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,519
Du E is also involved.

795
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,119
Why did you put on such a show?

796
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,679
The Bodhi Seal
is not in the Futu Temple?

797
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,039
It isn't right.

798
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,559
Wherever the seal is,
you could have obtained it.

799
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,119
Your making so many efforts

800
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,079
only means that the seal

801
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,639
was in a place you cannot reach.

802
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,960
I have the seal.

803
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,039
The seal of the Altar Treasure

804
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,239
is my tattoo.

805
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,079
The secret you got at Futu Temple

806
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:50,920
is this one, right?

807
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,800
(The seal of the Altar Treasure)

808
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,800
(are the tattoos on the chief inheritors
of Southern Shaolin.)

809
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,719
So, even when
we were in the Futu Temple,

810
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:04,119
you did not show up
even after Liu Lin obtained the secret.

811
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,400
You were waiting for the four seals
showing up together.

812
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:07,840
Sure.

813
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,239
I couldn't count on you

814
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,440
to take the seal from Zhuo Bufan.

815
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,280
But Wang Jialuo doesn't have the seal.

816
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,800
The Prajna seal is also a tattoo.

817
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,760
So Wang Jialuo...

818
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,000
This is the most uncertain thing

819
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,239
in the whole plan.

820
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,880
Because his master
has been insane for many years.

821
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,239
No one is sure

822
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,239
whether he has had the legacy or not.

823
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,800
Is Lin Anjing one of yours?

824
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,880
No.

825
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,039
She should be with the Japanese.

826
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,280
It doesn't matter.

827
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,599
Wang Jialuo himself
doesn't know anything.

828
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,199
That woman won't get anything useful

829
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,880
by following him.

830
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh no.

831
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,960
He has returned to Ze Ze Inn
to confront her.

832
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,119
As you said,

833
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,360
Lin Anjing is not one of you,

834
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,599
but from the Japanese side.

835
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,800
Sei I Shinpu and Yeshang Han

836
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,760
are still there.

837
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,440
If Wang Jialuo finds out something,

838
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,519
it may put him in danger.

839
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,320
Why would he confront Lin Anjing?

840
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,280
Because I told him

841
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,519
I suspect that woman.

842
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,159
Let's go.

843
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,599
Go back to Ze Ze Inn for him.

844
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Don't stay here.

845
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,199
Leave.

846
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,719
Why should I listen to you?

847
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,559
You informed them

848
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:15,599
about the secret conversation.

849
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,679
Otherwise, we would've been dead
in Ze Ze Inn.

850
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,960
Intelligence is the most important.

851
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,639
You being safe
could actually help us more.

852
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,039
You can't help much here.

853
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,920
I'll go with you.

854
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,440
Drive Wulan Shan back home first.

855
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,760
Then come back here and wait for us.

856
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,039
We will bring Wang Jialuo back.
