1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,160
(The imperial guards of the Department)

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,960
(did find something in Fenzhou.)

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,800
(After searching for nearly two months,)

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,679
(they finally found Shovel.)

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,519
(They secretly took him to the suburbs)

6
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,000
(and severely tortured him
for confession.)

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,920
(Shovel was truly tough.)

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,000
(No matter how he was tortured,
he did not spill it.)

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,119
(Later on, the guards)

10
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,399
(captured Shovel's wife and child)

11
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,799
(and wanted to kill
them in front of him.)

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,399
Among the three constables dispatched
by the yamen,

13
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,280
only I was there.

14
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,479
To tell the truth,

15
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,439
I disapproved

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,119
of their using his wife
and child as hostages.

17
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,840
But you imperial guards

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,760
are just heartless.

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,159
I disapproved,

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,760
(but I could only watch.)

21
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,799
(Just at that moment,)

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,519
(someone appeared suddenly.)

23
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,680
(That person moved like a ghost.)

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,040
(His sword strikes were lightning fast.)

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,560
(Later I found out)

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,959
(that he was the master
from beyond the Great Wall)

27
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,959
(the Department was pursuing.)

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,120
(Almost in an instant,)

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,239
(he struck down several guards.)

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,680
(I was terrified.)

31
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,200
(In a hurry,)

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,079
(I seized Shovel's child)

33
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,439
(and put him in front of me.)

34
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,719
Please spare me.

35
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,920
Listen to me.

36
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,079
Listen to me.

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm not from the Department.

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,319
I am just a constable from Fenzhou,

39
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,239
under the command

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,959
of the imperial guards.

41
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,120
I gotta take care of my parents...

42
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
You've suffered.

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
...who are over 80.

44
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,640
Please spare me.

45
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,000
Please spare me.

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,159
Please spare me.

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,000
Please spare me.

48
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Please.

49
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,439
Please spare me.

50
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,280
I can spare you.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,120
But who would spare him?

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,000
Please spare me.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
Please spare me.

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,919
I was really scared back then.

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,599
In front of the master,

56
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,400
it had me scared out of my wits

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,199
and kowtow more times

58
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,879
than ever in my life.

59
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,520
That man ultimately spared my life.

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
He told me

61
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,400
that if anything untoward happened
to Shovel and his family in the future,

62
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,400
I would not escape death.

63
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,879
And then?

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
In the over 40 years since then,

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,680
I have kept my mouth shut.

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,599
That's why in the official records,

67
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,400
there's never been a mention of that.

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,319
You've kept silent not out of fear.

69
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,159
I must

70
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,319
repay the man who did not kill me.

71
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,919
But you're telling me now.

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,080
It doesn't matter.

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,759
Because Shovel is long gone.

74
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,120
Shovel is dead?

75
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,840
Yes.

76
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,000
What about his descendants?

77
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,159
I don't know.

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
They've long since lost contact.

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,479
Do you know

80
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,080
where Shovel's hometown is?

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,719
Back then,

82
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,719
he lived in a village
in Jiexiu County, Fenzhou.

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,319
Feel free to investigate it.

84
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,280
You won't find the person.

85
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,000
Mr. Qin,

86
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,080
thank you.

87
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,080
I take my leave.

88
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,479
Sir,

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,520
you're not arresting me?

90
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
You're already 72.

91
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,560
Should I arrest you and take you back

92
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,319
to face a charge of deceiving the court?

93
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,400
You've lived in fear for over 40 years.

94
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,000
This scar and these matters

95
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,719
have already tormented you enough.

96
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,000
Take care.

97
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,800
Thank you.

=Episode 12=

100
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:39,020
(The 9th day of the fourth month,
3th year of Xuantong era)

101
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,082
(31 days before Mangzhong)

102
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,680
(Fenzhou, Shanxi)

103
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,079
Go away.

104
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,120
Beggar!

105
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,439
Go to somewhere else.

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,800
Sir,

107
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,399
I'm not a beggar.

108
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,240
I'd like a pancake.

109
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,000
Sir.

111
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,759
I am really sorry.

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,639
Sir.

113
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,199
Could you give me some water?

114
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,720
Move aside.

115
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,439
Move aside.

116
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,519
Who are those people?

117
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,759
They are from the Beiyang Army.

118
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,920
Beiyang?

119
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,920
You're not a local man, right?

120
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
You don't know the situation here.

121
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,480
Here in Shanxi, the Beiyang Army
is the most powerful force.

122
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,439
What about the yamen?

123
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,959
Yamen?

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,040
They're nothing.

125
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
Things that the yamen can't handle
are managed by the Beiyang Army.

126
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
They can't even manage
the things they're supposed to.

127
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,519
They rely on the Beiyang Army.

128
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,399
The Beiyang Army is the most powerful.

129
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,879
No one wants to mess with them.

130
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
I want to know

131
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,879
how I get to the 43rd Association.

132
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:44,064
(43rd Association, Shanxi Army)

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,120
What for?

134
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
Dude.

135
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,160
This beggar is calling me dude?

136
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,720
Is this a place you should visit?

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,360
Go away.

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,040
Dude.

139
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,839
Go away.

140
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,839
Go.

141
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:10,080
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

142
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,192
I am a constable from Dagu County Yamen,

143
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,560
passing by for a case.

144
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,199
A constable?

145
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,600
You're a constable from a county yamen.

146
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,879
What are you doing in Shanxi?

147
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,399
Dude,

148
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,759
I just want to ask...

149
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,199
You won't find out here.

150
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
Even if a constable from Fenzhou came,

151
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,800
I wouldn't bother with him.

152
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,519
But then again,

153
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,320
your uniform is pretty nice.

154
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,360
Just right.

155
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,000
Once you run out of money on a case,

156
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,919
you can beg on the streets with this.

157
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,799
Dude,

158
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,440
I just want to ask

159
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,919
if this is the 43rd Association.

160
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,080
The 43rd Association.

161
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,039
Do you know what it is?

162
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,519
Want to know where it is?

163
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,879
Look down at the ground.

164
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,919
Look up at the sky.

165
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,360
You are now right at it.

166
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,960
That's just right.

167
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,279
I am here for Long Chi.

168
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,120
For whom?

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,879
Long Chi.

170
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,279
Do you know him?

171
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,759
Of course, I do.

172
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,519
Do you know who Long Chi is?

173
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,399
I do not know him.

174
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,039
My friend asked me to come for him.

175
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,720
Go away.

176
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
What are you talking about?

177
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,440
Take a look at yourself.

178
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,480
Go away.

179
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,120
Please announce me.

180
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,200
Go away.

181
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,360
What's going on?

182
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,639
Back in line.

183
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,159
Sir,

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,559
I am Wang Jialuo,

185
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:36,120
a constable from Dagu County Yamen.

186
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:38,960
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)
I'm passing through Shanxi for a case.

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,799
My friend told me

188
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,039
to come here to visit someone.

189
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,559
But these people here

190
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,960
refused to announce me.

191
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,720
Could you please tell me
if you know Long Chi?

192
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,200
Long Chi?

193
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,080
Yes.

194
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,720
He is the commandant
of the 43rd Association.

195
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,960
How could he be friends

196
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,480
with a county constable like you?

197
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,559
You just mentioned
a friend referred you.

198
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,679
Who is he?

199
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,559
I don't really know him.

200
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,240
Dude,

201
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,039
I suppose you are
in some kind of trouble.

202
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,720
Tianjin is far from Shanxi.

203
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
Take this and go home.

204
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,600
Thank you.

205
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,080
Please wait a moment.

206
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480
Since I can't meet Mr. Long Chi,

207
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,000
(To Long Chi)
please hand over this letter to him.

208
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,440
Thank you.

209
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,000
You idiot!

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,919
Are you blind or stupid?

211
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,159
Someone claims to be my relative
and you believe it?

212
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,600
What makes you think that?

213
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,519
Try letting that kind
of person in again next time.

214
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Go away.

215
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,279
Foolish.

216
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,279
Ding Yu.

217
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,039
Where are you going?

218
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,360
General,

219
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,000
just now at the gate,

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,159
someone was stopped by the guards.

221
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,559
He is a constable
from Dagu County in Tianjin.

222
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,792
He said he had a friend's recommendation
and wanted to meet you.

223
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,120
Dagu in Tianjin?

224
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,879
Even people
from such a backwater come to me.

225
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I'm not going to see

226
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
any freeloaders looking for

227
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,159
a handout.

228
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,000
Chase them away.

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,919
He gave me a letter,

230
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,559
and said it was written to you

231
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,600
by his reference.

232
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,360
I saw the paper quality
of this letter is a bit unusual.

233
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,159
That's why I took it.

234
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,679
White Xuan paper.

235
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
And it's of high quality.

236
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,080
Where is he?

237
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,360
He was outside the camp entrance.

238
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,120
General.

239
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,480
Where did he go?

240
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
Where's that person?

241
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,039
That beggar seems to have already left.

242
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:11,879
Beggar?

243
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,600
He is my honored guest.

244
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,720
Hurry and bring him back.

245
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,279
Yes.

246
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,960
If you can't, I'll kill you.

247
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,679
Yes. Let's go.

248
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,559
General.

249
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,759
(Long Chi,)

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,639
(the person holding
this letter, Wang Jialuo,)

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,159
(is merely a constable
but has unique talents.)

252
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,559
(He's fit
for a second lieutenant position.)

253
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,120
(Let him lead troops
to handle a case in Shanxi.)

254
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,000
(The case he's working on
is of great importance.)

255
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,879
(Please give him your earnest help.)

256
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,799
Fine calligraphy.

257
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,919
Fine calligraphy.

258
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,200
Everyone, come and have a look.

259
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,840
(The doctrine of Confucius )
Look how good this calligraphy is.

260
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
It's just ten wen.

261
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,200
Why don't you get one?

262
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,120
No, thanks.

263
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,600
The doctrine of Confucius
and Mencius is sold so cheaply.

264
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,039
Did you find him?

265
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,840
No.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,679
Dude,

267
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,279
may I ask

268
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,519
if you've ever seen

269
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,600
anyone wearing Lingxi attire recently?

270
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,679
Approximately 20 or so people.

271
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,496
Right.

272
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
No.

273
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,080
I haven't.

274
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,360
Thank you.

275
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,679
Dude.

276
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,279
Dude.

277
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,080
Dude.

278
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,480
We came specifically to find you.

279
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,360
Please return to the camp.

280
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,320
Our general is waiting for you.

281
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:47,744
(43rd Association, Shanxi Army)

282
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,159
General.

283
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
Jialuo,

284
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,360
I am Long Chi.

285
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,399
Sorry for any neglect just now.

286
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,840
Please forgive me.

287
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,919
Nice to meet you.

288
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,519
You don't have to.

289
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,600
Dude,

290
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,879
it seems like you've had
a tough journey.

291
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,000
Ding Yu.

292
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,600
Yes.

293
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,799
Take Jialuo

294
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,840
to take a bath and get changed.

295
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,039
Ask the cooks to prepare

296
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,679
a welcoming feast.

297
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,679
Dude,

298
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,720
these are all specialties from Shanxi.

299
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,679
Try it.

300
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,720
Thank you for your treat.

301
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,080
This is for honored guests.

302
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,799
You first.

303
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,039
My brother told me about you

304
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,120
in his letter.

305
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,559
Let's do as he said.

306
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:45,840
Starting from today,

307
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,519
Jialuo is now one of us.

308
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,759
Keep eating. Don't stop.

309
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,279
You'll be

310
00:14:59,039 --> 00:14:59,919
a second lieutenant.

311
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,679
First, I'll assign 30 soldiers to you.

312
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,000
You will have full command over them

313
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,000
to facilitate your pursuit of criminals.

314
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,320
Really?

315
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm truly grateful to you.

316
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,519
A toast to you.

317
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,960
Keep eating.

318
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,639
Those 30 people

319
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,519
are for your personal use.

320
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,360
If needed,

321
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,840
they'll be added to 300 people
at any time.

322
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,279
Jialuo,

323
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,960
you are not familiar with Shanxi.

324
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,488
And you haven't really
led troops before.

325
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:32,000
Right.

326
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,679
I plan to assign you an aide

327
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,039
to make things easier for you in Shanxi.

328
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,519
Ding Yu,

329
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,440
you will assist Jialuo

330
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,440
with the investigation
and pursuit of criminals.

331
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,759
I'll be at your disposal.

332
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,879
Thank you.

333
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,840
Father, you've had a tiresome journey.

334
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,159
Would you like to rest?

335
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:01,639
It was just a ride after all.

336
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,480
Nothing too tiring about that.

337
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,200
Your Highness.

338
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,519
I've just been informed by a servant

339
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,360
that Chief Cunqing
of the Imperial Household Department

340
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,200
sent over a gift.

341
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,600
Cunqing?

342
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,879
What is this?

343
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,759
Mr. Cunqing said

344
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,040
he happened to get

345
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,960
(Liezi, Lie Yukou)
an early manuscript by Ouyang Xun.

346
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,840
He knows you enjoy calligraphy,

347
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,879
so he specifically presented it.

348
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:34,519
They all say Chief Cunqing
is both literary and martial.

349
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,320
It's true.

350
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,320
Father,

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,480
what does he mean?

352
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,559
Zhuangzi once said in Chapter Lieyukou,

353
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,879
Zhu Pingman spent three years
and all his family fortune

354
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,200
learning dragon-slaying from Zhi Liyi,

355
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,480
only to find out
there are no dragons to slay.

356
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,039
Cunqing is telling me
through Zhuangzi's words

357
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,159
that we have put in

358
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,920
so much effort,

359
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,000
wanting to slay the dragon,

360
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,039
but we can't even put it

361
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,359
into practice.

362
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,920
He couldn't possibly leave us
an opportunity to do it.

363
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,000
Among the servants
of the Imperial Household Department,

364
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,079
only Cunqing is capable.

365
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,839
It's just that he fails
to see the situation clearly.

366
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,759
If he's willing to follow me,

367
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,119
it would be a good thing.

368
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,319
Zhao Fu.

369
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,720
On the bookcase in the study,

370
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,880
there must be a fan made
of Chinese rosewood and feathers.

371
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,519
Yes.

372
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,319
Your Highness.

373
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,279
This was presented to you
by the Governor of Huguang

374
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,640
the year before last.

375
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,640
Have someone send it to Cunqing.

376
00:17:59,319 --> 00:17:59,880
Yes.

377
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,319
Sit.

378
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
You don't get it?

379
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,279
Do you know the saying,

380
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,640
"Smart folks are those
who can see the situation"?

381
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:20,759
Yes.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,799
Be it a scholar or a commoner,

383
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,559
smart folks are those
who can see the situation.

384
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,039
Like Zhuge Liang and Pang Tong.

385
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,880
That saying comes from The Book of Shu,
The Records of the Three Kingdoms.

386
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,880
Zhuge Liang held a feather fan.

387
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,519
Cunqing likes reading
about The Three Kingdoms.

388
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,759
He will immediately understand me.

389
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,279
Father, do you mean

390
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,640
to let Cunqing
know the situation better?

391
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,960
I respond with a tough stance

392
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,960
while also expressing
a willingness to recruit talents.

393
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,039
It all depends on whether Cunqing

394
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,000
can understand this or not.

395
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,920
Father, you are brilliant.

396
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,319
This time when I went to Shanghai,

397
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,400
I met with the consuls
of France and Britain.

398
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,160
They expressed
their full support for us.

399
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,319
Once the coup is successful

400
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,279
and I reorganize the Qing cabinet,

401
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,480
other countries
will swiftly grant recognition.

402
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,839
That would be great.

403
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,400
As long as they recognize us,

404
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,799
we will make it at least legitimate

405
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,279
internationally.

406
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,920
Of course, it'll be legitimate.

407
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:39,079
Everything has been thoroughly prepared.

408
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,839
Just waiting for action.

409
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,319
Haichao,

410
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,799
we two shall change our fortunes.

411
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:58,874
(Constable of Dagu County Yamen)

412
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,039
Are you satisfied with the residence

413
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,408
General Long has offered you?

414
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,240
This room is really too big.

415
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
General Long is really quite courteous.

416
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,519
Wouldn't it be too wasteful for me

417
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,640
to live in such a large place?

418
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,799
I really can't accept it.

419
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,160
Jialuo,

420
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,519
you are now a second lieutenant,

421
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,400
a leader of troops.

422
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,759
Why can't you accept it?

423
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:42,560
Sit.

424
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,480
Jialuo,

425
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,440
how should we handle
the case you're working on?

426
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,640
I'll follow your lead.

427
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,279
I don't have any leads on the case yet.

428
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,640
I'm just thinking

429
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,759
we need to find Zhuo Bufan
and the men from Rongtian Ridge first.

430
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,720
They are all in Shanxi?

431
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,160
Right, in Shanxi.

432
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,000
It'll be easy.

433
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,519
Jialuo,

434
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,279
tell me what characteristics
that group of people has.

435
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,079
They came from Lingxi.

436
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,480
Their clothing is different
from what us Han

437
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,240
and Manchu wear.

438
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,079
Quite noticeable.

439
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,160
And they speak with a strange accent.

440
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
The Sect Leader is Zhuo Bufan.

441
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,359
He had more than 20 people under him,
including Yu Huanjie and Qin Tuo,

442
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,720
and two female disciples.

443
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,279
Be extremely careful.

444
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,039
Each of them has high martial skills.

445
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,720
Jialuo, don't worry.

446
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
They've learned martial arts.

447
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,680
But we have guns.

448
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
In Shanxi,

449
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,359
it's not difficult for us

450
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,480
to find a few people.

451
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,480
You rest.

452
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,160
I'll have someone investigate it now.

453
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,720
Thanks.

454
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,359
This is

455
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
the household registration book
for the villages of Jiexiu County.

456
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,400
Over 400 households for three villages.

457
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,839
We do not know the real name of Shovel.

458
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,200
Continuing this way,
I'm afraid it will be of no use.

459
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,640
Getai,

460
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,359
we should make
a trip to Jiexiu tomorrow.

461
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,680
Muqing,

462
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,000
who is the master
from beyond the Great Wall

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,920
Mr. Qin mentioned today?

464
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,359
I have been thinking for a long time.

465
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,319
That person

466
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,480
must be the inheritor of Bodhi
Tan Xian mentioned on the wall

467
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,000
of that restaurant in Shanghai.

468
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,200
It makes sense for him to be so skilled
in martial arts if he's the chief

469
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,839
of the Bodhi Department

470
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,240
of the Southern Shaolin.

471
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,759
There's definitely a unique bond
between the two.

472
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Shovel is right here.

473
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,839
And the clues to the Bodhi tomb
also point here.

474
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,400
So there must be
a connection between them.

475
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,720
You're back.

476
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,400
I've been talking business
with your dad.

477
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,480
How was it?

478
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Did you have fun in Shanghai?

479
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,359
I intended to buy
some Western clothes in the Concession.

480
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,400
I went to take a look

481
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,799
and didn't find anything I liked.

482
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,720
Was the wedding lively?

483
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,640
It was not just lively,

484
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,200
but completely noisy.

485
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,720
That must have been quite interesting.

486
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,400
Interesting?

487
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,759
Just a mess.

488
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,680
During your days in Shanghai,

489
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,400
didn't anything interesting happen?

490
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,000
Come on.

491
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,240
It's all the same.

492
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,400
Is that so?

493
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:56,119
I heard Men Sandao

494
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,039
was in Shanghai a few days ago.

495
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,240
What do I have to do with it?

496
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,839
I was just asking.

497
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,119
What's wrong?

498
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,200
I can't even talk about it?

499
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,519
It was from over a decade ago.

500
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,200
We've long become estranged.

501
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,359
Why bring him up?

502
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,759
If you knew he was still in Shanghai,

503
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,799
wouldn't you want to find
a way to see him again?

504
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm a bit tired.

505
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,720
I'll go to bed.

506
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,279
You're already tired?

507
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,160
I've been sitting in a car all day.

508
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,839
They say absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

509
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,160
You didn't miss me at all?

510
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,920
I am really tired.

511
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,759
I need to rest.

512
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,480
What if I didn't mention Men Sandao,

513
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,519
would you still need to rest?

514
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,599
Would you still be tired?

515
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,480
Why do you change the subject
as soon as I mention Men Sandao?

516
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,519
Tell me

517
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,319
why I can't mention him.

518
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,480
Or does it hurt you
whenever I mention him?

519
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:25,880
Say something.

520
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,440
Tell me!

521
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,200
(It doesn't bloom in early spring.)

522
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,240
(It blooms at the end of spring.)

523
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,599
This was what you told me back then.

524
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,079
I'm glad you remembered it.

525
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,759
These are the seeds of rosa rubus.

526
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,480
Sow them into the soil.

527
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,960
Soon, you'll see tiny white flowers.

528
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,880
They are quite beautiful.

529
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,930
(12 years ago)

530
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,319
The Emperor agreed.

531
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,359
But he told me

532
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,480
that the most important thing now
is the reform.

533
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,880
Once the reform succeeds,

534
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,480
he will propose the marriage

535
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,640
on my behalf.

536
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,920
The Emperor really agreed?

537
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,079
That's great!

538
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,559
It looks like it's going to rain soon.

539
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,599
Shall I take you home?

540
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,279
I don't want to leave.

541
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,039
I want to stay with you a little longer.

542
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,559
Okay.

543
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,599
(The rosa rubus has blossomed
in the late spring.)

544
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,079
(The end is near.)

545
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,480
(The glorious and unforgettable moments
will fade away.)

546
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,480
Muqing,

547
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,279
take care.

548
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,119
You were just reading a book?

549
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,960
I found a book in your drawer

550
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,680
and wanted to take a look.

551
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,799
(Revolutionary Army)
Is this the book you usually read?

552
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,039
This is a confiscated book. It's banned.

553
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,680
A banned book?

554
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,319
The author of this book is Zou Rong,

555
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,480
who has already been punished
by the court.

556
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,680
This book must not be read.

557
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,279
Reading it is considered
as a rebellion, a crime.

558
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,799
But I...

559
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,160
Fortunately, you read it here.

560
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,319
So it's okay.

561
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,880
That cabinet
is filled with banned books.

562
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,200
Feel free to read them.

563
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:15,759
Report.

564
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,119
Come in.

565
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:22,839
General Long.

566
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,160
Do you know

567
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,079
why you were assigned as the deputy
to that constable?

568
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,880
I'm all ears.

569
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,519
Sit.

570
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,240
Wang Jialuo's investigation
into that murder case

571
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,240
is not the key.

572
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,880
The key is the Altar Treasure

573
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,680
the Rongtian Ridge is looking for.

574
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
The Altar Treasure?

575
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,720
What is that?

576
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,039
Money!

577
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,000
It's a huge sum.

578
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,599
You mean...

579
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,319
It's not what I intended.

580
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,279
That's...

581
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,839
Let me tell you.

582
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,319
The letter Wang Jialuo gave me

583
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,279
was written by an important figure.

584
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,200
The most powerful in Beiyang Army.

585
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,240
The fat man mentioned by Wang Jialuo

586
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,920
is...?

587
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,279
Stop. Don't say it out loud.

588
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,160
Enough.

589
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,319
Understood.

590
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,559
I get it.

591
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,960
The reason I'm having our guys

592
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,559
help Wang Jialuo

593
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,960
is to keep an eye

594
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,079
on all the treasure hunters.

595
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,359
Since anyone getting that sum of money

596
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,519
won't be a good thing,

597
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,160
why don't we take it?

598
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,799
If we can't get it,

599
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:50,839
no one else should get it.

600
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,519
He's chasing the killers.

601
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,640
You follow him in the pursuit.

602
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,680
The Rongtian Ridge
will lead you to the treasure.

603
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,559
Whether Mr. Wang is gonna
capture someone or show loyalty,

604
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,640
you just keep an eye on the traces
of the secret treasure.

605
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,240
Do not fail.

606
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,799
I understand.

607
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,778
(Baoyu Inn)

608
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,759
Mr. Zhuo.

609
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,480
Are the horses ready?

610
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,480
Yes.

611
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,079
Where are we going?

612
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,200
Zezhou.

613
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,120
(The 8th day of the fourth month,
3th year of Xuantong era)

614
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,680
(32 days before Mangzhong)
On this trip to Shanxi,

615
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,279
besides seeking the Bodhi tomb,

616
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
there's another thing we must do.

617
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,759
Saving a person.

618
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,720
We must get to Zezhou before dawn.

619
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,960
Wait for us here.

620
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,319
Let's go.

621
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:50,426
(Zezhou Prison)

622
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,960
It's right inside.

623
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,759
Right here?

624
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:56,720
Let's go in.

625
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,720
We don't know the situation inside yet.

626
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,416
You wait here for me. I'll go in alone.

627
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:00,960
But...

628
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,799
You wait here for me.

629
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,640
Don't worry.

630
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:04,920
You must be careful.

631
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,559
Okay.

632
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,159
Who's there?

633
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,760
How dare you break in?

634
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,440
Go!

635
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,119
Come on.

636
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,320
Qin Tuo.

637
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,000
Mr. Zhuo.

638
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,159
Greetings, Martial Uncle.

639
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,119
Greetings, Martial Uncle.

640
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,119
Mr. Mo Kun?

641
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,079
Greetings, Martial Uncle.

642
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,000
All rise.

643
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,519
I didn't expect you
to become the Sect Leader.

644
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:44,760
Oh, right.

645
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,079
I forgot to introduce her.

646
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,400
This is the youngest female disciple
of our sect.

647
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,000
When you left,

648
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,079
she hadn't joined the sect yet.

649
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,519
Are you Qin Tuo or Tang Yu?

650
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,239
Martial Uncle, I am Qin Tuo.

651
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,639
You were a child when I left.

652
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,119
Yes.

653
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,840
I was young.

654
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,199
Tang Yu only aged three
back then, right?

655
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Martial Uncle.

656
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,039
Tang Yu is no longer with us.

657
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,599
How the world turns.

658
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,920
Martial Uncle,

659
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,840
back then, to make

660
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,000
our sect world-famous,

661
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,039
you resolutely went
to the Central Plains.

662
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,079
But after a few years,

663
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,320
you vanished without a word.

664
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,760
Our master was very concerned.

665
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,119
Despite asking around,
there was still no news of you.

666
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,000
I didn't find out until recently
I knew you'd been in Shanxi all along.

667
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,880
So we came to rescue you.

668
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,880
I am already in my twilight years.

669
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,280
What difference does it make
whether I get out or not?

670
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,320
Please don't say that.

671
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,039
You are senior to us all now.

672
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,800
With you around,
our sect has its backbone.

673
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,360
Why did you come to Shanxi?

674
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:58,639
It's a long story.

675
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,079
Let's go back

676
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,199
and talk on the way.

677
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,119
Martial Uncle.

678
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,079
Martial Uncle.

679
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,760
I finally see you again.

680
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,760
Right.

681
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,800
Huanjie, get up.

682
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,519
Martial Uncle.

683
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,079
You're grown up now.

684
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,159
Welcome back.

685
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,719
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

686
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Rise.

687
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,599
All rise.

688
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:09,920
Huanjie,

689
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,559
Martial Uncle must be tired.

690
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,760
Take good care of him.

691
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,199
Everyone, please go out.

692
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:25,760
Bufan.

693
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,480
Leader.

694
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,320
Thank you.

695
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,159
Don't mention it.

696
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,480
Yu Huanjie.

697
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,079
Why is he...?

698
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,920
Acting weird, right?

699
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:52,719
Yes.

700
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,320
Do you know

701
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,760
how he joined our sect?

702
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,280
Actually, he was an abandoned baby.

703
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,280
He was picked up by Martial Uncle.

704
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,639
Martial Uncle raised him to adulthood.

705
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,880
They were like father and son.

706
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,760
Martial Uncle feared
he couldn't bear to discipline him,

707
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,480
so he let him be our master's disciple.

708
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,599
His swordsmanship

709
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,280
was taught by Martial Uncle
and Master together.

710
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,239
If he was not less talented than me,

711
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,639
he would be much better
at swordsmanship.

712
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,280
I just heard you saying

713
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,880
Martial Uncle left
more than 20 years ago.

714
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,199
Why did he leave?

715
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,039
Our sect was in Lingxi.

716
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,960
Just an unknown

717
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,039
and unrecognized sect.

718
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,079
So Martial Uncle decided

719
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,760
to resolutely head to the Central Plains

720
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,920
to make a name for himself.

721
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,440
Speaking of martial arts,

722
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,159
Martial Uncle

723
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,639
was more skilled than Master.

724
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,360
More skilled than you too?

725
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:00,880
Right.

726
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,920
Since the foundation
of the Rongtian Sword Sect,

727
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,639
you have been unmatched

728
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,639
in terms of swordsmanship.

729
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,800
Why was Martial Uncle in prison?

730
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,039
After he went to the Central Plains,

731
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
he vanished without a trace.

732
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,199
The news about him was told
to me by Prince Qi.

733
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,519
It was part of the deal I made with him

734
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,719
to help him find the treasure.

735
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,360
After Martial Uncle went
to the Central Plains,

736
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,960
more people got to know
about the Rongtian Sword Sect.

737
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,039
He also made friends
with many martial artists.

738
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,800
He disappeared

739
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,280
because during the Wuxu Reform,

740
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:43,000
he lent a hand to the Reformists.

741
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,400
But after the failure of the reform,

742
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,960
he was arrested as a rebel

743
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,320
and ended up being captured in Shanxi.

744
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,039
He had been imprisoned
in Zezhou ever since.

745
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,519
If it weren't for us rescuing
him this time,

746
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,480
he would probably have to die in jail.

747
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,800
Martial Uncle
is of higher seniority than you

748
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,239
and treats Yu Huanjie as his son.

749
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,320
Will they...?

750
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,920
No.

751
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,719
Previously, Yu Huanjie had no idea

752
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,079
about the whereabouts of Martial Uncle.

753
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,760
If I had such concerns,

754
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,039
I could have just ignored it.

755
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,760
Since I chose to rescue him,

756
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,199
I wouldn't worry about it.

757
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,880
Not to mention that Martial Uncle

758
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,400
doesn't want to be the Sect Leader.

759
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:21,400
Otherwise,

760
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,079
why would he decisively go
to the Central Plains

761
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,920
and let Master take up the position?

762
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,159
And with Martial Uncle around,

763
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,119
Yu Huanjie will behave himself.

764
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,000
Why didn't you mention me
to Martial Uncle?

765
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,039
I just don't know how
to broach the subject.

766
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,639
I'm afraid that after I tell him,

767
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,719
he will blame the master.

768
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
You're afraid he will blame your master?

769
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,960
You couldn't decide
what happened back then.

770
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,199
None of us could.

771
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,719
Do you blame your master?

772
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,239
He is Master.

773
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,559
We wouldn't be who we are today

774
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:38,519
without him.

775
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,039
How can I blame him?

776
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,400
If only you had become
the Sect Leader earlier.
