1
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,280
I should apologize to you.

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,719
Due to my carelessness,

4
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,479
I almost messed up your plan.

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,359
Anyway, a minister cannot keep me
from doing whatever I want.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,560
Long Zhen Li Jiu.

7
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,640
Racing against time
to change the nation.

8
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,679
Your Highness.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,840
Do you have something
to say on your knees?

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,719
You're wise, ambitious,
and a pillar in the nation.

11
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,959
And now, the nation is in peril.

12
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:11,280
The emperor is still too young,
and urgently in need of full assistance.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,599
I earnestly wish you to endure
for the country and the people.

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,424
You want me to me endure?
I've been doing it.

15
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,396
As a prince,

16
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,959
I've been living without worry.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,400
I've decided not to endure anymore
because of the country and the people.

18
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,120
If I continue to endure,

19
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,159
the nation might be in grave danger.

20
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
I know and admire your great cause

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,719
of developing
and strengthening the nation.

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,239
Yet, to save the nation
from going over the brink,

23
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,359
do you have to usurp the throne?

24
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,759
If the country is so weak

25
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,280
and nobody reshuffles the court,

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,984
the person sitting in the seat
might not be an Aisin-Gioro.

27
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:27,008
Your Highness,
are you sure this is your decision?

28
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,800
I'm sure, but it's not my own thing.

29
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,360
You'll destroy
this 300-year-old dynasty.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,360
Aren't you afraid of becoming a sinner
for your selfish desires?

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Did I allow you to look up, minion?

32
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,400
How could you know my thoughts?

33
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,280
You don't know what I am thinking,
just like everyone else.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,960
You think I want that throne?
You're wrong.

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,120
I thought about it,

36
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,240
but I couldn't find the right person
for the throne.

37
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,439
It's a crazy pipe dream.

38
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,560
I might be crazy, but it's not a dream.

39
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:03,232
=Heroes=

40
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:06,432
=Episode 28=

41
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:08,224
(Saintly Wise, Beloved Homelands)

42
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,279
Sir.

43
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,439
I just left the court
and came to tell you something.

44
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,279
Are you going to Fujian tomorrow?

45
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm leaving tonight. I want to go there

46
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,120
to see if there are
any clues left behind.

47
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,720
Good. I wish you success.

48
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
I will do my best.

49
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,920
You have to.

50
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,279
Otherwise,
we'll have nothing else to do.

51
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,759
After you leave the capital
for Fujian tonight.

52
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,879
I won't order you
to change your mission again.

53
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,600
If anyone gives you orders in the name
of the Imperial Household Department,

54
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,720
you must not believe it.

55
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,879
Yes, sir.

56
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,920
Keep it in mind.

57
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,920
If anything happens to me,

58
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,439
and you find the Altar Treasure,

59
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,160
take this token
to see Prince Regent Zaifeng.

60
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,759
Apart from him, you can't tell anyone
about the secret treasure.

61
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,800
Keep it.

62
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,399
Sir, why do you say this?

63
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,600
Is it because of the rebellion
on the eleventh day of the fifth month?

64
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,759
I've long prepared for the rebellion.
No need to worry.

65
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,040
I am worried about you.

66
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,399
The gainer of the secret treasure

67
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,839
will directly determine the future
of the nation.

68
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,000
So you have a great burden
of responsibility.

69
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,639
Understood.

70
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,199
Getai is not going with you.

71
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,680
He's been working for me since he was
a kid. It's been so many years.

72
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,896
Let him stay by my side this time.

73
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,112
Yes.

74
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,959
Be grateful to the pigeons flying
over the clouds.

75
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,480
Muqing, do you know the merits
of pigeons?

76
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
Pigeons know the way.

77
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Yes, they can fly very far.

78
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,199
But they will always fly back.

79
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,079
Remember what I have said.

80
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,120
I wish you success.

81
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,040
When I was young, I loved
to walk through the crowds at the fair

82
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,519
to watch the sugar-figure blowing.

83
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,439
I never get tired of seeing it.

84
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,799
Once I told my father I wanted
to be a sugar-blower when I grew up.

85
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,879
Hearing that,
he kicked me out of the house.

86
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,759
Before the imperial examination,
my father told me

87
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,360
if I failed, he'd kick me out
and let me be a sugar-blower.

88
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,440
You couldn't fail.

89
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,320
Being a sugar-blower is good.
I don't need to worry about anything.

90
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,600
Even if things change,
I still can be a sugar-blower.

91
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,879
Children always love to buy sugar.

92
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,799
Who cares who's the ruler?

93
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,799
It's a pot of sugar,
simmering into syrup.

94
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,879
If you like,
take a straw and swirl it inside.

95
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,120
And you'll get something out of it.

96
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,759
If you don't like it,
just throw it back into the pot.

97
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,720
In an instant,
it will melt into its original form.

98
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,000
Any forms will become the same.

99
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,879
Sir, it's done.

100
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,879
Good.

101
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,888
It looks good.

102
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,919
It is truly good.

103
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,559
Sir.

104
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,639
Sir, it's too much.

105
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,960
Say thanks.

106
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,399
Thank you, sir.

107
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,000
Lift.

108
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,440
Look, green peppers.

109
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,120
Hot and freshly made.

110
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,399
I remember you love

111
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,759
to eat the mutton
from the Ma Shop in Qianmen.

112
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,600
You remember I love this dish.

113
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,240
Thick slices. It's indeed tasty. Drink.

114
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,159
You eat.

115
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,360
It's getting dark.

116
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,759
I have checked it over and over.
It is foolproof tonight.

117
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,944
You've been with me for years. How can
you be absolutely certain of anything?

118
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,279
There's no foolproof thing.

119
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, everything is well prepared.

120
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,080
Wait.

121
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,759
Having been working for so many years,
I've saved some money.

122
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,919
The money is all yours.

123
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,879
Sir, if I succeed tonight,

124
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,000
my career will take off.

125
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,840
If not, money will mean nothing to me.

126
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,320
If you fail, try to escape.

127
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,080
This money is enough
for you to live a life.

128
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,240
For me, tonight, it's make or break.

129
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Whether we can live or not
depends on tonight.

130
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,200
- Great.
- Great.

131
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,000
- Great.
- Great.

132
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,840
- Good.
- Good.

133
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,679
- Great.
- Great.

134
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,360
- Great.
- Great.

135
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,440
- Great.
- Great.

136
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,919
- Good.
- Good.

137
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,919
- Good.
- Good.

138
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,559
- Good.
- Good.

139
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,919
- Great.
- Great.

140
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,360
We have utterly lost. We admit it.

141
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,328
No.

142
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:28,679
If your assassination is successful,

143
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,440
it will mean you utterly fail.

144
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,399
I know most of you are loyal to Cunqing.

145
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,519
That's why you are willing
to risk your lives to assassinate me.

146
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,039
I won't reason with you. Let's talk
about the similarities and differences.

147
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,559
It's either me or Cunqing.

148
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,408
We both agree
to make the country strong.

149
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:09,079
The difference is that Cunqing
puts the royal family first,

150
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,559
while I want
to weaken the imperial power.

151
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,279
Cunqing wants to assassinate me
for fear I would stage a coup.

152
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,319
I do want to stage a coup
because I want to change the nation.

153
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,920
You attempted
to kill the Prince of the First Rank.

154
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,000
That's already a huge crime.

155
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,240
Given you don't know the similarities
and differences,

156
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,279
I'm giving you a choice.

157
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,319
Those willing to follow me can survive.
The rest can kneel and die.

158
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,944
(Upright and Incorrupt)

159
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,559
Where is the feather fan I gave you?

160
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,359
That fan wasn't suitable for me,
so I gave it to a subordinate.

161
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,216
Who did you give it to?

162
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,759
Men Sandao?

163
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:15,839
Yes.

164
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,039
Good. Very good.

165
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,400
It's okay
if you refuse to seize the chance.

166
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,319
Hopefully, Men Sandao knows what to do.

167
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,519
Yes, as an ignorant minister,

168
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,200
how dare I hinder you,
an ambitious prince?

169
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,599
You're wrong, Cunqing.

170
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,279
You are admirable as a minister.

171
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,319
You are loyal and work hard
for the imperial family.

172
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:58,640
You even resorted to assassination
to stop me.

173
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:03,844
You should know

174
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:11,480
that killing the imperial family
is a grave crime.

175
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,640
Success would mean saving the nation,
failure would mean its destruction.

176
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,799
You're being silly and obstinate.

177
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,880
Even at this point,
you still can't see the situation?

178
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,279
Your Highness, I understand.

179
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,440
Prince Regent Zaifeng announced
he'd start constitutionalism in 1917.

180
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,000
Later, it was moved up to 1913.

181
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
Doesn't it mean that the Prince Regent
is also determined to reform?

182
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,720
Your Highness, I know the situation.

183
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,279
I also hope to see the nation rise again

184
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,119
after the pains of transformation.

185
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,680
But it's not my responsibility
or mission.

186
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,960
What is your responsibility and mission?

187
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,480
Uphold imperial power. As the minister
of the Imperial Household Department,

188
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,559
upholding imperial power
is my sole responsibility and mission.

189
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,279
Upholding imperial power?

190
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,359
Indeed, you are a good minister.

191
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,240
You have strategies,
a great vision, and means.

192
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,160
If you'd been born decades
or a century earlier,

193
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,839
you would have been an excellent talent
to assist the emperor.

194
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:37,440
Sadly, you were born in this era.
You're short-sighted.

195
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,400
You're right.

196
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,680
Anyway, I lost.
It's pointless to say anything.

197
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,559
Do you know why you lost?

198
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,759
It doesn't matter anymore.
There's no use crying over spilled milk.

199
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,640
Do you think I only placed Khankh
by your side?

200
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,960
You're resourceful.

201
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,799
I don't think
you only placed one person by my side.

202
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,039
I'm taking a gamble.

203
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,400
Since I've come this far,
I have to take the gamble.

204
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,759
Those who tried to kill you tonight
are all my most trusted subordinates.

205
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,640
I'm afraid in your eyes,

206
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,032
my trusted subordinates are a joke.

207
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,759
They don't work for you

208
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,920
not because I give them money
or good career prospects.

209
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,328
That's because they believe
that I can turn things around.

210
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,759
I will not let the country fall
into the hands of others.

211
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,680
I have committed a huge crime,
and I know that I will die.

212
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,400
If you think
my people will trust and follow you,

213
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,839
please show mercy and spare them.

214
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,799
I believe they will
be even more loyal to you.

215
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,200
It makes sense.

216
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,400
I've been thinking on my way here.

217
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,720
I was thinking about whether
to persuade you to follow me.

218
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,799
Later, I just laughed.

219
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,720
I laughed at my hypocrisy.

220
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,960
Do I have to watch you cry
and thank me for being merciful?

221
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:08,920
You're a good minister,
so I will let you be.

222
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:30,240
To change the nation,
we must start by changing the Qing Code.

223
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,279
Cunqing, I'll spare your entire family.

224
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,519
Nor will I punish anyone besides you.

225
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,799
Your dead body will remain intact.
I'll even let you do it yourself.

226
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,599
Please do me one last favor.

227
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,960
I don't dare to hope you'll give up
the rebellion, but I need your promise.

228
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,039
If your rebellion succeeds,

229
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,880
I beg you to keep your word.

230
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,279
You will do all you can
to restore the prestige of the nation.

231
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,248
Zaifeng told me

232
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:35,960
that it was hard and too slow
to realize constitutionalism.

233
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:42,656
He told me to do it quicker

234
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,920
and be decisive in troubled times.

235
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,079
Impossible, I don't believe it.

236
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,880
Impossible! I don't believe it!

237
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,248
(The first day of the fifth month, 1911,
ten days away from Grain in Ear)

238
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,119
(Suzhou, Jiangsu)

239
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:23,904
- Give me some food.
- Sir.

240
00:26:23,904 --> 00:26:25,400
- Please give me some food.
- Sir.

241
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,079
Please give me some food.

242
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:33,960
I'm hungry.

243
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,880
Sir, two bowls of noodles.

244
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,559
Alright.

245
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,519
Sit.

246
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,880
Hurry and go.

247
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:50,480
Move.

248
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,056
Come here.

249
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,880
He looks like...

250
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
Look like a human trafficker.

251
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,039
Four coins.

252
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,104
Please offer more.

253
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,599
I can't. Here.

254
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,240
Alright then.

255
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,000
He's really a human trafficker.

256
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,599
Go.

257
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,039
You eat here. I'll be right back.

258
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,359
Hurry up.

259
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,880
Sir, what's up?

260
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,480
Did you buy this child?

261
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,920
Who are you, sir?

262
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:55,232
(Constable of Dagu County)

263
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
So you are a constable.
I'm from the local opera troupe.

264
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,519
This girl's family is poor
and can't support her.

265
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,440
Her mother gave her to me.

266
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,328
If she works hard,

267
00:28:07,328 --> 00:28:09,400
she can make a living.

268
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,559
She looks clever and pretty.

269
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,359
She might become a leading role one day.

270
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,680
Her mother sold her to you
or gave her to you?

271
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,200
Well...

272
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,359
I just saw you paying.

273
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,680
Yes, I paid. At the agreed price.

274
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,960
I'm afraid the woman
who sold her is not her mother.

275
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,480
She said she was.

276
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,920
The woman who brought you here
is your mother?

277
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,519
What are you afraid of?
I am a constable.

278
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,279
Just tell me. Is she your mother?

279
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,200
Kid, don't be scared.

280
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,119
Tell me. Is the person
who brought you here your mother?

281
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,039
You...

282
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,119
- Move.
- Sir.

283
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,799
It's a misunderstanding, sir.

284
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,000
He's from an opera troupe.

285
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,319
Even so, he can't buy a child.

286
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,200
It's okay if they make a deal.

287
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,240
What deal?

288
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,960
You know what? The person
who sold the girl is not her mother.

289
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,480
I know, but we
can't find the trafficker.

290
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,000
Come on. Have some sunflower seeds.

291
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,160
It's your job to find the trafficker.

292
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,640
Listen, buddy. We both are constables.

293
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,119
I know what you mean.

294
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:17,799
What can you do
even if you find the trafficker?

295
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,160
Look at that child. How thin she is.

296
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,319
Her clothes are clearly altered.
Old coarse cloth.

297
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,160
Her family can't raise her.

298
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,599
To speak frankly,

299
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,079
many poor families sold their children.

300
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:42,440
At best, they're sold to rich families.
At worst, some are sold to brothels.

301
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,640
This girl is lucky enough
to be sold to an opera troupe.

302
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,799
Why do you care about such matters?

303
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,912
How can I not care?

304
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,160
As a constable,
I'm responsible for the people.

305
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,240
Have some sunflower seeds.

306
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,319
Take them away. It shouldn't be hard
for a local constable to find someone.

307
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,519
Where is this child's home?
Where are her parents?

308
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,160
If you want, you can find out.

309
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,599
If you do nothing,
the criminal will get away with this.

310
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,279
Aren't you being irresponsible?

311
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,799
You are quite stubborn.
I can find her parents.

312
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,559
But what if her family is so poor

313
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,880
that they have to sell the child?

314
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,519
You send the kid back home,
and then her parents sell her again.

315
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,599
She might be sold to a brothel.

316
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,004
Do you think you're doing a good deed?

317
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:29,472
Parents love their kids.

318
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:31,039
How could parents
abandon their children?

319
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,359
Besides, without investigating it,
you concluded

320
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,432
that the child was abandoned.

321
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,880
What if her parents are looking for her
right now?

322
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,160
Enough, I can't make you understand.

323
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
I'll find her parents for you, alright?

324
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,240
You're not doing it for me.

325
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,160
If not for you, for whom then?

326
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,640
It's your responsibility.
It's not for anyone.

327
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,880
Fine, I'll do it for myself, alright?

328
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,119
Go. Find her parents.

329
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,480
Hurry up.

330
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,359
- How irresponsible.
- Move.

331
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:16,519
Why can't I sell her?
Will you support us then?

332
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,480
What can she do with me?

333
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
If I don't sell her to an opera troupe,

334
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,119
should she stay with me doing this?

335
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,079
She's my daughter and I love her,
but what can I do?

336
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,359
I don't even know how to support her.

337
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,440
I raised her until she was five
before sending her away.

338
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,759
I'm good enough to her.

339
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,880
If she stays in the opera troupe,

340
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,079
perhaps ten years later, she could
become a concubine in a wealthy family.

341
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,240
If she stays with me, she'll end up
like me in less than ten years.

342
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,759
I've had enough of this life.
I don't want her to suffer any longer.

343
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,440
I have to get rid of this nuisance.

344
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:57,088
I'm the most beautiful nearby.

345
00:32:57,668 --> 00:33:00,448
But my business is the worst
because of her.

346
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,359
She's too little
to mess up your business.

347
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,359
Sir, how do I work with her by my side?

348
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,200
So you don't want me to sell her?

349
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,960
Fine, I am reluctant to part with her.

350
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,400
You give me money. It's not costly
to support my daughter and me.

351
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,480
With six taels of silver a year,
my daughter and I can get by.

352
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,720
Give me 60 taels to raise her, okay?

353
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,839
Sir, come and have some fun.

354
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,920
If she's sent away,
both she and I can survive.

355
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,456
Otherwise, she and I
will starve to death.

356
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,360
I have an illness
and can't afford the treatment.

357
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,144
When she grows up and wants to find me,

358
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,440
I fear I may already be dead.

359
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,639
Come to me again.

360
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,079
What's her name?

361
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,719
Her name is Linglong.

362
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,400
What's her surname?

363
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,039
I don't know.

364
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,480
What's your surname?

365
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,840
Mine? My surname is Shen.

366
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,119
(Shen Meifeng)

367
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,000
Sir, come and have fun. Come on in.

368
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,599
Take care.

369
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,679
Shen Linglong, let's go.

370
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,239
Mr. Zhang, long time no see.

371
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,239
Come and have fun.

372
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,079
Take care, sir.

373
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,440
Come on in.

374
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,880
Come on in. This way, please.

375
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,239
I'm sorry, sir. I wronged you.

376
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,880
Taking disciples is allowed,
but trafficking children is not.

377
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Yes, you're right.

378
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,239
Don't do it again.

379
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,679
Your name is Shen Linglong.

380
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,639
Name is important.
Have you remembered it?

381
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,776
You must also remember
that no one can help you.

382
00:36:03,776 --> 00:36:04,996
You can only rely on yourself.

383
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,159
You need to become strong enough
so that no one can bully you.

384
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,679
Otherwise, you'll be trampled underfoot.

385
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,800
I haven't seen you cry.

386
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,440
It means you're strong and tough enough.

387
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,760
You must stay tough.

388
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,760
Crying will only make you weaker.

389
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,199
When you want to cry,
just think about what I told you.
