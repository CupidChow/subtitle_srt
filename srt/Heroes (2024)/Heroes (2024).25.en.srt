00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,919
You don't have to. Take it back.

2
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:16,600
Congratulations.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,440
Congratulations.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,280
No, take it back.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,960
(Han Can Hui)
Please take it back.

6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,000
You don't have to. Take it back.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,120
You don't have to. Take it back.

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,440
Muqing.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
You don't have to. Take it back.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,000
Welcome Muqing, my good friend,
a second-rank imperial guard.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,399
Mr. Lin.

12
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,152
Jialuo.

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,960
Congratulations.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,799
Come on.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,759
Jialuo, why are you
wearing humble clothes?

16
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,000
Why not wear your Beiyang Army uniform?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,560
I...

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,120
That's fine. It shows
that I have connections in Yamen.

19
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:06,879
Red envelope for you.

20
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,576
(Red envelope from Wang Jialuo)

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,920
Thanks.

22
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,120
Jialuo, why does this feel thicker
when I hold it?

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,359
The inside is the money you deserve.

24
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,439
And some of it is from me.

25
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,359
Buddy, that's very generous.
You are my true friend.

26
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,719
You are much better
than those officials and noblemen.

27
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,359
The human nature could shine or dim

28
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,079
before the money.

29
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,480
And your human nature shines.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,840
Not only that, you're dazzling.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,439
You are so welcome.

32
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,239
Come on in. Take care of him.

33
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:49,120
(LUCKY MALL)

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,879
Congratulations.

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,159
Hello, how do you do? Enjoy yourself.

36
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:35,648
(LUCKY MALL)

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360
No need to worry.

38
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,840
You're also tricked into coming here?

39
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,159
Aren't you?

40
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,400
What is the latest on the investigation?

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,120
That depends on how you're doing on it.

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,960
I've arranged for people to do that.

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,759
I've pulled the records of Ministry
of Commerce from the year 1662.

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,719
It was Ministry of Revenue. In 1901,
the Ministry of Commerce was created.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,479
Right, I'm investigating
both ministries.

46
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,520
In 1906, the Ministry of Revenue
was turned into the Ministry of Duzhi.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,919
The Ministry of Works
and Ministry of Commerce were merged.

48
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,039
I'm investigating it all.

49
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,520
If you're worried,
you can investigate it yourself.

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,639
I trust you. You can get it done.

51
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,624
If so, why did you say those things?

52
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:03,652
You think I don't know?

53
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,199
You must be aware of that.

54
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,776
Honestly, too many records.

55
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:14,319
Decades or hundreds of years of papers
have piled up an entire room.

56
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,839
Many more people are working on it.
But I haven't found anything yet.

57
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
You worked so hard for this.

58
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,920
And you? Have you found anything
in the seal?

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,439
Like you, I found nothing
as there is only one seal.

60
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,399
How about the two of us exchange ideas?

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,439
There's no need for that.
We only have two seals in total.

62
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,680
We can't find anything.

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,279
Let's wait until we get four seals.

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
Alright, let's wait.

67
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,160
(Red envelope)
Thank you.

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,759
You don't have to, actually.

69
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,680
Alright, just take it.

70
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,480
You do your things.
I'll just look around.

71
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,959
There will be a brief ceremony later.

72
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,079
After the ceremony,
feel free to pick anything.

73
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,759
Please take your seat. Let me...

74
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,399
Would you like to sit next to
the concubine of the Military Minister?

75
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,519
Or the wife of the President
of the Western Chamber of Commerce?

76
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,279
Take care of her.

77
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:25,720
Congratulations.

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,920
Thank you.

79
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,600
Muqing.

80
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,560
Princess?

81
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
Keep your voice down.
Don't let others hear it.

82
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,560
Yeah, but why are you here?

83
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,360
Lucky found many things for me.

84
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,079
He opened a shop.
I'm just here to congratulate him.

85
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,480
I see.

86
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,319
My classmate is doing well at my place.

87
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,720
Don't worry about it.

88
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,959
Thank you, princess.

89
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,000
I mentioned before that my husband
will leave the capital for Fujian.

90
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,279
If I go with him, what would you think?

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
How long will you be gone?

92
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,720
Maybe for a short time,
or for a long time.

93
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,800
Muqing.

94
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,519
You don't have to. Do you remember me?

95
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,800
When I was about to fall off my bike,
you helped me.

96
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,040
I remember.

97
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,319
You must always remember.

98
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,839
I always remember.

99
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,759
I mean it. You must remember.

100
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm about to leave.
I'm going to study abroad in the West.

101
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,759
Do you have anything
you want to say to me?

102
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,000
I cycled around the palace
just to run into you.

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,799
So how long will you be gone there?

104
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,519
Maybe for a short time,
or for a long time.

105
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,559
You must always remember, Muqing.

106
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,559
Muqing, what are you thinking about?

107
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,919
I will always remember.

108
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,120
Actually, I'm not going.

109
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,120
Look, do you think those drifting
in the air resemble us?

110
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,799
Us?

111
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,320
They seem to be beautiful
and fly freely,

112
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,240
but they don't know where they will go.

113
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,440
With the sound of the drum,
the light goes out.

114
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,460
When I'm awake,

115
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,519
I hear the cry of a lone wild goose.

116
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,080
Life is like catkins floating
in the wind,

117
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,559
full of laughter and sadness.

118
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,919
It's all gone upon the river.

119
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,879
This verse...

120
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,879
Never heard of it? It is
Mr. Guantang's recent work.

121
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,360
You were in prison when he created this.

122
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,799
I see. It's in a dispirited tone.

123
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,279
Yes. Back then, revolutions rose
across the nation.

124
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,720
Mr. Guantang was in low spirits.

125
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,519
He saw no hope for the court anymore.

126
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,559
Princess.

127
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,279
I'm telling the truth.
Can't we even talk about it now?

128
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,840
The colorful stuff seems beautiful,
but it's like drifting duckweed.

129
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,679
In today's dynasty,
aren't you and I just helpless?

130
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
Ladies and gentlemen.

131
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,639
Ladies and gentlemen.

132
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,360
Welcome to today's opening ceremony.

133
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,759
Welcome to today's opening ceremony.

134
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,039
All of you are good friends today.

135
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,080
All of you are good friends today.

136
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,159
They're also people of high status.

137
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,159
They're also people of high status.

138
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,919
Most important of all.

139
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,120
Most important of all.

140
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,399
They're all future customers
of Han Can Hui.

141
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,159
They're all future customers
of Han Can Hui.

142
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,399
Because of you,
I can earn money every day.

143
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,919
Because of you,
I can earn money every day.

144
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,240
Because of you, I am lucky.

145
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,600
Because of you, I am lucky.

146
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,559
Because of you.

147
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,639
Because of you.

148
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,368
Wealth rises like the rising sun.

149
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,080
Wealth rises like the rising sun.

150
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,720
I love you all.

151
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,879
I love you all.

152
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
- Great.
- Great.

153
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,759
Han Can Hui officially opens today.

154
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,879
A twenty percent of discount
on all goods.

155
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,360
Please feel free to view and purchase.

156
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,879
- Great.
- Great.

157
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,960
You're also interested in these things?

158
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,759
Have a look.

159
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,559
Found something you like?
Let me introduce it.

160
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,799
Top-quality products.

161
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,639
There are suitable items
for yourself or others

162
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,639
or your friends.

163
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,440
This looks good.

164
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,039
Two mandarin ducks were having fun
in the water.

165
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,919
But why the bottle is in black?

166
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,944
(Price is negotiable)
You have not set price yet?

167
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,919
You don't understand, do you?
You've never seen this before?

168
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,039
As I said, my goods are remarkable.

169
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,919
It's amazing.
Birds fly side by side and fall.

170
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,320
Mandarin ducks play
in the water but are drown.

171
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,039
It's a divine artifact,
a remarkable piece, and a weapon.

172
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:41,200
Legend has it that it was made
by a lovesick man from Southeast Asia.

173
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,879
He was good with his hands.

174
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,399
But he had no desire for profits.

175
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,919
He made good stuff but less money.

176
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,519
In the end, the girl he loved ran off
with a young rich man.

177
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,896
The lovesick craftsman was devastated,
and his nature changed drastically.

178
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,559
So he made this thing.

179
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,759
It's said he killed a pair of lovebirds
and smeared their blood on the clay.

180
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,200
He made the lovebirds part,

181
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,399
and threw a wood into the kiln.

182
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,519
To break them up,

183
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,720
he turned the white porcelain
into a black one.

184
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,320
It's like it has been cursed.

185
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,960
If you want to break up a couple,
send it to them.

186
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,159
Put it in the room,

187
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,360
and lovers or spouses
will turn against each other.

188
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,279
No lovers will be together.

189
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,200
Would anyone
buy such a terrifying thing?

190
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,440
This is a must-have for the concubines
vying for favor in the imperial harem.

191
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,559
But the Emperor is too young.

192
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,832
When his concubines crowd the palace,

193
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,524
it will become a sought-after item.

194
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,879
Jialuo, let me show you around.

195
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,399
Cheers.

196
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,559
Cheers.

197
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,759
Mr. Lin, can you help me
choose something?

198
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,639
For whom?

199
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,639
A woman? I'm sure. Easy.

200
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,120
Jialuo, are you serious
about this relationship?

201
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,279
Or just a fling?

202
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,840
I'm being silly.

203
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,759
You're a serious man.
You'll definitely marry her, right?

204
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,279
This is good.
It restrains you for a lifetime.

205
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,639
Gold inlaid with jade. It's expensive.

206
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:22,759
This is also good. Jade encased in gold.
It's also expensive.

207
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,799
These two are a set.

208
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,720
Look, I'll slowly slot it in.
Just kidding.

209
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,639
This is good, with Southeast Asian musk
within the hollow gold tube.

210
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,320
It's also not cheap.

211
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,440
Jialuo, you are Han Chinese, right?

212
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,480
Of course.

213
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,120
Your girlfriend is also Han Chinese?

214
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,559
Yes.

215
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,264
Manchu people give Ruyi.
Han Chinese give rings.

216
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,120
How about this one?

217
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,799
It's fashionable, from a good craftsman,
with top-notch carving.

218
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,599
Westerners give rings when proposing.

219
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,920
You don't like it?

220
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,056
This must be expensive. How much?

221
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,599
Just keep it.

222
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,680
No, I can't take it.

223
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,799
We're friends,
and today is my business opening.

224
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,200
I give this ring to you.

225
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,279
Jialuo, you can't refuse.

226
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,119
If you don't accept it,
you're embarrassing me.

227
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,640
Help me close it.

228
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,920
Mr. Lin. Thank you.

229
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,640
I didn't know what to choose.

230
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,160
So I let Mr. Lin choose for me.

231
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,559
But he gave it to me for free.

232
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,480
I wanted to buy it for you.

233
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,000
Doesn't it become his gift to you?

234
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,160
I got this gift from you.
What does it have to do with him?

235
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,279
I didn't pay for it.

236
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,359
It's not about the money.
It's the thought that counts.

237
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:48,200
Anyway, I'll save up
and pay Mr. Lin back later.

238
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,759
This must not be cheap.

239
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,359
If Mr. Lin charged me today,
I probably couldn't afford it.

240
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,440
Whatever you give me,

241
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,759
cheap or expensive, I like it all.

242
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,200
I've chased the murderer
from Dagu for 30 days.

243
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
We've gone through a lot of stuff.

244
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,599
I thought we'd get married
after closing the case.

245
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,880
But now I don't know
when this case will be concluded.

246
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,839
I don't want you to wait,
nor do I want to wait any longer.

247
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,359
Whether waiting or not,
there's no difference.

248
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,640
No, there is a difference.
I'll take you back to Dagu.

249
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,119
Let's go home and get married.

250
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,759
After all, I can't find the Baohe Inn.

251
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,839
I'll trust Muqing once.

252
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's make a day to hold our wedding.

253
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,680
We're pressed for time,
but formalities must be observed.

254
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,960
It's just that I'm short on money.

255
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,480
I can't give you a grand wedding.

256
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,720
I don't care
as long as I can be with you.

257
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,874
(The 26th day of 4th month,
3th year of Xuantong era,)

258
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:56,928
(14 days before Mangzhong)

259
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,279
We can't miss the hotpot in the capital.

260
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,680
But eating it outside is ostentatious.

261
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,960
So I bought it. Let's enjoy it.

262
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:14,160
How is your injury?

263
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,200
- It's much better now. Don't worry.
- To you.

264
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,480
Where can we find the Baohe Inn?

265
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,720
I heard from Prince Qi that Men Sandao
has the Department look for it.

266
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,519
But there is still no clue.

267
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,960
If he can't find anything,
what can we do?

268
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,519
If we can't find the place,
what about the thirty-year pact?

269
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,240
I plan to find something
on the Discipline Seal.

270
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,839
You already have the Discipline Seal,
right?

271
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:53,880
Yes, but it takes four seals
to open the treasure.

272
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,000
I think the thirty-year pact

273
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,519
is more important than the seal itself.

274
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,000
When the Disciplinary Department's chief
turned to the court,

275
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,279
he presented the seal.

276
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,000
How could he
forget such an important clue?

277
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,559
So we have to look for his descendants.

278
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,759
Huang Xing,
have you found his descendants?

279
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,839
When the Disciplinary Department's chief
turned to the court,

280
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,920
he received some rewards.

281
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,319
None of his descendants are officials.

282
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,000
His son was a scholar, who once
was in charge of an academy in Jiangnan.

283
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,119
He has passed away now.

284
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,400
His grandson is currently teaching
in the Jiangzhe Region.

285
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:44,480
Bufan, the Southern Shaolin's inheritor
has become a school teacher.

286
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,340
(Home)

287
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,480
Muqing, I've been busy
with the opening ceremony these days,

288
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,160
I've been very busy.

289
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,440
But I never forget to find the treasure.

290
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,359
I've been thinking of the words

291
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,599
on the burned wooden box.

292
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,799
I made a guess
and I think it's reliable.

293
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,680
So, I've come to share it with you.

294
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,000
Tell me then.

295
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,632
Firstly, the word of five.

296
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,920
Could it be referring to the time,
the fifth day of the fifth month?

297
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,200
The word of Bao.
Could it refer to a place?

298
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,640
For instance, Baota,
Baodian, Baozhai, and...

299
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,039
Lin Haohan, you are very clever.

300
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,279
It makes sense.

301
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,279
I'm flattered,
but you're telling the truth.

302
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,319
Do you know about the Baohe Inn?

303
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,440
Baohe Inn? The word of Bao?

304
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Muqing, have you figured it out?

305
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,759
Come on. Let's talk about it.

306
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,000
If you don't know about the Baohe Inn,

307
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,599
we really have nothing to talk about.

308
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,440
Muqing, you're hurting my feelings.

309
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,880
You're not treating me as your buddy.

310
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,640
Buddy, if you don't know
about the Baohe Inn,

311
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,079
it makes it hard for me
to think of you as a buddy.

312
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,720
Even so, I still see you as my buddy.

313
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,759
Even though you're breaking my heart,

314
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,799
as your buddy,
I will tell you everything.

315
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,839
You know the Baohe Inn?

316
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,559
So this is fate.

317
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,920
If you ask others,
they probably don't know.

318
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,319
But now, you've asked the right person.

319
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,519
You really know?

320
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,720
Muqing, have I ever deceived you?

321
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,079
Have I ever boasted to you?

322
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,960
You haven't.

323
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:11,079
Buddy, come in and talk.

324
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:11,880
That's more like it.

325
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,839
From 1522 to 1566, in Fujian,

326
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
there was a large shop, Baohe Shop.

327
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,200
Its business was extensive,
including an inn.

328
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,079
The Baohe Inn is one of businesses
of the Baohe Shop.

329
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,279
Buddy, go on.

330
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm done.

331
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,920
What?

332
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,160
Yes, Baohe Inn,
the business of Baohe Shop.

333
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,039
Where is it?

334
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,880
What? How would I know?

335
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,720
Didn't you say you knew where it was?

336
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,032
You asked me if I knew the Baohe Inn.

337
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:01,680
I know, and I have already told you.

338
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,799
I have never stayed in that inn.
That was centuries ago.

339
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,680
Even as an antiques dealer,
I don't know where it is.

340
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:13,319
Can't you search for it?
I've already told you.

341
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,119
Baohe Shop was a shop in Fujian.
Can't you find it?

342
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,240
It's been hundreds of years.
The inn might have changed its name.

343
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,119
It's uncertain
whether it's still an inn now.

344
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,599
But you can find out something, right?

345
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,880
So I couldn't find it in any records
of the past two hundred years.

346
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,759
Turns out that's a long time ago.

347
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,079
I'll have to take a trip to Fujian.

348
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,160
You're going to Fujian?

349
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:37,952
Are you going with me?

350
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,000
You think I'm useful?

351
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,119
You're a lucky man.

352
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,240
You can't drive me away again.

353
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,279
Absolutely not.

354
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,119
You can't stop me from getting benefits.

355
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:49,920
You're allowed.

356
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,759
Ten percent?

357
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,039
No less than ten percent.

358
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,359
Great, I will follow you to Fujian.

359
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,920
I'll be at your service
and share the treasure with you.

360
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,640
Before that, I have to find out
where the Baohe Inn used to be

361
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,599
and its new name.

362
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:10,784
(The 27th day of 4th month,
3th year of Xuantong era,)

363
00:27:10,784 --> 00:27:11,552
(13 days before Mangzhong)

364
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:21,056
(Get)

365
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,640
How long will you be gone?

366
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,599
It might take over ten days.

367
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,279
Returning home to pay respects
to ancestors. It's a hassle.

368
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,440
It's an act of filial piety.
How can it be a hassle?

369
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
Thank you. I will be back
before the tenth day.

370
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,960
No worries. Since you're going back,
take a longer rest.

371
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,480
Thank you.

372
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:21,720
(Get)

373
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,160
Come again tonight.

374
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,680
Zhuo Bufan has found some new clues.

375
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,880
You need to hear from him
before you leave.

376
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,200
Yes.

377
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:43,960
(Get killed)
You may go. Come again in the evening.

378
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,680
Zhao Fu.

379
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:51,840
Your Highness.

380
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:57,920
Get Zhuo Bufan here tonight.
Do it secretly.

381
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,400
Understood.

382
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,440
The oil is hot.
Add green onion, ginger, and garlic.

383
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,072
Good.

384
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,759
- Here you go.
- Sauce.

385
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,519
Here come the eggs.

386
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,000
Done.

387
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,319
Alright, good.

388
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,039
Cheers.

389
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,079
Good wine and food.

390
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,039
Try the dishes in a while.

391
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,160
Jialuo.

392
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:42,359
Jialuo.

393
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,079
What a surprise.

394
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,440
Where have you been?
I couldn't find you.

395
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,160
I thought you got lost.

396
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,480
Right. Jialuo.

397
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,079
You've missed so many delicious foods.

398
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,039
Mahua, big steamed buns,

399
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,279
fish dumplings, and Hulatang.

400
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,359
Who is that girl standing behind you?

401
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,799
Come. This is the county magistrate.

402
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,519
Greetings, sir.

403
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,200
This is the Adviser.

404
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,680
Greetings, sir.

405
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,960
Nice to meet you.

406
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
This is Mr. Xing who taught me.

407
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
We have met before.

408
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,392
This is Mr. Wang, Mr. Li.

409
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,599
They are officers of Dagu County Yamen.

410
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,319
Greetings to you all.

411
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,319
What's wrong with you?
I'm asking who she is.

412
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,640
You've introduced us all,
but who is she?

413
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,000
She is Lin Anjing, the victim
of the Dagu murder case.

414
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,640
The nine people who were murdered
were her family and friends.

415
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,759
Miss Lin and I are...

416
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,920
Miss Lin and I...

417
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,519
Goodness, you're so slow.

418
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,599
What are you to her?

419
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,008
She and I...

420
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:55,968
We...

421
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,839
Sir, Jialuo and I have been together
these days.

422
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,160
We have already committed.

423
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,680
Jialuo brought me back to get married.

424
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,960
That's a good thing.

425
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,559
Yes.

426
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,240
- Good news.
- Great.

427
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,039
You're of a marriageable age.

428
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:25,824
(Zhou Jiaoqin, Wang Pengde)

429
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:30,148
(Alcohol)

430
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
Sir, this red cloth...

431
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,000
- Put it over her head.
- Okay.

432
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,440
This is not necessary, right?

433
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,680
You have already seen me.

434
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,599
Yeah.

435
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,319
Take it off.

436
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,960
Take it off.

437
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,640
Put it over and take it off.
Then enter the bridal chamber.

438
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,599
Wang Jialuo, Lin Anjing,
it's your big day.

439
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,799
May you be happy and have a child soon.

440
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,640
Wish you a happy marriage.

441
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,880
Wish you a lovely life.

442
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,119
Why are you silent?

443
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,799
I have already said to myself.

444
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,640
After all, my father won't object.

445
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,680
Let's go. I'll take you
to see my master.

446
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,000
How nice would it be
if we could live here?

447
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,200
It's okay as long as you like
this small place of Dagu.

448
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:38,920
I like this place. Really.

449
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,880
If we can live here,

450
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,000
we won't have to think about anything.

451
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,160
And we don't feel tired at all.

452
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,240
Really?

453
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,744
Yes.

454
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,400
I promise you. After I catch Zhuo Bufan
to close the case

455
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,720
and protect the Altar Treasure
for the court, we will return.

456
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
We live a good life here.

457
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,920
After returning, I'll repair the house.

458
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,440
So you can live in it happily.
By the way,

459
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,024
it's the key to my house.

460
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,760
Whatever vegetables you want to eat,
I will plant them in the yard for you.

461
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,199
And if you want to eat meat,
I will raise pigs, chickens, and ducks.

462
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,559
Jialuo.

463
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,119
We just got married.
Let's stay at home today.

464
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,079
Can we go back tomorrow?

465
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,119
Okay.

466
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,280
No progress?

467
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,679
Yes.

468
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:26,239
You've been in the capital for days
and even have gone to Tianjin.

469
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,760
How could there be no progress?

470
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,079
Zhuo Bufan got a clue from Prince Qi.

471
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,800
He went to Tianjin to find a madman,
the inheritor of the Dharma Department.

472
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,960
I don't know if he's the inheritor,
but he is a madman for sure.

473
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,079
Nothing was gained.

474
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,199
I wish to gain something.

475
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,199
But nothing was found in the end.

476
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,960
Nothing else?

477
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,440
My nation used to be known
as the Wo state.

478
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,119
Since the reign of Emperor Xuanzong,
our nation has been called Japan.

479
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,119
We paid tribute yearly, and your nation
was known as the Celestial Empire.

480
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,039
But after the Meiji Restoration,
things were different,

481
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,160
because we know
the importance of change.

482
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,039
I believe you're as far-sighted as us.

483
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,480
I know some clues,
but I don't know if they're of any use.

484
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:28,840
Tell me about it.

485
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,880
The chief inheritors of the Southern
Shaolin meet once every 30 years.

486
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,159
They meet in the Baohe Inn.

487
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,239
They're supposed to meet
on the sixth day of next month.

488
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,239
Such important information.

489
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

490
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,480
Three of the four inheritors are dead.

491
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,360
What's the point of meeting again?

492
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,559
And one of them is unknown.

493
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,360
Who knows if he will show up?

494
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,280
Sounds promising.

495
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,159
I see no hope.

496
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,640
Zhuo Bufan never gave up
when hunting the treasure.

497
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,519
Why do you see no hope?

498
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,840
There are only a few days left
until the appointed day.

499
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,039
No one knows where the Baohe Inn is.

500
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,079
We don't know,
and Men Sandao doesn't know either.

501
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,519
Everyone is desperately searching.

502
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:34,880
All of you can't find the place,

503
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,920
so they will miss this appointment?

504
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,719
Didn't Zhuo Bufan do something else?

505
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,119
There's nothing he can do.

506
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,639
He will do something, won't he?

507
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,039
He'll find the inheritor's descendants
of the Disciplinary Department.

508
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,719
That inheritor sided
with the court decades ago.

509
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,719
What secrets could his descendants have?

510
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,880
The court could know all of his secrets.

511
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,639
Zhuo Bufan doesn't think so.
He wants to give it a try.

512
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,239
Yes, if I were him, I would do the same.

513
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,679
Alright, I have to go.
Staying too long would arouse suspicion.

514
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,104
Go through the back door.
Someone will walk you out.

515
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,800
Mr. Yu, if anything happens,
please let me know.

516
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,599
Okay.

517
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,679
He was hesitant today.

518
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,679
It took you a long time
to get the information out of him.

519
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:42,559
He's not reliable anymore.

520
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,679
He's always unreliable.

521
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,239
It seems
someone has offered him more benefits.

522
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,119
Who could it be?

523
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,880
No matter who he is, he is our enemy.

524
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,800
Your Highness,
don't you like Queshe tea?

525
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,639
Why do you drink Longjing Tea now?

526
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,480
It's sent by Hangzhou officials.
Give it a try.

527
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,920
Good tea.

528
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,639
Your Highness,
what do you summon me for?

529
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,320
Do you know where the Baohe Inn is?

530
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,039
I know you'll go to the Baohe Inn
for the thirty-year pact.

531
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,159
You ask for leave with a lame excuse.
Ancestor worship?

532
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,880
I have always been careful
in employing people.

533
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,450
Your father's death anniversary
is in the 8th month,

534
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,960
and your mother's is in the 1st month.

535
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,000
You paid respects to ancestors
in the twelfth month.

536
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,599
Since when do you pay respects
in the fifth month?

537
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,719
Yes, I put poison in the tea.

538
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,199
Look, when you asked for leave
this afternoon,

539
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,119
I wrote something for you.

540
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,880
Get killed for stupid stuff.

541
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,480
Get imprisoned for survival.

542
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:57,039
