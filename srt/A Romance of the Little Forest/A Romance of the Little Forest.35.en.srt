[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,780
[Episode 35]
[My wish is to be together with you forever.]

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,100
Someone in Xingfu used a group photo
of junior high school to frame me up.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,539
I'm afraid you're
my only classmate working there.

26
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,620
But why don't you...
Why don't I yell at you?

27
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,679
I've possessed so many things

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,220
so I don't need to fuss about it.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,820
Yu Meiren.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,140
That's why we're different.

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,700
You're just a hypocrite.

32
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,700
I can confess what I've done

33
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,939
but you only know to resort to sophistry.

34
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,780
Miss Xia.

35
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,300
You've thought too much.

36
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,100
We refuse to admit it

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,300
only because we haven't done it. It's too low.

38
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:17,980
Do you think she's the only one
who knows the photo?

39
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,300
Who else could know?

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,239
I think President Zhao also knows it, right?

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,899
Are you crazy? We share the same interests.

42
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,500
So how could he do so?

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,660
For some greater interests.

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,620
Almost everyone could see
it's belittling you to flatter her.

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,700
Obviously, we can't stand
to see you feel wronged

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,060
so I investigated it.

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,660
I find that she's Xingfu's new signed blogger.

48
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,380
So I'm afraid they're not belittling you,

49
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,460
but abandoning you.

50
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:11,620
Sorry, the number you dialed is busy.
Please dial again later.

51
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,460
Sorry, the number you dialed...

52
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,100
Impossible. How can he ignore my call?

53
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,140
Give it up. Let off yourself.

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,060
Why did she come?

55
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,819
No wonder I saw a sneaky guy in my garden.

56
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,740
Did she bully you?

57
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,900
Their roles are upside down.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,038
Stop your bullet comments.

59
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,239
Go to send it to them.

60
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,220
Yes, madam.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,020
I indeed thought I bullied her.

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,999
Always when the leading lady is softhearted,

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,340
the villain will assume great airs.

64
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,078
Who says I'm the leading role?

65
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,460
Maybe in Xia Zhi's sight, I'm the villain.

66
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,020
Are you okay?

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,540
Actually, I seemed to
understand her a little just now.

68
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,078
We started from the same level.

69
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,940
Besides, no matter in the field
of love, career and study,

70
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,860
she works even harder than me.

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm just luckier than her.

72
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,100
Anyhow, isn't it the unfair part?

73
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,580
So how could I blame her?

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,620
Do you know why you're the leading role?

75
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,740
It's because you're able
to reflect on yourself, not like her.

76
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,398
In the world, most people

77
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,558
would like to take the credit
for themselves when they succeed,

78
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:14,759
but blame others when they fail.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,780
So does she.

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,620
But you're not like them.

81
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,719
You'll dread when you succeed

82
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,599
while reflecting on yourself when you fail.

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,020
That's why you're the leading role.

84
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:30,639
Why can you think so deeply?

85
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,220
Because I've studied pretty hard recently.

86
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,740
Let's go inside.

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,479
Whether it'll be tested or not,
she's read them all.

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,118
She has learning enthusiasm.

89
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,518
Then you need to work hard

90
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,479
otherwise, you can't catch up with her.

91
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,838
Of course, I will.

92
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,660
I've had a strong sense of crisis
since we're together.

93
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:55,639
What about keeping pace with Professor Zhuang

94
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,039
to get a doctorate or be a professor?

95
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,439
Is it amazing?

96
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,479
If I want, I can be at once.

97
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,780
Anyhow, I don't have that ambition.

98
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,919
What do you mean by that?

99
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,639
An old pedant may not
complete my job better than me.

100
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,639
My job also has deep meanings.

101
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,740
I agree.

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,639
Nice to meet you.

103
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,100
Nice to meet you too. I'm Zhuang Yu.

104
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,159
I didn't introduce myself properly
to you at Meiren's home last time.

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,599
Well, don't misunderstand me.

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,518
You're a young and handsome scholar.
I've heard a lot about you.

107
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,580
Have a seat.

108
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,558
Oh, come on.

109
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,278
You haven't met again since last time?

110
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,759
Because I separate my job and life quite well.

111
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,700
I hope you can appreciate my work,
not my private life.

112
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,118
By the way, I find a good place

113
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,180
so would you like to join us?

114
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,518
I have a presentiment.

115
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,100
What?

116
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,820
The males are going to vie with each other.

117
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,159
Male competition?

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,580
I like it!

119
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:15,380
First is to show his strength,

120
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,260
which means he's able to support a family.

121
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,140
Weather signals!

122
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,798
They're not only signals but also lights.

123
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,479
When you broadcast forecasts,

124
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,039
you don't need to tell them one by one.

125
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,020
Folks will know as the lights are on.

126
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,020
You're really attentive.

127
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,719
Love means giving her the best.

128
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,700
Only a petty thing.

129
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,580
What a bossy tone!

130
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,020
There's a microphone here!

131
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,078
All folks! Attention, please!

132
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,260
It's a happy sunny day today!

133
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,879
It's Jian Tao's PR.

134
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,580
It's fine. Take it easy.

135
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,980
Professor Zhuang. No.

136
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,020
It troubles Master Zhuang a lot.

137
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,900
It's nothing.

138
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,380
After all, love means giving her the best.

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,300
- Let's go.
- You, please.

140
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,860
What's going on?

141
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,678
They start to show their abilities.

142
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,199
Why does no one talk?

143
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,180
Because you're just here.

144
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,158
I didn't know we're at the same age.

145
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,279
Thanks to Meiren.

146
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,820
She made me know you.

147
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,999
She tells me you're young and promising.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,540
You're busy with your career at college

149
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,900
so it's common for you
knowing little about our school.

150
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,558
Of course.

151
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,060
I can't be compared with
Professor Zhuang in academic aspect.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,918
Anyway, I went to learn it
for a few days that year.

153
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,180
And, luckily, I got full grade points

154
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,598
and was granted the first class scholarship.

155
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,780
But, forget it. Everything had gone.

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,060
Unfortunately, I went to study
in Yale with Mr. Zhong

157
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,460
so I missed your
brilliant appearance on the rostrum.

158
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,678
Slow down.

159
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,038
It's right.

160
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,999
As you're born in a wealthy family,

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,340
you can devote yourself to your study.

162
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,358
By the way, I once made contact with Jian Tao

163
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,399
and I found it's quite a stringent firm.

164
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,660
I'm afraid your
growth environment may be similar.

165
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,180
Be cautious, Meiren.

166
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,260
It's our own business.

167
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,100
Maybe I could do something to help you.

168
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,999
Last time, when I went to your firm,

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,798
I incidentally knew
you're busy contacting Jian Tao.

170
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,980
Supplying goods is not an easy job.

171
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,100
Meanings are far more than individual interests.

172
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,220
So I mentioned it to her in passing.

173
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,060
Let me drink a toast to you by tea in place of wine.

174
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,620
Thank you

175
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,020
for working hard to vitalize our villages.

176
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,740
Meinan, let me go to send it.

177
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,700
I can go to send it. Take your time.

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,038
Meiren, let him go.

179
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,598
Let's drink a toast.

180
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,700
Come on. Where's yours?

181
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,500
Perfect bliss.

182
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,540
Hold on!

183
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,580
I brought some crabs.

184
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,580
- Meinan?
- Come here!

185
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,669
- Come in!
- Come here!

186
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,999
- Tiantian.
- I went to get a chair.

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,900
Grandma.

188
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,999
Let's dine together.

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,519
- Have a seat!
- Well, I...

190
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,199
- Have a seat.
- Sit down.

191
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,759
Let me see what they are.

192
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,279
I got several big crabs for you in particular.

193
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,620
I love it!

194
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,180
[Ant Forest]

195
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,020
Zhuang Yu! You stole my points!

196
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,519
Why did you...

197
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,589
Wow. You get up so early today.

198
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,479
Hui, why did you come?

199
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,199
My mom and I come
to see her future daughter-in-law.

200
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,598
I see. You can go first.

201
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,558
Don't forget to play with me when you're free.

202
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,300
Well, you're her future daughter-in-law.

203
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,540
Take it easy.

204
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,439
She comes to inspect the supplement here.

205
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,940
As she knows I'm here,
come to see me in passing.

206
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:03,999
Actually, the gardens are quite far from here...

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,639
Not that in passing...

208
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,918
Don't you want to play with me?

209
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,759
No! I want!

210
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,718
Of course, I want.

211
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:15,380
But I suddenly feel dizzy...

212
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,558
Zhuang Yu, just leave me here.

213
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,759
You two can go to see your mother first.

214
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,639
Let me rest for a while.

215
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,158
A pompous performance.

216
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,660
What? I can't hear it.

217
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,519
My head and ears all feel uncomfortable.

218
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,879
I'll go to inspect the folk customs first.

219
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,180
Call me when you're fine.

220
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,180
Are you still dizzy?

221
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,980
Weren't you energetic
when you were yelling at me?

222
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,860
Oh, yeah!

223
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,158
I was angry about it!

224
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,580
Work and rest like an elder
to steal my energy points?

225
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,420
You feel better now?

226
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,700
Are you unhappy?

227
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,300
You stole my points.

228
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,900
Energy points belong to early birds

229
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,660
but I belong to you.

230
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,199
A lovers' tree! When did you plant it?

231
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,798
You mentioned it
when you gave me renovation costs.

232
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:46,700
Don't you remember?

233
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,900
But I remembered you didn't agree that day.

234
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,399
We can't plant a spruce...
no, a populus diversifolia!

235
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,660
Do you feel better now?

236
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,759
I'm not unhappy.

237
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,798
It's too sudden.

238
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,399
I'm not ready to see her.

239
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,279
More sudden than mine?

240
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,478
It's different.

241
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,660
That wasn't real.

242
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,460
As it's real now,

243
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,639
of course, you should meet her.

244
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,220
Jin Xi said she's not amiable.

245
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,478
You enthralled my son and
beat out of a spokesperson's job?

246
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,839
I didn't...

247
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,358
Please trust me.

248
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,540
I...

249
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,220
Is it enough for you to leave my son?

250
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,678
You can be confident and add more.

251
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,718
Besides, she's not like that.

252
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,718
Oh, yes.

253
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:01,718
She's not only a noblewoman
but also a bossy president.

254
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:02,718
Your name.

255
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,919
Yu... Yu Meiren.

256
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,879
Age.

257
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,958
27.

258
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,999
We don't need a girl who's over 25.

259
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,519
Aunt... No... President!

260
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,679
I'm a doctor.

261
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,919
I was over the age when I graduated.

262
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,838
Doctor? What's your job?

263
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,559
I was a make-up blogger.

264
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,078
Sometimes advertise for brands.

265
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,838
Besides, I'm a part-time tutor at college.

266
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,358
No stable income.

267
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,838
Though I don't have a stable income,

268
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,460
I promise I'll work harder and harder.

269
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,279
Next one.

270
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,879
President! No!

271
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,039
Please trust me!

272
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,238
I'll earn more and more money!

273
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,598
No! Let me off!

274
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,820
She doesn't care about it.

275
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,799
I know.

276
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,318
She must think highly of this.

277
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,620
Yu, ready to eat?

278
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,759
What is that?

279
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,260
Please wait for a while. It's ready soon!

280
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,159
I can cook. That's enough.

281
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,820
I'm so scared!

282
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,100
Calm down.

283
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,759
Don't think too much.

284
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,838
She just likes a young girl like you.

285
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,100
How did she know what I'm like?

286
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,180
She likes whomever I like.

287
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,420
Fine.

288
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:29,620
So what color do you like?

289
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,020
Yellow.

290
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,300
I like whatever you like.

291
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,900
When do I like yellow?

292
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,420
You...

293
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,679
I shared them for I wanted to get a VIP.

294
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,300
They're chosen at random.

295
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,580
Meiren! See! Who's coming?

296
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,919
Maybe we still need some time.

297
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,279
Please hold on.

298
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,060
Okay.

299
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:38,318
I just helped him clean his glasses...

300
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,860
We're cleaning...

301
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,919
Why didn't you lock the door?

302
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,020
She looks quite serious.

303
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:48,300
Does she like yellow?

304
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,860
What about asking her yourself?

305
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,900
Have some tea, please.

306
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,279
Picked in the mountain.

307
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,639
Enjoy yourself.

308
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,540
I don't know whether you can adjust it or not.

309
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,460
Mom.

310
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,140
Aunt, nice to meet you.

311
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,460
Have a seat.

312
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,958
Let me go to add some hot water.

313
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,958
No thanks.

314
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,220
I've just added it.

315
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,118
Making tea needs hot water.

316
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,300
So let me add some more.

317
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,519
What's wrong with you?

318
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,700
You have to face it one day.

319
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,660
Let me do it.

320
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,740
He's so sensible.

321
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,039
I didn't mean you're bad.

322
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,060
You're nice too.

323
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,300
Oh, my! Please stop!

324
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,140
I don't know how to speak now.

325
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,660
Well said.

326
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,919
We were chatting just now.

327
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,540
We think you're predestined.

328
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,958
They've been at the same school since high school.

329
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,140
Now they're together.

330
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,799
She's right.

331
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,279
Meiren has been studying well since childhood.

332
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,220
We have no other way.

333
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,519
It's hard for the kids here to
enter a high school in the town.

334
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,980
Well, Zhuang Yu's grades are better than mine.

335
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,198
So I didn't steal your grades?

336
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,620
How dare I say that now?

337
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,598
Meiren is great. It must be hard for you.

338
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,180
As long as she can live a good life, it's nothing.

339
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,140
Zhuang told me that
you run snack businesses.

340
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,318
Yes.

341
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,300
It's a hard year.

342
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,460
It's not easy to maintain it this year.

343
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,940
Do you need to work from dawn to dusk?

344
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,399
Well, we're lucky.

345
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,700
It's not that hard.

346
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,780
Glad to hear that.

347
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,900
So what about his father?

348
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,820
His father has departed.

349
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,919
Departed? What sad news!

350
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,198
- I shouldn't mention it.
- That's it!

351
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:20,140
I'm very sorry.

352
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,279
Well... My father is responsible
for overseas business...

353
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,919
He's not at home.

354
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,540
Oh, my goodness.

355
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,639
Oh, my!

356
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,438
Oh, my horrible comprehension...

357
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,060
You're too hasty.

358
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,100
It's uneasy for you
to expand a small business abroad.

359
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,500
So Africa?

360
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,900
I hear B&R has some preferential policies.

361
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,220
That's it.

362
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,679
Here you are.

363
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,829
Aunt... I...

364
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,999
Let me pour you some water.

365
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,980
There's still water.

366
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,238
You rude girl. Clean it.

367
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,238
Slow down.

368
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:03,118
Let me go to help Meinan.

369
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,679
- Okay.
- Here you are.

370
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,759
Are you fine?

371
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,598
Come on.

372
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,399
Yu, come out with me.

373
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,180
I want to change clothes.

374
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,399
You're so reckless!

375
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,438
Why did you rob it?

376
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,460
I can help her.

377
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,238
Besides... Oh,
my! What did I say?

378
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,919
- Calm down.
- I'm so rude.

379
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,198
Take it easy.

380
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:33,780
Maybe they need Meiren
to help advertise their small business.

381
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,039
To publicize their goods.

382
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,958
You're right.

383
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,478
Meiren, is that right?

384
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,238
Fortunately, our girl is excellent.

385
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,340
Obviously.

386
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,438
Are you tired?

387
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,660
Come and have a rest.

388
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,620
Thank you.

389
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,599
Your leg can't stand long.

390
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,500
Tired?

391
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:05,199
I'm Iron Man. How can I be tired?

392
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,180
Check it!

393
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,260
Here's what I've done for you.

394
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,478
With Jian Tao, we don't
need to worry about sales.

395
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,999
That's it.

396
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,799
When the payment for these goods arrives,

397
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,780
then I can go back to study.

398
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,300
Well.

399
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,279
You still don't need my help?

400
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,718
Bossy presidents are not popular now.

401
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:27,718
Leading ladies need to be independent.

402
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:28,919
Obsolete so fast?

403
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,300
I still have lots of things to learn.

404
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,958
Throw them away.

405
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:35,700
Now you should learn some masterpieces.

406
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,340
What?

407
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,519
From re-energizing our village!

408
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,078
Let's go back!

409
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,020
Let me get the basket.

410
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,100
It's daytime.

411
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,220
I like it!

412
00:24:56,057 --> 00:25:00,925
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

413
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,460
How are Meiren and her future mother-in-law?

414
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,740
We're kissing! Focus on it, okay?

415
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,699
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

416
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,500
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

417
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,980
Come and sit.

418
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,039
What did she say to you?

419
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,559
Did she dislike me?

420
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,438
Impossible. Don't think too much.

421
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:45,238
Well, let me say something first.

422
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,220
Go ahead.

423
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,599
Thank you for visiting Qingshui Village

424
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,300
and guiding Meiren Homestay.

425
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,519
I mean I hope they could be better and better.

426
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,238
I agree. Cheers!

427
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,660
Thank you for your warm welcome.

428
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,180
That's fine. Cheers!

429
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,718
The juice isn't made by us.

430
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:22,180
I booked it on the internet especially for them.

431
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:25,259
Our village doesn't have it.

432
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,900
- It's too expensive.
- Dad, forget it.

433
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,780
Sorry to trouble you a lot.

434
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,900
That's what we should do.

435
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,838
Aunt.

436
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,039
Can you adjust to country food?

437
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,900
Yes. But I haven't had it for a long time.

438
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,660
Sorry. I have to answer it.

439
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,260
Hello. President Wu.

440
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,500
My secretary has sent
that 100 million contract to your office.

441
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:53,118
Hui.

442
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,820
So what does your family do?

443
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,540
Well, this is our good.

444
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,340
You mean this brand?

445
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,740
Zhuang?

446
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,159
Why didn't you tell me about it?

447
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,159
I've just learned it.

448
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,919
I don't have the time to tell you.

449
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,838
Excuse me.

450
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,519
I'm sure you can't adjust to these poor dishes.

451
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,078
Let's eat in a restaurant.

452
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,860
What do you think of it?

453
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,540
You're so welcome.

454
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:32,820
I can't have such
wonderful country food outside.

455
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,118
Aunt, do you like it too?

456
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,700
Otherwise why does my brother like it?

457
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,260
Come on, Zhuang Hui.

458
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,140
Help yourself to it.

459
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,598
Hui is like his father.

460
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,820
He doesn't like these.

461
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,639
Yu's taste is much more like mine.

462
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,718
That's great. Eat more if you like it.

463
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,020
Try some as it's still hot.

464
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,478
Have some tofu. It's made by ourselves.

465
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,380
Thank you.

466
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,919
I find Zhuang is prudent like you.

467
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,860
He'll have a bright future.

468
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,540
He's right.

469
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,660
He didn't despise you.

470
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,860
Have some meat.

471
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,260
Actually...

472
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,820
he's like neither me nor his dad.

473
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,519
He's quiet and doesn't like socializing.

474
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,300
We were too busy to accompany him.

475
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,260
We thought love was
to give him better material conditions.

476
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,180
Anyhow, we almost cultivated him into a plant.

477
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,279
- Well...
- Plant?

478
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,780
Mom, I'm not that withdrawn...

479
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,718
Really?

480
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,140
Without Meiren,

481
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,620
how could you be like this?

482
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,700
In fact, I noticed his change quite early.

483
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,300
He seldom contacted us before.

484
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,900
But now, he came to ask for our help.

485
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,180
Meiren.

486
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,879
You don't know how I'm gratified at it.

487
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,020
Gratified?

488
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,420
Does the word mean that?

489
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,198
Well, my mom hopes he can live off her

490
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:34,140
so that she could remedy him.

491
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,420
Mom, you're too exaggerated.

492
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:40,279
Don't let them misunderstand.

493
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,580
We didn't.

494
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,799
I mean we all feel that he becomes better.

495
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,300
He's warmer and breezier now.

496
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,980
Is that right?

497
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,700
Just as you like.

498
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,780
At first, I didn't know why.

499
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,660
As soon as I saw Meiren and you,
then I understood.

500
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,438
Only such father and mother

501
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:16,140
can raise up such a brilliant flower.

502
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,078
- Nice!
- You speak so well.

503
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,420
Hui's language proficiency is like my mom's.

504
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,078
So awesome.

505
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,260
He even knows to make fun of me.

506
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,140
Mom, help yourself more.

507
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,500
See. He knows to refill my bowl.

508
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,380
I just asked him what you might like.

509
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,118
I came here in a hurry and I didn't prepare it.

510
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,598
So I want my men to prepare it.

511
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,519
No thanks.

512
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,519
You're too kind.

513
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,780
Yu said you wouldn't care about it.

514
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:06,180
So,
we could never get any useful suggestions from men.

515
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,060
That's it.

516
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,078
So I used my imagination.

517
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,879
I don't know whether you like it or not.

518
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,958
Yes! I like it!

519
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,559
Thank you, aunt.

520
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,519
But when did you fetch it?

521
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,118
I have my own car.

522
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,380
So it's quite convenient.

523
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,318
Come on.

524
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,620
Thank you for raising such a perfect girl.

525
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,958
Zhuang is perfect!

526
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,838
You did a good job!

527
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,598
Hope they have a better future.

528
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,540
Cheers.

529
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,300
Shake your ass!

530
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,198
Why are you like a timid puppy?

531
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,500
Who's a puppy?

532
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,718
I don't know you.

533
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:13,580
How can you?

534
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,380
Oh, my!

535
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,700
Have I become prettier?

536
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,478
We met before.

537
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,759
I asked you the way.

538
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,639
You told me you work in a home-stay.

539
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,039
See! Now I find you.

540
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,718
Who told you?

541
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:34,118
You scared my dog away last time.

542
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,500
You haven't paid it yet.

543
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,380
Do you remember?

544
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,198
You are really a loafer.

545
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,900
Qingshui Village is small.
You don't need to come again.

546
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:46,140
- Why again?
- I know you remember me.

547
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,399
I think the trees here are so nice.

548
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,799
I thought a good farmer
could plant a wonderful tree

549
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,399
as he met a good place.

550
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,340
Right?

551
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:04,718
I think I can find them all here.

552
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:07,958
Audiences like my last video blog here.

553
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,780
They want me to appraise the home-stays here.

554
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:15,039
So I think I should take care of your business.

555
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,060
Am I right?

556
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:20,039
Meiren Homestay.

557
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,838
The name goes well with me.

558
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,159
I decide to live here for a week.

559
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,740
Catch it!

560
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,838
Am I kind?

561
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,358
What's your name? Your WeChat?

562
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,519
I can find you easily when I meet some problems.

563
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,139
No free room today.

564
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,679
The dining hall is booked either.

565
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,198
Haven't you been here last time?

566
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:39,399
You must know here well.

567
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,759
Find another hotel.

568
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,180
What?

569
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,159
Wait for me!

570
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,060
Give me your WeChat! I have so many cases.

571
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,900
Your anxiety was in vain, right?

572
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:59,100
I've never thought
a successful entrepreneur is so amiable.

573
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,660
All my family members are amiable.

574
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,620
But you're not like them.

575
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,980
Then check again.

576
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,999
No impiety to the divine tree!

577
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,260
I still want to make a wish.

578
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,659
Go ahead.

579
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,461
♫ Passing through beams of light ♫

580
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:27,805
♫ Meet the bright weather ♫

581
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,382
♫ Meet someone ♫

582
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,340
I know your wish and
I've made it for you.

583
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,659
You're now cultivating a superior breed

584
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,660
of Artemisia annua which can grow in Africa.

585
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,158
I've found you're busy in your lab

586
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,999
so I wished you could succeed soon.

587
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,940
Cultivate one in Africa.

588
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,420
You know that?

589
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,039
We are working in the same college.

590
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,060
I also know Director Wang and Li.

591
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:06,519
Anyhow, I hope you can
keep on pursuing your dream.

592
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,660
Dunes may be changed by wind

593
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,660
but deserts won't.

594
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,780
So does our love.

595
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,759
The treasure is just in the pyramid.

596
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,220
You've already known it.

597
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,878
But you still need to pay me six sheep.

598
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:29,260
Because I help you make up your mind.

I can give you them all.

602
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,319
Did I guess right?

603
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,220
Is that your wish?

604
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:06,740
No.

605
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,780
So what is it?

606
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,620
My wish is that

607
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,259

621
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,839
Thank you. Be aware of your hands.

622
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,398
You've worked hard.

623
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,319
Miss Meiren.

624
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,878
- Miss Yu.
- Fewer and fewer nets.

625
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,519
Good publicity effects.

626
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,300
That's it, Miss Meiren.

627
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,319
Sir, can we post a paper-cut on the glass wall?

628
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,300
It can protect birds from being bumped.

629
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,060
No! It's so ugly.

630
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,179
I heard that dead birds will bring you bad luck.

631
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,140
You will lose money.

632
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,079
It's our good intention.

633
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,438
If you don't care, just ignore it.

634
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:05,620
Let's go.

635
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:10,100
Wait.

636
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,260
Give it to me.

637
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,580
[To Yu Meiren]

638
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,340
My dear Meiren.

639
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,420
It's the 97th letter that I write to you.

640
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,580
So weird.

641
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:03,100
Though we chat every day,

642
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,300
I still want to tell you so many things.

643
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,580
Endless words.

644
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,500
It's not like me.

645
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,700
Yesterday, I dreamed of the divine tree.

646
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,340
I forebode your wish may come true.

647
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,980
Maybe when you receive the letter,

648
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:28,380
our first experimental seedlings have grown up.

649
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,340
If the experiment can succeed,

650
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,180
it also thanks to Lv Jian.

651
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,180
He went to Alxa to complete the cross-matching.

652
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,438
Also Qi and Ni Ke. They stayed in the lab

653
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:55,940
and completed the gene test.

654
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,020
Sorry.

655
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,820
I started to talk about my study unconsciously.

656
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,900
Let me say something else.

657
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,740
Li finally got married.

658
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,900
He sends me their loving photos to me every day.

659
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:17,180
Yesterday, you said Tiantian and Jin Xi
were preparing for their wedding.

660
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,060
Unfortunately, I have no time to attend it.

661
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,540
So I drew them a picture

662
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:24,380
to express my wish.

663
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,100
I'm waiting for the day
when I can meet you every day.

664
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,700
I miss you.

00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,100
I miss you too.

667
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,420
Has he picked you up?

668
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,999
Yes. I'm already in the car.

669
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,198
Where do you want me to go?

670
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,220
A deluxe feast can't suffice me now.

671
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,460
What? So mysterious.

672
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,638
It's already midnight at your place, right?

673
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,878
Lay down your work.

674
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,620
Go to sleep. Right now.

675
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,079
Yu Zhuang wants to thank, in particular,

676
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,300
the love, care and support from Meiren Yu.

677
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,198
My dear.

678
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,700
Thank you for making me a better person.

679
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,189

♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

728
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,540
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

729
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,900
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

730
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,139
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

731
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,539
♫ You show up in my sight ♫

732
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,419
♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

733
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,780
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

734
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,739
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

735
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,179
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

736
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,179
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

737
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,380
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

738
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,859
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

739
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:02,579
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

740
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,819
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

741
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:13,219
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

742
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:18,219
♫ You make all the stars in the sky shine for me ♫

743
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:23,340
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

744
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,779
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

745
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:34,100
♫ Even the air is filled with the scent of flowers ♫
