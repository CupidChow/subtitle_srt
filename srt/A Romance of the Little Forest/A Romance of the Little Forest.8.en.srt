[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,940
[Episode 08]
[Don't worry. I'll behave.]

24
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:37,985
As soon as Mr. Zhuang came,

25
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:39,847
he said directly that he would look after Mei.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,518
Hearing that, no one dared to say anything.

27
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,660
They were all mute.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,740
How could I miss such a wonderful time?

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,039
You silly boy.

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,679
Why didn't you record it?

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,999
But I'm now bringing you back to the scene.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,420
By such acting skills?

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,459
Why are you laughing?

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,719
It's all your fault!

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,819
If you hadn't asked me to the county town,

36
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,719
how could I have missed her critical moment?

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,180
I thought I couldn't hear his promise
until they get married.

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,580
I've never thought
they could be together so rapidly.

39
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,620
We should blame their speed.

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,719
- Calm down.
- I'm a little emotional now.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,198
Anyway,
Meinan's words make me find that

42
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,159
Zhuang really loves Mei. Is that right?

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,119
You could be at ease now, right?

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,758
Of course. Who can hurt such a cute girl?

45
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,540
Good morning.

46
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,940
You're all here to praise me?

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,558
Not you, but your boyfriend.

48
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,180
Your praise was up to him.

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,478
Sit down and tell us some details.

50
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,799
What happened yesterday?

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,918
I'll tell you when I'm back.

52
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,180
He's waiting for me now.

53
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:03,519
Her breakfast is still here!

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,500
Love is a mystery.

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,159
You should learn from her more.

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,719
How sweet they are!

57
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,820
If you could learn a little from her,
you've already been with Tiantian.

58
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:18,380
Don't make fun of me, mom.

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,638
Why are you so bashful?

60
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,439
So gutless!

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,118
He's so numb just like you!

62
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,918
Why did you start to blame me all of a sudden?

63
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,460
Numb like me?

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,700
Fortunately, Mei is like me.

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,278
She's a smart and pretty sweetie.

66
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:38,038
Right. Her advantages are like yours.

67
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,029
To be honest, Meinan.

68
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,859
Nearly thousands of people in Qingshui Village

69
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,820
were enchanted by your mom.

70
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,340
Oh, come one. Are there so many people here?

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,758
Put it down. It's Mei's favorite.

72
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,940
They're her midnight snacks.

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,079
Don't try to take it.

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
It should be had together with her snacks.

75
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,580
Mom, you show partiality to her too much.

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,140
Am I free from any bias now?

77
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,180
Professor Zhuang.

78
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,140
Professor Zhuang, I'm here.

79
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:30,060
You look quite energetic today.

80
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,460
I was more energetic 10 minutes ago.

81
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,100
I thought we came to an agreement
about the time yesterday.

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,798
But one minute late.

83
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,500
Well, my remedy is to speed up.

84
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,319
I haven't deceived you, right?

85
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,420
It's a nearly unknown shortcut to the mountain.

86
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,580
I didn't know that we would come here
so I didn't take too many things.

87
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,099
You have a large bag

88
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,599
so you should have brought
some mosquito repellent, right?

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,180
We're here to observe the pollination of plants.

90
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,958
But it's not today. Please give me.

91
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,039
So I didn't take it with me.

92
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,940
Fine, forget it.

93
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,820
It should be a sacrifice to science.

94
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,700
Fortunately, I didn't learn botany.

95
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,700
What's the matter?

96
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,620
So things develop differently
as we're in the mountain?

97
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,620
My garment wants to have no lipstick print.

98
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,798
Good people won't do one-half favor.

99
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,518
Could you lend me your suit?

100
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,740
You see.

101
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,620
Oh, I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:12,118
Don't worry. It's a waterproof one today.

103
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,340
Leaves no print.

104
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,540
That's better. Let's go.

105
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,020
Professor Zhuang.

106
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,980
You can't tie?

107
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,719
It suits you.

108
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,700
Really? I also think the color suits me.

109
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,660
Fisherman's knot?

110
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:15,199
Professor Zhuang, please be frank.

111
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,460
How can you taunt me deliberately?

112
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,599
I was almost confused by his face.

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,238
Fisherman's knot is not complex.

114
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,220
I can tie 10 knots in a minute!

115
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,789
So when can Tiantian and you...

116
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,780
Mom.

117
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,820
Is your memory failing recently?

118
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,820
What do you mean?

119
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,519
You've said it half an hour ago.

120
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,179
If you want me to keep quiet,
go to marry Tiantian!

121
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,860
Aunt, are you calling me?

122
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:57,039
No. It's Meinan. He's looking for you.

123
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,039
Come and have some oranges.

124
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,380
Sit and chat.

125
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,798
What's wrong? Where's Mei?

126
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,140
I've brought her some grapes.

127
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,078
She went to meet Mr. Zhuang.
They went out to date.

128
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,719
Don't mix them together.

129
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,140
What do you mean by "date"?

130
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,820
Cool dude.

131
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,439
Though a sunshine young boy like you is popular,

132
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,518
because of showing up too late,

133
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,879
you could only miss her
and be the secondary lead.

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,719
Meinan, what do you think?

135
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,798
Secondary lead?

136
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,639
Professor Zhuang is too dull

137
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,599
so how can he be the leading actor?

138
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,558
By the way, Meiren is elder than you

139
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,759
but why is her nickname cuter than you?

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,060
Because a man should be mature.

141
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,589
I should protect her like an elder brother.

142
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,159
Don't care about the nickname and age.

143
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,478
Nice declaration.

144
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:52,798
Hamesome, although I support their love,

145
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,589
I still want to suggest you enhance
your existence as the secondary lead.

146
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,099
No secondary lead, please.

147
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,038
Won't you go to Maldives?

148
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,079
No. It's more interesting here.

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,099
You start to act?

150
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,179
Ambitious boy.

151
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,199
Because I boasted about
what I could do yesterday.

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,340
So I have to work for the fake male lead today.

153
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,279
Aren't you good at tying knots?

154
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,180
Why is your shoelace loose?

155
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,420
Wow, it's a magpie.

156
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,319
So?

157
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,279
A good omen.

158
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,220
Things will be smooth today.

159
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,780
Then what about that?

160
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,158
Just a crow.

161
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,238
There are almost 25 types of corvidae.

162
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:19,679
Every black bird can be called a "crow".

163
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,980
You know quite a lot.

164
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,300
I learned it from online slang.

165
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,820
All these meanings are granted by humans.

166
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:33,918
That's why the innocent creatures
suffer from the mishap.

167
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,500
We shouldn't let it happen.

168
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,469
I shouldn't have said that.

169
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:42,827
For nature,
the most ominous is humanity.

170
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,380
You're right.

171
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,484
Watch out.

172
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,580
Qing?

173
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,579
You know it?

174
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,260
Yes. I always came here to inspect...

175
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,439
the location for vlogs.

176
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,798
I could always find it
and Zaocys dhumnades.

177
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,918
Zaocys dhumnades looks pretty when it's small.

178
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,619
Quite ordinary after growing up.

179
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,140
It's adverse to me.

180
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,558
Yu Meinan showed you my childhood photos, right?

181
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,959
Forget them.

182
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,820
Just remember my present look.

183
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,540
I can't yield to him.

184
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,660
I found no difference.

185
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,029
Let's go.

186
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,420
If it's late, then we can't make it back.

187
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,118
It's hard to walk here.

188
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,340
Be cautious.

189
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,959
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Don't worry.

190
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,100
I'm tired so I choose to sit on the ground.

191
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,319
Nice sweeping movement.

192
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,439
Remember to be careful.

193
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,340
Otherwise I can't explain to Meiren later on.

194
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,140
Got it!

195
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,940
By the way.

196
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,238
Which one do you choose,
Professor Zhuang or that young lad?

197
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,029
But Professor Zhuang has
already been her boyfriend, right?

198
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,699
Whom else can I choose?

199
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,158
Sounds reasonable.

200
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,980
Anyhow, there are many tricks
for the sunshine boy to be prime.

201
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,118
The thoughtful behaviors behind his tricks

202
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:16,060
are what the cold hero lacks.

203
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,060
This kind of hero is always a cold fish.

204
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,060
I'm exhausted.

205
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,639
I must haven't exercised for a long time.

206
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,238
Otherwise, how can I be so tired now?

207
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,260
Professor Zhuang, lend me your shoulder...

208
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,340
To lean on.

209
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,220
Forget it. Let's move on.

210
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,300
It's jequirity!

211
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,740
Red beans grow in southern land.

212
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,759
One-third of its seed is black.

213
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,740
As it's wholly red, it should be Adenanthera.

214
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,260
I thought it's a joint name.

215
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,859
They're from different subfamilies.

216
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,759
You're misled by Wang Wei.

217
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,039
I'm just talking to a wall.

218
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,580
If Wang Wei were alive, you would make him mad.

219
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,539
He might act like an old man.

220
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,740
Thermos?

221
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,860
Chinese wolf-berry? Hot water?

222
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,660
You might have a common language with my father.

223
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,179
Drinking hot water
can promote sweat evaporating.

224
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,959
It can relieve summer-heat.

225
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,319
Really?

226
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,420
Besides...

227
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,140
I don't have an adult daughter like you.

228
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,140
But sometimes his consideration is touching.

229
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,260
Here you are. You're the control group.

230
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,798
GENKI FOREST!

231
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,839
You still remember my favorite flavor!

232
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,678
The store has no change.

233
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,620
We all pay online so how can you get the change?

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,060
The machine was broken.

235
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,660
Did you buy it especially for me?

236
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,420
It's going to rain. Put on the raincoat.

237
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,700
Thanks. You're so sweet.

238
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,979
But don't ignore the rival in love.

239
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,759
The greatest advantage is that
he knows to use his outgoing personality

240
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,540
to conquer the people around her.

241
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,500
Aunt Wang, time to go home?

242
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,918
That's our orchard and
here's the tea garden.

243
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,079
Thanks for showing me around. Thank you so much.

244
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,798
You're so welcome. Thanks.

245
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,279
It's on the way to my home.

246
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,519
By the way, as it's hot recently,

247
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,660
take it with you to prevent from summer-heat.

248
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,598
How can I take it, Lv?

249
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,599
We're not strangers.

250
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,279
As we've lived together for days,

251
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,639
I've treated you as my family.

252
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,759
Okay. Thank you.

253
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,639
Fine. You can walk around as you want. Take care.

254
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,220
- I see. Take care.
- Bye.

255
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,279
Miss Tiantian, you really know a lot.

256
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,718
You're really a master of love.

257
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,679
You're still too young.

258
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,860
You could know it after watching more TV series.

259
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,540
In conclusion,

260
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,900
Professor Zhuang can't let down his guard.

261
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,340
Many girls like romance with younger men.

262
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,279
Miss Tian, do you also support it?

263
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,439
Of course.

264
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,709
So what do you think of...

265
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,859
Besides that,

266
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,779
I still support stories
between mature men and young ladies,

267
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,799
two brave girls and intimate boys.

268
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,958
I love them all.

269
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,238
As long as actors and stories are nice,

270
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,460
then nothing I can't endure.

271
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,780
Wait. Except for bossy men.

272
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,380
Their stories are out of date.

273
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,100
Come in.

274
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,620
President Jin.

275
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,100
- Good news.
- Did you find her?

276
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,559
How could that identical portrait find nothing?

277
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,438
- Tell me. Where?
- What are you talking about?

278
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,039
Not that.

279
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,299
See. Yu Meiren's latest vlog!

280
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,820
Likes, remarks and views are over 10 thousands.

281
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,838
- Yu Meiren?
- That's it.

282
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,559
Her new village vlog was in a grape garden.

283
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,399
Her bestie in the village showed up with her.

284
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,919
Viewers remarked her bestie was quite unique.

285
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,020
Enough.

286
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,740
I told you to find my Fairy,

287
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,420
not a rural girl.

288
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,980
Go to work first.

289
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,420
Okay.

290
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,580
Over 10 thousand...

291
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,220
My success will come back to me soon.

292
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,220
Hi, I'm Mermaid With Long Legs.

293
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:34,958
I'm Li Tiantian.

294
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,180
We're in her grape garden.

295
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,438
Here's my yard.

296
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:44,109
Let's introduce the grapes here first.

297
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,499
My grapes are very sweet.

298
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,599
Fairy?

299
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,598
No pesticides. They're all green.

300
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,799
You can bring your dad and mom

301
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,180
or your kids to play here at weekends.

302
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,860
Someone picked them.

303
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,540
It seems they're collected a few days ago.

304
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,060
I've never thought
they also came to a remote area.

305
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,118
It seems there are some
Artemisia annuas near the cave.

306
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,279
It's hard to climb up so no one should go there.

307
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,340
Let's go.

308
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,020
Let's go and come back quickly.

309
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,660
Wait a second.

310
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,820
Professor Zhuang, are you scared?

311
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,940
The way is slippery at the time. Put them on.

312
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,879
Oh, dear. I thought he's changed.

313
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,820
However, he's still the same.

314
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,860
You can't wear it?

315
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,299
See. A beauty can be good with hands too.

316
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,060
Does anyone here mention that?

317
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:27,860
Just confess it, Professor Zhuang.

318
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,660
Let's go.

319
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,500
The phone you're calling is powered off.

320
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:58,260
Call me back as soon as you see it! Hurry!

321
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,919
You don't need to find everywhere

322
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,919
for the tasty grapes are right here for you.

323
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,279
If you love grapes, don't miss them.

324
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,580
You can scan the QR code
to enter my online shop to buy.

325
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,980
Okay.

326
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,020
Goodbye!

327
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,100
[Tiantian's shop]

328
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,559
No wonder she's Fairy.

329
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,820
How cute her shop name is!

330
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,718
I can not only help the village
but also repay her.

331
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,020
I'm so great!

332
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,479
Tiantian.

333
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,540
Thank you.

334
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,100
Meinan.

335
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,879
Nothing of Qingshui Village is bad,

336
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,589
except the transportation.

337
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,619
Few businessmen come here to buy grapes.

338
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,900
Such delicious grapes
can only stay in the field.

339
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,220
Don't worry. I can buy them.

340
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,358
You really deserve my feeding!

341
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,700
My care is not in vain.

342
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,060
Feeding?

343
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,460
Who is it?

344
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,700
What?

345
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,860
Ten, hundred, thousand...

346
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,860
Two thousand catties!

347
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,820
Am I dreaming?

348
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,759
I even can't feel the pain now.

349
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,519
Did he make it wrong?

350
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,598
You can ask him.

351
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,349
You're right.

352
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,358
I'm afraid of the poor shipment of 2000 catties.

353
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,500
Could the seller deliver the grapes herself?

354
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,620
He mentioned 2000 catties himself.

355
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,039
Look at his name. I'm Handsome.

356
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,700
Not a decent name.

357
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,718
Is he a bad guy?

358
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,340
If so, what does he want?

359
00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:00,279
The sum of all grapes
we can collect is about 500 catties.

360
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,620
Not enough.

361
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,039
Let's go to ask our villagers.

362
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,279
Okay.

363
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,718
Go!

364
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:11,580
Come on!

365
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,838
You see. It's nearly secluded.

366
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,159
Our destination is right there.

367
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,340
Faster than I thought.

368
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,159
We still can go faster.

369
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,460
Have you seen that cave?

370
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,198
Let's have a competition.

371
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:50,540
The winner can let the other fulfill a wish.

372
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,220
I win.

373
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,500
Let's deal. Don't forget my wish.

374
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,300
Naive.

375
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,399
You know me so well.

376
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,958
I'm a naive girl.

377
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,740
Let me think of the wish.

378
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,660
Can you conjure?

379
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,820
Finished.

380
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,198
So fast. What is it?

381
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,340
Sichuan Opera face.

382
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,980
What do you mean?

383
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,900
Oh, no.

384
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,519
Are you hungry? Have some snacks.

385
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,879
I got them at the baby's one-month birth party.

386
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,879
They're all unopened.

387
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,220
I brought them back for no waste.

388
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,620
Shall I conjure for you?

389
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Look at there.

390
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,700
Good magic.

391
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,039
Professor Zhuang.

392
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,620
I think your smile should be semi-permanent.

393
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,380
I think it won't stop in a while.

394
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,140
Well...

395
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,980
Sir, wait for me!

396
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,820
Thank you.

397
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,860
It's over.

398
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,838
Didn't the forecast say no rain today?

399
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,039
Why is it thundering now?

400
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,438
Let's go home now.

401
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,620
Let's go.

402
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,718
So weird. There was
no rainstorm prediction this morning.

403
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:11,679
Why does it rain so heavily in a sudden?

404
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,140
How long will it last?

405
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,119
Rainfall is over 50 milliliters.

406
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,759
It might cause mud-rock flow.

407
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,140
Mud-rock flow? What should we do?

408
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,860
Let's go back after collecting them.

409
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,479
They're not at early bud stage.

410
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,060
We can't pick now.

411
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,100
I'll explore the way first.

412
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,100
No, you can't!

413
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,860
I'm scared so let's go together.

414
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,740
Let me first.

415
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,580
It's too slippery.

416
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,100
Here you are.

417
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,700
Well-prepared! Professor Zhuang.

418
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:59,740
Fully equipped.

419
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,219
Follow me.

420
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,060
Every step must be firm.

421
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,799
What's the matter?

422
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,900
I seemly lost my contact lens.

423
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,860
It's better now. Let's go.

424
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,079
It's dangerous to walk in the mountains
in heavy rain.

425
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,860
There would be landslides.

426
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,140
The cave is tidy and flat.

427
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,620
Shall we leave when it abates?

428
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:02,540
Okay. Sorry for being your burden.

429
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,958
It's the most feasible choice.

430
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,140
None of your fault.

431
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,780
Let me make a phone call.

432
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,340
Powered off.

433
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,380
Here you are. Don't let your family worry.

434
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,260
Tiantian, it's Zhuang Yu's phone.

435
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,318
It's raining now
so it's unsuitable to go downhill.

436
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,279
We'll go back when the rain eases off.

437
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,039
Tell my parents that I'll
stay overnight at your home.

438
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,380
Otherwise they'll worry.

439
00:29:56,959 --> 00:30:00,159
They move on at triple speed.

440
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,829
I must conserve this message.

441
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,619
Using the same phone

442
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,300
means it's a significant part
to improve their love.

443
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,879
Miss Tiantian, what triple speed?

444
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,099
What love?

445
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,540
They're on the mountain?

446
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,589
Nothing. I'm watching a new play on Youku.

447
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,700
Triple speed is a new function.

448
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,460
Mei doesn't want her parents to worry.

449
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,478
Please don't tell her parents.

450
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:31,438
No hazard on Qingshui Mountain.

451
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:35,118
Besides, Professor Zhuang
is with her. Don't worry.

452
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,020
It's precarious now. I have to go to find them.

453
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,519
You've fallen in love with the wrong one.

454
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,420
Hope that a nice girl can warm your heart.

455
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,420
Professor Zhuang! Miss Meiren!

456
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:59,020
Miss Meiren! Professor Zhuang!

457
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,460
Miss Meiren!

458
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,380
Professor Zhuang!

459
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,180
Professor Zhuang! Miss Meiren!

460
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,260
A boar?

461
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,039
It's a ship biscuit.

462
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,318
It seems small but can fulfill your stomach.

463
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,559
Don't eat too fast.

464
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,700
Thank you.

465
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:52,820
The snacks you gave me are enough.

466
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,198
Only a few snacks.

467
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,860
How can you be full? Have a bite.

468
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,159
Sleeping bag?

469
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,300
You've prepared in advance.

470
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,438
Everything needs a plan B.

471
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,580
Plan B?

472
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:24,260
Have you already prepared to sleep with...

473
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,540
Please look at the bag carefully.

474
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:42,399
It's eiderdown.

475
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,140
Quite expensive? It's sturdy.

476
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,380
It's a single sleeping bag.

477
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,820
Maybe it can contain two people.

478
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,900
I... I think it's
a little small.

479
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,820
You can sleep it alone. You're welcome.

480
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,919
I'll sleep here.

481
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,159
Calm down. I'll behave.

482
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,980
I won't touch you.

483
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,820
Be good?

484
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:32,940
That kind of thing won't happen again.

485
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,700
Why do you still bear me a grudge?

486
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,519
I didn't drink too much today.

487
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,340
It's not easy to see that performance again.

488
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,540
- Here?
- Yes.

489
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,420
It's for you to prevent
from the print, not the dust.

490
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,919
What a hypocritical man!

491
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,399
I thought he was concerned about me.

492
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,660
He only cares about his coat.

493
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,478
How can you be like this?

494
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:05,180
You can refuse to lend me the coat
but why do you grab my place?

495
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,780
Go to sleep.

496
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,860
For me?

497
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,700
What's going on?

498
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,780
Enter the sleeping bag.

499
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,900
Fine.

500
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,140
Thank you.

501
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,740
Professor Zhuang.

502
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,740
Thank you for your sleeping bag.

503
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,380
Is it hard for you to sit on the ground?

504
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,140
It's okay.

505
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,479
Are you cold?

506
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,580
No.

507
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,700
Can you sleep now?

508
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,860
No.

509
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,340
Is it because I...

510
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,839
Maybe you should sleep in it.

511
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,299
I...

512
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Because you've kept talking with me.

513
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,958
Professor Zhuang.

514
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:30,100
Will you leave alone when the rain abates?

515
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,340
No.

516
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,940
I'll pick up my sleeping bag.

517
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:51,180
I...

518
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,539
Go to sleep.

00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,399

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,639
Hey, Xiaoai.

549
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,878
I'm here.

550
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:55,020
Play my favorite music.

551
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,100
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

552
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,939
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

553
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:28,019
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

554

♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

558
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,980
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

559
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,819
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

560
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,259
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

561
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,259
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

562
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,460
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

563
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,820

564

570
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,700

00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:19,260
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

581
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,659
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

582
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:30,020
