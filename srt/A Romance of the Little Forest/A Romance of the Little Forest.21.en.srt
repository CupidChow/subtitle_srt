00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,239
You're welcome.

188
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,718
Did you do it on purpose?

189
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,159
You asked me to knock this piece.

190
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,558
Why is that?

191
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,598
It's not you lost.

192
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,639
I lost.

193
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,440
Do you still want to play this?

194
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,639
Then hurry up.

195
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,199
I want to see it at night

196
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,238
if your prediction is accurate or not.

197
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,520
Don't worry about that.

198
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,199
- Hello?
- This guy again?

199
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,320
What does Miss Meiren like to eat?

200
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,439
Why do you ask?

201
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,399
I'm at the restaurant.

202
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,158
It's the right time for dinner.

203
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,718
I'm thinking about
bringing some food to her.

204
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,280
No.

205
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,598
I happen to be going to see her today.

206
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,558
I'll just bring her.

207
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,558
No need to bother you.

208
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,200
It's okay, it won't bother me.

209
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,840
Would she like sashimi?

210
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:29,880
No.

211
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:31,440
I should bring her some hot ones.

212
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:34,319
This one, please.

213
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,799
Sure.

214
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,400
This plot is not quite right.

215
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,519
Miss Tiantian.

216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,118
You know what has happened.

217
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:46,150
What have Zhuang Yu done?

218
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,478
If he were the hero,
he must be scolded by the audience.

219
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,559
Are you sure you are shipping the right couple?

220
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:54,400
I'll give you a new solution to the problem.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,159
Maybe...

222
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm the real hero.

223
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,558
Who is this?

224
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,879
Why does he always call my girlfriend?

225
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,199
What are you talking about?

226
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,960
Nothing.

227
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,000
In the future,
you have your own business.

228
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,798
I won't mind if there is a reason.

229
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,839
And as for me,
if I have a reason I can't tell,

230
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
please don't mind.

231
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,199
Are you threatening me?

232
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,519
You can't be jealous of anyone.

233
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,710
He is wooing my bestie,
and asking for help from me.

234
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,879
Originally,
I think he is not the right match.

235
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,959
The female lead only has the male lead
in her heart,

236
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,639
and treats him like a little brother.

237
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,880
And the supporting actor
must be very warm and sweet, right?

238
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,598
But now it seems that with
the male lead being a jerk,

239
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,918
the supporting actor has his chance.

240
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,960
I'm all ears.

241
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,840
The only advantage of a younger man is

242
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,239
he is warm and sweet.

243
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,840
Warm... and sweet?

244
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,639
What's more valuable is that

245
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,478
he is also handsome, rich and devoted.

246
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,719
He is young, strong and healthy.

247
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,239
Healthy?

248
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,639
I don't mean that you are not healthy.

249
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,999
Look at this!

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,039
So sturdy.

251
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:23,000
But you can't call him handsome boy.

252
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,598
It's a nickname.

253
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,439
He is certainly not as handsome as you.

254
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,358
And in this storyline of mine,

255
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,439
there are not so many male characters,

256
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,679
you're my only male lead.

257
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,119
Magic.

258
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,798
And,

259
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,359
I won't be afraid
even if there are other male characters.

260
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:01,999
That's right, you don't have to.

261
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,280
You're in good health after all.

262
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,399
Let's go.

263
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,918
Whoever loses stands treat.

264
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,880
I'll invite you to dinner.

265
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,759
So, let's grab a bite.

266
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,759
Chinese or Western food?

267
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,678
Western food.

268
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,200
Seafood or steak?

269
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,159
Steak, well done.

270
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,598
Salad or hot soup.

271
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,279
I don't like to eat grass.

272
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,479
Hot soup.

273
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,320
What kind of dessert you want?

274
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,080
The sweeter, the better. Anything.

275
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,519
But we said to grab a
bite... I have to see my...

276
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,960
You don't need to care about Yu Mei...

277
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,478
Mermaid With...

278
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,718
What's your bestie's online name?

279
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,798
Mermaid With Long Legs.

280
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,639
Yeah.

281
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,718
Look at her online name.

282
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,918
Mermaid With Long Legs.

283
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,879
Look at you.

284
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,519
You're so skinny. Let's go.

285
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,678
You need to have a good meal.

286
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,719
Are you sure she will be okay?

287
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
I've checked the horoscope.

288
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:04,838
With the laminator I picked
to keep her company,

289
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,800
everything will be alright.

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,599
♫ Holding an umbrella with you ♫

291
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,439
♫ Feeling very warm ♫

292
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:29,560
♫ I didn't even notice
the rain soaking half of me ♫

293
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,439
♫ Dark clouds are blown away ♫

294
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,640
♫ Time is also very slow ♫

295
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,958
♫ The sunlight shed a circle of light ♫

296
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,839
OCD.

297
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,999
♫ I run hard towards you ♫

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,078
♫ Lift my head and breathe hard ♫

299
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,000
Happy Chinese Valentine's Day.

300
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:57,999
♫ I won't hesitate even if it's a big storm ♫

301
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,239
♫ The wind quietly blows across the sky
after the rain ♫

302
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,799
♫ You stand in the wind
and look at the rainbow ♫

303
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,639
♫ The whole view in my eyes ♫

304
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,039
♫ It is not as good as
the moment you look back ♫

305
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,800
♫ The wind quietly blows across the sky
after the rain ♫

306
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,559
Put it at the door.

307
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,599
♫ I'm moved by you
even when I stand in the wind ♫

308
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,520
♫ See how clear your eyes are ♫

309
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:30,040
Can't you let me immerse myself
in the sad atmosphere for a while?

310
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:31,959
I'm coming.

311
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,239
It's been a long time.

312
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,358
Miss Meiren.

313
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,359
Why are you here?

314
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,319
No need to change shoes, just come in.

315
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,639
Why didn't you turn on the light?

316
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,519
It's bad for your eyes.

317
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,118
I was sleeping.

318
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,679
I didn't expect it to be so late.

319
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,000
There are drinks in the fridge,
and also cans of tomatoes.

320
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,399
Don't touch it.

321
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,838
I have a cold.

322
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,319
So as not to infect you.

323
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,400
You have a cold and still wear so little.

324
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,919
You must be hungry not having dinner.

325
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,039
Come.

326
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,438
Miss Tiantian told me
these are your favorites.

327
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,438
These are the specials of that restaurant.

328
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,478
I think they're good.

329
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:44,239
Try it.

330
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,280
Miss Meiren.

331
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,920
Miss Meiren?

332
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,239
So much delicious food.

333
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,838
Here.

334
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,640
Thank you.

335
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,639
Why are your hands so cold?

336
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,959
Warm your hands with this.

337
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,800
How much is it? I'll transfer it to you.

338
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,079
No need.

339
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,358
Money is a small matter.

340
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,279
Look at you.

341
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,199
How can you get recovered by wearing so little
when you're sick?

342
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,520
Did you take your temperature?

343
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:16,559
No fever, right?

344
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,159
It doesn't matter.

345
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,559
You should go now.

346
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,319
Otherwise it really infects you.

347
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,879
I'll go get you a thick coat.

348
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,640
No, I'll go by myself.

349
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,438
By the time I get you the coat,

350
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,760
you have to drink all of this, okay?

351
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,519
Sit.

352
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,199
Thank you, Mrs. Zhong.

353
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,999
After Huaiqing passed away,

354
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,280
we haven't seen each other for years.

355
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,000
It's been six years.

356
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:14,110
Time flies so fast.

357
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:16,880
Here.

358
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,279
Freshly baked pastry.

359
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,040
Try it now.

360
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,680
Okay.

361
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,520
How is it?

362
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,640
Quite...

363
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,279
Quite special.

364
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,199
Thank you, Mrs. Zhong.

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,439
I'm really good at this, right?

366
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,039
Your master, my daughter,
and my granddaughter.

367
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,319
Every time they eat it,
they say it's really good.

368
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,399
They are just afraid that I am too tired.

369
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,799
They never let me do it.

370
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,959
Mrs. Zhong,

371
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,279
it's important to take care of your health.

372
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
As long as the kids love it,
I'm happy to do it.

373
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,799
Every time I see them,

374
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,079
the way they eat with tears in their eyes.

375
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,959
It's worth it even if I am tired.

376
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,799
Unfortunately, I am a diabetic.

377
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,839
I can't eat it.

378
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
That's a shame.

379
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:16,078
Take a few more bites for Mr. Zhong.

380
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:16,640
Okay.

381
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,958
Mrs. Zhong,
how is your health these days?

382
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,439
Good. Very good.

383
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:33,919
My children take good care of me.

384
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,560
I have nothing to worry about.

385
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,359
Come.

386
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,560
Let me take a closer look at you.

387
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,478
You're mature now.

388
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,959
You haven't come back for six years.

389
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,520
Yes.

390
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,719
Six years ago,

391
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:56,160
you and Michael are still young men.

392
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,478
Now you're professor Zhuang.

393
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,719
He is professor Giannandrea.

394
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,359
Did you see him?

395
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,800
Yeah, at the forum.

396
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,399
Michael now has a family of five.

397
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,560
Last month, on his daughter's
One Month's Birthday,

398
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,318
I saw his little girl.

399
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,279
She is chubby and round.

400
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
So cute.

401
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,239
Yu,

402
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,560
you have a girlfriend too, right?

403
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,879
You have so much stuff in your closet.

404
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,520
I only found this suit jacket.

405
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,438
Miss Meiren,
not bad for a fashion blogger.

406
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:42,039
Oversize suit jacket.

407
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,920
Good taste.

408
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:57,880
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,239
What does it mean?

410
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,719
Do you have a fever?

411
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,958
You must have a fever!

412
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,159
Where is your medical kit?

413
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,279
Do you have a thermometer?

414
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,958
I don't have a fever.

415
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,239
I'm even more sober than ever.

416
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,999
What did you mean by that?

417
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,400
You don't need to say sorry to me.

418
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,800
I still can't forget him.

420
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,759
I know.

421
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,239
It doesn't matter.

422
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,559
I'll always be with you.

423
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,478
You know I'm good at messing around.

424
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,999
Do you still remember the Sushi Train?

425
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,318
In fact, I know a lot of things.

426
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:32,919
I can also build small cars,
small planes, yachts as well.

427
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,160
Let me take you out, okay?

428
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,119
Every time I see you,

429
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:47,520
I think about the time we were
in Qingshui Village.

430
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,760
It was a really happy time.

431
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,920
We had a good time every day.

432
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,520
That's right.

433
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:59,319
At that time,
we were so... Just think of Qingshui Village,

434
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,400
I'll think of Zhuang Yu.

435
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,520
Whenever I think of him,

436
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,119
I feel so sad in my heart.

437
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,359
I get it.

438
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:17,679
If you can be happy
when you're not seeing me,

439
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,318
I'll just disappear.

440
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,110
I'll show up when you want to see me.

441
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,880
Lv Jian.

442
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,199
Thank you.

443
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,759
What for?

444
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,350
Remember to eat regularly when I'm away.

445
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,680
Thank you, Mrs. Zhong.

446
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,479
Why did you keep silent?

447
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,439
Look at the sadness in your eyes.

448
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,079
Missing your girlfriend?

449
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,478
How come?

450
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,438
You don't have a girlfriend?

451
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:10,520
Mr. Zhong told me
lots of girls fancied you.

452
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,800
You don't like any of them?

453
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,559
There is nothing else but scientific research

454
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,119
in my life plan.

455
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,839
When master passed away,

456
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,400
there were regrets left in his heart.

457
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,040
I only hope that

458
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,199
what he didn't finish,

459
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,400
I can do it for him.

460
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:54,599
It is good to dedicate yourself to research.

461
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,830
But you still should live a vivid life.

462
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,438
I've eaten here before.

463
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:22,358
They have steak, hot soup and dessert.

464
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,040
Shall I tell you in detail?

465
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,358
What's going on?

466
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,520
Too expensive.

467
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,478
I told you not to save money for me.

468
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:31,919
Not to save you money.

469
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,679
I don't think it's cost-effective.

470
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,238
What's the price of beef in the grocery?

471
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,919
It's too expensive here.

472
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,118
It's some trick to fool you around.

473
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,639
You get what you pay for.

474
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,560
You'll know it after you eat it.

475
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,838
I want this one.

476
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,118
Are you sure you only need this?

477
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,079
Do what she says.

478
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,598
Okay, one mushroom soup.

479
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,160
How about you, sir?
What would you like to eat?

480
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,198
One tuna tartare.

481
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,759
M9+ S Class. Chocolate.

482
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,958
One medium, one well done, please.

483
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,479
What?

484
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,999
Are you crazy? Two?

485
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,159
What are you doing?

486
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,919
Money doesn't come with the wind.

487
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,198
It's not easy to earn some money.
How can you squander it?

488
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,078
So what do I earn money for?

489
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,958
To let you eat what you want to eat.

490
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:28,719
I can eat whatever I want
to eat even if I don't eat here.

491
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,479
Open your mouth.

492
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:41,559
And it's just the two of us.

493
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,959
We can just grab a bite.

494
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,999
When it's time to officially invite my bestie,

495
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,400
we can have a good meal.

496
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,000
To invite your bestie?

497
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,718
Take it easy.

498
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,118
You don't need to spend a lot of money.

499
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,679
See how scared you are.

500
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,479
That's not what I meant.

501
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,159
Your bestie just broke up.

502
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,478
If we invite her for dinner at this time,

503
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,118
it seems to show off.

504
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,079
This is not good.

505
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,598
You have a point there.

506
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,239
Yeah.

507
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,359
It's not a good time for you to meet each other.

508
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah.

509
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,359
Why do I feel... you don't
want to meet my friend?

510
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,639
Not at all.

511
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,680
And you have never taken me
to meet your friends.

512
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,799
I have no friends.

513
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,559
You're not the kind of
person who hide your identity,

514
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,519
and you're two-timing me.

515
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,438
Because of the fear of being exposed,

516
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,279
you never take any girlfriend
to see your friends.

517
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,399
How did you reason your way here?

518
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,279
You're too fast.

519
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,839
I can't keep up with you in a wheelchair.

520
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,519
You have to try this.

521
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,119
Especially delicious.

522
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,879
Don't change the subject. Explain it to me.

523
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,639
I have nothing to explain.

524
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,078
What can I explain?

525
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,560
I just don't have any friends.

526
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,078
It's my first time seeing someone
talk so loudly about

527
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,400
him having no friends.

528
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,039
Even if you have no friends,
you should have WeChat Moments.

529
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,999
Yes.

530
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,198
My Moments is very expensive.

531
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:34,000
The ad price is super high.

532
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,760
Post a picture of mine.

533
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,160
If you have a girlfriend, you should post it.

534
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,560
That's right. I'll post now.

535
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,359
I'm done.

536
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,560
Do you like it?

537
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,958
It's good.

538
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,599
It has some hazy beauty. Go ahead.

539
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,318
I'll just post it.

540
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,839
What? Are you going to eat your words?

541
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:13,119
No.

542
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,718
I've just never seen a girl

543
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,879
who is so confident about her real picture.

544
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,079
That's my girl.

545
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,239
I'm okay with the real picture.

546
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,439
Why are you doing this to me? I won't...

547
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:34,239
♫ Slowly learn to expect. ♫

548
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,160
♫ I am afraid of giving you harm. ♫

549
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,198
Jin Xi.

550
00:31:57,199 --> 00:32:00,160
Not bad. He is something.

551
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,119
Why did she change her avatar?

552
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,438
Lv, time for dinner, where are you?

553
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,519
I've got a date tonight.

554
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm not coming.

555
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,800
The same starry sky avatar.

556
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,280
Could it be...

557
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,959
Let's go. Mr. Lv has an appointment.

558
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,358
What are you thinking?

559
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,830
Later your favorite dishes will be gone.

560
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,759
There must be a problem.

561
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,040
What are you talking about?

562
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,799
Do you remember Lv
Jian said in the morning

563
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,040
he would eat with us.

564
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,359
That might be true.

565
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,800
Boss has just left,
Lv Jian's whereabouts are erratic.

566
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,439
It makes me think more.

567
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,040
I'll test him first.

568
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,080
Mr. Lv's nightlife is exciting.

569
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,799
And as for you,
you can learn more about

570
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,320
when he will finish the activity.

571
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,879
Here.

572
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,438
Gel electrophoresis is okay.

573
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,678
But I'll come back late.

574
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,320
Wait if you don't mind working overtime.

575
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,958
Professor Zhuang.

576
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,159
You're here so early.

577
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,599
You don't have to do this.

578
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
It's still a few days before school starts.

579
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,759
There is a bad look on your face.

580
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,239
Are you sure you don't need to rest?

581
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,919
Not so easy, I'm afraid.

582
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,079
Take care on your way back.

583
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,239
Tell Mr. Fang to drive a little slower.

584
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,079
All right.

585
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,559
I'll stay with my bestie today.

586
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,759
Tomorrow,
the day after tomorrow,

587
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,039
and the days after, I'll only spoil you.

588
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,479
Is it good?

589
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,439
It's a deal.

590
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,239
Slow down.

591
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,120
Go.

592
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,559
Remember to lock the door at night.

593
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,319
Don't chat late at night.

594
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,479
It's bad for your health to stay up late.

595
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,238
Didn't she recognize her?

596
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,519
Fortunately.

597
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,879
Luckily I was smart.

598
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:47,320
Candlelight dinner is a good choice.

599
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,120
Since Yu Meiren is not herself,

600
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,760
Tiantian shouldn't show her.

601
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,438
No!

602
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:07,080
Would Yu Meiren recognize
her once she becomes okay?

603
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,679
If I hadn't lied, it would have been great.

604
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,678
Don't sigh.

605
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,119
Sighing takes away good luck.

606
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,520
It's a pity that you and Mr. Zhuang...

607
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,119
Forget it.

608
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,919
No more sad things.

609
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:48,279
Did you cry a lot and
forget to eat anything?

610
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,399
I didn't cry.

611
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,399
I'm not hungry.

612
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:03,639
What is this?

613
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,360
You've got a hobby of painting lately.

614
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,120
Let me take a look.

615
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,800
This is a... tortoise.

616
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,238
No.

617
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,559
Why?

618
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,999
Although it is a bit abstract,

619
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,918
I can tell it when I look closely.

620
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:32,519
You'll screw up the things
that don't belong to you,

621
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,280
even after all the effort to get.

622
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,040
A laminator.

623
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,320
It's okay.

624
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,198
Difficult the first time, easy the second.

625
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,478
Try a few more times.

626
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:44,600
You'll make it.

627
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,958
No, it's useless.

628
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,478
Even if the wet painting is repaired,

629
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:52,799
it won't be the same one as before.

630
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,039
Not the previous one.

631
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,519
You just think of it as a new one.

632
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,959
It's not a big deal.

633
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,559
You know what?

634
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,918
Recently,
female-led series are especially popular.

635
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:08,199
I have some inspirations.

636
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,718
Generally speaking, men in dramas of this kind

637
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,839
are the heroine's passing travelers,

638
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,718
a stepping stone to help the heroine grow.

639
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,878
The audience is not concerned about

640
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:20,799
how their relationship is going,

641
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,120
but whether she finally realizes her dream.

642
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,759
You have to show the spirit of the heroine,

643
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,430
and give an explanation to the audience, okay?

644
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,840
Then for me...

645
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,639
No.

646
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,918
This is for you.

647
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:42,878
Be the heroine of your own.

648
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:44,599
Keep up the good work.

649
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,599
Okay?

650
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,280
Good?

651
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:48,199
You nodded! I saw it.

652
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,359
All right.

653
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,398
Look at you.

654
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:52,879
Like a little cat.

655
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,678
Meow.

656
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,159
Meow.

657
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,999
I'm sorry, Tiantian.

658
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,839
You are so pure and kind.

659
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,399
But I took advantage of your kindness
to deceive you again and again.

660
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,718
Whenever I wanted to explain,

661
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,560
I craved a moment of happiness.

662
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,638
I boiled this myself yesterday.

663
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,919
It has ginger, rice wine and salt.

664
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,519
This can improve blood circulation.

665
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,080
So it can relieve the pain.

666
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:06,039
I'll bring this for you every day.

667
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,718
When you sit, put your legs on top.

668
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,080
It also provides some relief.

669
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,359
This time I want to start
with the initial encounter.

670
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,398
Let me make it clear to you.

671
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:20,399
I want to take the high road.

672
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:36,839
Why are you here?

673
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,360
Come to discuss work with you.

674
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:40,280
You are going out?

675
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:43,238
I... I'm not going out. Come.

676
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,719
Let's discuss it.

677
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,840
Why do you have that?

678
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:58,719
What did you just drop?

679
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,599

What is your outfit for the launch tonight?

684

After all, we're going together.

685
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,559
If we weren't matched in clothes,

686
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,000
it might look really bad, right?
