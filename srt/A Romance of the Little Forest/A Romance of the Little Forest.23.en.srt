[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,280
[Episode 23]

24
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:32,980
[If I had a single flower for every time
I think of you, I could walk forever in garden.]

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,319
Should I applaud for your earnestness?

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,439
If you are really serious,

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,759
you should treat this feeling more sincerely.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,918
I am not insincere.

29
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:43,518
Do you think that

30
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,039
sweet words and spending time together everyday

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,480
are true love?

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,518
When she cares about and sympathizes with you,

33
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,318
and is sincere with
you, do you feel proud,

34
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,160
and even ridiculous?

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,479
What do you think of her?

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,319
A doll that you can handle at will?

37
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,759
If you really love her,

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,879
you shouldn't keep her in the dark.

39
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,800
I'm just scared.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
You're scared.

41
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,118
Are you afraid of losing her,

42
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,198
or afraid of losing the thrill of control

43
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,279
this information asymmetry gives you?

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,759
Just leave.

45
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,800
Tiantian doesn't want to see you.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,520
I can't help you.

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
Please tell her that

48
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,360
I'm sorry for her.

49
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm the one who screwed everything up.

50
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,918
I'll come back when she is better.

51
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,559
I'll leave now.

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
Are you done?

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,559
No.

54
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,080
What I really want to say is

55
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,520
I…

56
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,279
I like you.

57
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,800
I've not been a lucky person since my childhood.

58
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,359
No matter how hard I study or work,

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,839
I can't compare with someone,

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,758
who could get the first place

61
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,959
without much effort just by luck.

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,399
But no one ever seems to see me.

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,759
Only you

64
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,360
saw me.

65
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:52,479
That's the first time I
knew that even once

66
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,759
I might be the lucky one.

67
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,398
My teacher set up the scholarship,

68
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,278
based on grades rather than luck.

69
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,758
But if you hadn't chosen me

70
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,918
from among the applicants,

71
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,440
I wouldn't have had a chance to change my fate.

72
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,839
I wrote to you,

73
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,160
and went to the school to see you.

74
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,119
But

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,880
you are so outstanding, so good.

76
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,200
I was just an
ordinary ugly duckling.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,518
You probably wouldn't even look at me.

78
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,720
So all these years,
I've been working hard,

79
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,079
trying to get a
qualification alongside you.

80
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,078
Until at the launch of
Lami, I saw you again,

81
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,920
I thought

82
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,919
maybe I…

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,679
You just said you like me.

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,640
But we haven't spoken before, right?

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,040
How can you say you like me?

86
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,398
You misunderstood your feelings.

87
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,920
- I…
- If there's nothing else,

88
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,319
please go back.

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,399
I didn't misunderstand.

90
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,398
The pain of separation

91
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,279
is the best measure of love.

92
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,559
When I can't see you,

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,880
I never forget you.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
The longer the separation is,

95
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,920
the clearer your image will be in my mind.

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,919
The only thought that

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,359
supports me through every day

98
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,920
is that one day I can see you again.

99
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,358
The pain of separation

100
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,320
is the best measure of love.

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,720
When I can't see you,

102
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,760
I never forget you.

103
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,199
Professor Zhuang might stay

104
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,359
in the room of the vanilla
for a long time without smelling its fragrance.

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,159
You want to fulfill your dream,

106
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,599
but I just want to be

107
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,760
a stable bakery or crystal store owner,

108
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,679
treating dreams as stars,

109
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,879
knowing that I can not have them,

110
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,919
but it's enough to take a look at it

111
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,200
once in a while.

112
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Why are you bullying me too?

113
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,920
Dispensing. Please wait for a moment.

114
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,398
The product is dispensed.

115
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,719
Please take the product you purchased

116
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,599
from the pickup port.

117
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,920
Welcome to your next visit.

118
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,439
They are both sparkling.

119
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,000
Just drink.

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,400
Drinking to dispel sorrow makes it worse.

121
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,000
Hello, Tiantian,

122
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:09,280
hello,

123
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,718
why aren't you talking?

124
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,159
Are you crying?

125
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,079
Come on, who am I?

126
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,119
I won't cry for this kind of trivial love.

127
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,598
Whether Jin Xi comes
or not, I'll pretend that

128
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,440
he never existed in my world.

129
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,119
I want to tell you,

130
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,719
a few months ago,

131
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:34,880
when I left Qingshui Village with the grapes,

132
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,799
I made a wish that

133
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,118
I would use all my
good fortune in my life

134
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,799
to exchange for my grandma's health and peace.

135
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,959
Although I seem to
be in a bad situation

136
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,000
and everything is not going well,

137
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,679
I am actually quite happy.

138
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,679
I feel that God is helping me.

139
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,760
Compared to losing my grandmother,

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,519
being tricked, cheated and losing love

141
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,719
are nothing.

142
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,158
Don't make it so serious,

143
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,239
and you shouldn't lose your faith in love.

144
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,038
Let me tell you

145
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,960
a special love story of fidelity.

146
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,919
The story is that

147
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:30,118
in a small town in Croatia,

148
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:32,798
an injured female white stork

149
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,320
was saved by a kind-hearted old man.

150
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,999
Because of its serious injury,

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,440
it could no longer make long flights.

152
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,639
The old man built a nest for it

153
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,960
on the roof of his house,

154
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,080
and named it Marlena.

155
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,599
Marlena was a beautiful stork,

156
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,000
so it soon attracted a
male stork named Clapton.

157
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:01,798
Clapton took great care of Marlena,

158
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,280
building a nest and catching fish.

159
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,760
So he soon won Marlena's heart.

160
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,479
But after a few months,

161
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,239
one day,

162
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,039
Clapton suddenly disappeared.

163
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,520
Because the white stork is a migratory bird.

164
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,079
They fly to Africa for winter every year.

165
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,679
It's their nature.

166
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,478
The shortest journey

167
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,559
from Croatia to South Africa is 8,000 miles.

168
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:37,439
Being tested by snow and wind,

169
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,320
and the hunter's rifle,

170
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,439
they suffer from hunger on the way,

171
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,880
just to fly to their destination.

172
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,119
Good job!

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,839
This kind of thing may be incomprehensible

174
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,080
to human beings,

175
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,798
but for them, it is their
unchangeable nature,

176
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,760
and it is what they do best.

177
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
But for Marlena,

178
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,598
who was now unable to fly long distances,

179
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,960
has to face the parting alone.

180
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,999
I've thought it all through.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,320
Great.

182
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,399
I'll do my best.

183
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,119
It's just that since then,

184
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,959
Marlena seemed to be a different bird,

185
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,280
not fond of playing.

186
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,559
When it had time,

187
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,478
it would flap its injured wings

188
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,039
and fly to the highest telephone pole

189
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,919
to look into the distance.

190
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,639
The old man who rescued it

191
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,439
tried everything to help it

192
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,520
get over the breakup,

193
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,679
taking it to eat good food and play,

194
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,039
but Marlena couldn't
be happy anymore.

195
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,559
It was probably wondering

196
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,640
if Clapton had forgotten about it,

197
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,880
or if

198
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,280
it had fallen in love with others.

199
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,999
[Huaguang Unversity]

200
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,238
But to everyone's surprise,

201
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:39,358
Clapton finally flew back

202
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,559
with a bloodstained body.

203
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,839
No one knows what it
went through on the way.

204
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,158
Maybe for those who really want to see you,

205
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,799
even if they can't overcome their instincts,

206
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,719
even though they are thousands of miles away,

207
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,000
they will eventually arrive.

208
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:06,239
Miss Yu, you tell
this story so well.

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,519
The story of Marlena and Clapton

210
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,399
touched many people,

211
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,678
and eventually pushed Lebanon,

212
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,118
where the storks must migrate,

213
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,798
to change its laws

214
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,478
to punish illegal shooting of birds.

215
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,918
Our country is also revising

216
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,558
the wildlife protection law recently,

217
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,038
so that more wild birds

218
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,650
could be included in the scope of protection.

219
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,359
All right.

220
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,319
Go back and get familiar with

221
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,079
the endangered birds in China,

222
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,620
we will discuss them in the next class.

223
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,440
Miss. Yu, it's a trick
for your touching story.

224
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,839
Miss. Yu, the story
you told is so touching,

225
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,319
do you have any similar experience?

226
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,359
Tell us please.

227
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,039
Not everyone can be as lucky as Marlena.

228
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,399
But even if we
aren't, it can't stop us

229
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,039
from becoming better.

230
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,399
So sorry.

231
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,759
I'm really bad at cooking.

232
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,400
So I could only order food for you.

233
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,158
You're so kind.

234
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,559
These are enough.

235
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,599
Lucky cookies. Open one.

236
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,598
What does it say?

237
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,559
Let me see how lucky you are.

238
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,639
If I had a single flower for every time

239
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,079
I think about you, then

240
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,359
I could walk forever in my garden.

241
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,879
It's all just a bunch of mumbo.

242
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,520
How can you say that?

243
00:15:55,599 --> 00:16:00,799
Your teacher used
this to chase me down.

244
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,999
He and I

245
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,119
were both poor students studying abroad.

246
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,399
We usually didn't spend much.

247
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,718
When we saved a little more money,

248
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,718
a few of us could get together and

249
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,718
go to eat Chinese food together.

250
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:19,478
I met him at the dinner table.

251
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,598
In order to get close to me,

252
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,158
he deliberately asked me

253
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,520
what the English words on this note meant.

254
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,879
With the opportunity of the note,

255
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,919
we got together finally.

256
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,199
Until that time, I realized that

257
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,759
when we had dinner together,

258
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,199
he almost finished his thesis,

259
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,478
so how could he not know

260
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,880
the English on the note?

261
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,639
Surprising, right?

262
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,599
Your teacher is quite romantic.

263
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,838
He even had a custom-made fortune cookie made,

264
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,560
and put the note inside to propose.

265
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,920
How could I not say yes?

266
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,399
In fact, before I broke the fortune cookie,

267
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,198
I already knew that Huaiqing

268
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,640
is the one I want to be with forever.

269
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,478
I heard from Michael that

270
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,439
the college wanted to hire you as a teacher.

271
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,680
It's a good opportunity.

272
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,040
But you hesitate to say yes.

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
Because you can't let go of someone, right?

274
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,999
For some certain things,

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
before you make the decision,

276
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,680
you already have answers in your heart,

277
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,479
right?

278
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,160
Choosing between dream and love

279
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,160
is just a false dilemma.

280
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,680
Young people should dare to venture and love.

281
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,679

indecisive than your teacher?

- Hello.
- The grapes are so sweet this year.

319
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,399
Are you sure you don't want to come back?

320
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,198
Yes. I really can't leave.

321
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,358
The school arranges summer classes.

322
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,919
Great.

323
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,919
The transformation of you is really good.

324
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,078
I want to show my respect.

325
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,920
Ask Meiren if she
receives the grapes or not.

326
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,078
Let me check.

327
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,318
Grandma asked me to send you the grapes.

328
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,439
I think they'll be here today.

329
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,000
Wait a minute.

330
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,760
I got it.

331
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,358
So sweet.

332
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,879
Have you washed it?

333
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,520
Of course.

334
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,718
The grapes are so good this year,

335
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,478
they must be selling well.

336
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,559
Do you want me to take a video

337
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,799
for you like last time?

338
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,680
Maybe we can attract a big order again.

339
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,478
Nothing.

340
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,319
It was a long time ago.

341
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,838
Even the grapes on the vine

342
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,280
have grown to be new batch.

343
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,078
He's just a long-lost acquaintance.

344
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,430
There's nothing we can't talk about.

345
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,199
Didn't he come back to you afterwards?

346
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,760
No.

347
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,519
Luckily he didn't come.

348
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,639
Even if he did, I would have kicked him out.

349
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,559
It would have been a farce again.

350
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,999
The village chief said that our village

351
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,639
is being appraised as
the most beautiful village,

352
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,559
so we should pay attention to civilized manners.

353
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,718
It would be so bad if I get angry

354
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,198
and affect the appraisal result.

355
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:51,198
In fact, I haven't seen
Jin Xi for a long time.

356
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,358
And I haven't

357
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,438
heard any rumors about him from others.

358
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:56,659
Maybe he's changing his ways

359
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,958
and has decided to come back to you

360
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,239
after a thorough introspection.

361
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,799
Do you remember the story

362
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,479
you told me about the white stork?

363
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,438
It says that

364
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:09,118
for someone who really wants to see you,

365
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,559
even if he has to cross thousands of miles,

366
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,279
he will come to you in the end.

367
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,118
The white stork has to fly 8,000 miles,

368
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,389
but Shanghai

369
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,319
is just a few hours' drive to Qingshui Village.

370
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,519
But now that I look back on it,

371
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,919
what happened before

372
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,439
was like an unrealistic dream for me.

373
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,318
Now everything that happens

374
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,719
in Qingshui Village is real to me.

375
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,718
That's right. Just be yourself.

376
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:40,879
So that even if you accidentally run into him,

377
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,559
you can tell him in the best state,

378
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,399
and let him know that

379
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,199
even without him, you can live better.

380
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,039
Tiantian, don't think about it anymore.

381
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,039
Okay, bye.

382
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,760
I have a lot of homework to correct.

383
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,478
Is your job part-time now?

384
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:56,639
I feel like you're busier
than before as a blogger.

385
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,559
That's right.

386
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,479
What's comfortable? Do I deserve it?

387
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,719
Okay, don't bother you. Bye.

388
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
I still want to eat grapes.

389
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,479
Just eat.

390
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,718
No matter how unrealistic the dream is,

391
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,119
it's time to wake up.

392
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,199
Yu Meiren, you have to defeat yourself.

393
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,400
Defeat myself,

394
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,520
it means there is still one myself be defeated.

395
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,559
If I can't even control my weight,

396
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,119
how can I overcome other obstacles?

397
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:54,479
Forget it. I need more power to fight.

398
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
[The orders for takeaway have been suspended.]

399
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,999
Let me put on a little smoky makeup,

400
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,119
which is just right for the dark night.

401
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,559
Eating may cause stomach pain.

402
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,718
Don't eat, I'm sure
I'll be unhappy.

403
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,400
Eat.

404
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,478
Why are there always

405
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,319
people looking for you at this late hour?

406
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,078
For work.

407
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,118
If I don't work hard to earn money,

408
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:51,880
how can your parents

409
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:53,640
marry their baby girl to me?

410
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,438
You are the one I like.

411
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,718
They should agree.

412
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,520
Baby, let me feed you.

413
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,838
Sorry.

414
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,318
It's my fault for being careless.

415
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,759
Let me wipe it for you.

416
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,919
Forget it, you can't wipe it clean.

417
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,159
I'll go to wash it.

418
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,319
Then I'll wait for you.

419
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,880
What's wrong with you?

420
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,560
I told you not to call me.

421
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,040
What?

422
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,838
At the point of my engagement,

423
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,160
what are you doing?

424
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,118
I thought we had a deal that

425
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,358
I'll marry her first, then
we'll get the money,

426
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,399
and I'll divorce her.

427
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,079
Then we can be together.

428
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,560
Baby, don't cry.

429
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,118
Be a good girl, listen to me.

430
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,000
Don't cry.

431
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,958
What are you doing?

432
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,478
I can't see you just for a while.

433
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:46,919
Nothing, just move around.

434
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,039
Upon seeing you
coming, I'm coming over.

435
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,680
I can't stay away from you for a moment.

436
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,359
Don't know when the wedding dress will be made.

437
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,839
I ordered it in France.

438
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,879
Sorry.

439
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,078
- It's okay.
- Be careful.

440
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,198
Miss, your makeup is smudged.

441
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:18,078
Wipe it with this tissue.

442
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,280
Thank you.

443
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,039
I'm really good.

444
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,039
Say bye bye to all the troubles.

445
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,919
Say hi hi to all the happiness.

446
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,599
All the playboys…

447
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,679
You did this, right?

448
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,078
[Your boyfriend cheated on you.]

449
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,838
No, it's not me.

450
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,119
Pretend.

451
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,438
It was you in the dessert store just now.

452
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,598
You've come to meddle with me?

453
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,000
You're asking for trouble, are you?

454
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,478
Am I the one who cheated

455
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,438
or am I the one who did something wrong?

456
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,639
If you don't want people to know, then don't do.

457
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,539
Hey, police, here is Dongchuan…

458
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,438
Ruining my future, you dare to call the police.

459
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,599
Give me back my phone.

460
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,499
♫ Sharing an umbrella with you ♫

461
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,500
♫ I feel so warm ♫

462
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:33,200
♫ Without noticing that
the rain was soaking me ♫

463
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,279
No, this is not the time for hallucinations.

464
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,199
♫ Time is also very slow ♫

465
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,999
♫ The sun is casting a circle of light ♫

466
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,958
♫ I run hard towards you ♫

467
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,318
What? It's not a hallucination.

468
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:54,509
♫ Lifting my head and breathing hard ♫

469
00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:00,010
♫ I won't hesitate even if it's stormy ♫

470
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,909
♫ The wind gently blows the sky after the rain ♫

471
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,709
♫ You stand in the wind
and look at the rainbow ♫

472
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,399
♫ All the scenery in my eyes ♫

473
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,318
So that even if you accidentally run into him,

474
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:16,199
you should tell him
in the best state.

475
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,519
What?

476
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,399
Now I'm so ugly.

477
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,438
♫ I stand in the wind and am moved by you ♫

478
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,358
Put the coat on.

479
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,358
♫ Your eyes are so clear ♫

480
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,640
Do I know you well?

481
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,279
Meiren.

482
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,000
♫ I want the scene to be frozen ♫

483
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:42,040
♫ I want the scene to be frozen ♫

484
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,838
Sorry to trouble you.

485
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,838
If it wasn't for you,

486
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,078
I don't know how long I would have been fooled.

487
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,039
- I'm really…
- It's his fault.

488
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,318
The law has made him pay.

489
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,439
Don't blame yourself too much.

490
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,198
Then I'll go to take the record.

491
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:59,719
Thank you and your boyfriend.

492
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,358
Don't feel so sad.

493
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,438
After all, leave the wrong person,

494
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,040
then you can meet the right one.

495
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,599
I'm going in then.

496
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,119
Meiren.

497
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,159
Let him know that even without him,

498
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,358
I can live better.

499
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,239
No need.

500
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,238
I'm not cold. I'm not cold at all.

501
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,599
I'm in good health.

502
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,958
Let me take you home.

503
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,799
Do you still live…

504
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,839
Taxi.

505
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,198
Where I live now is
none of your business.

506
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,280
And

507
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,438
I have money now, no
matter how close I live,

508
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,719
I'll take a taxi.

509
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,520
Go.

510
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,198
Bad man.

511
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,639
Come and go as you please.

512
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,439
Miss,

513
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,438
fight with your boyfriend, right?

514
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,959
He's not my boyfriend.

515
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,958
You young people are irritable.

516
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,919
When you're as old as I am, you'll understand.

517
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,198
In your whole life,

518
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:26,478
it's not easy to meet a lover

519
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:28,958
who cares about you.

520
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,559
The way that young man

521
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,919
looked at you just now was full of love.

522
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,039
I can't be wrong.

523
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,759
Can you drive faster, please?

524
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,999
I would like to.

525
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,718
My wife is urging me to go back.

526
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,319
Look, it's blocked.

527
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,358
As the saying goes,

528
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,438
there is no nightly feud between a couple.

529
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:46,718
Just now the young man

530
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:48,520
has put himself low enough,

531
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,000
you'd better forgive him.

532
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Give him an out, right?

533
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,759
The corn poppies in your yard

534
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,238
are blooming really well.

535
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,600
But you can't see them when you come back.

536
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,238
After all, leave the wrong person,

537
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,840
then you can meet the right one.

538
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,319
What happened?

539
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,520
The car is slower than walking.

540
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,320
The traffic jam was at the wrong time.

541
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,639
What are you doing?

542
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,600
I want to see you get home safely.

543
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,398
Funny.

544
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,320
Am I not safe when you're not here?

545
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,519
How can you be sure I still live here?

546
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
You just said

547
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,770
you'll take a cab no matter how close you live.

548
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,759
I guess the neighborhood closest to the station

549
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,959
should still be here.

550
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,120
Meiren,
