[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,059
[Episode 26]

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,980
[When you truly desire something,
the entire universe will help you]

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,559
Tiantian,

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,439
there is no way to make western desserts
in this kitchen.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,318
But on the rice cakes,

28
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,519
I added a lot of brown sugar
to make them sweet.

29
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,279
Why haven't you left yet?

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,119
Thanks to Jin today.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,838
I didn't know your tastes changed so much.

32
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,558
When did you love meat so much?

33
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:57,958
Grandma, Jin Xi is just my colleague.

34
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,559
How does he know what I like to eat?

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,239
I don't think colleagues

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,559
will use this pair of phone cases.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,639
Don't overthink it.
I can't be bothered changing it.

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,360
Come on, let's eat.

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,639
Thank you.

40
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,080
Jin.

41
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,198
I'll cut it for you.

42
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,080
No, thank you.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,759
Come on, eat.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,240
Do you have to anatomize them?

45
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,720
Could they die of illness?

46
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,478
These Common Teal bodies

47
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,758
were found in the same depression.

48
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,559
Died of illness?

49
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:01,800
Not so coincidental.

50
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,479
No blood around the eyes or mouth.

51
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,319
Does not meet the characteristics
of the death.

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
An autopsy is required
to determine the true cause of death.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,320
This is?

54
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,758
Carbofuran. Pesticide.

55
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,599
Carbofuran is very toxic.

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,080
A packet can poison twenty.

57
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,678
It's on the list of wildlife with important
ecological, scientific and social value.

58
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,558
Illegal hunting of over twenty wild animals

59
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,520
can be filed in a case.

60
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,279
Call the police.

61
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,719
The situation you mentioned,

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,638
in fact, we have already recorded it.

63
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,959
The birds are dense in the wetlands here.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,678
Poachers were more rampant in earlier years.

65
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,839
The common method of poaching
is to set up nets.

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,719
One is called a flipping net.

67
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,319
To find a piece of water in advance.

68
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,159
Set up the net.

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,198
Put a few domestic ducks in as matchmakers.

70
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,599
What matchmakers?

71
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,599
The decoys that lure the Common Teal.

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,159
Ducks are herd animals.

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,678
When they see their own kind, they will go over.

74
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,720
That's right.

75
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:07,519
You can catch dozens of them in one net.

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,758
There is another kind, called sticky net.

77
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,879
It's to set up nets in the reeds and forests.

78
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,079
When the bird flies,

79
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,440
once hit it, they can't get down.

80
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,159
All these years,

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,439
we've pitted our wits against the poachers.

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,238
They have a strong sense of
anti-reconnaissance.

83
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,919
Seeing us and volunteers,

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,238
they won't go over to pick them up.

85
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,678
Even if we catch the poisoners,

86
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,759
they will say they're spraying pesticides.

87
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,040
Caught picking up bird carcasses,

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,319
they won't admit that they poisoned.

89
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,479
Wetland reeds are so obscured from view.

90
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,879
It's difficult to enforce.

91
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,759
Since poachers are repeat offenders,

92
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,200
do you know who it is?

93
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
Jia San?

94
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,920
Do you all know him?

95
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,999
Xue and I met Jia San before.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,798
I felt that he was particularly suspicious.

97
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,000
So I went after to check it.

98
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,200
He scolded us badly.

99
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,078
When we solve a case,

100
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,599
we need to form a complete chain of evidence.

101
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,958
From suspects buying drugs, spilling drugs,

102
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,558
catching, killing, processing to selling,

103
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,920
we all need to collect evidence.

104
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,999
The terrain here is complex.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
Our police force is also not enough.

106
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,999
Unless...

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,358
we can capture Jia San with the stolen birds.

108
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,958
Otherwise,

109
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,559
it's difficult to take further action.

110
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,359
Now that we know who the poisoner is,

111
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,199
we can catch him.

112
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,398
I heard that Jia San is like a ghost.

113
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,358
It's not that easy to catch him.

114
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,958
Since he has poisoned,

115
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,879
he'll definitely pick up the body today.

116
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,078
I just need to wait in the depression.

117
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,439
At least I can confirm
if the poacher is Jia San.

118
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,199
No, Miss Meiren, it's too dangerous.

119
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,519
How about we go together?

120
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,759
Too many people and he knows you.

121
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,358
In case Jia San finds out,
he'll be more alert.

122
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,679
Next time it'll be harder to capture him.

123
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,119
But...

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,919
Think about the dissected Common Teal.

125
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,919
There is no food in his stomach.

126
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Only gravel and poison.

127
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,999
The waterland is shrinking.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,159
It is not easy for them to find food.

129
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,759
They were hungry,

130
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,319
and were just looking for water to drink.

131
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,160
Who knew they would lose their life?

132
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,720
It shouldn't be like this.

133
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,519
This is supposed to be their home.

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,399
So don't argue with me on this matter.

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,238
Catching poachers one day early,

136
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,359
one less bird to die.

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,600
Dusk is the first peak of bird activity.

138
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,958
Jia San is still not coming.

139
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,958
Could he wait for

140
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,639
the second peak of bird activity?

141
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,079
He is too greedy.

142
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,740
[The animals in this scene are made by CG.]

143
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,160
It's you.

144
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,200
Just two!

145
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,558
Mr. Wang, I'm checking the goods.

146
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:55,039
I know it's a big deal for you.

147
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,790
I should prepare enough goods for you, right?

148
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,118
How can it be compared with first class

149
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,639
and second class national protected animals?

150
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,999
First class and second class? Is there a team?

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,919
Tomorrow, no, Mr. Wang,

152
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,159
give me two more days, okay?

153
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,999
I've been watched these days.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,279
I really can't do anything.

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,999
Who else can it be?

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,118
Just those people.

157
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,799
The volunteers.

158
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,798
They'll get themselves killed.

159
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,599
They dare to get in my way.

160
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,760
If I meet them, I'll
teach them a lesson.

161
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,599
Who is it?

162
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,119
You want to die, do you?

163
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,840
Dare to get in my way!

164
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,280
Come out! Who is there?

165
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,840
Don't shout. It's me.

166
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
Come out.

167
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,359
Hug me.

168
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,320
Come on.

169
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,359
Who?

170
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,319
What's going on here?

171
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,439
What the...

172
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,559
Stay close to me.

173
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,439
Rotten luck.

174
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,400
I didn't find the ducks but illicit lovers.

175
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,559
Is he gone?

176
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,119
Not yet.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,760
Still not gone? Did he find us?

178
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,919
You lied to me.

179
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,359
Liar.

180
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,079
Why are you so close to me?

181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,358
No, I just want to thank you

182
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,999
for walking with me all the way back.

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,079
Don't flatter yourself.

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,718
If Grandma hadn't given you so many things,

185
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,358
I don't want to make such a trip.

186
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,400
Yes.

Want to take a break?

188
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,639
I heard that the stars in the countryside
are particularly bright at night.

189
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,280
Look at this view. It's so good.

190
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,678
Do you remember

191
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,759
last time we watched fireworks in the park?

192
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,319
Do you think

193
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,799

Don't be afraid.

206

You mean Jia San?

207
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,839
Why would I be afraid of him?

208
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,918
If you hadn't come,

209
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,038
he has been locked up by the police, okay?

210
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,559
Then your plan will be ruined.

211
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,759

212
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,880
And why are you here?

213

221
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,358

Why did you take off for two days？

231
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,880
You're going to Baiyuan, why?

232
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,358
I signed up for bird volunteers

233
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:09,118
at the Baiyuan wildlife station.

234
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,599

Thank you.

242
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,079
Will Miss Meiren be in danger?

243
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,199
Should we go to the depression to help her?

244
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,959
No, in case we are discovered by Jia San,

245
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,320
she will be more dangerous.

246
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,598
I'm still worried.

247
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,959
Jia San is a repeat offender.

248

He has poisoned the birds in the water
for so many times.

249
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,519
He must be ruthless.

250

She said she'll call the police immediately
if something goes wrong.

better than you do.

267
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,798

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,040
to find the star.

356
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:26,760
It can't be true.
How can the stars shine brightly?

357
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560

The boy was anxious.

360
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,319
He told his family

361
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,839

00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,560

368
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:08,560
But it doesn't talk.

369
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,439
It can't testify to the boy.

370
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,239
So the boy made up his mind.

371
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,839
Since there are no stars in the village,

372
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,040
go to a place where the stars can be seen.

373
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,800
The boy wants to walk along
the edge of the dark clouds.

374
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,198
This always comes to an end.

375
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,318
But the boy doesn't know.

376
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,199
To find the end of the clouds,

377
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,040
he tramps over hill and dale.

378
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,599
But no matter how he goes,

379
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,880
that dark cloud is always over his head.

380
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,479
Whenever the boy is tired,

381
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,839
the flowers on the mountain

382
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:49,359
remind him of the flowers in front of his home,

383
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,239
the night when he saw the stars.

384
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,160
So he can't give up.

385
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,520
And then?

386
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
No matter how much the boy goes,

387
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,280
he never reaches the border
of the dark clouds.

388
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,520
But then one night,

389
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,439
he closes his eyes,

390
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,318
those flowers suddenly appear

391
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,439
right in front of his eyes.

392
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:20,680
That flowers glowing with light,

393
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,040
is exactly the same

394
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,280
as the stars he saw that day.

395
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,359
What flowers?

396
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,520
After wasting a year of time and emotion,

397
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,040
you just came and told me a story?

398
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,198
Look at you.

399
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:46,238
You get annoyed when he is around.

400
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:48,358
You're not happy when he leaves.

401
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,400
What should he do?

402
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,438
My sister? What's wrong?

403
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,958
Did she and her boyfriend quarrel again?

404
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,999
Watch the road. I'm discussing the plot.

405
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,319
Why does she touch him?

406
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,759
Why bother caring about his appearance?

407
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,598
He is here.

408
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,718
If he is not for you, then for whom?

409
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:11,799
He saved you and helped you.

410
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,159
How romantic!

411
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,198
That is why I need to be calm, okay?

412
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,879
I think this is the Drawbridging Effect.

413
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,519
In the most dangerous times,

414
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,559
I happen to run into an acquaintance
who offered a helping hand.

415
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,039
It's easy to get confused about the heartbeat.

416
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,039
Aren't you flipped?

417
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,598
Can't you tell the difference?

418
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,718
What's more,

419
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,118
it takes some time for you to forgive him.

420
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,439
I'm so looking...

421
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,279
forward to it. I've got some things to do.

422
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,838
Talk to you later.

423
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,719
What is it? Why not say it?

424
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,920
Drive slower.

425
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,279
Don't worry about it.

426
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,880
It's still very slow.

427
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,199
It's time to turn the corner.

428
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,598
She didn't find us, did she?

429
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,838
I don't think so.

430
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,238
This happens to be a blind spot.

431
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,199
She can't see.

432
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,478
Look.

433
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,958
If a girl puts her hands on you,

434
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,519
what's the relationship between you two?

435
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,679
Nothing?

436
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,598
Impossible.

437
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,759
Her hand, your head, like this.

438
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,999
Think again.

439
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,799
It must be the girl dislikes the boy,

440
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,118
so she pushes him away.

441
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,078
Impossible, they are familiar with each other.

442
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,919
Really?

443
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,710
Then that must be a joke.

444
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,799
Do you have a girlfriend?

445
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,359
No.

446
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,639
Do you have a crush?

447
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,280
No.

448
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:45,680
No wonder you don't understand.

449
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,559
If you ask me,

450
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,718
I think Miss Li treats Meinan as her brother.

451
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,238
Don't overthink it.

452
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:57,199
President Jin,

453
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,639
My huckleberry friend.

454
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,078
Isn't it the plot of the love drama
Tiantian is watching?

455
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,999
Go!

456
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,838
There is some distance.

457
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,400
Go, let's catch up!

458
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:08,598
Don't worry, President Jin.

459
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,359
- Come on.
- In my speed.

460
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,759
There won't be a problem. Don't worry.

461
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,000
Go!

462
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,519
Don't worry, President Jin.

463
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,000
Please wait a minute.

464
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,799
Don't worry. Let me check it.

465
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,959
It won't take long.

466
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Drop the ball at the last minute.

467
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
[Jail for bird hunting]

468
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,799
Hello, what are you talking about?

469
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,280
I said to buy you watermelon.

470
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,439
Thank you, Miss Meiren.

471
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:55,520
What's going on?

472
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,478
Let me introduce him.

473
00:30:57,479 --> 00:31:00,679
This is a famous botanist,
Professor Zhuang Yu.

474
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,318
He has just returned from
an exchange visit abroad.

475
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,078
He comes here for field research.

476
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,358
Director Li of Huaguang Unversity Botany

477
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,078
recommends our station.

478
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,159
We were just discussing

479
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,358
the plan and ideas for the preserve.

480
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,040
Associate...

481
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,679
What?

482
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,800
Associate Professor.

483
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:18,159
And an associate professor of botany.

484
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,679
What do you know about bird conservation?
What ideas can you have?

485
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,838
Right.

486
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,159
Miss Meiren, you're from the same university.

487
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,999
Do you know each other?

488
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,560
- No.
- Yes.

489
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,838
Save it.

490
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,478
It's just a matter of fact.

491
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,198
Why do you come to the wildlife station
for field research?

492
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,560
Don't hold me back.

493
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,560
We'll know later.

494
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,159
These two teachers...

495
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,280
Something must be wrong.

496
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,719
Come, sit.

497
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:47,919
Officer Wang,

498
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,039
let me first report to you
about last night's situation.

499
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,919
Professor Zhuang has just called the police.

500
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,640
We have some preliminary information
about the situation.

501
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,160
Now we're here to record the whole case.

502
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,198
That's why he disappeared this morning.

503
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:02,280
He came here to take credit.

504
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,000
Yesterday when I saw
Jia San, he took a call.

505
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,039
The call seems to be from his accomplice.

506
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,399
He called his partner Mr. Wang.

507
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,238
I suspect

508
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:19,280
they have a number of first-class
and second-class animals.

509
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,879
Mr. Wang?

510
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,679
This person Jia San said

511
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,358
might be the guy the villagers mentioned.

512
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,640
I heard that this person is very cunning.

513
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,078
Now in this season,

514
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,920
they have the potential to poach again
in large numbers.

515
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,560
However,

516
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,358
thank you for the valuable clues.

517
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,039
That's all for today.

518
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,039
About the fight against crime,

519
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,039
it's the duty of our police.

520
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,639
If there is a need for you
to cooperate with the investigation,

521
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,838
we will inform you.

522
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,800
That's it. We'll leave now.

523
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,478
Miss Tiantian,

524
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:11,279
President Jin has come to our village
to purchase.

525
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,318
Is this still necessary?

526
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,519
He does his job, I do mine.

527
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,078
Besides, my Taobao
store is still open.

528
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,078
I have a sales promotion.

529
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,880
It sells like hot cakes. Let me show you.

530
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,839
Look.

531
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,399
Your sister took this photo for me last time.

532
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,358
- How is it?
- It's beautiful. If I'm the buyer,

533
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,279
I'm sure I'll place an order too.

534
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,039
Right? Look at the grapes.

535
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,238
How fresh and juicy those grapes are!

536
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,078
Miss Tiantian, it's so hot.

537
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,559
Have some water.

538
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,439
Thank you.

539
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,598
Meinan, after the delivery,

540
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,160
do you have any arrangements?

541
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:52,198
No.

542
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,039
Great.

543
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,598
Are you interested in going to
the market in town tonight

544
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,839
for Chinese Valentine's Day?

545
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,760
What will you do with a girl?

546
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,599
You ask me about it?

547
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,000
I haven't been in love. I don't know.

548
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,520
Who said they were in love?

549
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,280
I didn't mean that.

550
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:22,198
Definitely not in love.

551
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,678
When people fall in love, they're romantic.

552
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,158
Look at these two people.

553
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,359
They left early this morning.

554
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
They can't be in a relationship.

555
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,438
I also remember.

556
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:33,559
What day is it today?

557
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,719
It's not suitable for going out.

558
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,679
Wait a moment, I'll check it for you.

559
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,678
Look.

560
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,439
Well...

561
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:49,959
President Jin...

562
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,800
Have more watermelon.

563
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,079
I'll eat it.

564
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,120
Stop.

565
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,840
Meinan,

566
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:09,158
thank you for bringing me to
such a beautiful place.

567
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,520
Tiantian, for you, I'm
willing to do anything.

568
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,918
The flowers you sent me are also beautiful.

569
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,199
No, Tiantian.

570
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:22,359
No matter how beautiful the flowers are,
they're not as beautiful as you.

571
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,279
You're the most beautiful person in my heart.

572
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,599
Any flower in the world

573
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,438
can't be compared with you.

574
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:29,600
Meinan, you're so sweet.

575
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,279
Am I?

576
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,319
Maybe it's because I had this.

577
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,919
Then I want to taste it too.

578
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,678
- Go.
- What are you going to do?

579
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,359
Hello? Can I borrow an electric tricycle?

580
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,319
The car was driven away by Meinan

581
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,559
to deliver grapes for Tiantian.

582
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,918
Do you need me to ask someone else?

583
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,759
No, thanks.

584
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,039
President Jin, is your source accurate?

585
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,239
This is absolutely reliable.

586
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:07,119
I heard you said you quit this day last time,

587
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,559
I thought that...

588
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,238
I did. But others haven't.

589
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,238
I was worried the grapes would be damaged
on the way.

590
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,319
I brought several extra boxes of grapes,

591
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,319
let's sell them on the night market.

592
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,800
I don't want to bring them back.

593
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,639
Come on.

594
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,039
If we finish early, I'll invite you to lunch.

595
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,760
Come.

596
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,399
Okay.

597
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,479
Come on, hurry up.

598
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,600
This one.

599
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,918
If pretending to be the buyers,

600
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,039
at the time of delivery,

601
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,799
we can capture them and the goods.

602
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,600
No.

603
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,600
Why?

604
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,600
I also saw Jia San yesterday.

605
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,238
He carried a knife with him.

606
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,399
It's too dangerous for you to go.

607
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:46,159
A knife? I didn't see it.

608
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:48,399
It seems that your attention

609
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,800
was drawn to other things.

610
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,759
What are you talking about?

611
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,799
I was too busy watching the moon.

612
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,760
The moon was full yesterday.

613
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,878
What?

614
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:05,919
Miss Meiren, it's impossible to see
the bright moon last night.

615
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:09,438
So you have met yesterday.

616
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,679
- No.
- Yes.

617
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,839
I'm not holding you back.

618
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,359
But if there is no foolproof solution,

619
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,600
we can't act rashly.

620
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,398
But it's breeding season.

621
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,878
If poaching is rampant,

622
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,599
it'll have an incalculable
and serious consequence

623
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,080
on the wild bird populations of Baiyuan.

624
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,839
Not to mention,

625
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,958
Mr. Wang has a batch of first
and second class animals,

626
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:38,478
even more endangered wild birds.

627
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,760
Have you ever thought about these?

628
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:43,560
Although I can't save the world,

629
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,079
to protect your well-being alone,

630
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,159
I'm willing to give it my best shot.

631
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,638
Professor Zhuang,
what's your brilliant plan?

632
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,199
Can you share it with us?

633
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,280
Can I be your WeChat friend?

634
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,199
Yes, for follow-up contact.

635
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,439
Please accept my request.

636
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:27,159
Good, you've learned this trick.

637
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,360
I will appreciate your help.

638
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,239
Well, me too.

639
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,439
Wait a minute.

640
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,639
What?

641
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:06,320
You're scared?

642
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,079
Let me confirm.

643
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,799
Don't you forget something?

644
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,199
What?

645
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,320
Your character setting.

646
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:23,879
Boring.

647
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,479
Where to sit?

648
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,319
Welcome. Please have a seat.

649
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,919
Yes.

650
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,158
What can I help you with?

651
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,319
Thank you, sir.

652
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,439
Ask my wife, please.

653
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,280
What are your special cuisines?

654
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,958
These on the menu.

655
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,119
These are our specialties.

656
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,159
Please.

657
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,639
Do you have any game here?

658
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,879
Like that table.

659
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,519
No.

660
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,599
We're a restaurant.

661
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,840
We don't have any game.

662
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,399
That gentleman is eating chicken.

663
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,678
Sir, drop the act.

664
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,599
We understand.

665
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,080
I want to eat chicken,

666
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,760
wild.

667
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,719
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

668
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,149
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

669
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:52,800
♫ I'm sure you are my future ♫

670
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,638
A foolproof plan, you?

671
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,239
Are you Iron Man or Superman?

672
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,399
Although I can't save the world,

673
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,439
to protect your well-being alone,

674
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,079
I'm willing to give it my best shot.

675
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,119
What danger can there be in broad daylight?

676
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,399
It's just doing business.

677
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,439
What about the delivery?

678
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,320
In broad daylight?

679
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,678
Professor Zhuang,
what's your brilliant plan?

680
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,159
Can you share it with us?

681
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,560
Cutting the watermelon?

682
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,439
Professor Zhuang is really considerate.

683
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,198
But...

684
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,999
You can eat without affecting the lipstick,

685
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,918
can't you?

686
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:37,959
How come you get overwhelmed
by a mere piece of watermelon?

687
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,919
Sometimes I also need to keep it classy.

688
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,279
Professor, you look so handsome.

689
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,679
You're a perfect match with Miss Meiren.

690
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,839
You're like a real couple.

691
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,039
Thank you.

692
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,759
Obviously, I'm the one who helped first.

693
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,039
Professor Zhuang, when I look at your eyes,

694
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,079
I know immediately

695
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,320
your idea of pretending to be a couple.

696
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,399
Is it to protect Miss Meiren?

697
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,919
I told you.

698
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:31,369
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫
