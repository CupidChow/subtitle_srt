[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,019
[Episode 25]

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,980
[Some plants are both medicinal and ornamental,
for example, the corn poppy.]

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,109
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,379
What about it now?

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,300
What do you mean?

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,109
Even in your messy house,

29
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,429
you'd change into your slippers.

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,979
How could you walk in Zhuang's place

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,229
wearing your dirty shoes?

32
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,020
I couldn't get used to the slippers there.

33
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,190
Get used to it then!

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,579
I told you they are not getting on.

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,659
She gets that tantrum from you.

36
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,749
We are getting on.

37
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,579
Getting angry with your partner
is perfectly normal.

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,619
It will be over in a couple of days.

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,149
It is normal.

40
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,070
Not at all.

41
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,309
To be honest,

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,429
after we met Zhuang for the first time,

43
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,309
we weren't sure about your choice.

44
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,899
He's a botanist who
looks stern and cold.

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,589
We didn't think he'd be nice to you.

46
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,429
And then?

47
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,069
Then, we took a closer look at him.

48
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,149
He might not be very talkative.

49
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,260
But he's tidy and clean.

50
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,029
Yeah, he's a Virgo.

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,979
That's not what we mean!

52
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,899
Did you make it clear?

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,509
Of course, I did!

54
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,259
What your father is saying is

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,589
that Zhuang is simple-minded.

56
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,339
The only thing that makes us worried

57
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,149
is your bad temper.

58
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,389
Zhuang might stand you for a short while.

59
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,339
With enough time,

60
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,150
he would be tired of your tantrum.

61
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,789
Alas, men with good nature like me

62
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,430
are rare these days.

63
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,540
But I'm tired of him!

64
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,869
We're assured after this meal.

65
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,620
The way he looked at you tells everything.

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,309
Watch your step.

67
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,259
Hold on.

68
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,389
- Aunt Wang.
- Wait.

69
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,260
Tiantian, here to pick the grapes?

70
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,509
Heading home?

71
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,619
Here you are.

72
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,620
Tiantian.

73
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,869
There you are.

74
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,869
Tiantian.

75
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,899
Why are you here?

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,869
President Jin lives in our hotel.

77
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,899
He wants to take a look at our grapery.

78
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,099
So, I brought him here.

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,509
Whose side are you on?

80
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,699
How could you bring him here?

81
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,509
President Jin said he
wants to try our grapes.

82
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,949
You owe him nothing. He's not your president.

83
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,739
Well, Tiantian.

84
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,149
Don't blame Meinan.

85
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,789
I insist on coming.

86
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,620
You are giving me a hard time!

87
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,870
I'm only here to check on the grapes,

88
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,069
wishing that I could meet you by chance.

89
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,339
That's right. You're colleagues.

90
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,550
Alright, you get along
well with him. Keep going.

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,020
Wait.

92
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,229
I am in a good mood. So, I won't yell at you.

93
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,669
This is my grapery.

94
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,669
You're the one who should go.

95
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,949
You have no right to stay here.

96
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,230
I'd rather take a day off than host you.

97
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,830
It just occurs to me that
I was on to something.

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,670
I mean you no offense.

99
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,669
I just want to help
you trim the grapes,

100
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,740
bag the fruits.

101
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,509
I want to compensate you

102
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,070
for being absent last year.

103
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,390
Maybe it changes nothing.

104
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,300
Still, please give me a chance.

105
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,710
A chance?

106
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,020
Let me think.

107
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,740
You were a fake
cripple, not a fake mute.

108
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,789
We've known each other for a long time.

109
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,179
You had your chances.

110
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,789
You didn't say a word.

111
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,619
I get it.

112
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,989
What is your excuse this time?

113
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,830
Have you lost your memories?

114
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,270
I couldn't bring you back.

115
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,019
All I want is to try my best

116
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,340
to make it up for what I've done.

117
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,390
Forgive me or not,
that is your choice.

118
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,019
Okay.

119
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,179
You want to experience rural life, right?

120
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,509
Enjoying the rural vibe, aren't you?

121
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,070
Fine, I'll give you a brand new experience.

122
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,829
Meinan.

123
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,140
Coming!

124
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,670
I'm coming.

125
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,230
What's up?

126
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,829
He wants to learn about rural life.

127
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,019
Show him how to carry farmyard manure.

128
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,550
What? Manure?

129
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:15,900
That's...

130
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,789
President Jin? Can he handle it?

131
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,109
Are you sure?

132
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,180
I can do that.

133
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,830
Come on. I'll do it.

134
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,790
Here's the carrying pole.

135
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,139
Lead the way.

136
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,390
Sure, follow me.

137
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,110
All it requires is muscle.

138
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,019
There isn't any technique in particular.

139
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,109
President Jin, are you okay?

140
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,229
Doing great.

141
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,710
This is heavy. Does she do this every day?

142
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,950
I help her out occasionally.

143
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,420
As you know,
Tiantian is a tough girl.

144
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,390
She'd do it herself.

145
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,419
President Jin.

146
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,140
Come on.

147
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:29,019
These are too heavy for you.

148
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,740
Walk away.

149
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,510
But...

150
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,509
What's wrong?

151
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,020
That's too heavy!

152
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,829
Not at all.

153
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,179
What you could
do, I can do it, too.

154
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,300
President Jin, you are...

155
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,739
Come with me.

156
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,950
Okay.

157
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,389
I'm telling you.

158
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,709
It's not heavy for me at all.

159
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,669
I could double the weight.

160
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,139
Jin Xi!

161
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,070
Tiantian,

162
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,790
I didn't want to embarrass you.

163
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,710
My heart would ache.

164
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,899
If you are here to apologize,

165
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,420
you've shown your sincerity.

166
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,709
If it makes you feel any better,

167
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,990
consider your apology accepted.

168
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,550
Just go back.

169
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,789
I am here to apologize. But there's more...

170
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,949
If there's anything else,

171
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,420
I can tell you my answer now.

172
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,390
It's a hard no.

173
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,619
Stop wasting your time.

174
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,620
♫ We just let it go ♫

175
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,470
I get it.

176
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,470
I don't deserve you.

177
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,620
Don't worry.

178
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,150
I won't stick around and annoy you.

179
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,070
By the way,

180
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,029
I brought something for you.

181
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,980
Wait here.

182
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,469
♫ How I cherish the moment we spent together ♫

183
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,469
♫ If I could ♫

184
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,269
♫ I want to put on a smile ♫

185
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,100
See? The plant you sent me is blooming.

186
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,540
You are keeping it.

187
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,739
♫ I want to lean on your shoulders ♫

188
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,419
I sent it to you. So, it's yours.

189
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,950
There's no need to show it to me.

190
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,689
♫ I'm tired of pretending ♫

191
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,949
♫ Turns out, it was the happiest moment ♫

192
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,749
♫ when we sit together ♫

193
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,530
♫ enjoying the starlight ♫

194
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,100
Leaving already? You only stay for one night!

195
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,469
I know you're doing well here. That's enough.

196
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,300
I am doing well. You can be assured.

197
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,219
A clean facial makeup for summer,

198
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,420
product placement for Qin Ya's foundation.

199
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,980
I drew it for fun.

200
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,619
I know, you've told me about it.

201
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,659
Having a nice makeup

202
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,469
is the key to grabbing the students' attention.

203
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,030
Right?

204
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:20,860
Exactly! That's it.

205
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,979
Look at you, preparing for the lessons

206
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,589
while working on the makeup.

207
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,390
Don't exhaust yourself.

208
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,300
I know.

209
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,269
Time for breakfast.

210
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,070
Go ahead.

211
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,179
Let's take a look.

212
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,710
What did your father make for you?

213
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,219
Making breakfast right before leaving.

214
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,149
That's too nice of you.

215
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,269
Not a big deal.

216
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,469
We sleep less than you do.

217
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,949
I just make use of the time in the morning.

218
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,779
Come on. Try the dishes.

219
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,029
How about staying for a few more days?

220
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,269
We would like to.

221
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,179
But our village is voted
the most beautiful village.

222
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,859
Visitors emerged in clusters.

223
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,349
A few days ago, some rich man

224
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,710
booked a room for one entire month.

225
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,709
I'm afraid Meinan couldn't handle it.

226
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,979
To be honest, I am worried these days.

227
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,350
He could make mistakes.

228
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,179
Try the pickles.

229
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,420
Especially for you.

230
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,619
Any idea whom I just met?

231
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,539
Who is it?

232
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,590
Zhuang!

233
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,269
I told him we were leaving.

234
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,219
He keeps apologizing to me.

235
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,149
Saying he has a meeting at school,

236
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,619
so he couldn't send us to the station.

237
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,029
He even offers to call a cab for us.

238
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,270
That's so considerate.

239
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,180
Not at all.

240
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,590
Nothing is more
important than his career.

241
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,509
Hello, Qi. Here you are.

242
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,420
Get in.

243
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,299
He's so popular.

244
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,030
We have to issue tickets to
limit the number of people.

245
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,150
Even the aisles are taken.

246
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,069
Hello, Qi.

247
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,710
Hurry up.

248
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,470
Sure.

249
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,859
You've worked hard

250
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,269
on teaching the younger students.

251
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,420
Everyone knows you.

252
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,390
I am popular.

253
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,589
After years of study,
we've found out

254
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,619
how abscisic acid stimulates
the production of Artemisinin.

255
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,099
We breed a highly productive variety
of Artemetin annua.

256
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,619
This could increase the income
for Artemetin annua farmers

257
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,389
and the enterprises.

258
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,779
And it would stabilize the global supply chain

259
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,909
of Artemisinin.

260
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,740
Thanks.

261
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,779
Thank you, Professor Liao.

262
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,219
Thanks to the experts like Professor Liao,

263
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,179
we get to stand on the shoulders of giants

264
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
and march forward.

265
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,100
Please be seated.

266
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,860
By applying metabolic engineering techniques,

267
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,590
we breed a new variety
with strong stress tolerance.

268
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,390
The ratio of Artemisinin weight

269
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,099
to the leaf dry weight has reached 4 percent.

270
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
In the foreseeable future,

271
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,419
I am sure we will keep renewing the record

272
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,910
to 5 percent, even 6 percent.

273
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,590
What was unimaginable is now becoming real.

274
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:43,827
Today since it's an academic symposium,

275
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:45,700
the speakers shouldn't only be me and Liao.

276
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,349
If you want to ask anything,

277
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,270
all questions are welcome.

278
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,470
- Here!
- Pick me!

279
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,150
Professor Zhuang,

280
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:59,739
I'm a student in landscape architecture.

281
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,589
We take many botany classes, too.

282
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,659
But they all focus on landscape design.

283
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,509
As for your research,

284
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,909
it stresses the medicinal use of plants.

285
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,029
What is your idea

286
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,539
on the difference between the two subjects

287
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,029
and their value orientations?

288
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,949
It might be an unprofessional question.

289
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,070
Thanks.

290
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,470
Your question is more
related to aesthetics

291
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,910
rather than botany.

292
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,710
From your perspective,
ornamental plants

293
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,069
such as orchid, lily, and rose

294
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,180
are cultivated for ornament.

295
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,420
For other plants, like
the Artemisia annua,

296
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,950
we're more interested
in its medicinal value.

297
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,510
It may look plain and simple to you.

298
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,620
But to me,

299
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,220
it is beautiful in its own way.

300
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,710
Even though its flowers are small,

301
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,030
it is thriving on its own.

302
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,620
Artemisia annua is not limited
to its medicinal value.

303
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,270
Its flower is appealing as well.

304
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,539
In my opinion,

305
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,390
these two aspects don't conflict with each other

306
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,779
There are plants

307
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,910
with both medicinal and ornamental values.

308
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,390
For example,

309
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,510
the corn poppy.

310
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,799
♫ I wouldn't hesitate even if it's raining ♫

311
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,579
♫ The wind breezes after the rain ♫

312
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,219
♫ There you stand the breeze,
watching the rainbow ♫

313
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,540
It can be used as a herb.

314
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,660
The bloom looks great, too.

315
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,470
Being perspective enough,
and you'll see its beauty.

316
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,830
I hope you'll find my answer useful.

317
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,219
Are you sure that he's
unapproachable and remote?

318
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,589
He sounds affectionate!

319
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,830
I feel the same!

320
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,469
Next question.

321
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,779
Over here!

322
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,980
Look at me.

323
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,509
Professor Zhuang,

324
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,539
you've got tenure in a college abroad.

325
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,470
Why do you come back?

326
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,300
Both you and I

327
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,510
are lucky enough

328
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,420
to live in this prosperous time.

329
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,179
Our predecessors went through

330
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,029
obstacles in many aspects.

331
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,909
Back now, our technology

332
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,589
is mature and advanced enough.

333
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,779
I went on academic visits

334
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,420
to communicate with other botanists.

335
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,909
We are not limited by
equipment or technology now.

336
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,590
Science has no national boundaries.

337
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,910
But scientists have their motherland.

338
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,180
For me,

339
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,300
there is something more valuable here

340
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,149
than a tenure.

341
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,069
Professor Zhuang, what
is the greatest challenge

342
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,390
you encountered when studying abroad?

343
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,180
Homesickness.

344
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,089
♫ I buried my fears deep down in my heart ♫

345
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,800
♫ I buried them in the desert ♫

346
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,419
To be more specific,

347
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,870
it's stimulation, rather than a challenge.

348
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,350
Only by finishing my study,

349
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,180
can I come back early.

350
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,539
That is the cure for my nostalgia.

351
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,599
♫ The sunshine passes through the dark clouds ♫

352
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,019
♫ lighting up the space between us ♫

353
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,019
♫ It leads me to you ♫

354
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,240
♫ my dream ♫

355
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,140
That's the nature of birds.

356
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,749
Is it fair to judge the birds

357
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,420
according to our moral standards?

358
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,749
Do humans have moral standards?

359
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,070
That's new to me.

360
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,749
You used to chime.

361
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,110
Why are you silent today?

362
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:26,070
[Yu Meiren's moments]

363
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,469
The symposium is a huge success.

364
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,749
I'm here to celebrate.

365
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,350
Don't pull a long face.

366
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,539
A minimal error...

367
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,590
Resulting in a wide divergence already?

368
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,899
I know you're good at making coffee.

369
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,870
But I paid much for this drink.

370
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,660
It can't be that bad.

What a waste of money!

373
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,299

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,470
Nothing.

That's interesting.

378
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,379
You turned your Wechat notification off.

379

I'm not as close to you as a net friend.

382

What a pity!

383
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,139
Wechat is for messaging.

384

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,900
and turning to Penny.

557
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,299
I must say, Yu is nice to you.

558
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,420
You can't do this to her.

559
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,019
By the way,

560
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,380
I saw Yu together with Lv Jian yesterday.

561
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,070
[Forgive Jin Xi's mistake
unconditionally for once.]

562
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,140
Keep this.

563
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,540
Show it to me if you can indulge me.

564
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,779
If you can't,

565
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,499
toss it away, burn it, tear it apart.

566
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,380
I won't bother you again.

567
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,420
Jin Xi, you are an idiot.

568
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,990
What are you looking at? You look obsessed.

569
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,419
A TV show.

570
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,230
Quit it. You've got a visitor.

571
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,870
Tiantian.

572
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,629
Why did you bring him here?

573
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,109
He's our guest.

574
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,109
And he does a great favor to our village.

575
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,659
I must host him.

576
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,989
Don't you think about expelling him.

577
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,139
She did this out of politeness.

578
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,419
Don't take it seriously.

579
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,469
Mind your language. Manners!

580
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,349
It's alright.

581
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,660
I owe it to her. I deserve this.

582
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,779
Mind your language.

583
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,589
Alas. Carry on.

584
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,750
Thanks, grandma.

585
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,660
Don't worry, I will not bother you.

586
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,020
Why are you here then?

587
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,750
I'm here to say goodbye.

588
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,870
I think about

589
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:34,420
what you said to me in the grapery.

590
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,870
You are right.

591
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,900
It is my fault.

592
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,990
I have no right

593
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,110
to ask you to forgive
me like it was nothing.

594
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,260
It's good that you can figure it out.

595
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,630
That's the way out. You may leave.

596
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,149
♫ I think of your eyesight ♫

597
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,530
♫ The rain drops on my faces ♫

598
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:08,239
♫ It is caring about me ♫

599
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,289
♫ How I wish to stand by your side ♫

600
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,129
♫ and lean on your shoulder ♫

601
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,419
♫ How I cherish the moment we spent together ♫

602
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,999
♫ If I could ♫

603
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,139
♫ I want to put on a smile ♫

604
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,070
Tiantian.

605
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,630
Tiantian!

606
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,630
Why are you back?

607
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,470
Do you remember this?

608
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,470
Maybe you won't go to the city again.

609
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,139
This gift might be useful to you.

610
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,590
I won't accept your gift.

611
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,659
This might be the last thing I do for you.

612
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,469
Please, keep it.

613
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,299
Or I'd be worried about you. Please.

614
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,589
You can worry about me
as you want. I don't care.

615
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,299
Just take it. I'm begging you.

616
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,659
- I don't want it.
- Keep it.

617
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,469
Take it away.

618
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,749
Please.

619
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,110
You dropped this.

620
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,070
[Forgive Jin Xi's mistake
unconditionally for once.]

621
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,420
Are you still keeping this?

622
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,299
It's just a waste.

623
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,830
Not a big deal.

624
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,989
I thought you've thrown
it away. I didn't expect...

625
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,469
You should expect nothing!

626
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,499
Stop overthinking.

627
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,750
Okay, I will.

628
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,299
It just occurs to me

629
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,589
I booked the hotel for an entire month.

630
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,869
Is it okay to check out now?

631
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,659
I don't care.

632
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,659
I don't run the hotel anyway.

633
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,349
Enough. Just go.

634
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,140
Take it.

635
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:54,469
Take it with you.

636
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,829
I'll give it to you the next time.

637
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,630
Just go. I don't want it.

638
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:57,539
Next time.

639
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,710
- Just leave!
- Come on.

640
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,420
That's right.

641
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,260
Grandma.

642
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:04,900
It works out.

643
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,779
Stop talking.

644
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,259
I don't want to see you now.

645
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,390
What about later?

646
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,429
Grandma, I'm heading to the grapery.

647
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,389
Have lunch without me. And you!

648
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,300
Don't you follow me!

649
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,459
Leaving.

650
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,150
Leaving already?

651
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,070
[Library]

652
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,829
What are you looking for?

653
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,670
This.

654
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,829
The British publish an article

655
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,190
about a productive Artemisia annua
for African countries.

656
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,669
The breeding of Artemisia annua

657
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,019
isn't all about the weight content.

658
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,190
We need more biomass, too.

659
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,349
Both two aspects require our attention.

660
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,069
Hold on. Make it stop.

661
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,019
Would you please pay some attention

662
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,260
to your private life?

663
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,190
Take two weeks off.

664
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,069
Have some fun.

665
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,189
Enjoy your time like other young people.

666
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,109
Mei isn't around.

667
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,070
Really? What is she up to?

668
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,869
We'll find it out soon enough.

669
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,670
Let me see it.

670
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,390
Get yourself a new watch?

671
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,259
It's lunchtime.

672
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,300
Shall we have lunch together?

673
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,110
Lv.

674
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,979
Director Li, Professor Zhuang.

675
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,070
By the way, I saw
you with Yu yesterday.

676
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,189
Hello, dad? Sorry, Director Li.

677
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,219
My dad is calling.

678
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,189
I'll talk to you later.

679
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,069
I'm with you. Go ahead.

680
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,940
Hold on.

681
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,390
That's not the right interface.

682
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,869
He must hang up by accident.

683
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,300
I'll call him back.

684
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,669
Yes, dad? Why did you hang up the phone?

685
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,630
Sure.

686
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,700
There is no signal here.

687
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,739
Is that so? I must head out then.

688
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,910
Stop it.

689
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,349
These are eggs of apple snails.

690
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,539
I know it.

691
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,299
I saw it in my village. The snail feed on rice.

692
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,349
There's more.

693
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,349
Apple snails take up the living space

694
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,779
of the original aquatic life.

695
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,539
It is devastating to the native creatures.

696
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,349
As a result, we must guard up

697
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,669
against the invasive species.

698
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,629
Get rid of the eggs.

699
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,259
Alright, let's split up.

700
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,460
- Sure.
- Go!

701
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,020
There's more.

702
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,300
There are plenty here!

703
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,740
Here, have some water.

704
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,069
Are you alright?

705
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,220
Thanks, Ms. Yu. I'm fine.

706
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,219
Let's take a break and have some water.

707
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,700
Don't get heat stroke.

708
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,349
Why are there so many eggs?

709
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,259
They are highly productive.

710
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,539
Their breeding seasons

711
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,539
last from March to November.

712
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,739
One female snail produces
around 10,000 eggs per year.

713
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,020
It is a huge number.

714
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,779
Picking up snails and removing eggs.

715
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,979
This is exhausting.

716
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,390
Are there any other solutions?

717
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,389
We could set up nets

718
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,939
by the river bank and the rice field.

719
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,389
But the net could bring trouble to the birds.

720
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,939
The good news is,

721
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,739
water birds like the Eurasian teal

722
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,219
feed on infant apple snails.

723
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,070
They share much of our workload.

724
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,459
According to the weather forecast,

725
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,669
it could be rainy tomorrow.

726
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,869
Let's work harder.

727
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,349
We could take a rest tomorrow.

728
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,829
Ms. Yu, I'll team up with you.

729
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,189
Let's take turns.

730
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,259
Take a rest. Don't get sunstroke.

731
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,389
Ms. Yu.

732
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,669
We tried so hard to have you

733
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,019
here to guide us as an expert.

734
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,189
We can't just watch you work

735
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,779
while we have a rest.

736
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,589
Don't call me an expert.

737
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,979
I'm only here to help.

738
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,459
By the way, no need to call me Ms. Yu.

739
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,189
Just refer to me as Yu or Meiren.

740
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,070
Well... That's it. Sit
down and have a rest.

741
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,259
Alright. Thanks, Meiren.

742
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,390
You're welcome.

743
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,429
Polished as you are,
you can't handle this.

744
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,389
The axe is slippery, that's all.

745
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,740
Let me try again.

746
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,389
Fine. That's it. Alright.

747
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,220
I've got enough firewood for today.

748
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,539
Why don't you go to the grapery for Tiantian?

749
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,629
She's bagging the grapes today.

750
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,109
She doesn't want to see me.

751
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,589
A bad mood will slow her down.

752
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,429
That would make it worse.

753
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,589
I'd rather not annoy her.

754
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,699
I'll wait for her here.

755
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,629
The way I know about her,

756
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,629
she barks worse than her bite.

757
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,589
Don't mind her.

758
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,390
She didn't mean it.

759
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,699
Alright. Have a rest. Time to cook.

760
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,540
Sure.

761
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,189
Why are you here?

762
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,389
Grandma, I may not be good at chopping wood.

763
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,069
But I am a cooking expert.

764
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,869
Take a guess if she'll like my dishes.

765
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,830
You got it.

766
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,980
That...

767
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,219
It's an old house. Didn't
have time to get it repaired.

768
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,349
It will keep the water out

769
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,699
if it drizzles. Like today.

770
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,780
What if it's heavy rain?

771
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,940
Heavy rain?

772
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,149
You've worked hard. After setting this up,

773
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:23,940
let's eat watermelons together.

774
00:40:23,941 --> 00:40:25,909
- Thanks!
- Thanks!

775
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,110
Gather around.

776
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,459
One banner for each.

777
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,500
Sure.

778
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,219
What's going on, Xue?

779
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,069
Let's take a look.

780
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,670
Hurry up.

781
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,940
Look.

782
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,779
What happened?
[The birds in this scene are made by CG.]

783
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,830
How did this happen?

784
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,150
- No way!
- Who did this?

785
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,299
Grandma.

786
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,980
You should try these dishes I made.

787
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,980
Tiantian.

788
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,869
There aren't enough gradients to make desserts.

789
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,739
But I've laid brown sugar

790
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,940
on the rice cakes. It must be sweet enough.

791
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,590
Why are you still here?

792
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,109
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

793
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,589
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

794
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,439
♫ I'm sure you are ♫

795
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,140
♫ my future ♫

796
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,260
Congrats on graduation.

797
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,219
This watch for the fossil, are you sure?

798
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,539
I own this watch for years.

799
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,870
So, I guess, I'm pretty sure.

800
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,019
Once it's mine,

801
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,500
it'll be too late for you to regret it.

802
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,670
I won't. Something is just worth more.

803
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,149
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

804
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:41,449
