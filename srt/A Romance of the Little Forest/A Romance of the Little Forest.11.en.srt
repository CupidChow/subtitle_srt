00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,759
The portion is so small.

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,598
It's far from enough!

27

Yes!

They kept rubbing it in.

00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,718
You look nice with that hat.

189
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,118
Really?

190
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,760
Is it good?

191
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,319
You didn't even tell me.

192
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,999
What's the rush?

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,879
You must be perfect in your boyfriend's eyes.

194
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,519
That's why he's paying for it.

195
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,798
Is that so?

196
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,400
Is that so?

197
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,999
I'll take that one, too.

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,918
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

199
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,839
My boyfriend, what's the rush?

200
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,319
Are you shy?

201
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,759
It's raining heavily. Let's go.

202
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,479
See?

203
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,400
I've got this for you.

204
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,080
Stay still.

205
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,719
Besides, it's not heavy rain.

206
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,880
Look at me.

207
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,359
Sprained your ankle?

208
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,999
Can you walk?

209
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,038
Stay here.

210
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,119
I'll go get help.

211
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,840
Hold on.

212
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,478
Don't push yourself too hard.

213
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,358
You might hurt yourself.

214
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,959
I'm okay. I can handle it.

215
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,119
Let me have a try.

216
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,679
Come up.

217
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,358
Your hand.

218
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:27,918
I could still walk.

219
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,918
Alright. I am slender.

220
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,840
I'm sure you can handle it.

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,359
You're back!

222
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,118
What happened?

223
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:56,999
What's wrong?

224
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,478
Put her down.

225
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,238
Hurry. Steady.

226
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,118
What happened?

227
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,839
Are you alright?

228
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,839
What's wrong?

229
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,399
It's me.

230
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,798
I sprained my ankle.

231
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,999
You were fine before going out!

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,199
How did you get hurt?

233
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,718
I fell down in the market.

234
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,238
You're an adult.

235
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,319
You should have been more careful!

236
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,798
It's my fault.

237
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,080
I should have taken care of Mei.

238
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,519
What did he just say?

239
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,558
Is it true?

240
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,439
Zhuang, it's too kind of you.

241
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,439
How can we blame it on you?

242
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,478
It's all her fault.

243
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,119
That's right.

244
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,319
Stop standing there.

245
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,759
Grab an ice pack.

246
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,439
I'll go get it.

247
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,158
Let me see. Which one is it?

248
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,439
It's okay, mom.

249
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,039
I'm fine.

250
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,919
I'm your mom. Let me see.

251
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,679
It moves freely.

252
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,079
It hurts.

253
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,960
Is it here?

254
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,319
What should we do?

255
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,839
It's not bruising or swollen.
You should be fine.

256
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,839
No way!

257
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,558
It's so painful!

258
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,319
Mind your tone! He's your boyfriend.

259
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,558
Stop yelling.

260
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,478
That's intimidating.

261
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,439
Who are you yelling at?

262
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,879
Here is your ice pack.

263
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,959
Hurry. Apply it to your ankle.

264
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,759
Following my instruction word by word,
is that right?

265
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,918
Can't you get a towel?

266
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,238
It's freezing cold!

267
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,079
Sorry, my bad.

268
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,839
It slipped my mind.

269
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,999
I'll go fetch it now.

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
See?

271
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,079
That's your dad.

272
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,118
It's alright. I'll go to my room.

273
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,319
I can take care of myself.

274
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,718
I can do it.

275
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,719
I can bear with it.

276
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,358
Do you need a hand?

277
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:37,119
Not at all! Light as I am,
He can handle it well.

278
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,558
Seriously?

279
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm afraid Professor
Zhuang's waist couldn't take it.

280
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,118
It's too cold!

281
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,000
Must I apply it for
the next few days?

282
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,958
Anyway, now I've got an excuse.

283
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,039
I could stick around Professor Zhuang.

284
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,040
In no time,
I will take him down.

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,399
Looks like it's going on well.

286
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,799
Strike the iron while it's hot.

287
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,520
I've got it under control.

288
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,199
Thanks to my makeup skill,
my face is pretty enough.

289
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:59,199
Why isn't he attracted at all?

290
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,559
Only one thing stops you
from achieving your dream.

291
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,519
The fear of failure.

292
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,279
As the top scorer in College Entrance Examination,

293
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,718
and a talented student,

294
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,478
he could have chosen a more profitable career.

295
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,039
To everyone's surprise,
he enrolled in a career

296
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,078
that has nothing to do with money.

297
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,919
What's more, he stuck to this rule

298
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,318
and went on his study on Artemisinin.

299
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,718
He's dedicated to solve
a world-class problem.

300
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,838
He's just like the young boy

301
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,640
determined to go through the
desert to locate the pyramid.

302
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,920
What is this place?

303
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,560
The pyramid.

304
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,800
The Alchemist.

305
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,319
It's burning here.

306
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
Zhuang Yu!

307
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,159
It's so hot here.

308
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,760
Why aren't you even sweating?

309
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,280
Me?

310
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,198
Where are we heading?

311
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:43,199
To the place we didn't even dream of.

312
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,439
- Sure.
- Wait.

313
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,160
We...

314
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,958
No, I can't go with you.

315
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,359
Why is that?

316
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,920
I don't want partners with shallow sulcus.

317
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,319
Sister.

318
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,879
How could you do that to me?

319
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
Hooking up with me then walking away?

320
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,439
Sis, why are you sleeping here?

321
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:25,598
Sis, are you having a bad dream?

322
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,880
I saw a ghost in my dream.

323
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,079
Why are you here?

324
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,959
It's time for breakfast.

325
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,639
Are you alright?

326
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,679
What do you mean?

327
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,279
Your feet. How do you feel?

328
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,718
I feel great.

329
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:42,119
Mom said you sprained your ankle.

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,838
That's right.

331
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,880
I just woke up. I'm a little confused.

332
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,078
Sis, you could take a rest in the bed.

333
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,199
I can bring the breakfast up.

334
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,958
Look at you.

335
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,118
Caring as you are!

336
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,199
I'll go, then.

337
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,119
I hate bad dreams!

338
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
[Happy Qixi Festival! The market is gorgeous!]

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,519
What's going on with her?

340
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,118
Of the nine pictures,

341
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,039
only one of them barely shows her face.

342
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,000
With no photographer around her,
it could be hard for her.

343
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,400
The scenery looks fine.

344
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:31,479
Never mind, wait for her vlog.

345
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,718
By the way,
the golf clubs you ordered have arrived.

346
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,079
That's what I'm talking about.

347
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,078
It's worth the money.

348
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,839
Good.

349
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,439
[President's Office]

350
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,799
Tell me about it.

351
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,039
How did you get it under control?

352
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,160
Get me out of the exploitation of the capitalist.

353
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,318
Seriously?

354
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,760
Come on, Yu Meiren.

355
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,399
It's the 21st century!

356
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,318
Even the TV shows don't use
the cliche excuse of the sprain.

357
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,479
Tiantian!

358
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:23,959
Coming.

359
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,719
President Jin.

360
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,438
Why are you sitting there?

361
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:32,520
Are you practicing skiing?

362
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,879
It's not skiing.

363
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,839
It's golf.

364
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,079
Actually,

365
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,078
I've always wanted to be a golfer.

366
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,760
But, because of my legs,

367
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,800
I could never achieve it.

368
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:53,479
I could only sit higher
and swing my clubs.

369
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,760
Pretending to be the young
man who stands on his legs.

370
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,198
Sir, if that's all,
I'll get back to work.

371
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,520
Sure, go ahead.

372
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,920
I get it.

373
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
You do?

374
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:23,280
To be honest,
it's my dream to be a weather forecaster.

375
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,439
But, due to my poor hearing,
I would never get there.

376
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,159
Still,
a dream isn't about achieving it.

377
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,999
As long as I work hard,
get one step closer to my dream,

378
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,959
that's enough.

379
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,640
What should I do?

380
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,400
That's another lie.

381
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:45,640
Cheer up.

382
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,839
Sure, cheer up.

383
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,680
What were you talking about at the door?

384
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,118
Nothing.

385
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:00,040
It's a test for my bestie's acting skills.

386
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:05,599
Cliche or not,
it works. That's all!

387
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,040
Leave it at the door.

388
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,879
Wrong side.

389
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,000
I...

390
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,560
Take me as a harpy eagle,
showing one side of my face.

391
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,640
Your feet.

392
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,039
Oh no!

393
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,438
That's why my feet hurts!

394
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,839
I was standing on the wrong foot.

395
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,280
What are you doing here?

396
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,079
This is yours.

397
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,239
Thanks.

398
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,958
Anything else?

399
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,319
The ice has melted.

400
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,318
Well, well.

401
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,039
It is working!

402
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,959
No wonder I feel
much better now.

403
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,639
Yu Meinan said,
he couldn't deliver today's breakfast.

404
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,199
He asked me to carry you to the dining room.

405
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,358
Oh, okay.

406
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,438
Let me finish my makeup.

407
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,439
In five minutes.

408
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:43,920
Did I give myself away?

409
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,559
Yu Meiren.

410
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,639
Why are you still so nervous when seeing him?

411
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,880
How useless!

412
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:04,079
Gorgeous.

413
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,000
Where is he?

414
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,718
That's the first time I finished my makeup

415
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,199
before someone shows up.

416
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,718
What is that?

417
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:21,999
There you are, Meiren.

418
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,919
Feeling any better?

419
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,079
Yeah, thanks.

420
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,239
Did you build this Sushi conveyor belt?

421
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,879
Just for fun.

422
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,879
Fooling around, you know.

423
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,238
Don't laugh at me.

424
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,478
That's great!

425
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,438
I love it, fooling around.

426
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,598
Look at you.

427
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,399
Good at taking pictures,
creative, and full of crazy ideas.

428
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,958
You're gifted!

429
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,919
If you become a blogger,

430
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,318
you might receive 10,000 followers in a day!

431
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,319
Really?

432
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,358
I'm flattered.

433
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,039
Thanks.

434
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,679
Why do we have to focus on one career?

435
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,159
What's wrong with sidelines?

436
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,760
It's great if you succeed at your sideline,
too.

437
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,198
Hardworking as you are,

438
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,599
you must be great at your main job, too.

439
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,519
I'll get going.

440
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,759
Why not stay and share it?

441
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,000
Thanks, my parents are waiting.

442
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,560
The student of yours is adorable.

443
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,880
What took you so long?

444
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm stuffed.

445
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,359
What's wrong?

446
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,358
What's this?

447
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,319
Pulling a long face suddenly.

448
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,280
Why so hurry?

449
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,078
Put it down.

450
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,400
There they are.

451
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,719
Slowly.

452
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,800
Come on. Here.

453
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:54,879
Take your seat.

454
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,319
Meiren.

455
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,639
How are your feet?

456
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,958
I feel better...

457
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,719
I'm afraid it takes me one week to recover.

458
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,760
Come on.

459
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:09,199
Would you grab that for me?

460
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:20,119
Come on, the bum did nothing wrong.

461
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,719
I'm choking.

462
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,599
Would someone grab me a drink?

463
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,319
Professor Zhuang, would you pour me a drink?

464
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,559
Meiren.

465
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,478
Did you injure your hands, too?

466
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,679
Help yourself.

467
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,438
Zhuang is wounded in his hands for real.

468
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,238
Don't you boss him around.

469
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,399
- Zhuang.
- It's fine.

470
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,920
Don't mind her.

471
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,680
I'll do it.

472
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:58,560
Let me do it.

473
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,039
Keep eating.

474
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,439
I'll peel this egg for you.

475
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,958
By the way, the conversation isn't over yet.

476
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,639
You are injured because of me.

477
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,479
I must take responsibility.

478
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,560
It's just a scratch.

479
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,520
It heals in no time.

480
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,400
Is he suggesting something?

481
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,958
Be careful the next time.

482
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,280
The ice pack.

483
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,160
It's cold!

484
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,238
That way, it recovers faster.

485
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,319
Hold it yourself.

486
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,439
Do you know the saying?

487
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:35,880
The green beans and...

488
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:37,599
Shut it.

489
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,719
The mother-in-law is
cheered up by her son-in-law.

490
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,639
Zhuang is so nice to Meiren.

491
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,119
You're right.

492
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,520
Look at you.

493
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,520
Forget about it.

494
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,159
You've found it out.

495
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,760
Don't overestimate your acting skill.

496
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,760
Even after finding it out,
you still cooperate with me.

497
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,040
Does that mean that
you enjoy this show?

498
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,199
I wouldn't mind it if you
want to take a step further.

499
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Who's there?

500
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,159
Oh, crap.

501
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,040
My mom must have heard it.

502
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,680
The door isn't very dense.

503
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,719
And it's not thick.

504
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,318
And it's a flat door.

505
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,479
What does that mean?

506
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,479
It has wider gaps.

507
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,559
I see. It's a thin door with a low density,

508
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,519
and with gaps on the edges
It doesn't insulate sounds.

509
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,478
That's only theory.

510
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:33,119
Let's practice.

511
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,560
See if you hear me.

512
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,560
Zhuang Yu is a stupid...

513
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,040
Thanks for the compliment.

514
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,319
What should we do now?

515
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,479
We can't act forever.

516
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,599
Just tell them the truth.

517
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,399
Professor Zhuang,
I don't like that.

518
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,279
I've told you many times.

519
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,838
I love you for real.

520
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,719
Bear that in mind.

521
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,959
What about your attitude
towards fooling around?

522
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,879
If you become a blogger,

523
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,639
you might receive 10,000 followers in a day!

524
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,719
Really?

525
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,639
I'm flattered.

526
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,039
Thanks.

527
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,478
Why do we have to focus on one career?

528
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,919
What's wrong with sidelines?

529
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,920
It's great if you succeed at your sideline,
too.

530
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,598
Professor Zhuang,
you know it already. Stop testing me.

531
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,239
You just get what you want.

532
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,879
Look at you.

533
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,238
What's that face?

534
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,559
It's cute.

535
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,198
I'll talk to my mom.

536
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:43,760
Wait for me.

537
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,520
We need to work out a plan.

538
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,520
Mom.

539
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,519
Mom!

540
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,239
What are you up to?

541
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,238
You scared me.

542
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,040
Were you looking for me?

543
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,718
I got you some fruits.

544
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:16,919
I sent it to your room.

545
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,039
The door is shut.

546
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,358
I don't want to disturb you.

547
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,319
Take the plate and go.

548
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,838
What are you thinking?

549
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,958
Nothing, really.

550
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,199
For real?

551
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,358
Don't worry about me.

552
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,719
All I wish for you is the
happiness with your boyfriend.

553
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,958
Did you hear something?

554
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:38,839
Nope.

555
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,279
Did you say anything
I'm not supposed to hear?

556
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,559
No way! Where's my dad?

557
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,640
No idea.

558
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,920
I'm leaving then.

559
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,439
She's not acting normal. It's for sure!

560
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,839
I'm doomed.

561
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,400
She must have heard it.

562
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,719
The flowers look great!

563
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,520
Thanks for sparing some time for me.

564
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,478
Back to the topic.

565
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:15,158
Mom is acting abnormal.

566
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,679
Help me with it.

567
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,638
Firstly,
she said she was intended to send me fruits,

568
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,478
she left after seeing my door was shut.

569
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,638
Usually,
she'd come in without knocking at the door.

570
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,759
Since when she's learned
to respect my privacy.

571
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,759
People can learn.

572
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,718
Besides, I walked normally just now.

573
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,520
And she didn't notice.

574
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,080
She might think

575
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,479
you can heal very fast, like a dog.

576
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,319
Most importantly,
I asked her where my dad was.

577
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,918
She said she didn't know it!

578
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:46,599
My dad is a henpeck.

579
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,678
Mom knows every
detail of his movement.

580
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,638
Even if she doesn't ask,
dad would report to her.

581
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,599
But now, either she didn't ask,

582
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,478
or she didn't listen to my
dad when he reported to her.

583
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,639
Whichever it is,
it's suspicious.

584
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Don't you think so?

585
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,918
I suppose she's gratified.

586
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:08,759
How's that possible?

587
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,999
She must be angry with me.

588
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,600
Why would she be gratified?

589
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,840
Now you've followed her example
and become a detective.

590
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,638
Thanks. Hold on!

591
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,359
If she was that great,
it would be even trickier!

592
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,879
My only suggestion is

593
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,478
tell her the truth.

594
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:29,560
Of course!

595
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,638
I couldn't disclose the
details of what's happening.

596
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:36,280
Anyway, that's how it is going.

597
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,718
That's my bestie.

598
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,239
She can't live without me,
her love consultant.

599
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,120
No wonder you're occupied, Yu Meiren.

600
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,679
Hold on.

601
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,999
Love consultant.

602
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,918
That's right.

603
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,199
Don't I look like one?

604
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,398
I didn't expect

605
00:35:57,399 --> 00:36:00,280
I could date someone who's a match. I love it!

606
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:03,079
Of course, you do!

607
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,918
With all due respect.

608
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:08,238
President Jin,
if there's anything bothering you,

609
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,359
feel free to talk to me.

610
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,399
Maybe, I could help you out.

611
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,878
I'm sure you could help me out.

612
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:19,359
But... But it's hard to
share it with a stranger.

613
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,799
Right? I get it.

614
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,159
Tell me when you're ready.

615
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:28,718
President Jin,
is there any private schedule tonight?

616
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,398
Not at all. Get off work on time.

617
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,760
Great!

618
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,520
Yes! I could finally date on time.

619
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,119
Date?

620
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,039
She's got a date?

621
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,079
No way. Being honest now
and we'd end up with a disaster.

622
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,879
They'd kill us. That's for sure.

623
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,159
Please save my life.

624
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
Life-threatening?

625
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,958
You may call the police.

626
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:03,959
I couldn't help you
with the potential crime.

627
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:08,198
We could solve this without
bothering the police for sure!

628
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:12,079
How about we make it happen for real?

629
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,040
Maybe they'd believe us then.

630
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,438
I'm heading to the mountains.

631
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,399
Couldn't help you with that.

632
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,600
Is it the bud stage now?

633
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,999
Cui, what's wrong?

634
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,238
Stop pulling a long face.

635
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,119
Are we in debt or what?

636
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,199
Don't jinx it!

637
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,280
Listen up.

638
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,198
Don't you listen.

639
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,559
I haven't heard it yet.

640
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,438
Not you! You!

641
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:57,599
Go trim the vegetables.

642
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,718
I've trimmed a bowl of vegetables.

643
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,759
Go for the second one.

644
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,199
Hurry up.

645
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,438
Well, it's...

646
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,319
Calm down.

647
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,878
Take your time.

648
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,559
Meinan! You've worked hard!

649
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,918
So many vegetables!

650
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,638
Are we receiving guests?

651
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,478
Not at all.

652
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,319
I just finished with this bowl.

653
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,398
Mom asked me to trim the others.

654
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,359
Here comes the vegetarian menu.

655
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,918
What are they talking about there?

656
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,678
No idea. Looks fishy.

657
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,438
They're avoiding us.

658
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:34,239
By the way, are your legs fully recovered?

659
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:40,199
Sure! Young as I am,
I recover in no time!

660
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,439
Dad, mom,
what are you talking about?

661
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,079
Never fill up the cup with tea.

662
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,559
Only fill it if it's wine.

663
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,359
Have you forgotten the traditions and virtues?

664
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,119
Traditions and virtues?

665
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,639
Is she warning me to be honest?

666
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,839
I get it.

667
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,519
Looks like you have something on your mind.

668
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,718
I'm here to care about you.

669
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,718
Why? Are you afraid that I'd
misbehave and get dumped?

670
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,559
Well,
Zhuang... Zhuang must know about them.

671
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,159
Zhuang?

672
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,119
Look at him, he's graceful and reliable.

673
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,398
It's just that he's too busy.

674
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,359
He might not have enough time to teach you.

675
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,039
What does that mean?

676
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,878
Does she know that I'm aware

677
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:27,279
Zhuang is too busy to help me out?

678
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,079
No way!

679
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,398
Zhuang and I talked a lot.

680
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:34,320
We talk about everything,
from poems to philosophy.

681
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,039
Dad, what about Zhuang?

682
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,800
I...

683
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:48,280
Never mind. It's nothing.

684
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:55,120
Zhuang! Zhuang!

685
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,399
Zhuang.

686
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,878
Zhuang.

687
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:03,319
I don't have your Wechat, right?

688
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,919
I'll scan your QR code now.

689
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,039
What? Talking to him in private?

690
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,159
Going for the easy target.

691
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,879
See? There it is.

692
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,879
Good.
[Zhuang Yu's moments]

693
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,198
Zhuang, I didn't see any photo

694
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,279
of you and her in your moments.

695
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,398
Crap!

696
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:29,119
Would anyone save me?

697
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,079
That's right.

698
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,279
Say something.

699
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,999
Anything.

700
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,600
What to say?

701
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,199
Meiren doesn't like the previous photos.

702
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,119
That's right.

703
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,799
Once we have the perfect photos,

704
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,919
we will post them immediately.

705
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,840
Give it to me.

706
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:54,958
Professor Zhuang.

707
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,198
Thank you for saving my life.

708
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,759
I will repay you for the rest of my life.

709
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,560
That's two lifetimes now.

710
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,119
You're keeping a record.

711
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,239
That's to say,
you don't want to leave me, right?

712
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:08,839
Don't overestimate yourself.

713
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,439
You owe it to me. Time to repay.

714
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,918
Zhuang.

715
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:14,198
You don't post a lot, do you?

716
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,559
I...

717
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,878
It's about time.

718
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,398
Time to dance.

719
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:20,678
Or Wang Xiumei would take your place
as the leader.

720
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,239
That's right.

721
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,639
Time to dance.

722
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,239
Meinan, don't forget to cook for them.

723
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,519
What you hear may not be true.

724
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,958
We need to know more about him.

725
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,799
That's right.

726
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,359
To know more?

727
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,520
What does that mean?

728
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:37,878
Real knowledge comes from practice.

729
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:40,549
Just wait and see. And you'll know.

730
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,749
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

731
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,549
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

732
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,099
♫ I'm sure you are ♫

733
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,300
♫ my future ♫

734
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:12,799
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

735
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,799
What was that?

736
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,919
Where is the bonus scene?

737
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:19,639
The writer must have run out of ideas.

738
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,360
Time to sleep.

739
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:28,919
Come on, the writer is such a slacker.

740
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:33,000
Go to bed.

741
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,669
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

742
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,969
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

743
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:52,039
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

744
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,240
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

745
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,269
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

747
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,589
♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

748
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,040
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

749
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,839
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

750
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,269
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

751
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,269
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

752
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,520
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

753
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:24,369
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

754

760
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,770

761
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,639

762
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,089

763
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:09,089

770
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,819
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

771
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:48,689
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

772
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:54,070
