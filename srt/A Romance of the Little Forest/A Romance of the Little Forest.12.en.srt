The purpose of the field trip is different,

187
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:53,759
so we have to design the trip accordingly.

188
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,079
Yes, it seems that our purposes

189
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,999
are not the same.

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,719
But why don't you go up in the daytime?

191
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,440
I don't want to miss the blossoms.

192
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,598
This store is really good.

193
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,999
It's hard to buy these, right?

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,118
Little thing.

195
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,959
I have to thank you.

196
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,999
If you like,

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,640
I can buy you every day in the company.

198
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,839
No need.

199
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,238
No merit, no reward.

200
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,400
If colleagues see
that, the impact is bad.

201
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,199
I've sent the file,

202
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,440
and enjoyed all the
milk tea, then I'll leave.

203
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,479
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

204
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,279
You shouldn't be able to date this time.

205
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,038
I'll ask Fang to send you back.

206
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:43,639
No need.

207
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,718
It's faster if I take the subway.

208
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,839
Maybe I can still catch the second half.

209
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,678
What?

210
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,678
Why is there a second half?

211
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,559
Wait.

212
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:51,799
What's the matter?

213
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,679
Can you get the file over there for me?

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Over the window.

215
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,879
Okay.

216
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,839
You're truly a capitalist.

217
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,558
No matter standing or sitting,

218
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,520
you're going to bleed people dry.

219
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,080
There really is such a view.

220
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,080
The view is great.

221
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,200
When I'm free,

222
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,919
I like to watch the scenery here while ru...

223
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,359
You want to say running, right?

224
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,520
Me? Did I?

225
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,440
Sneakers, skateboards,
and golf clubs.

226
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,359
All these can show
that you love sports.

227
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,158
Do I?

228
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,239
Should I say I love?

229
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,960
I'd better admit it.

230
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:21,960
No need to answer.

231
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,000
Your eyes already tell me.

232
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:27,000
If you have a dream, just say it.

233
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,000
In fact, many times I wish

234
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,799
my right ear was not deaf.

235
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,239
Let's not talk about these sad things.

236
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,399
Do you want to have some fun?

237
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,598
What could be happier than drinking milk tea?

238
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,119
Let's go.

239
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,799
What's inside?

240
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,679
A variety of toys that

241
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,679
can make you experience the supreme pleasure.

242
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,879
Supreme pleasure.

243
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,280
It's not what I think it is, is it?

244
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,599
Have a look inside.

245
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,719
Okay.

246
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:22,960
The door is heavy.

247
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,900
[Peace and Happiness]

248
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Act accordingly, shouldn't act rashly.

249
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,159
It's not a big problem.

250
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,959
How is it not a problem?

251
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,519
What is a problem with you?

252
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,880
You don't care about it at all.

253
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,798
Does this dance make
you feel more alive?

254
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,358
I just don't understand that

255
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,158
why she did not tell me.

256
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,558
Maybe she has some troubles.

257
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,118
She has troubles, she
should tell me directly.

258
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,718
There is no need to do so.

259
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,519
Don't be angry.

260
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,999
Anger might harm your body.

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,960
You are not angry
because you only know how to eat melons.

262
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,959
To deal with this kind of thing,

263
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,359
you have to pay attention to the attitude,

264
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,520
and the way to do it, right?

265
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,439
Is it so serous?

266
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,719
How do these two people look so angry?

267
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,239
Mom, you're back from the dance.

268
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,280
You…

269
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,678
Have you eaten dinner yet?

270
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,679
Yes.

271
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,279
Mom, you don't look so good.

272
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,598
Are you having trouble with Auntie Xiumei again?

273
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,840
No.

274
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,359
Is there something you're not telling me?

275
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,999
Dad, if you have
something to say, just say it.

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,639
Don't hide it from me.

277
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,279
What is this about?

278
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,520
No, nothing serious.

279
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,959
I can't talk to you.

280
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,839
I need to ask Zhuang about this.

281
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,558
Zhuang, what does it matter to him?

282
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,879
Where is Zhuang?

283
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
He's in the room.

284
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,478
My mom has learned to break the weak points.

285
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,279
No, I have to follow her.

286
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,320
What can't you take me with you?

287
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,080
Wait for me.

288
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:31,999
What are you doing here?

289
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,279
Why do you always go to Zhuang for everything?

290
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,279
Your daughter is a living person here.

291
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,839
Follow me.

292
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,199
- Watch out.
- Why are you following me?

293
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,439
Why are you favoring outsiders?

294
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,999
Don't come to Zhuang for everything.

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,559
He's a researcher,
not an encyclopedia.

296
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,999
Are you sure you don't want to ask me first?

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,399
You probably won't get much out from him.

298
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,959
What's wrong with me talking to Zhuang?

299
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,199
Is this in your way?

300
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,199
What's wrong with you today?

301
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,919
Why are you stopping me?

302
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,880
Please come in.

303
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,320
Zhuang.

304
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,439
- Handsome boy?
- Auntie.

305
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,478
Where is Zhuang Yu?

306
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,919
Didn't he tell you that he went to investigate?

307
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,558
Of course he did.

308
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,559
I forgot that.

309
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,598
What's wrong with you?

310
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,879
About your boyfriend's schedule,

311
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,759
you need his student to remind you.

312
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,119
Can't you care more about Zhuang?

313
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,439
Mom, I saw you
and Dad looking sad,

314
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,959
so I was so busy caring for you that

315
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,118
I forgot about him for a while.

316
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,199
We don't need you to care about,

317
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,599
you should care more about Zhuang.

318
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:44,038
Why didn't you go
with Professor Zhuang?

319
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,759
The fieldwork he assigned me to do

320
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,798
is more suitable to be done during the day.

321
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,319
Zhuang is really strange,

322
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,199
why did he go to the mountains at night?

323
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,959
He does not want to lose a minute.

324
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,479
He wants to see it first.

325
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,479
How do you know that?

326
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:00,519
Of course I know.

327
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,079
It seems that your relationship

328
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,358
is closer than I thought.

329
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,919
Of course.

330
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,238
After all, we're lovers.

331
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,680
Of course I know his things.

332
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,519
I am right, mom?

333
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,559
You and my dad must have had

334
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,078
such a tacit understanding

335
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,599
to have a daughter as transparent as me.

336
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,760
Zhuang is not here.

337
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:23,479
I'll ask him when he comes back.

338
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,040
I'll leave.

339
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,640
What's the thing indeed?

340
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,718
The situation is not good.

341
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,879
My mother wants to avoid me

342
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,839
and ask Zhuang Yu about something.

343
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,399
Are you tired?

344
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,279
No.

345
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,238
Interesting.

346
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,680
Continue, great.

347
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,358
Would you like something to drink?

348
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,119
No.

349
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,399
Are you afraid of losing to me again

350
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
so you deliberately disrupt my rhythm?

351
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,359
You're pretty good.

352
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,599
Here you are.

353
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,800
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

354
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,438
Although you're not good at playing,

355
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,198
your taste of picking a drink is not bad.

356
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,619
I gave in to you just now.

357
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,078
I'm not going to let you win this time.

358
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,280
You'd better be careful.

359
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,358
Were you unable to keep up with the rhythm

360
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,799
without the music?

361
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,879
You can turn it on a bit,

362
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,040
My ears won't be tingling.

363
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,198
I'm the best at this game.

364
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,519
Not to mention without music,

365
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,719
I can beat you even with my eyes closed.

366
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,719
Okay, let's compete fairly.

367
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:13,078
What happened?

368
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,478
It's 10 o'clock.

369
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:15,958
It's only two TV episodes,

370
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,560
why hasn't she finished watching it?

371
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,839
The adviser is not here, I
have to do it on my own.

372
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,358
Whatever my mom
asks you, tell me in sync,

373
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,719
and don't do anything rashly.

374
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,078
Forget it.

375
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,119
The old man should be sleeping at this time.

376
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,438
Zhuang.

377
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:07,039
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

378
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,959
- Breakfast time.
- Good morning.

379
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,318
Okay.

380
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,319
Let's go get ready.

381
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,159
Earthquake?

382
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
[Two hours ago]

383
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,118
Mom, what are you doing?

384
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,879
What time is it?

385
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,478
Neither of the guests are here,

386
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,520
let's go up to the hill and camp.

387
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,919
Have a nice trip.

388
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,198
Be safe.

389
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,399
Not only we three,

390
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,958
it's our whole family that go to find Zhuang.

391
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,238
Get up.

392
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,599
Get up.

393
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,439
Find him?

394
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,639
Don't you miss your own boyfriend?

395
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,119
Of course not.

396
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,399
If I don't miss him, who do I miss?

397
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,199
I really miss him so much.

398
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,598
It's good to be here.

399
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,400
I can just use the trick
of going with the flow.

400
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,920
It's rare that I get up earlier than you.

401
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,839
Didn't you say I might let out your secret?

402
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,279
I've thought about it.

403
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,078
It's better to show it rather than cover it up.

404
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,799
If we work hard and perform well,

405
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,160
we may be able to dispel their doubts.

406
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,599
Do you think that makes sense? Professor Zhuang.

407
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,680
Are you going to the cave?

408
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,640
Are the flowers in blossom?

409
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,000
Soon.

410
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,118
Zhuang, breakfast is ready.

411
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,559
Come and have some with us.

412
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,759
Mom, Zhuang has work to do.

413
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,118
Don't delay him.

414
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,759
Can't my son-in-law eat breakfast?

415
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,318
What will having breakfast delay?

416
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,598
It's okay, Auntie.

417
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,159
With this light and temperature,

418
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,639
the flowers won't bloom for a while.

419
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,879
Zhuang has said like that.

420
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,799
I think that

421
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,039
you just don't want to leave him alone with us.

422
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,839
No.

423
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,399
I am afraid that

424
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,799
too many people will squeeze the flowers.

425
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,478
You just talk.

426
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,039
Zhuang, this way please.

427
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,920
Come on.

428
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,279
Are you ready?

429
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,919
Zhuang, we've finished. Come on.

430
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,959
Come on.

431
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,078
Zhuang, drink some water of black wolfberry.

432
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,279
It's wild and very good.

433
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,078
It is anti-fatigue, anti-aging,

434
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,559
anti-depression, and anti…

435
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,438
- Anti-radiation.
- Anti-radiation. Right.

436
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,799
It resists everything anyway.

437
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,359
Resist all.

438
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,999
Mom, you're exaggerating.

439
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,879
According to you,
doctors should all change

440
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,559
to grow black wolfberries.

441
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,919
The black wolfberry only
has anthocyanins in it,

442
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,039
and it's not stable.

443
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,999
The water is so hot,

444
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,880
there may be nothing left in it.

445
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,559
You know again?

446
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,838
Zhuang, who studies plants, said nothing.

447
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,479
Right?

448
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,039
Tell her, Zhuang,

449
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,560
is this black wolfberry particularly nutritious?

450
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:53,760
Of course.

451
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,438
Having black wolfberries in summer

452
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,238
can make people drink a lot of water.

453
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,879
Look, Zhuang has said so.

454
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,838
He also said that if you drink too much water,

455
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,239
there is no place for you to pee.

456
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,359
You bad girl.

457
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,478
Come on.

458
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,880
Eat breakfast.

459
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,119
Eat.

460
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,598
What's wrong with you?

461
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,880
Didn't we say we were going to try to behave?

462
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,159
Sister, what are you doing?

463
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,799
Can you think about me?

464
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,078
In the morning, I want
to eat something healthy,

465
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,358
don't feed me dog food.

466
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,599
Just eat.

467
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,520
We're playing so hard,
how can they ignore it?

468
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,040
Maybe,

469
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,039
you're overacting a bit.

470
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,920
No.

471
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,280
No.

472
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,439
I think they don't like watching this.

473
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,559
Zhuang,

474
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,919
why is there no picture of you two together

475
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,000
in your moments?

476
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:00,800
Got it.

477
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,039
Mommy, take a picture of us.

478
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,118
OK. No problem.

479
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,598
Remember to turn on beauty.

480
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,438
I know.

481
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:09,599
Beauty camera.

482
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,160
Okay.

483
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:12,239
Come on.

484
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,920
Look here.

485
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,479
Smile.

486
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,359
Great.

487
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,000
In fact, for many times I wish

488
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,079
my right ear was not deaf.

489
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,559
Although I can't make up for

490
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,999
your regret of enrolling in a major back then.

491
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,280
At least with it,

492
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,999
you can enjoy movies

493
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,119
and games with sound like everyone else.

494
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,680
Come in.

495
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,439
Mr. Jin,

496
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,079
this is for you.

497
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,519
For me?

498
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,199
What is this?

499
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,379
Longan jujube tea.

500
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,989
It can nourish the Qi and protect the liver,

501
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,509
which is most suitable for people like us

502
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,359
who stay up late at night.

503
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,919
I can't believe a girl gave me something

504
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,478
before I took the initiative to send a gift.

505
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:12,319
She's really a
fairy, not a mortal.

506
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,838
What?

507
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,919
Has he found out that

508
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,400
I brought it to him after doing too much?

509
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,879
Mr. Jin, why don't you drink?

510
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,400
I will.

511
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,800
So hot, no, so sweet.

512
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:29,920
Oh no.

513
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,040
Doesn't he like to have sweet drinks?

514
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,759
I'm screwed.

515
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,599
My life of working overtime.

516
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,639
By the way,

517
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,879
Mr. Jin, I think the files over there

518
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,318
are too high for you to take.

519
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,559
Why don't I ask Linda to come over

520
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,639
and help me move those files

521
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,519
to the low cabinet over there?

522
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,358
Then when I'm not here,

523
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,879
it's also convenient for you to take.

524
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,159
The fairy is too thoughtful.

525
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,598
I'm just speechless.

526
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,589
I can only think of two words,

527
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,280
beautiful and kind.

528
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,920
Why does he look in that way?

529
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,799
Is it too obvious that

530
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,359
I don't want to get the files?

531
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,358
- I'm not trying to…
- Tiantian,

532
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,199
here's a gift for you.

533
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,680
A gift for me?

534
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,319
[Huiya Hearing Aids]
Hearing aid.

535
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,799
This is a very expensive brand, right?

536
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,719
Try it on.

537
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,160
What's wrong?

538
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,838
I can't take this.

539
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,520
Why?

540
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,078
Why?

541
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,640
I…

542
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,640
I give you a gift just because

543
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,358
I'm sorry for making you work late all the time.

544
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:42,839
Okay?

545
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,358
So I give you a gift.

546
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,399
I don't mean anything else.

547
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,280
Don't think too much.

548
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,679
Mr. Jin, I'm working
here to pay off my debt.

549
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,358
I don't want to think about my ear issue now.

550
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,039
If you really feel sorry about it,

551
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,519
can you convert the overtime hours

552
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,879
into working hours to offset my debt?

553
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,650
How about that?

554
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:03,838
No problem.

555
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,358
Working hours are hours, but gifts are gifts.

556
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,718
If it's a gift, I can't take it.

557
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,759
I should send a present in return.

558
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,438
This is too expensive,

559
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,640
I can't afford to return it.

560
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,039
Mr. Jin, I really can't take it.

561
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,078
If it's convenient for you later,

562
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,519
I'll ask Linda to come

563
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,159
and move the files with me.

564
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,438
What happened?

565
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:25,279
I've never been so passive

566
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,359
in front of any girl before.

567
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,079
Okay.

568
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,438
I'll leave.

569
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,359
Okay.

570
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,838
First win people's hearts,

571
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,598
then make people work hard.

572
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,040
Capitalists' tactics, I
know them very well.

573
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,029
What happened?

574
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,598
Is it because my brain is not working well

575
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,000
after my feet are not working well?

576
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,839
Look, my photoshop skill is good, right?

577
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,880
Great.

578
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,280
How is it?

579
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,799
I'm good at it, right?

580
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,318
Don't worry, I'm fair.

581
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,280
I fix you too.

582
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,319
But you have nothing to fix.

583
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,039
I sent it to you.

584
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,559
Mom, last time you said that

585
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,238
Zhuang Yu does not like to post on Moments.

586
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,799
I am very satisfied with this photo today.

587
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,198
I'll let him post it now.

588
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,159
Look at you,

589
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,318
you are exactly the same as your mother,

590
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,559
force others to post to show your love.

591
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,198
It's Zhuang's own
business to post or not.

592
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,598
Don't force him.

593
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,118
I'm not forcing him.

594
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,238
He is voluntary to do that.

595
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,399
Right?

596
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,078
- Yes.
- Fine.

597
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,358
Please.

598
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,358
Please post it on the moments

599
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,039
to let my parents see it.

600
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,640
Good luck to good people.

601
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,199
Zhuang, you've posted it, right?

602
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,239
I will be the first to give you a like.

603
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,358
- Look.
- I'm going to like it too.

604
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,000
Look.

605
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,118
What's wrong with you?

606
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,958
You…

607
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,839
How could you post the original picture?

608
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,799
Which is the original picture?

609
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,039
This one.

610
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,879
Look, how round my face is.

611
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,078
This one is the fixed one.

612
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,279
This is the normal one.

613
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,319
How could you even get this wrong?

614
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,198
I don't see any difference.

615
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:21,318
Yes, it's great.

616
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,159
I knew it.

617
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,639
Are you trying to embarrass me on purpose

618
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,439
because I didn't retouch your pictures?

619
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,598
Luckily it's only for
mom, dad, and Yu Meinan,

620
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,119
otherwise you'd be in for a treat.

621
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,560
Who commented?

622
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,318
Do you open your relationship with Miss Yu?

623
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,160
Congratulations.

624
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,039
Good for you.

625
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,839
Why didn't you tell me

626
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,680
about this great news in advance?

627
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,280
Why didn't you set up groups?

628
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,160
What's that?

629
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,520
Mr. Jin,

630
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,000
we've got the contract with Qin Ya back.

631
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,400
A week later,

632
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,279
there is an offline promotion for the brand,

633
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,759
they hope that
Meiren can be there.

634
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,880
This is the theme and image reference for it.

635
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:13,900
Miss Li is going to dinner.

636
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,319
Okay, I get it.

637
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,198
I'll tell her. You can leave.

638
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:17,839
Okay.

639
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,070
[The program of Qin Ya's promotion]

640
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,598
After such a long break,

641
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,079
it's about time to come back.

642
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:30,000
You posted like this,
everyone will see it.

643
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,119
They're blooming.

644
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,318
It's not right.

645
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,999
When this Artemisia annua blooms,

646
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,999
isn't it past the first bud stage?

647
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,919
The content of artemisinin should not be high.

648
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,838
The samples of the first bud stage

649
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,830
have been collected.

650
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,719
Who said Artemisia annua has only one use?

651
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,959
It is also very beautiful when it blooms.

652
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,160
Then…

653
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:10,799
♫ The world of two ♫

654
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,499
♫ is what we're proud of ♫

655
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,999
♫ I'm walking toward you ♫

656
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,699
♫ You suddenly break in ♫

657
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,399
♫ and also open up my heart ♫

658
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,949
♫ Tell me this moment can be our future ♫

659
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,639
♫ The expectations of two ♫

660
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,718
Miss Meiren.

661
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,280
Who?

662
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,560
Handsome boy.

663
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,640
Professor Zhuang, Miss Meiren.

664
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:44,438
You're on the mountain so early.

665
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:45,000
It's so dark,

666
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:46,719
you're unable to see anything, right?

667
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,478
It's 9:30, is that early?

668
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,198
And it's pretty bright today,

669
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,800
so I can see everything I should see.

670
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,040
God.

671
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,478
When is it so bright?

672
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:06,679
And… And the sun is nice today.

673
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,479
Isn't it?

674
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,919
You…

675
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,598
What are you doing here?

676
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,679
I'm here for my botanical expedition.

677
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,280
I didn't expect to meet you here.

678
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,358
I didn't expect that I just said last night,

679
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,599
you can forget it so quickly.

680
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,799
Right, you told me you were coming here.

681
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,989
But it's still a little surprising

682
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,839
to see you here.

683
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,799
You guys work on your samples first.

684
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,239
I'm going to see if my
mom needs any help.

685
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:06,279
Calm down.

686
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,118
A kiss is a touch of
the skin on the lips.

687
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,799
A handshake is a touch
of the skin of the hands.

688
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,159
It's all skin.

689
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,559
So it's just like a handshake.

690
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,000
There's nothing to be nervous about.

691
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,598
It's useless to think about it,

692
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,920
I should think about
getting rid of Sherlock Feng.

693
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,119
Mom,

694
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm back.

695
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,519
Meiren, where's Zhuang?

696
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,280
Eat a grape.

697
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:37,199
No.

698
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,438
Mom and Dad, you've
been whispering for days.

699
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:44,599
What is it that he
can know but I can't?

700
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,718
It's useless for me to tell you.

701
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:48,560
You just know how to fool me.

702
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,280
I... When did I fool you?

703
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,159
Mom, just tell me
what's going on?

704
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,879
I don't want outsiders to laugh at me.

705
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,399
Who's an outsider?

706
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,478
How can Zhuang be an outsider?

707
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,358
You've already known that,

708
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,839
how could he not be an outsider?

709
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,959
Yes, since it's like
this, tell Meiren.

710
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,399
Fine.

711
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,519
I'll tell you, but
you must promise

712
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,360
not to stop us from talking to Zhuang.

713
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,999
Chen Guilan of our dance team,

714
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,040
do you remember Aunt Chen?

715
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:22,999
No impression, right?

716
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,760
This is normal.

717
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,878
When she was young,
she was on good terms with Wang.

718
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,759
So she took Wang as the village beauty.

719
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,158
Can Wang Xiumei compare with…

720
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,399
You.

721
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,639
You are the most beautiful woman in our village.

722
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:38,359
Just cherish and don't brag.

723
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,239
Low profile.

724
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,398
Where was I?

725
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,040
Wang Guilan.

726
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,678
Not Wang Guilan.

727
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,519
That's Chen Guilan and Wang Xiumei.

728
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,040
Sorry.

729
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,438
Keep talking.

730
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,759
This Wang Guilan.

731
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,719
Stop.

732
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,039
Their names are so similar,

733
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,359
so they must be in a group.

734
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,918
Since I became the captain,

735
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,799
they do not obey me at all.

736
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,239
I don't know

737
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,279
if it was Wang Xiumei who urged her behind,

738
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,438
now she always comes in late and leaves early.

739
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,955
These days she even didn't come.

740
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:07,918
She didn't respect me as captain at all.

741
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,319
Isn't she too much?

742
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,840
She's too much.

743
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:13,080
But what does this have to do with Zhuang?

744
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,520
Don't hurry.

745
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,079
Let your mom slowly unravel the fog of history.

746
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,478
It's not that long.

747
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,159
At first I thought

748
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,839
she had some opinion on me personally.

749
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,799
I thought it doesn't matter

750
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,839
whether she comes or not.

751
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,119
It's good that they don't dance anyway.

752
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm good at it,
so I'll stand out,

753
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,119
right?

754
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,119
Then I thought, no.

755
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,999
I am the captain.

756
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,759
If I lead this team like this,

757
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,678
it will fall apart.

758
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,079
It won't be good.

759
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,639
I think

760
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:38,239
I should probably go to their home to check.

761
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,438
If there is any problem,

762
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:44,279
we should spread it
out to talk clearly, right?

763
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,678
When I went to
their house, oh, no,

764
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,198
something really happened to them.

765
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,039
We don't grow grapes so we don't know that.

766
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,319
This year, our village is certified organic,

767
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,918
so no pesticides are allowed to be applied.

768
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,999
So now the grape production

769
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,438
has been greatly reduced.

770
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,359
Mainly because of the pest.

771
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,238
Right.

772
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,799
The couple are so worried at home

773
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,759
that she is in no mood to dance.

774
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,198
I think Zhuang can help them.

775
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,039
Zhuang is studying plants.

776
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,840
He's so knowledgeable

777
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,958
that he can definitely
help them, right?

778
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,238
So I just want Zhuang to help them.

779
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,279
That's why you're so sad these days?

780
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,239
Yes.

781
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,919
See?

782
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,799
Beautiful and kind.

783
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,840
How can I not love her?

784
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,198
It is a good thing,
why didn't you tell me?

785
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,158
It's because of you.

786
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,559
You either say that Zhuang is busy at work,

787
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,638
or he is engaged in

788
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:39,238
confidential scientific research.

789
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,759
I'm afraid that if I tell you,

790
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,799
you'll say we're disturbing him.

791
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,360
Mom, in your mind,
I'm so narrow-minded?

792
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,999
Did she just say that Zhuang is an outsider?

793
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,639
She did.

794
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,520
Why?

795
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,559
What did you mean?

796
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,839
I didn't say that.

797
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,918
What outsider and insider?

798
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:58,198
We're all family, aren't we?

799
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,958
You think it's better
for me to talk to Zhuang

800
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,878
or you to talk to him?

801
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,879
Of course it's me…

802
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,359
Of course, you tell him.

803
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,158
I'm going to see what Meinan needs.

804
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:16,879
Come back.

805
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,399
There's something wrong with you today.

806
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:23,039
What's wrong?

807
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,279
When I talk about Zhuang,

808
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,718
usually you are very active.

809
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,398
Why are you so evasive today?

810
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:29,839
I'm not.

811
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,800
Are you two having a fight?

812
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:32,839
No.

813
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,319
Mom, you're kidding.

814
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,800
We're fine.

815
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:40,959
Uncle, Auntie.

816
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,918
- Zhuang, you're back.
- Yu Meinan,

817
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:43,958
what can I do to help you?

818
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:44,560
Come here.

819
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,039
- Come here, Zhuang.
- Come here.

820
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,438
I have nothing you can help me with here.

821
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,319
Lv Jian, why are you here too?

822
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,759
Come and sit.

823
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,320
Have some fruit.

824
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,559
You go back to rest.

825
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,559
Yes, Auntie.

826
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,799
You're carrying something so heavy.

827
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,280
Take a break.

828
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:09,678
Get the flowers to my office.

829
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:12,319
Mr. Jin, aren't you
allergic to pollen?

830
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,120
It doesn't matter.

831
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,559
No girl would refuse
so many flowers, right?

832
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,319
That's true.

833
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,839
Not to mention such
beautiful flowers.

834
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,719
Not to mention that they're from me.

835
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,718
You deal with it. I'll go up first.

836
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,359
Okay.

837
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,519
I'll get someone to take them up.

838
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,080
Okay.

839
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,319
Great.

840
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,159
It's more and more of my style.

841
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,600
Linda,

842
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,600
help me put the coffee machine back.

843
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,760
Yes.

844
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,560
Taste it.

845
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,600
Okay.

846
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:09,839
My son-in-law's
coffee is truly different.

847
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,958
Is it?

848
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:11,760
Let me try it.

849
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,520
Delicious.

850
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,800
Brother-in-law,

851
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,519
you brought these things to the mountain,

852
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,719
you really have a sense of ritual.

853
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,599
Of course.

854
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,760
That's why your sister likes him, right?

855
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Thank you, Professor Zhuang.

856
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:42,080
Thank you.

857
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,520
Auntie,

858
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,039
I'll do what you just told me.

859
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,079
I'm just about done with my own work.

860
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,780
I'll take a look when I get down the mountain.

861
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,638
That's great.

862
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:03,678
I'm so lucky to have
such a good son-in-law.

863
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,080
Don't be polite to your own family.

864
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,918
I'll come with you, Auntie.

865
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:07,679
If there's anything

866
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,279
you want to tell us, just say it.

867
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,519
Having lived here for so long,

868
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,359
I've already regarded it as my own home.

869
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,360
Something happens to
my family, I must help.

870
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,520
That's great.

871
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:16,839
Thank you.

872
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,999
On behalf of the village chief, thank you.

873
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,918
I'll drink first.

874
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,679
Be careful, Miss Meiren. It's hot.

875
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,360
Left.

876
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,080
I'm full.

877
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:50,959
I'll take a walk to digest.

878
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,479
What?

879
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,238
Why does she have such a small appetite today?

880
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,040
Yes.

881
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,519
Come on, Zhuang, pour it for me.

882
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,320
I want to drink more.

883
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,638
Five years ago, I was strong enough

884
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,799
to go up and down without breathing.

885
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,279
Why do I get heat stroke so easily now?

886
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,639
Otherwise, why is my face flushing?

887
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,600
Unexpectedly.

888
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,999
♫ Migrant birds fly into the forest ♫

889
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,399

Mom,

897
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,359
take a picture of us.

898
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,199
Okay.

899
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,678
Remember to turn on beauty.

900
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,559
I know.

901
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,279
Beauty camera.

902
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,080
Okay.

903
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,398
Smile, ready.

904
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:03,919
Smile.

905
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,199
Great. What do you think?

906
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,639
What's up?

907
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,759
It is better to use the original camera.

908
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,280
What's wrong?

909
00:42:18,281 --> 00:42:19,918
It's good.

910
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:20,879
Take another one.

911
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,879
Okay, original camera.

912
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,478
Look here.

913
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:30,399
One, two, three, smile.

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,499
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,899
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

924
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,899
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

925
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,799
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

926
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,499
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

927
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:24,099
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

928
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:29,100
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

929
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,740
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

930
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,699
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

931
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,199
♫ You show up in my sight ♫

932
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,899
♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

933
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,999
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

934
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,499
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

935
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,499
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

936
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,499
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

937
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,499
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

938
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,499
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

939
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,899
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

940
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,999
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

941
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,999
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

942
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,699
♫ You make all the stars
in the sky shine for me ♫

943
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:38,379
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

944
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:43,499
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

945
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,500
♫ Even the air is filled
with the scent of flowers ♫
