Do I know you well?

00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,680
Why did you say I am superficial?

27
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,919
A woman dressing like you is superficial.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,159
Who told it to you?

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,439

31
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,359
I learned it from TV that a
woman with such red lips

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
is usually stupid.

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,958
So you learn everything from TV dramas.

34
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,559
Did you learn

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,638
that don't judge people from their appearances?

36
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,558
And a good-looking woman is surely stupid?

37
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,079
She may possibly be pretty and smart.

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,518
A smart woman won't misspell my name.

39
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,039
And you are not pretty at all.

Mrs. Zhuang, you have good taste.

74

But he's not like an idol. I am.

We met before at the entrance of our lab.

you and our boss are not only friends.

84
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,958

boss posted the photo.

You're right.

I'm curious.

97
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,558
Why can't you get tanned?

98
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,959
What did Yu apply to your skin?

99
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,078
This is for you.

100
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,759
Don't forget to use it before you get outside.

101
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,920
Or you might get skin cancer.

102
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,959
What is the smell?

103
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,559
The smell of a lovey-dovey couple.

104
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,558
I miss the smell of herbs in
the greenhouse very much.

105

Get out, turn right, then go straight,

106
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
you'll find that greenhouse.

107
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,958
You've officially announced your girlfriend online.

108
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,399
Why are you so shy?

109
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,320
Only you and I are here. So
tell me what is your next step?

110
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,879
Professor Zhuang, please answer my question directly.

111
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,519
Anti-UV cream.

112
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,078
I used an anti-UV cream.

113
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,399
This is not my question.

114
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,558
I'm really serious.

115
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,159
When you get married,
you must invite me.

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,640
By the way, look at me,
I deserve to be the best man.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,639
But to tell the truth,
the photo you shared with us

118
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,999
is really nice.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,959
Yu helped to take sampling this time, right?

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,398
How did you know?

121
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,200
Look.

122
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,159
In this photo, not only you two,
there is something else.

123
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,440
It is Qingshui Mountain, right?

124
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,359
Behind you is the summit of it.

125
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,440
You found Artemisia annua around this area, right?

126
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
Did she take you there?

127
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,199
Listen, as the old saying goes,

128
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,118
the military medal is the honor of all,

129
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,798
so you and Yu share it.

130
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,999
Your old saying sounds younger than you.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,919
Cut the crap.

132
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,199
I'm really serious.

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,838
Yu is really nice.

134
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,639
As I think,
there won't be another person like Yu

135
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,839
that cares about you so much.

136
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,320
If you let her go, I won't help you.

137
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,079
Do you hear me?

138
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,239
I don't need your help.

139
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,719
Do we need to change our shoes?

140
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,678
No, you don't have to.

141
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:05,239
You come on time that the rooms
were cleaned a few days ago.

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,118
It's often in a mess, so don't take it so seriously.

143
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,479
But it's not appropriate.

144
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,999
It's nothing to worry about.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,919
I don't have extra slippers, either.

146
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,119
Don't worry. Just come in.

147
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,319

148
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,358
It's alright. Come in.

149
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,359
Thank you. Mrs. Zhuang.

150
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,079
Here's water.

151
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,119
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

152
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,879
What does Zhuang Yu mean?

153
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,078
He left those dirty works to you.

154
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,719
We'd like to do it.

155
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,159
Yes, it's our fault, actually.

156
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,398
Boss has to run the data analysis again

157
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,078
because we can't finish it at all.

158
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,639
So he has to stay in the lab for a whole day.

159
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,639
And he's worried that Hui is alone at home.

160
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,838
The truth is...

161
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,558
They didn't have good communication.

162
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,639
Not even good communication.

163
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,119
There's even no communication.

164
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,199
Leave it to me.

165
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,118
Really?

166
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,439
That's why Boss told us we'd come to you

167
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,399
if we're in trouble.

168
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,480
Did he say it?

169
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,798
He said you could talk a lot with him.

170
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,278
It's crazy.

171
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,040
I have nothing to talk to this old aunt.

172
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,958
That's great.

173
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,599
I have nothing to say to you.

174
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,759
So stop talking and drink water.

175
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,558
No.

176
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,559
I want to eat Fun Waves.

177
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,079
Fun Waves?

178
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,798
Old aunt.

179
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,518
Don't you even know Fun Waves?

180
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,719
Language!

181
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,119
If you don't explain it, you'll never get it.

182
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
It's a noodle snack.

183
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,279
No wonder she is our Boss's girlfriend.

184
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,640
Her force can pacify everything.

185
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,760
Don't comment on Boss's girlfriend.

186
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,399
Boss told us he's not allowed to eat snacks,

187
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,158
and must finish his homework.

188
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,519
If there's no Fun Waves,
I won't do my homework.

189
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,238
Fine. Don't do it.

190
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,558
I don't want to look after you, either.

191
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,799
We don't even need to talk.

192
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,759
Excuse me. I need to check something.

193
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
[Chat Group of Prof. Zhuang Plant Studies]

194
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Who is she?

195
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,718
Someone who likes professor Zhuang secretly

196
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,440
edited it by herself.

197
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,239
No.

198
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,718
I took the photo of Prof. Wu's screen secretly.

199
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,598
So it's from the Moments of Professor Zhuang.

200
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,319
Professor updated his WeChat account?

201
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,519
As far as I observed,
he only updated this photo.

202
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,478
What is happening?

203
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,119
Girlfriend?

204
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:22,679
Announcement?

205
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,319
The professor is our public property,

206
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,080
who took him privately?

207
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:25,999
Who is she?

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,359
She's not even worthy of him.

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,799
Mrs. Zhuang.

210
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,320
They're jealous of you.

211
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,159
Look.

212
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,519
This girl looks quite pretty.

213
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,960
So Professor Zhuang is worthy of her.

214
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:47,399
So leave this kid here,
go to help your boss.

215
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,238
Can you do it?

216
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,598
Sure thing.

217
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,880
It's easy-peasy for me to help him with this.

218
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,158
Why am I removed from the chat group?

219
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,199
Thank you. Mrs. Zhuang.

220
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,880
Let's go.

221
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,679
- See you. Mrs. Zhuang.
- See you. Mrs. Zhuang.

222
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,478
As I said,
this is the Mrs. Zhuang.

223
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,038
She has great force,
and plays the cards well;

224
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,279
The little devil brother,
can't fight back at his will.

225
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,279
Respect.

226
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,199
What a rhyme.

227
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,280
We're the idols of the lab team.

228
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,359
What time is it?

229
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,439
Where are you going? Wait.

230
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,400
Seriously? The experiment result is about to come out.

231
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,000
You're right.

232
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,158
You don't want to drink water?

233
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,280
So you want the milk?

234
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,200
President Jin.

235
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,199
The business division made a list of

236
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
the brands for cooperation.

237
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,880
Those who we often worked with
are on the top of the list.

238
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,359
Linda.

239
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,300
I think I made a big, really big mistake.

240
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,322
I told a lie,

241
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:02,158
so I had to keep lying to make it more real.

242
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,840
President Jin.

243
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,559
Your style of speaking
is different than the past.

244
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,880
My style?

245
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,440
I'm still the same as before.

246
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Still handsome.

247
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,559
I mean the way you talk.

248
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,640
I watched too many dramas recently.

249
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:26,519
I think that in a relationship,

250
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,960
trust is the most important key.

251
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,079
President Jin, here's your coffee.

252
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,840
Half milk...

253
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm so sorry.

254
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

255
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,599
Why are you leaving?

256
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,118
Be careful.

257
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,158
Are you alright?

258
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm good.

259
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,880
President Jin, he's busy now?

260
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,879
It seems so.

261
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,038
Linda is in there.

262
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,559
They may be talking about important business.

263
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:11,799
I see.

264
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,679
I'll come again later.

265
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,599
Xiaofang.

266
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,479
I want to ask...

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,238
Has Linda been working with
the president for a long time?

268
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,118
Yes.

269
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,880
Linda is the original generation of our company.

270
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,358
So... She and President Jin...

271
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,118
They are not merely colleagues.

272
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,119
Their trust of years is more
valuable than anything else.

273
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,999
But don't take me wrong.

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,399
I didn't mean that the president doesn't trust you

275
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,598
in your work.

276
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,558
To be honest, president and Linda,

277
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,719
they are at the same pace even beyond the business.

278
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,359
Well, I know.

279
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,320
Let's go.

280
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,840
It's just a second,
then I can't find her.

281
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,319
President Jin.

282
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,279
Miss Li has two legs.

283
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,559
So I don't think you can find her in your wheelchair.

284
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,479
I feel your style of talking has also changed.

285
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,118
Really?

286
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,799
In your words, I can feel something else like...

287
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,359
President Jin.

288
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,199
Hold on a minute.

289
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
I didn't mean anything else.

290
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,440
It's honesty.

291
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,399
The feeling of your honesty.

292
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,039
I like it.

293
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,999
Keep it.

294
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,880
Keep saying like that.

295
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,718
Well, do you think...

296
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:39,000
she may have heard the lies that we talked about?

297
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,199
May I have lost the chance to explain?

298
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,719
President Jin.

299
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,478
Did I hear you just said
that you like honesty?

300
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,320
What you said is true.

301
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,399
But honesty is used for the right moment.

302
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,200
Listen, help me to find her,

303
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,639
and tell her to go to my home

304
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,358
with me to get something later.

305
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,478
I tell her?

306
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,159
It looks real.

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,640
To your house?

308
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,640
Everything is under my control there.

309
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,320
Sure.

310
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:05,919
Wait a second.

311
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,519
Keep your honesty.

312
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,119
Come on.

313
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,839
Boss. Boss.

314
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,599
Surprise.

315
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,079
Why are you here?

316
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,038
We looked for you everywhere at the lab.

317
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,038
Yes.

318
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,478
For you, your boss has finished the hardest part.

319
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:31,440
- Director Li.
- Director Li.

320
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,718
Boss.

321
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,719
don't you feel surprised seeing us here?

322
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,199
To look after a kid,

323
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,159
or to run an evaporative light-scattering detector.

324
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,399
It's easy to tell which is harder.

325
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,678
You are our mind reader.

326
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,439
We underestimated the difficulty of baby care.

327
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,478
So we can only study plants.

328
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,000
Thanks to Mrs. Zhuang.

329
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,080
Don't call her like that.

330
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,559
What's wrong with him?

331
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,038
Isn't it obvious?

332
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,080
He is shy.

333
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,079
Look at you. She is your lady now.

334
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,559
So I can't just call her Yu anymore.

335
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,279
Sister-in-law?

336
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,000
My brother's wife?

337
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
1.66%.

338
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,520
Is it real?

339
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,119
Boss, this is the best result we have gotten for recent years.

340
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,718
Boss.

341
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,639
Did you collect all of these this time?

342
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,598
Yes.

343
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,679
See how great your professor is?

344
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,918
But it's not easy to travel with these samples.

345
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,999
We should have joined you.

346
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,799
It has been late, even if you say it.

347
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,959
Who, who are you?

348
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,640
The greenhouse is a restricted area.

349
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,319
Nice to meet you.

350
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,919
I'm Lv Jian.

351
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,840
Freshman of MA student.

352
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,918
Boss,
when did you recruit new students?

353
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,519
Maybe a competitive student is needed here.

354
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,599
What do you mean?

355
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,798
Stop it.

356
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:53,118
Lv Jian joined the field research this time.

357
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,959
He also took half of the samples back to the lab.

358
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,279
Now you're a family.

359
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,199
So help each other and move forward together.

360
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you understand?

361
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,159
But Boss won't recruit an arrogant man.

362
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,519
His name is Lv Jian.

363
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,839
But he's not like his name, which means thrifty.

364
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,918
He dresses like a rich second-generation.

365
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,559
He must pull some strings to get in.

366
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,640
Thanks to him,
you look much nicer than him now.

367
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,079
By the way, Lv, don't worry.

368
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,520
Feel free to consult with them.

369
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,079
I may have nothing to ask them.

370
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,399
The most important point of research
is to go for the truth.

371
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,478
They keep saying Mrs. Zhuang.

372
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,038
But the professor has denied it.

373
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,319
It's really annoying.

374
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,478
I say whatever I want to see.

375
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,519
None of your business.

376
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,479
Enjoy the talk?

377
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,640
Boss, it's his fault...

378
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,039
After talking,

379
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,599
go back to the lab, finish the rest

380
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,840
of tests and agarose gel electrophoresis.

381
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,440
So you don't know how to do it?

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,239
You don't need to judge him.

383
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,159
Lv's not good at making gel electrophoresis.

384
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,679
Help him to practice it.

385
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,479
Ni Ke once practiced in the same way.

386
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,439
Look at you.

387
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,318
You should learn from your professor and me,

388
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,280
learn how to respect and love each other.

389
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,400
Do you know it?

390
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,639
Where are you going?

391
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,119
Boss told us to help you.

392
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,478
I'm not available now. You don't have to help me.

393
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,679
Go after you finish it.

394
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,839
This is our love.

395
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,999
Good job.

396
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,560
Stop him from staying with boss alone.

397
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,039
A restaurant around our campus opened.

398
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,078
I heard it's delicious.

399
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,358
Come on. It's on me.

400
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:42,760
No.

401
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,079
I have to go home.

402
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,279
You can go home after lunch.

403
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,799
It won't take a long time.

404
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,078
The boy is at home. If he doesn't eat on time,

405
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:49,599
he'll be angry.

406
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,838
Zhuang Suiyu.

407
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,759
Listen, I am starving now.

408
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,959
So I am easily pissed off.

409
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,078
Don't look at me in this way.

410
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,078
I am not your brother.

411
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,478
So it's not my duty to educate you.

412
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,799
You don't have to do your homework.

413
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,439
My name is not Zhuang Suiyu.

414
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Uneducated old aunt.

415
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,839
My name is not old aunt.

416
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,478
As your students described,

417
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,559
it's hard to get along well with your brother.

418
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,640
So if Yu is alone at home with him,
it may be...

419
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,399
Is it an emergency?

420
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,759
It's obvious you're in love.

421
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,599
You got a wife and even a kid.

422
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:33,318
It's feast or famine.

423
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,358
When does my love come to me?

424
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,439
I want to eat Fun Waves.

425
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,400
You kept asking it,
but you're still full of energy?

426
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,958
If you don't buy it for me, I'll never stop.

427
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,679
Fun Waves.

428
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,958
I want to eat Fun Waves.

429
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,959
Fun Waves.

430
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,079
Where should I start explaining naturally

431
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,319
to chill her out?

432
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,438
He's behaving unnaturally in a weird way.

433
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,079
There's something wrong.

434
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,920
She is staring at me.

435
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,119
He avoided my look.

436
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,358
There's something wrong.

437
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,239
Well...

438
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:36,719
What did you want to say?

439
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,759
President, I can't find what you asked.

440
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,959
Can you look for it by yourself?

441
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,919
- I can help you to...
- No. No.

442
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,359
It's alright.

443
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,118
I can look for it by myself.

444
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,280
Thanks, President Jin.

445
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,719
Yeah, I'll find it myself.

446
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,359
Keep calm.

447
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,238
Those skills from romantic
dramas were taught by you.

448
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,959
Now it's successful,
I should be delighted.

449
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,719
It's great.

450
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,479
What is great?

451
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,358
Keep the distance.

452
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,199
We can't be too close as ordinary friends.

453
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,119
It's over. It's over. It's over.

454
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,759
Tiantian is going to keep her distance.

455
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,959
I'd better tell the truth.

456
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:20,680
Well.

457
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,999
I can explain.

458
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
Explain?

459
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,598
You don't need to explain to me.

460
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,838
I need to do it.

461
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,719
It's very necessary.

462
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,040
OK.

463
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:34,880
Well.

464
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,239
I should start from
the day you met Linda.

465
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,760
Why does it sound not good?

466
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,639
Is he going to have a secret relationship?

467
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,520
The one who knows it will be fired?

468
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,359
To lie,

469
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,079
I won't do it.

470
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,439
So I will pretend not to know
what you are talking about.

471
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,079
Big-hearted woman.

472
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,679
Among Thirty-Six Stratagems,
the best way is to go away.

473
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,399
President Jin.

474
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,999
Do you get what you want?

475
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,279
The lunch break is almost over.

476
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,880
If you don't go to have lunch,
you'll be late for work.

477
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,239
Yeah, it's here.

478
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,680
What do you want to eat? I'll join you.

479
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,280
OK.

480
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,399
President Jin.

481
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,800
There must be a lot of people
in snails rice noodle stall.

482
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,318
Or we can go back to the office first?

483
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,318
And later you can go with Linda.

484
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,318
You...

485
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,439
Why do you mention her suddenly?

486
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,238
I just feel that you
two are more in tune.

487
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,520
It's better for you to go with her.

488
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:53,680
Stop.

489
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,280
Why do I feel you mean something else in your words?

490
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,839
No.

491
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,519
Your relationship is closer.

492
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,680
That's the truth.

493
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,640
Tiantian...

494
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,959
Tell me the truth.

495
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,078
Do you hear some gossip in the office?

496
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:21,920
No.

497
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,639
You two exchanged such sweet glances.

498
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,239
Do I need to hear any other gossip?

499
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,999
Not at all.

500
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,160
You know I'm not interested in gossiping.

501
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,920
Let's go.

502
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,639
What?

503
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,999
How can he be so happy?

504
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,520
Today the lunch bill is on me.

505
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,159
Having a secret relationship
is like being a thief.

506
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,198
Linda.

507
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,920
You must have fallen in love with the wrong one.

508
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,199
No. Don't look around.

509
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:17,880
Hello.

510
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,358
Did you buy Fun Waves?

511
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,079
Do you think I have spare money to buy it?

512
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,439
She pushed me.

513
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:41,319
Because I am a self-aware
elementary school student.

514
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,199
What is your homework?

515
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,079
None of your business.

516
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,880
Why are you nervous?

517
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,958
Are you worrying that I will laugh

518
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,438
if you can't answer the questions.

519
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,679
I can answer all.

520
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,679
Then show me.

521
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,958
My teacher said,
you adults can't answer

522
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,479
the questions above the third grade.

523
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,239
Now I'm in the fourth grade,

524
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,000
can you know that?

525
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,839
Why are you so confident as a primary student?

526
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:13,319
Such a long answer to a math question?

527
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,879
This is an additional question.

528
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,000
It's really complicated.

529
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,358
Add an auxiliary line here.

530
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,639
Use similar triangles.

531
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,959
Only three steps.

532
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,118
What your name sounds like is true.

533
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,198
Zhuang Hui sounds like 'pretend'.

534
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,400
You're pretending to be smart.

535
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,799
It's not the meaning of my name.

536
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,760
Or you like Suiyu better?

537
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,958
Check your answer carefully.

538
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,199
When you finish your homework,
then you can have snacks.

539
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,478
You like this?

540
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,399
Yeah.

541
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,598
Food delivery is not good for your health.

542
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,438
Tomatoes contain many nutrients.

543
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:18,279
And lycopene.

544
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,838
It's healthy, right?

545
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,799
Lycopene is lipolytic.

546
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,838
I certainly know that
heating it with oil is the best.

547
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,159
But it's better for nothing.

548
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,718
The placebo effect is also effective.

549
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,000
Or can you

550
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,560
take me to a better restaurant?

551
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,679
I added more paprika for you.

552
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,319
Have a try.

553
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,319
Thanks.

554
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,760
Thanks.

555
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,359
Why don't you eat?

556
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,040
President Jin.

557
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,040
To be honest,
are you falling in love with someone?

558
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,679
Why... why do you say that?

559
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,119
You can't hide it if you love someone.

560
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,799
And, it's normal to fall in love

561
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,520
when you are always with each other.

562
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,520
Is it obvious?

563
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,160
Yeah.

564
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,478
It's not a good place to confess my love.

565
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:36,239
But given the current situation,
I should be flexible.

566
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,400
- Actually...
- You like... Linda, right?

567
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,559
Is this your observation?

568
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,359
Yes.

569
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,438
It's my conclusion according to my long-term observation.

570
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,479
Just say it.

571
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,279
Linda is pretty,

572
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,838
with outstanding work performance
and elegant behavior.

573
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,039
Except for her pretty appearance,
she is also charming.

574
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,159
Everyone admits that.

575
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,359
You can't deny it, right?

576
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,679
And you are an owner of MCN company.

577
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,800
You love a pretty girl,
it's normal.

578
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,159
But like the old saying goes,

579
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,919
don't fall in love with your colleague.

580
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,160
So I didn't think you liked her before.

581
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,679
And at that time, I thought that

582
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,679
you were suffering in another bad relationship?

583
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,359
Stop.

584
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,639
What is the bad relationship?

585
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,800
At that time, you were always stood up.

586
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,838
Listen to me.

587
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,319
OK, just say it.

588
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,118
When we set fireworks,

589
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,958
I saw your phone background accidentally.

590
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,519
And I found you were chatting with Linda.

591
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,079
Then I knew,

592
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,198
the one who always stood you up was her.

593
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:44,800
That's all?

594
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,159
Of course not.

595
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,198
When you know the secret love story,

596
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,759
you will find a lot of sweet interactions

597
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,879
between the couple.

598
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,958
Go home and have a rest.

599
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,838
Come on.

600
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,800
Don't take care of me.

601
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,040
I'll open the door.

602
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:56,920
No.

603
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,640
Linda, it's you. So good.

604
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:11,039
That's the magic of love.

605
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,159
That's all?

606
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,359
It's not enough?

607
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,879
Yu.

608
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,719
Why do we go outside for lunch?

609
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,520
Is it for her?

610
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,400
Carry your bag well.

611
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:28,879
Other kids prefer to go to restaurants.

612
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,919
Why aren't you happy?

613
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,799
My brother cooks well.

614
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,759
You didn't try it before, so how could you know?

615
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,279
He just doesn't want to cook for you.

616
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,239
That's why we are outside.

617
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,279
How do you know that I didn't try it before?

618
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,198
Then you must not have tried my bro's new cuisine.

619
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,559
Cilantro Eggplant.

620
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,680
My brother cooked that for me.

621
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,959
Cilantro Eggplant.

622
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,718
I also like it.

623
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,359
Can you cook it for me later?

624
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,519
My brother is busy.

625
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,879
I only had it once before.

626
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,759
You won't have a chance.

627
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,319
Really?

628
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,679
But your brother cooked for me

629
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,280
several times when he was free.

630
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,520
I know it.

631
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:10,958
You don't behave well.

632
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,199
Only the one who behaves well can enjoy it.

633
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,160
Yu, give her a lesson.

634
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,519
Yeah, also give me a lesson.

635
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,199
You...

636
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,280
go away.

637
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:25,118
You go away! Get out of the way!

638
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:25,800
Go away.

639
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,479
What to eat?

640
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,599
- Meat.
- Meat.

641
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,000
Then barbecue.

642
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:38,640
OK.

643
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,439
I want that.

644
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,879
Why do you like that?

645
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,040
You have no idea.

646
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,160
Thanks.

647
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,599
I also want one.

648
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,599
Eat what is on your plate first.

649
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,358
Yu.

650
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,760
You can't be like this.

651
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:11,000
Good for your health to have vegetables.

652
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,799
Excuse me.

653
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,159
I'd like to have a drink.

654
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,599
Soft drink is a good match to barbecue.

655
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,400
Hello, may I help you?

656
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:23,599
This one.

657
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,438
Yu.

658
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,639
You've changed.

659
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,079
You didn't have such drinks for fat nerds before.

660
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,199
Fat or nerdy,
you deserve it more than us.

661
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,319
How about you, boy?

662
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,238
OK, fine.

663
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,599
- I want...
- That's fine.

664
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,838
Give him more water.

665
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:47,359
OK.

666
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,198
Wait a moment.

667
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:48,839
Wait.

668
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,438
Iced drink, please.

669
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:51,920
OK.

670
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,519
Professor Zhuang does have a good memory.

671
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,718
Who doesn't know it?

672
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,319
My brother is a curve wrecker.

673
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,560
No snack for the meal.

674
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,838
I'm not going to have the snack.

675
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,839
I want to scan this.

676
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,679
What's that?

677
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,639
Garage kit.

678
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,400
You won't understand.

679
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,238
You are brothers.

680
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:21,879
One loves garage kits, the other loves puzzles.

681
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,198
You are two of a kind.

682
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,039
Of course.

683
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,439
You aren't from our family.

684
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:28,920
Wait.

685
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,839
Why do you even know my brother likes puzzles?

686
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,919
Is it a secret?

687
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,958
I also know this brand.

688
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,478
There is a sponsorship event later.

689
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,639
A lot of prizes.

690
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,400
Will you attend it?

691
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:41,959
I just said you don't understand.

692
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,759
Aunt.

693
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,279
You don't know that

694
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,238
this event does not sell tickets to the public.

695
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,519
You can participate in the event

696
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,000
only if you scan it and win the lottery.

697
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,118
It's a mysterious event.

698
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,760
An event that you can't attend by tickets?

699
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,800
Do you win?

700
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,238
No.

701
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,239
It's said that there is a garage kit in the prize.

702
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,439
If I'm allowed to attend this event,

703
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,799
I can do anything for that.

704
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,999
In romantic dramas,
a kid is the best helper

705
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,839
to assist you in a relationship.

706
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,198
How dare you name yourself a drama expert?

707
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,679
I think you are even worse than me.

708
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,478
No way.

709
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,039
Am I ever worse than you?

710
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,999
Be confident.

711
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Remove the question mark.

712
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,999
One question.

713
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,319
Have you seen any couple
who only appear in one place?

714
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,439
What do you mean?

715
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,590
There are three regular interaction places in dramas.

716
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,718
Daily life, work, and entertainment.

717
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:44,800
You went with me to all.

718
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:48,280
And as my assistant,
you're involved in all my schedules.

719
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,999
Then I'd like to ask you,
except workplaces,

720
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,400
have you seen Linda?

721
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,520
Well, maybe not.

722
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,439
Maybe when I'm not with you,
you often meet each other.

723
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,800
Why... why do I feel
jealousy in your words?

724
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:18,838
You misunderstand.

725
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,039
You know,
you just watched a few dramas.

726
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,199
But I am a drama expert.

727
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,520
Linda has got married.

728
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,959
And,
I've never said that I don't allow office love.

729
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,799
You don't need to do anything for me.

730
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,999
I am your brother's friend.

731
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,799
Just promise you'll call me Miss Meiren later.

732
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,879
Miss Meiren.

733
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,319
Good boy.

734
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,840
Didn't you say the one
who applies lipstick is the aunt?

735
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,319
I said it deliberately.

736
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,479
I know girls don't like to be called aunt.

737
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,478
Do not use age to attack girls.

738
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:20,639
Age is not a weapon to attack others.

739
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,238
Your brother means if you
don't think I look older than him,

740
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,238
call me Miss Meiren.

741
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,000
Of course.

742
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,919
I won't be angry if you call me aunt.

743
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,199
Go ahead.

744
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,280
You don't need to send him the ticket.

745
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:42,198
That's the only habit he got.

746
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,478
So we should satisfy him.

747
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,359
But it's not a big deal.

748
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,999
I've been a blogger for many years.

749
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,879
It's not difficult to get a ticket to this event.

750
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,039
Thanks.

751
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,639
You're so welcome.

752
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,079
Well.

753
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,638
You had a great speech.

754
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,199
I announce that you win
the prize to Respect Woman.

755
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,638
He called you aunt.

756
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,399
Then what should I call you?

757
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,479
Give it back.

758
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,360
What?

759
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:12,040
The prize I gave you.

760
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:18,600
What happened?

761
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,839
This event... It seems to
be a fancy dress activity.

762
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,280
And makeup is requested.

763
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,560
I can't get in.

764
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,039
It's nothing.

765
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,600
Do you forget Miss Meiren's job?

766
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,000
Hello, please show me your tickets.

767
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,439
He has the tickets.

768
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,039
The role you're playing is?

769
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,159
Professor of Botany.

770
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,840
Let's go.

771
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,879
Thanks.

772
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,879
So excellent.

773
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,919
Am I lovely?

774
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,679
I'll ask you again, am I lovely?

775
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,639
What's this?

776
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,199
Warship?

777
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:28,039
It's a 1-to-350 scale Liaoning Carrier.

778
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,638
Good design and production.

779
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:32,918
A high degree of detail orientation
and combination.

780
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:35,760
The paint I stocked before can be applied on it.

781
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,999
And what matters is that
it's an out-of-print one.

782
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,560
We can't buy it at other places.

783
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,360
Miss Meiren.

784
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,159
Show some reactions.

785
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,120
I'm nodding.

786
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,599
I get it, and I will be there soon.

787
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,199
Be careful.

788
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,159
You know how Tyrannosaurus Rex became extinct?

789
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,158
Climate change.

790
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,678
Volcanic eruption.

791
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,959
Orogenic movement.

792
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,159
But the academic field hasn't had a decision.

793
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:27,760
Their hands were too short for them to keep balance,
so they fell to their deaths.

794
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,399
So be careful later.

795
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,800
Don't fall over.

796
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,478
Brother, it's a lot of fun here.

797
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,958
I'd like to stay here for the whole day.

798
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:39,719
Yes.

799
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,319
Zhuang Hui is also playing an extinct dinosaur.

800
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,159
Please go protect him too.

801
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,879
Yeah, right.

802
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,958
You are a triceratops.

803
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,519
She is a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

804
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,959
She became extinct early,
so she needs more protection.

805
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,719
Really?

806
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,919
No...

807
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,600
Let's go. The game is about to begin.

808
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,359
Yu.

809
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,239
Come with me.

810
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,120
Sorry, sir.

811
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:17,320
Only cosplayers are allowed.

812
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,599
- He cosplays a botany...
- Wait.

813
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,399
I'll go with him.

814
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,479
Are you sure?

815
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,999
Don't worry.

816
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,279
Tyrannosaurus Rex that can
survive till now is very capable.

817
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,679
Let's go.

818
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,799
OK, everyone.

819
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,438
Welcome to join the game of our event today.

820
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,678
Are you ready?

821
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,159
Yes.

822
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,719
Three games.

823
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,678
The first team finishing all the tasks
in the shortest time

824
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:47,198
will get our big prize, Winner Model Prize.

825
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,198
[Winner]

826
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,040
Don't worry. I'll get it.

827
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,760
First round.

828
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,759
Ping Pong Relay.

829
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,559
Transport our ping pong
balls to the designated basket,

830
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,119
then you can move on to the next round.

831
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,120
If the ping pong ball falls,
you have to restart this round.

832
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,799
♫ I'm feeling like cos someone with you ♫

833
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,625

♫ You know where to find me ♫

835
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:21,319
This is the end of games for today.

836
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,199
We would like to
congratulate the dinosaur team.

837
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,800
Well done.

838
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,280
Great.

839
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,600
Come on.

840
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:47,800
Go! Go!

841

Excellent.

851
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,360
I'm exhausted.

852
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,600
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

853
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,679
Thanks.

854
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,559
He loves highly-designed models,

855
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,280
but why do you only like puzzles?

856
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:11,800
When I was little,

857
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:14,119
my family couldn't afford a model.

858
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,239
But paper puzzles are cheap.

859
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,119
Well.

860
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,438
Have you finished renovating?

861
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,959
I haven't reimbursed you yet.

862
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,399
It's not bad.

863
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,878
OK, show me your QR code for receiving money.

864
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:35,560
How much in total? I'll pay for you.

865
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,199
No.

866
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:38,879
No?

867
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:40,119
Here.

868
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,159
You helped me a lot.

869
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,319
That's different.

870
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,999
I can't take advantage of a professor, right?

871
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,919
I haven't got the invoice.

872
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:50,040
Pay me when I have it ready.

873
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
You're not ready? Really strange.

874
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,500
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

Start now.

879
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,079
Let me show you how to build it.

880
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,799
I am an expert.

881
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,639
OK.

882
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:23,800
You can handle such a difficult model.

883
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,040
Yeah.

884
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,478
Wait.

885
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:33,478
Brother.

886
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:35,158
How to build this?

887
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,958
Help us.

888
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:37,520

00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,779
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

919
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,649
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

920
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:02,030
♫ Even the air is filled with the scent of flowers ♫
