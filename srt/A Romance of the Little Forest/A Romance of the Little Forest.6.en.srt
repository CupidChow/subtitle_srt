[A Romance of the Little Forest]

00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,980
[Episode 06]
[Yu Meiren, your disguise is gone.]

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,480
Professor Zhuang.

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,918
The path isn't yours.

26
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,160
Why can't I take this way?

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,838
You're stepping on a luffa seedling.

28
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,519
I...

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,599
It grows in disorder.

30
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,079
Professor Zhuang.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,518
Since we are on the same path, wait for me.

32
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,559
Same way, different thoughts.

33
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,319
Professor Zhuang, shall we make a deal?

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,038
If you do me a favor,
I won't bother you anymore.

35
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,360
You go your way,
and I'll go mine.

36
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,319
If you don't want to help me,

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,599
I'll have no choice but to
follow you and bother you.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,279
Excessive self-awareness is not a good thing.

39
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,880
I won't let anyone who upsets me be happy.

40
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,759
Just help yourself.

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,279
Stop.

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,759
Have some water.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,880
Director.

44
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,079
Tidy up.

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,839
OK.

46
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,319
Where did the brand find the small team?

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,398
They are arrogant as if they were Party A.

48
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,799
I can't bear it.

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,239
We're here to cooperate with them.

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,118
Don't be so critical.

51
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:23,879
But he purposely repeated filming
for so many times.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,320
We're just punching bags
who do a hard but thankless job.

53
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,838
Since we choose this job,

54
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,838
be prepared to face various situations.

55
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,719
We should do our own work well
and be professional.

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,559
After a long time,
people will naturally respect you.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,118
Cheer up.

58
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,479
Hurry up, the work is done.
We'll return and have a holiday.

59
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,559
OK.

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,800
For Granny Zhang.

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,799
For you.

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,959
Director, it's strange.

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,319
You promised to give me 200 yuan per day.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,599
But after two days,
you only give me 200 yuan in total.

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,439
Granny Zhang, we didn't work for two days.

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,198
We filmed for two half-days.

67
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,118
That's one day in total.

68
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,519
You filmed in daytime.

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,118
At night, we can't do farm work.

70
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,239
Why?

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,398
But we can only give you 200 yuan.

72
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,159
So greedy.

73
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,399
Leave her alone, let's go.

74
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,359
Wait.

75
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,479
What's the matter?

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,238
You want to film more?

77
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:26,239
Director, give her the money she deserves.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,039
Green Tea Lady?

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,159
Director, it is clearly stated in the contract

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,798
that the filming last for two working days.

81
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,518
Why did you only pay one day's salary?

82
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,199
The contract has nothing to do with
what I told her.

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,639
Granny, what did they tell you?

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,838
They promised to give me two days' salary.

85
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,919
Do you have any clue?

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,238
It's you who told me that.

87
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:48,078
It's you who told me.

88
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,958
Director Lin,
since you should conform to the contract,

89
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,199
let's talk about my working hours according to it.

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,079
What do you mean?

91
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Who are you looking for?

92
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,160
Hello.

93
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,239
Mr. Yu who runs the inn introduced you to us.

94
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,239
Mr. Yu?

95
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,599
Are you tourists?

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
What do you want from me?

97
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,639
It's said that the roads here
are very complicated.

98
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,159
It's easy to get lost without a guide.

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,759
If it's okay for you,

100
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,398
we can settle the guide fee on a daily basis.

101
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,078
I'm the right person.

102
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,039
No one is more familiar with
the mountain roads than I am.

103
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,639
OK.

104
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,759
But there is no fun in the mountain.

105
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,599
No one goes up the mountain
except those who collect herbs.

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,558
Collect artemisia annua?

107
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,678
Yes.

108
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:48,439
Recently, artemisia annua on the mountain
has been growing well.

109
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,760
We're quite busy.

110
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:54,320
Guy, you're professional.

111
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,919
Of course. He's studying it.

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,999
You are here for research, not for tourism?

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,999
He is so staid that he can't enjoy sightseeing.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,799
Mr. Zhang.

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,639
Sorry.

116
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,759
There are some family affairs.

117
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,999
I can't go up the mountain.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,359
Mr. Zhang.

119
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,278
What happened?

120
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,679
I'm just kidding.

121
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,039
I'm not kidding.

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,078
My contract clearly stated
six hours of shooting time

123
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,398
per day for two working days,

124
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,759
including makeup preparation time.

125
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,639
As a discount,
makeup time is not included.

126
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,358
We officially started work at 8 this morning.

127
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,678
There should be records in your camera.

128
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,238
It's four in the afternoon.

129
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,798
Except for half an hour for lunch,

130
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,838
you need to pay a overtime fee of one and a half hours.

131
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,599
It's a matter between you and the brand.

132
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,759
It has nothing to do with me.

133
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,879
Director.

134
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,439
What will the brand think

135
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,558
if they know that you deliberately re-film

136
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,199
in order to delay time?

137
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,078
Ms. Yu.

138
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,078
Don't smear me.

139
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,518
Do you have any clue to
prove that I deliberately re-film?

140
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,358
Director, don't be nervous.

141
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,160
I have no clue.

142
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,599
My assistant should have recorded

143
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,479
all the shooting process with her phone.

144
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,639
The brand will judge whether I framed you.

145
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,999
Yes, it's the behind-the-scenes video

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,398
we promised the brand to make.

147
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,959
It's clearly recorded.

148
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,078
I've worked with many online celebrities,

149
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,159
but you square accounts in every detail most.

150
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,759
You teach me a lesson.

151
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,479
Director Lin, I'm not as what you think.

152
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,640
You always pay attention to facts.

153
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,958
In fact, my overtime fee is not expensive.

154
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,558
As a discount, 200 yuan is OK.

155
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:33,880
Give it to Granny Zhang.

156
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,239
You want to do good deeds?

157
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:38,719
Yes.

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,599
I want to do good deeds.

159
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,078
I don't want to post the behind-the-scenes video online.

160
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,959
Would you give me a chance?

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,920
Give her.

162
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,679
Done.

163
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,958
Granny Zhang, here you are.

164
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,118
It's my first time to work with him.

165
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,999
I'm not familiar with him. Don't be angry.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,719
Bin, let's go.

167
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,879
Don't be angry.

168
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
Well...

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,119
Director!

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,358
Thank you.

171
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,199
You're welcome.

172
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,720
You deserve it. Fang.

173
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,358
I was afraid that the tea leaves would be damaged

174
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,720
so I picked them yesterday.

175
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,199
Thank you.

176
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,519
Are your hands OK?

177
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,160
Fine.

178
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,118
I'm fine.

179
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,319
Don't worry, granny.

180
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,719
Girls in town are pampered.

181
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,520
I didn't expect you can pick tea leaves.

182
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,879
Thank you, granny.

183
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,399
Granny, it's late.

184
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,639
Go home as soon as possible.

185
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,400
Or Mr. Zhang will be anxious.

186
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,639
Do you know my son?

187
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,038
God!

188
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,798
I mean, it's hot.

189
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,719
If you don't go back, you'll get sunstroke.

190
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,079
I won't.

191
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,919
Mom.

192
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,319
You're so late.

193
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,238
Don't mention it.

194
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,798
Two man came here to do scientific research.

195
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,999
They asked me to be their guide.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,079
I declined.

197
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,478
I didn't come until they walked away.

198
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,639
So I'm late.

199
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,879
I must thank this girl.

200
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,840
Without her,
I would have been cheated by the camera crew.

201
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,760
Thank you.

202
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,319
Are you hot?

203
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,319
Would you like to have water at my home?

204
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,039
No, thanks.

205
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,919
I'm busy with some matters.

206
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,598
Yes, I have fruit.

207
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,280
Girl.

208
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,598
These are the apples grown by us.

209
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,999
Quite sweet.

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,358
Have a taste.

211
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,199
Thank you, granny.

212
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,319
You're welcome.

213
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,119
Here you are.

214
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:33,840
Thank you, granny.

215
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,279
Granny, go on with your work.

216
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,238
And tea leaves.

217
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,558
She helped me pick tea leaves.

218
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,238
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

219
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,279
See you.

220
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,519
Thank you, granny.

221
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,879
See you.

222
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,478
Where is Xiumei?

223
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:49,279
Xiumei went to town with Feng Cuicui

224
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,439
to buy some props for the square dance.

225
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,358
I think they have returned.

226
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,280
Cuicui, my god!

227
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,478
I must explain.

228
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,598
I didn't mean to screw it up.

229
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:05,879
I didn't know that the villagers are so alert
to scientific research.

230
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,999
I don't know the reasons behind.

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,479
It's important to keep a firm grip on the job.

232
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,759
But I have no interest in that job.

233
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,238
Considering the mountain roads,

234
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,199
we can just use an unmanned drone.

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,039
Yes.

236
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,598
Hello, Wang.

237
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,319
Order an unmanned drone.

238
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,799
Yes, as soon as possible.

239
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,880
Though Qingshui Village is small,
it has some merits.

240
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,479
Professor Zhuang!

241
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,358
Do me a favor.

242
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,799
My hair is stuck.

243
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,279
Professor Zhuang.

244
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,520
The matchmaker must have
tied a red rope between us.

245
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,440
Since it's fate,
would you help me?

246
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,439
When you learn Chinese,

247
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
you must have bothered your PE teacher.

248
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,400
Thanks.

249
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,319
Thank you for your Sanguisorba officinalis L..

250
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,440
I've almost recovered.

251
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:20,199
Thank you for your great kindness.

252
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,519
I'm really grateful.

253
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,719
Since I have nothing to repay,

254
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,239
I have to marry you.

255
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
No need, Ms. Yu.

256
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't have the luck to enjoy it.

257
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:37,879
I only have it.

258
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,599
Here you are.

259
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,599
An apple tree needs the energy of

260
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,400
fifty apple leaves to produce one apple.

261
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,599
Don't waste the earth's resources.

262
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,679
If you eat it, it won't be wasted.

263
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,319
What is happening?

264
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,959
It's going so fast.

265
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,358
How do I become passive?

266
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:13,440
Calm down.

267
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,520
Mind your step.

268
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,840
Or no one will save you.

269
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,199
Yu Meiren, be professional.

270
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,239
You can make it.

271
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,118
Professor Zhuang, the earth is round.

272
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:30,159
Even if you go that way,
we'll meet again one day.

273
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,718
What a sweet apple!

274
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,400
Since you don't eat, I'll eat it.

275
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,999
I'm tired.

276
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,158
Anyone here?

277
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,239
I'm coming!

278
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,199
Mom.

279
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,199
Come and have a seat.

280
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,919
Why are you so late? Slow down.

281
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,959
Wang Xiumei asked me to choose props with her.

282
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,038
But as soon as I arrived,
she had made the choice.

283
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,199
What does she mean?

284
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,238
She looked down upon me
as the leader of the dance team.

285
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:11,079
Mom, Auntie Xiumei is jealous of your good dancing.

286
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,038
Yes.

287
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,239
Of course.

288
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,558
What is the most annoying is

289
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,598
that she mentioned her grandson again.

290
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:21,439
She kept praising as if someone envied her.

291
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,640
Why did she do that?

292
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,279
Just a first-month feast.

293
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,880
What a pompous invitation!

294
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
Fine.

295
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,199
Now Mei has a boyfriend.

296
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,678
Next year I'll get an invitation
in bone inscriptions.

297
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,599
Yes, they can't understand it.

298
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,400
No.

299
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
I've analyzed the situation again.

300
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,038
At the same college,

301
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,199
there are just several teachers in each major.

302
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,079
It's impossible that the man is anyone else.

303
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,479
So the man Mei mentioned is probably Zhuang.

304
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:06,279
But yesterday you thought
it was an underground relationship.

305
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,519
Underground?

306
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,478
Since only her parents know it,
how can it be an underground relationship?

307
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,840
It's not as what you think.

308
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,840
I think you're right.

309
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:21,679
So Mei lied to us that Zhuang is her boyfriend.

310
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,118
Yes.

311
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,399
I see.

312
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,079
So it's Mei's one-man show from beginning to end.

313
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,399
Zhuang doesn't know it at all.

314
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,840
She did that to avoid
being pushed by us to get married.

315
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,320
What an annoying girl!

316
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,118
Hide?

317
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,440
Hide!

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,919
Mom.

319
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,918
Shall I look for a boyfriend?

320
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,880
OK.

321
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,759
Yu Dazhao!

322
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,038
How dare you say "OK"?

323
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,919
OK?

324
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,400
Calm down.

325
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,359
Who are you looking for?

326
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,880
Purplish soil has good drainage.

327
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,280
Unmanned drones can't fly here.

328
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,799
Professor Zhuang.

329
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,479
Did you meet a girl

330
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,239
with the grace of a startled swan
and a swimming dragon?

331
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,599
What are you looking at?

332
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,440
There's no lurid bolete.

333
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,319
Top note: fresh sea water.

334
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,520
Base note: quiet amber.

335
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,159
She uses such a special perfume.

336
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,119
I'm right for sure.

337
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,559
I don't understand. Professor Zhuang,

338
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,119
since you speak little,
why do you become a teacher?

339
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,799
Since you don't like studying,

340
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,160
why do you want to go to graduate school?

341
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,599
Since you ask me sincerely,
let me tell you.

342
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,958
Determine the light conditions

343
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,559
according to the bending radian

344
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,759
of the stem of Artemisia annua,

345
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,280
and then select this path
according to the light conditions.

346
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,640
Professor Zhuang, good job.

347
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,040
Donate all of these for me.

348
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,959
Don't waste resources.

349
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,640
President Jin.

350
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,958
Shall I buy another batch for you?

351
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
It's useless.

352
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,680
I can't get closer to her.

353
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,520
Does she have any other information?

354
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,399
Don't be in a daze, cheer up.

355
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,399
Last time I left you a question.

356
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
How to give him an out?

357
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:51,679
I have been rejected twice in person.

358
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,520
I'd better work hard to get rid of poverty
as soon as possible.

359
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,318
Yu Meiren.

360
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,198
How can you be the heroine like this?

361
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,599
You need to take the initiative.

362
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,039
Am I a heroine?

363
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,718
You should be the leading role in your life.

364
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,238
Think about Go Go Squid!

365
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,759
Tong Nian was rejected many times by Han Shangyan,

366
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,078
but she was still indomitable.

367
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,039
The more setbacks, the more brave she became.

368
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,118
You were just rejected twice.

369
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,519
Tong Nian has so many assists,

370
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,958
including the whole K&K Team and her grandpa.

371
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:26,479
I have nothing but this shabby house.

372
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,400
What an old photo!

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,800
Look.

374
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,999
Mei, do you still remember how we became friends
in primary school?

375
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,718
Of course.

376
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:00,399
At that time, I was black, thin and ugly.

377
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,438
The boys in our class
secretly called me Human Limit.

378
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:07,358
If you hadn't taken action in time,

379
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,559
I would have been bullied a lot.

380
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,559
Look.

381
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,078
It's the beginning of our revolutionary friendship.

382
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,519
Do you get it?

383
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,479
Get what?

384
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,438
A relationship starts with a favor.

385
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:25,520
Think about what you can do for him recently.

386
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,198
Two man came here to do scientific research.

387
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:32,359
They asked me to be their guide.

388
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,479
Yes.

389
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,839
What?

390
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,959
I should have thought of it earlier.

391
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,718
I was busy with avoiding my family
and delayed my real business.

392
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,239
Tell me.

393
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,198
Zhuang Yu came to Qingshui Village
to look for Artemisia annua.

394
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,999
It was I who showed him the way.

395
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,039
Today, he looked for a guide to go up the mountain,

396
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,838
but Shouyi refused.

397
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,718
I have to continue to give him advice.

398
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:00,198
Yes, when you were young,
you liked to watch birds in the mountain.

399
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:02,119
You are familiar with the mountain roads.

400
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,719
I said your love is fated.

401
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
I'll make it.

402
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,159
Next chapter.

403
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,640
Contract lovers.

404
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,239
[Farm station of Qingshui Village]

405
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,940
[No relevant results]

406
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,040
Mei, have you woken up?

407
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,399
It's July.

408
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,318
It's time for summer vacation.

409
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,838
You must come back home, understand?

410
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,958
I'll ask Meinan to send you
the train ticket information.

411
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,078
Listen to me.

412
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,319
You won't regret this time.

413
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,598
Tiantian.

414
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,439
Tiantian.

415
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,519
I'll go to the grape shed first.

416
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,760
Remember to have breakfast.

417
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,039
The situation is grim.

418
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,280
The battle plan brooks no delay.

419
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,879
Professor Zhuang.

420
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,279
If you help me, you'll get paid a lot.

421
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,719
So disgusting.

422
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,800
It must be the bangs' fault.

423
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,039
A worker who wants to do his job well
must first sharpen his tools.

424
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,400
Fluffy hair is essential.

425
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:01,519
My god!

426
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,718
I forgot to remove my makeup.

427
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,399
Terrible.

428
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,680
My face will be ruined.

429
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,078
Let's catch a dragonfly.

430
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,879
Why do you know the whereabouts of dragonflies?

431
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,358
Because I'm good at it.

432
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,359
Wait for me!

433
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,149

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,549

Why do I meet him every time I don't make up?

448
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:56,640
You...

449
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,919
No.

450
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,159
I didn't make up.

451
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,359
He won't know who I am.

452
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,078
Young people need to use honorific

453
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,119
when talking to mountain elves.

454
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,999
I see.

455
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,679
You're not a native.

456
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,000
You want something here.

457
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,719
Things don't seem to be going well.

458
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,478
The key to breaking the bottleneck is women.

459
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,800
Never...

460
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,520
Never refuse...

461
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,118
Never refuse any woman who takes the initiative to you.

462
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,880
It may help you with questions you have in mind.

463
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,959
Don't you trust me?

464
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:15,358
When you went up the mountain,
you passed eight bends,

465
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,318
four ramps and three straw sheds,

466
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:20,439
but you haven't found what you want, have you?

467
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,078
And I also know that from now on,

468
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,039
when you count from one to ten,

469
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,719
there will be a rainbow hanging in the outside sky.

470
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,799
Well, the rain has stopped.

471
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,920
Let's go.

472
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,400
Look. There's a rainbow!

473
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,958
One more thing.

474
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,879
It will be easier to
walk down the mountain

475
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,718
on the left side.

476
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:09,800
I have to go.

477
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,239
Your disguise is gone.

478
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,280
Yu Meiren!

479
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,160
Your disguise is gone.

480
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,479
Thank you.

481
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,759
So embarrassing.

482
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,280
Is it too late to apply for death?

483
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,719
After I put on makeup, I feel like a different person.

484
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,079
How did he figure out?

485
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,000
My god.

486
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,679
Did he figure out long long ago?

487
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,880
Ka kun ka. Sawatdee ka.

488
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,599
My god.

489
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,879
Terrible.

490
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,560
How will I face him?

491
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,039
Stop. I shouldn't think about it.

492
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,040
The top priority is to deal with parents quickly.

493
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,318
You're narrow-minded since I don't take you there.

494
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,399
I'm not narrow-minded.

495
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,279
See you.

496
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,598
Safety first.

497
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,079
See you.

498
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,999
Go.

499
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,838
See you.

500
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,599
OK.

501
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,119
Just in time.

502
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,238
My parents and brother are not here.

503
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,599
I can deal with him at will.

504
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,198
Why are you always scaring me?

505
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,559
You are always around me.

506
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,479
You're more scaring.

507
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,559
Come on.

508
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,279
Let's talk business.

509
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,438
Yesterday, I told you that.

510
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,159
Now I've added a new condition.

511
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,439
I promise you'll gain without any loss.

512
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,399
Since you want a guide,
I'm familiar with the mountain.

513
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,679
Yu.

514
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,238
Did you see my speaker?

515
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,040
Take it easy.

516
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,319
Mom, did you see my dumbbells?

517
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,560
My god!

518
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,478
Mei, why are you back?

519
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:13,238
I... Surprise!

520
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,598
Are you surprised?

521
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,679
Mom and dad, I miss you very much.

522
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,800
Stop.

523
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,040
He is...

524
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:25,118
He's my boyfriend, Zhuang Yu.

525
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,880
Is he your boyfriend?

526
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,760
Yes.

527
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,199
Why did you come back separately?

528
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:41,279
We are both independent in our daily work

529
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,159
and don't ask about each other's work.

530
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,519
I've been busy these days.

531
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,399
I haven't had time to tell him about our family.

532
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,159
I didn't expect to meet him here.

533
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,560
It's fate that makes us meet.

534
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,639
Professor Zhuang, do me a favor.

535
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,800
I will repay you for your great kindness.

536
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,000
Since you have made up a lie,

537
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,238
you must patch it up yourself.

538
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,238
I know.

539
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,879
So I ask you for a favor.

540
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,598
The roads of Qingshui Mountain are complicated.

541
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,879
Without a local guide,
you can't find what you want,

542
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,640
and you may even get lost.

543
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,559
It seems that you're good at losing face.

544
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,439
Mei.

545
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,920
Shouldn't you introduce us?

546
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:29,838
Let me introduce them.

547
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,279
My dad, my mom and my younger brother.

548
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,880
This is your long awaited boyfriend.

549
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:42,599
Considering Artemisia annua,
do me a favor, please.

550
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,759
Mom, what's your expression?

551
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,000
Do you think I'm lying?

552
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,520
Hello, I'm Zhuang Yu.

553
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:05,039
Wow, the iron tree in blossom.

554
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,079
He's helping me!

555
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,078
Mei, it's your fault.

556
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,358
You didn't tell us clearly in advance.

557
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,920
You're a troublemaker.

558
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,519
Zhuang.

559
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,238
I'll refund the accommodation fee to you.

560
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:18,680
Auntie.

561
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:21,118
Zhuang is very principled.

562
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,919
Keep the money.

563
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,159
Well.

564
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,478
Zhuang, are you hungry?

565
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:29,078
He'll serve you a bowl of noodles.

566
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,599
Let's sit down and have a chat.

567
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,799
Mom, it's time for Zhuang to sleep.

568
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,919
He should go to bed now.

569
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,520
Let's call it a day.

570
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,039
He goes to bed so early.

571
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,560
He's fatigued by a long journey.

572
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,679
Mom, go to the square dance.

573
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,159
Or you'll be late.

574
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,999
Yes.

575
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,999
Wang Xiumei is still waiting for my speaker.

576
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,760
I've prepared it for you.

577
00:33:58,761 --> 00:34:01,039
Zhuang, let's have lunch together tomorrow.

578
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,078
Enjoy the nice food cooked by him.

579
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,519
No problem.

580
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,238
Hurry up. See me off.

581
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,839
Yes. Let's see you off.

582
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,560
You don't care about yourself

583
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,959
but pay attention to others.

584
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,158
It doesn't matter that my house is in a mess.

585
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,918
I shouldn't let you be upset.

586
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,559
I want to repay your kindness.

587
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,040
Otherwise, I will feel guilty.

588
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,479
It's strange that you should feel guilty.

589
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,478
By the way, don't forget what you should say

590
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:10,839
when you see my parents tomorrow.

591
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,879
Don't you need preparation?

592
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
No need.

593
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,678
Fine.

594
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,839
I believe that with your understanding of me,

595
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,600
you will be able to deceive my mother.

596
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,158
Don't worry.

597
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,198
You'll benefit from it.

598
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,198
I used to go up the mountain every day.

599
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,760
I know every flower, tree and bush here.

600
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,079
Don't worry.

601
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,399
I can help you find whatever you want.

602
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,959
Only if...

603
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,080
Professor Zhuang.

604
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:50,879
Can't you always let me take the initiative?

605
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:54,840
A guide can't sleep late,

606
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,040
and it's hard to walk on the mountain roads.

607
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,119
If you sprain your foot, no one will carry you.

608
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,919
Don't worry.

609
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,639
I can walk easily even in high heels.

610
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,879
See you at the restaurant tomorrow noon.

611
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,239
See you.

612
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,599
Where are Mei and Zhuang?

613
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,599
Upstairs.

614
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,639
Upstairs.

615
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,599
Young people are so sticky.

616
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,479
Yes.

617
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,159
I thought Mei didn't know anything about it.

618
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:32,438
I didn't expect that she's pretty smart.

619
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,759
You think she lied to you, don't you?

620
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,718
Now you can feel at ease.

621
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,999
Zhuang is down-to-earth.

622
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,599
He won't make trouble with Mei.

623
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,679
Of course.

624
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:43,520
Let me go.

625
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:47,199
Detective Feng, this way.

626
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,040
I'll inquire.

627
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,199
How happy she is!

628
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,039
God helps me.

629
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,360
You have nowhere to run.

630
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:10,199
What are you happy with?

631
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,280
Nothing.

632
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,559
I'm happy to see you.

633
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,479
I think you're happy to see Zhuang.

634
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,119
Why haven't you had the black sesame paste
I made for you?

635
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,559
You said you lost a lot of hair last time.

636
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,438
So I specially made it.

637
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:26,800
Drink it when it is hot.

638
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,039
There is another bag.

639
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,918
Take it back when you leave.

640
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:33,159
I'll drink it later.

641
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,918
Still working overtime?

642
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:38,839
Yes.

643
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,320
The latest research is laborious.

644
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,438
So how's the research going?

645
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:46,360
You must have worked hard.

646
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,879
This is a new research field and a new challenge.

647
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:54,599
Since you're a teacher,
why do you still have challenges?

648
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,238
Yes, we scientific research workers

649
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,439
should have the spirit of continuous progress.

650
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,800
The spirit of continuous progress?

651
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,678
I think your enterprising spirit has been
put into life.

652
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,519
Look.

653
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,119
The things in your suitcase are in a mess.

654
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,079
Clothes and cosmetics.

655
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,519
There is no girl like you.

656
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,519
Mom, men and women are equal now.

657
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,560
I can also keep up with young men.

658
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,999
I'm not kidding you.

659
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,878
You have a boyfriend now.

660
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:28,559
If you can't do the housework,
he will dislike you.

661
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,919
It's fine since he can.

662
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,198
I'm serious.

663
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,799
Even if Zhuang doesn't care,
how about his mother?

664
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,999
What will she think of you, future daughter-in-law?

665
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,999
Mom, you think too much.

666
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,399
Besides, women in our new era
should do what we like.

667
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,679
Do what you like?

668
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,198
But your room is in a mess.

669
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,958
Come on, the girl in the new era.

670
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,198
No.

671
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,799
Stand up. Since you're at home these days,

672
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,398
I'll teach you how to pack.

673
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,120
Come on.

674
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,800
Look.

675
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,119
I suddenly feel dizzy.

676
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,359
I seem to be a little short of oxygen.

677
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,079
You feel dizzy when I ask you to pack up.

678
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,678
Hey, you!

679
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,600
No, I need to get some air.

680
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,149
♫ If you dream of a gust of wind ♫

681
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,549
♫ A long journey indicates a strange sky ♫

682
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,749
♫ How many possibilities are there for farewell ♫

683
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,850
♫ What kind of farewell do I have ♫

684
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,999
♫ An impossible dream ♫

685
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,299
♫ Some people laugh at my bleary eyes ♫

686
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,699
♫ There are countless possibilities to let go ♫

687
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,199
♫ I just love chasing the wind ♫

688
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,499
♫ I never stopped searching ♫

689
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,800
♫ In the boundless forest ♫

690
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,319
Thank you, boy.

691
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,959
You also live here?

692
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,198
Let me introduce myself.

693
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,238
I'm Lv Jian.

694
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,800
Hello, I'm Yu Meiren.

695
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,120
Are you studying botany?

696
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,479
Yes, you have ideals and ambitions.

697
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,918
In fact, I learned it to fight against my parents.

698
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:20,438
The more they think its future is bad,
the more I want to learn it.

699
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,520
I feel relieved to see them upset.

700
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:26,198
Are you also here for research?

701
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,839
Research? I just want a summer internship certificate.

702
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,918
A certificate?

703
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,759
Don't be modest.

704
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,398
You have the hands of the working people.

705
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,840
You often do farm work.

706
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,678
Can you see that?

707
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,839
Of course.

708
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,399
You must be a good student.

709
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,999
You're Zhuang Yu's student, right?

710
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,679
I haven't seen you at school.

711
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,198
I don't like going to the school.

712
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,398
By the way, I heard from uncle and auntie

713
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:54,360
that Professor Zhuang is your boyfriend.

714
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,759
If he falls in love with a girl,

715
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,679
that will be breaking news at school.

716
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:01,719
Of course.

717
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,678
Thank you for helping me pick tea leaves last time.

718
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,158
Would you like to have some drinks? My treat.

719
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,958
I shouldn't let a girl pay.

720
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:09,679
I can buy on my own.

721
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,319
It's my treat.

722
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,439
Let me buy it.

723
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,760
I'm so happy that I picked tea leaves
with a beautiful girl.

724
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,840
It's priceless.

725
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,999
You have a good literary talent.

726
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,119
If I hadn't known you were Zhuang Yu's student,

727
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,840
I would have thought you majored in Chinese.

728
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,760
Meiren.

729
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:42,760
When did you become his girlfriend?

730
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,039
I heard that there's a fan group about him.

731
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,958
No news has been leaked.

732
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,000
Strange.

733
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,560
You mean Professor Zhuang doesn't deserve me?

734
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,059
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

735
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,359
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

736
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,660
♫ I'm sure you are my future ♫

737
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:17,398
You said yesterday that
I was the person you loved most.

738
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:19,559
Why do you break up with me today?

739
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,158
Let me explain.

740
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,759
Love is always unpredictable.

741
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,399
You are a good girl.

742
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,238
You'll meet better boys.

743
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,599
I have to go.

744
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,760
Don't leave me.

745
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:34,080
Baby.

746
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,359
If it wasn't for helping girls out of the miseries,

747
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,719
I wouldn't have helped you.

748
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,279
Hello.

749
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,399
Who are you?

750
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,958
I'm his younger sister.

751
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:49,599
My mom has made a child betrothal
for him in the village.

752
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,238
As soon as he graduates,
he must go back to get married.

753
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,000
Let go of my brother.

754
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,760
She is crying bitterly.

755
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,649
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

756
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:14,949

♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

764
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,249
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

765
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,249
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

766
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,500
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

767
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:52,349
