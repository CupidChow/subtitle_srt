[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,039
[Episode 34]
[This "Pursue Yu" Plan didn't seem to work]

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,759
I think you all know

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,399
that I became a top trending topic without paying.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,439
No matter who spent the money for me,

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,639
I want to thank this person now.

28
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:48,799
Because of her help,
I've attracted so much attention again

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,439
after I quit being a blogger,

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,399
I got the chance to stand here,

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,198
and now you have the curiosity and patience

32
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,238
to listen to what I'm going to say

33
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,558
about the charity sale for the conservation area.

34
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:02,359
This is a very meaningful thing.

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,359
I feel happy about it
no matter in what way

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,760
it drew your attention.

37
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,440
How shameless.

38
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,919
You're leaving before getting on stage?

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,038
You want me to get on stage
and be a foil to her?

40
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,398
How are you gonna tell Mr. Zhao?

41
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,519
He's arranged all the trending topics.

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,759
I'll explain to him.

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
Lin Qingxuan once said,

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,719
"Although we live in the dust net,

45
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,359
we should never lose the heart to fly,

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,558
and forget the flying posture."

47
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,918
But in some places,
wild birds that are supposed

48
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,959
to be free to soar in the sky

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,278
are losing their freedom and even lives

50
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,279
for reasons such as poaching

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,319
and degradation of wetlands.

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,278
So I want to take today's
opportunity to use your help

53
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:07,838
and let more people
know that there is

54
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,359
such a group of life on earth

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,759
which deserves our respect,
attention and protection.

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,678
What an inspiring speech.

57
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,599
I noticed that lots of
brand representatives

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,278
have become deeply interested

59
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,159
in our conservation area charity sale.

60
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,520
Please,
raise your number and let me see who's interested.

61
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,919
OK.

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,439
No. 18, Jian Tao Group

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,359
is interested in Miss Yu's charity sale.

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,678
Congratulations,
Miss Yu, Yu Meiren.

65
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,398
[Mr. Zhao]
And let's welcome

66
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,319
the brand representative to come on stage.

67
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,559
Give him a round of applause.

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,279
What? Jian Tao?

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,678
How's it possible?

70
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:50,439
When I invited Jian Tao,
the PR made it very clear to me

71
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,439
that they have their own charitable foundation

72
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,160
and wouldn't join the charity sale.

73
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,640
Why did you come to such a place?

74
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
To support you.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,999
How could you come at will?

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,399
Did you endorse Jian Tao?

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,760
You're quite good.

78
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,398
Don't flatter me.

79
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,920
OK,
let's invite Mr. Zhuang to say a few words for us.

80
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,719
I'd like to thank Miss Yu

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,799
for bravely sharing her concern
about the ecological environment.

82
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,479
On this planet,
we should never value humans

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,319
over other animals.

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,999
The respect we give to other lives

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,239
is a reflection of the respect we give ourselves.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Well said!

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,838
Besides,
Miss Yu stays true to her own attitude,

88
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,200
and it's in tune with Jian Tao's values.

89
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,358
If Miss Yu could become
the brand ambassador,

90
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,799
it'd be Jian Tao's honor.

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,079
I wonder if you'd like to accept it.

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,760
An endorser can't make the decision.

93
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,319
President Zhuang of Jian Tao Group
has offered an invitation.

94
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,920
Miss Yu, please say something.

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,119
President Zhuang?

96
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,559
A lollipop. You don't want it?

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,959
Then give it to me.

98
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,200
Yu,

99
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,958
I never want to eat it again.

100
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,119
Meiren, want a lollipop?

101
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,518
It's a Jian Tao lollipop.

102
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,640
I buy it all the time.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,480
If he loses, let him eat this.

104
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,358
You're just a schoolboy.

105
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,039
I don't think you have any pocket money.

106
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,118
Don't spend it on me.

107
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,160
Save some money
to buy a model for yourself.

108
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,999
Meiren, you don't have to worry about it.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,320
My pocket money...

110
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,440
You gave it to me last time.

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,439
If it's real,
it should be expensive.

112
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,519
I think it's better to
give it back to you.

113
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,159
Meiren, that was a great speech.

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,799
It's so like you. Very cool.

115
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,238
President Zhuang's here. We'll leave you alone.

116
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,320
- See you.
- We're leaving.

117
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,279
See you.

118
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,839
Don't think about it.

119
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,000
I bought the fossil myself.

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,399
How do you know I'm thinking about this?

121
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,118
What is it now?

122
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,519
Even Tiantian would think this is cheesy.

123
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,479
Are your parents going to show up,

124
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,640
hand me 10 million yuan and ask me to leave you?

125
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,760
So,

126
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,679
you've agreed to be with me?

127
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,319
Look at you.

128
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,519
Why did you become so
glib-tongued once your cover is blown?

129
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,359
Do your parents know about the news?

130
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,599
The parents busy with work

131
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,798
and the son having another ambition.

132
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,238
Having not seen each other in years,

133
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,839
the son made an outrageous request
when they reunited.

134
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,678
The parents seized the opportunity

135
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,679
and made you inherit the family estate.

136
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,559
Mom.

137
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,679
I have a favor to ask.

138
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,798
You're finally willing to ask for my help.

139
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,959
Who's it for?

140
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,480
That's it?

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,720
Tiantian will complain that
the screenwriter's being lazy.

142
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,519
We're still a family.

143
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,599
It won't be a problem.

144
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,718
Though this sounds cheesy,
I still wanna say it's poverty

145
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,799
that limited my and the screenwriter's imagination.

146
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,238
Wanna expand your mind?

147
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,519
How?

148
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,840
Meet my parents with me.

149
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,359
You... You've skipped some steps.

150
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,999
What step do you want?

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,519
I'll do anything you say.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,879
I...

153
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,558
You know what I want.

154
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,118
I'm not talking with you about this.

155
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:08,238
Since you're so rich,
why did you live in my place?

156
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,440
Experience poverty?

157
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,718
It's my parents' money.

158
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:15,760
I didn't earn it.

159
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,660
[Recipient: Mrs. Zhang]

160
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,599
What's wrong?

161
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,960
Mrs. Zhang?

162
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,439
Yes, that's me.

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,200
Hold on.

164
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,718
Who's Mr. Zhang?

165
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,798
My ex-husband.

166
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,079
To tell you the truth,

167
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,999
he has a secret identity,
second prince of the Ghost family,

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Ghost Prince.

169
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Ghost?

170
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,759
He's dead?

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,960
Watch your words.

172
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,118
But, that was in the last life.

173
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:06,158
In the next life, he likes a girl named Meiren.

174
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,038
You know.

175
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,839
My name is Yu Meiren.

176
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,640
So in this case,
I'm the one he likes.

177
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,440
This case seems like
an imagined situation.

178
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,279
Though it happened in the last life,
I'll always remember

179
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,719
the love between us.

180
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,640
So I should thank this
Mr. Zhang for giving me a chance.

181
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,719
You owe him big time.

182
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,399
OK, enough about me. Let's talk about you.

183
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,639
How many more surprises do you have?

184
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,038
Tell me when I'm in a good mood.

185
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,000
Nothing more.

186
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,520
I've told you everything.

187
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:49,038
No, there's one more thing.

188
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,119
Tell me, I'm all ears.

189
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,880
This "Pursue Yu" plan

190
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
didn't work very well.

191
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,999
None of them worked?

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,719
My meticulous designs.

193
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,038
I wrote that just for fun.

194
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,320
I didn't put much thought into it.

195
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,239
You did

196
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,200
but it didn't work.

197
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:12,919
He's humiliating me.

198
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,080
Because

199
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,158
you weren't swayed by them.

200
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,559
Don't say...

201
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,280
What? You used them on me?

202
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,558
When exactly? Why don't I remember that?

203
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,840
That's why it didn't work.

204
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,038
So... Since you saw that list,

205
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,760
why are you still acting calm?

206
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,640
Actually,

207
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,919
I'm not calm.

208
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,079
Let me explain.

209
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
I was surprised.

210
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,440
I didn't know you were so into me.

211
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,879
Don't flatter yourself.

212
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,320
Didn't you feel my anger between the lines?

213
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,519
I was also confused.

214
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,039
If I remember correctly,

215
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,399
I had no feud with you.

216
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,959
No, you're wrong.

217
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,399
Quite wrong.

218
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,079
We didn't have a feud?

219
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,960
You were like my deadly enemy.

220
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:09,439
I think we first met at Huaguang University.

221
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,799
So you made that list in less
than two days after we met?

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,280
That doesn't make sense.

223
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,478
That's not the first time we met.

224
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:22,679
But our feud started at Huaguang University.

225
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,279
Doesn't ring a bell.

226
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,879
Right, it doesn't ring a bell with you.

227
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,479
That's your original sin.

228
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,080
Then how do I make up for it
to make you satisfied?

229
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,679
You wanna know?

230
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,559
Beg me.

231
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,359
Now can you tell me

232
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,000
where did you first meet me?

233
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,400
I'll tell you after this kiss.

234
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,279
You're not supposed to be here.

235
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,679
But...

236
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,079
But what?

237
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,279
You missed such a great opportunity,

238
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,118
and let others take advantage of it.

239
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,279
I got sloppy.

240
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,118
I didn't expect Yu Meiren would...

241
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,319
You didn't expect it?

242
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,760
The company spent so much money on you,

243
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,080
just to pay for your mistakes
over and over again?

244
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,399
Give me another chance.

245
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,038
I'm sure I'll find some ways.

246
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,879
I just need more time.

247
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,719
I'll make it next time.

248
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,158
Xiaofang.

249
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,400
Check the post on Weibo.

250
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,839
Fake celebrity spotted.

251
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,839
Xia Zhi.

252
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,038
Isn't she the rich girl who lived abroad?

253
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,399
She's dressing up so plainly.

254
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,759
Some people have already
been authentic to themselves,

255
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,718
but some people are still
living in the lies they made up.

256
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,400
God, I was wrong about her.

257
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,158
The heir to Jian Tao mysteriously appeared.

258
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,999
Turns out he's Professor Zhuang Yu,

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,439
a renowned expert
in the breeding of artemisia annua.

260
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,879
He got failure in academics

261
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,439
and went home to inherit the family fortune.

262
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
Look at the post.

263
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
It's all nonsense.

264
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,199
Good for Yu Meiren.

265
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,718
She didn't let me go
and sneaked over there herself.

266
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,079
They're standing on stage together.

267
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,358
I wouldn't call it sneaking around.

268
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,959
They're being open and aboveboard.

269
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,640
She just chose a guy over her friend.

270
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,879
I'm sure she colluded with Zhuang Yu in advance,

271
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,879
and they were worried I'd steal his thunder.

272
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,598
But look at Meiren's face.

273
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,080
It's not like she's faking it.

274
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,159
Besides,

275
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,918
how would you steal Professor Zhuang's thunder?

276
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,639
I'm just being honest.

277
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,200
You can ask him,
who was the real cutest guy back in school.

278
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,358
That's a good question.

279
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:41,918
In TV shows set in a school,
there are often an ice prince,

280
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,640
and a school bully who always messes things up.

281
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:50,678
Who always messes things up?
Who do you mean?

282
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,598
So you admit you're the school bully.

283
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,158
Tell me, what bad things have you done?

284
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,320
I had the third highest GPA in our grade.

285
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,079
I'm both a smart ass and a school bully.

286
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,239
The toast of the school.

287
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,798
Alright, the loner who seeks defeat.

288
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:11,519
To prove your ability,
could you help me polish my draft?

289
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,599
Our sales will be
counting on you.

290
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,080
The pen.

291
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,639
Look. You can't mention the competitor.

292
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,999
Or it'll be unfair competition.

293
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,880
You need to change this.

294
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,439
And this one.

295
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,400
Inaccurate wording. Correct this.

296
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,238
Got it.

297
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,919
Mr. Loner, continue.

298
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,279
Did you see the post on Weibo?

299
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,718
Of course.

300
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:44,358
It went viral in the group chat.

301
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,839
That explains.

302
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,759
Professor Zhuang always acts like

303
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,399
money means nothing to him.

304
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,598
So he was born with a
silver spoon in his mouth.

305
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,798
That isn't about money.

306
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,000
Wisdom in hold, elegance in mold.

307
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,199
Can you add me to your group chat?

308
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,519
- You're...
- You're...

309
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,399
I'm a senior fan of his.

310
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,399
I left the group chat by accident.

311
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,399
Invite her in.

312
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,719
- We can chat together.
- Alright.

313
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,039
You look a little familiar.

314
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,079
Professor Zhuang's here.

315
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,639
Good spirits.

316
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,479
Looks like you all have something to say.

317
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,879
Yes!

318
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
OK, I'll give you the chance.

319
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,438
We'll do a quiz.

320
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,319
Five points will be deducted from
your class performance score for a wrong answer.

321
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,759
Ni Ke, keep a record.

322
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,959
Got it.

323
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,680
You, please.

324
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,000
Me... Me?

325
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,520
This is...

326
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,640
Acer rubrum?

327
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:12,199
Wrong. Acer palmatum.

328
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:18,318
Look at the lobes.
The lobes of acer rubrum are darker.

329
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,640
They extend to the base of the stem. Next.

330
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,160
This is...

331
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,919
Ficus... Ficus pumila?

332
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,759
Wrong. Camphorwood.

333
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,839
Next.

334
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,359
Hydrocotyle vulgaris.

335
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,040
Pilea peperomioides.

336
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,640
Next.

337
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,880
Any more volunteers?

338
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,040
Looks like you've got something to say.

339
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,800
This isn't hard. Saucer Magnolia.

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,520
You look unfamiliar.

341
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,839
I don't think you came to my class before.

342
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,679
I came for you.

343
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,760
Sir, did I get the right answer?

344
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,198
How could you tell?

345
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:22,880
There's a Japanese White-eye next to it.

346
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:30,040
It seems you're a
bird professional.

347
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,799
I wouldn't call myself that.

348
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,478
The Japanese White-eye is
a small passerine bird in the white-eye family.

349
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:40,039
The shape of a saucer magnolia flower
resembles a saucer,

350
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,199
and the Japanese White-eye likes to move near it.

351
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,040
Don't fool around. Sit.

352
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,880
Who's this girl?

353
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,000
Why wasn't I the one who got it right?

354
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,119
Meiren.

355
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,999
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon.

356
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,040
Will you and Zhuang come back home?

357
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,239
We've got a great festive atmosphere.

358
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,598
Easy.

359
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,640
Be careful.

360
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,959
Yes, the moon in our village is full and bright.

361
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,160
Mom just misses you.

362
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,160
Be careful and hang up the lanterns.

363
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,479
OK, I'll ask him.

364
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,000
No, why am I taking the initiative?

365
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,799
I've been busy with all the experiments.

366
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,118
I'm not going home tonight.

367
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,919
Remember to have dinner.

368
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,078
Oh, right.

369
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,759
I drew a few kinds of birds in the study.

370
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,280
See if you like them.

371
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,279
If I had a single flower for
every time I think about you,

372
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,079
I could walk forever in my garden.

373
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,940
♫ Passing through beams of light ♫

374
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,879
♫ Meet the best one ♫

375
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,118
Ma'am.

376
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,280
Here you are.

377
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,438
♫ A beautiful sun ♫

378
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,499
♫ An occasional response ♫

379
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,619
♫ makes my world clear up ♫

380
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,780
♫ The voices in my head ♫

381
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,460
♫ can't be avoided but still heal me ♫

382
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,939
♫ The world of two ♫

383
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,459
♫ is what we're proud of ♫

384
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,740
♫ I'm walking toward you ♫

385
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,059
♫ You suddenly break in ♫

386
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,619
♫ and also open up my heart ♫

387
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,460
♫ Tell me this moment can be our future ♫

388
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,099
♫ The expectations of two ♫

389
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,579
♫ are as splendid as dreams ♫

390
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,939
♫ Migrant birds follow the light ♫

391
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,859
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

392
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,339
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

393
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,260
♫ I'm sure you are ♫

394
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,580
♫ my future ♫

395
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,159
Let's go to have dinner.

396
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,719
Where are we going to eat?

397
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,318
We'll have a hot-spicy pot.

398
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,598
How about Lvye Restaurant?

399
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,640
OK.

400
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,119
Someone's in here! Open the door!

401
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,040
Come to the library to save me. I'm scared.

402
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,640
Meiren!

403
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,119
Meiren!

404
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:09,599
What took you so long?

405
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:12,839
Meiren.

406
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,719
Are you scared?

407
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,319
Professor Zhuang, are you there?

408
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,160
Professor Zhuang.

409
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,160
Don't move. Don't.

410
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,958
Professor Zhuang, are you alright?

411
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,079
Stand still.

412
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,839
I'm fine.

413
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,479
Don't move.

414
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,400
Don't move.

415
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:10,519
What is it?

416
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,198
I have to go home now.

417
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,519
You can leave the key with the doorman.

418
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,159
I'll go get it tomorrow morning.

419
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,238
OK, thanks.

420
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,520
Alright, I gotta go.

421
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,800
Still messing around?

422
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,319
Professor Zhuang, I'll never do it again.

423
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,358
I didn't know you'd be scared.

424
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,839
No Time to Talk.

425
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,000
Or Miss Yu?

426
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,160
Still not leaving?

427
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,438
You... You... You...

428
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:33,400
Not until you get this straight.

429
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,359
What's the hurry?

430
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,358
Poser.

431
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,159
When exactly did you know about it?

432
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,599
Can you tell me now?

433
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,439
Thanks.

434
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,079
I can tell you now.

435
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,000
Sunscreen cream.

436
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,799
I looked at the night sky,
and found your forehead looks dark.

437
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,799
The only way to survive this
is to wear sunscreen cream.

438
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,399
Miss No Time to Talk. The name is special.

439
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,119
But the way you talk isn't very creative.

440
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,959
Was it that obvious?

441
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,119
Look.

442
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,078
Kingfisher.

443
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,118
A family of medium-sized birds

444
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,400
within the order Coraciiformes.

445
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
[No Time to Talk]

446
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,958
I also couldn't think of how
to make it look less obvious.

447
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:09,199
But upon contemplation,
No Time to Talk

448
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,959
must be you.

449
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,880
Doesn't the name sound
very proud and privileged?

450
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,639
I don't know about that.

451
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,599
But people will have no time to talk to you.

452
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,119
But, the evidence is insufficient.

453
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,118
Being able to see the details

454
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,879
of bird legs that even I didn't notice,

455
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,520
it definitely can't be a beginner.

456
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,359
You know how to blow your own trumpet.

457
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:39,079
And then you came to school for classes,

458
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,799
and only general courses were offered
during summer vacation.

459
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,039
They were too elementary for you.

460
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,119
But you did attend all the classes.

461
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,560
If you weren't a student, you must be a teacher.

462
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:54,040
That's it?

463
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,640
And we're in the
same department.

464
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,399
Your supervisor, Director Wang,

465
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,039
knows Director Li and the others well.

466
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,400
You turned to other people for help. Cheater.

467
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,239
Even I didn't ask Li,

468
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,199
I still knew how to do web searches.

469
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,799
Dr. Yu.

470
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,639
You still have a lot of hair.

471
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,199
Yeah.

472
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,118
I could finish my doctorate degree

473
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,358
without losing a single hair.

474
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,719
How's it? Do you envy me?

475
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,839
Maybe Li envies you more.

476
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,879
No wonder he's a director.

477
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,159
By your hair volume,

478
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,118
you've still got a few more years to go.

479
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:46,520
Make some sacrifices for Huaguang Unversity.

480
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,679
My alumna has such a high consciousness.

481
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,800
So you've known me since college?

482
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,959
Much earlier.

483
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,919
You said I stood you up at Huaguang Unversity.

484
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,118
Right.

485
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,799
But your face

486
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,718
looks like you had a feud with me
early in high school.

487
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:18,519
You always got something for nothing.

488
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,559
You stole my chance of being the first place.

489
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,000
That wasn't stealing.

490
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,838
Easy for you to say.

491
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,238
It's all because of you.

492
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,799
I, the prodigy girl,

493
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,999
skipped a grade
and had been the first place for years,

494
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,280
but you ruined it.

495
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,879
I don't know what you're so proud of.

496
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,839
You look as cocky as the king of spades.

497
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,719
So, Miss Prodigy Girl,
what did you write in the letter?

498
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,999
How did you praise me?

499
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,719
I'm not telling you.

500
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:55,680
I just asked you why did
you steal my first place.

501
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,838
If I tell you,

502
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:02,400
will you write me another letter just like this?

503
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,399
I can write as many letters as you please.

504
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,359
Really?

505
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,760
Until my hand's too shaky to hold the pen

506
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,359
and your eyes are too sore to read.

507
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,479
You promise?

508
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
I promise.

509
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,680
Fine.

510
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,598
In this case,
I'll show mercy and tell you.

511
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,759
I wrote in the letter that
my name is Yu Meiren

512
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,718
and I'd known you for a long time.

513
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:34,838
After a period of less comprehensive observation,

514
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,879
I thought you were barely worthy of me.

515
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,198
But I didn't really know
about your girlfriend criteria.

516
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,598
So we could meet each other first.

517
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,160
If you were interested in me,
we could try to develop our relationship.

518
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,359
What are you laughing at? This is serious.

519
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,640
So you jumped from the
letter to "Pursue Yu" plan?

520
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,919
That's my prodigy girl who skipped grades.

521
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,640
Don't mock me!

522
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,040
How could I reject your kindness?

523
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,519
But what made you think
I agreed to meet with you?

524
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,039
You didn't return the letter,

525
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,599
that means you accepted my offer.

526
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,598
So can you tell me now?

527
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,519
Tell you what?

528
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,958
Your girlfriend criteria.

529
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:22,479
Or how would I know I'm up to your standards?

530
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,079
Are you asking about my criteria back then or now?

531
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,520
You can start with it back then.

532
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,319
Think straight before you say it.

533
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:37,439
None.

534
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,359
What do you mean?

535
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:45,358
I used to think life is limited,

536
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,639
and there's no need to spend too much time and energy

537
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,078
looking for a so-called partner for myself.

538
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,279
Since I didn't want to look for a girlfriend,

539
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,160
I didn't set any criteria.

540
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,839
Then what about now? Do you have one?

541
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,400
I do.

542
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,439
What's it?

543
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,680
You.

544
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,878
I don't care.

545
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,918
You have to make it up to me.

546
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,398
For what?

547
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,399
For losing my first place.

548
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,360
How do you want me to do it?

549
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,879
First, of course, try my Yu's Boxing.

550
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,379
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

551
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,899
♫ You show up in my sight ♫

552
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,699
♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

553
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,420
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

554
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,379
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

555
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,999
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

556
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,039
So sweet.

557
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,079
Listening to your story

558
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,560
feels like I'm also in a relationship.

559
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,918
What do you mean by that?

560
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,919
It's just a metaphor. Metaphor.

561
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,079
Okay, we're almost there.

562
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
I'll see you when you're done.

563
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,039
My livestream only got a few hits,

564
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,639
it can't be compared to your long legs.

565
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:07,439
OK, talk to you later.

566
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,599
You got so many followers just by one livestream.

567
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,599
Seems like I need to make a comeback

568
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,119
and create a new goddess.

569
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,438
No need, I'm not as capable as Meiren.

570
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:23,080
I can't be smooth and slick
in establishing social relations.

571
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,638
I'll feel content

572
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,839
as long as I can help them sell a little more fruits.

573
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,319
Besides, Linda manages Xingjin Entertainment well.

574
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,678
You don't need to meddle.

575
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,039
You're right.

576
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,599
I'm having a new identity, after all.

577
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,638
I have my hands full right now.

578
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,479
What's it?

579
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,638
[Letter of Acceptance]

580
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,679
Your study companion.

581
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,080
Huaguang Unversity.

582
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,239
Broadcast and host training class
of Huaguang University.

583
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,878
How did you know...

584
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:58,638
If I couldn't even see that,

585
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,319
I'd be a terrible boyfriend.

586
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,040
Don't worry.

587
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,478
You can focus on your study.

588
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:05,000
I'll be taking care of your grandma.

589
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:09,438
Right, and this.

590
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:10,958
Think of it as a little back-to-school gift.

591
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,800
You can't reject me this time.

592
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,639
I can't take this.

593
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,638
You forgave me and
agreed to be my girlfriend.

594
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,238
That's the best gift for me.

595
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,839
This isn't the same thing.

596
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,000
It's not like I agreed...

597
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,119
Right, whatever you say is right.

598
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,958
I just have a little bit of advice.

599
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:36,599
During class,
will it be better if you can

600
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,198
hear the teacher clearly?

601
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,438
Dreams don't come easy.

602
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:41,520
We still have to work hard to achieve it.

603
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:45,359
You have my absolute respect.

604
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,918
I'm not gonna make you
use a lifetime to return my favor.

605
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:50,559
It's your choice whether to take it or not.

606
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,959
I respect your choice.

607
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:58,000
Thank you.

608
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,638
That's what a boyfriend should do.

609
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,560
I just think you should
kiss me on this side.

610
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,959
Wait.

611
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,079
You're saying you'll
only be my boyfriend

612
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,520
instead of the friend of women?

613
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,158
I have to explain this to you.

614
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,999
I never called myself the friend of women.

615
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,398
I earned this title thanks to
the sharp eyes of the masses.

616
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,239
But from now on,
I'll be all yours.

617
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,080
Will you do whatever I say?

618
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,879
In this case,

619
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,800
help me bag all the grapes.

620
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,039
I'll do that.

621
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,600
But I need a good kiss now.

622
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,999
I heard Tiantian's boyfriend is a big shot.

623
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,999
So it's you, President Jin.

624
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,799
You look so handsome when I get closer.

625
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,158
How could you city folks
know anything about bagging?

626
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,478
- Exactly.
- Let us help.

627
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,080
Thanks, auntie.

628
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:54,559
I'll do it myself. I got it.

629
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,999
Don't call me auntie. I'm not that old.

630
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,438
Sister. Sister.

631
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:01,478
You do look young if I look carefully.

632
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,999
Very handsome.

633
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,398
You run a big business
at such a young age.

634
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,718
Tiantian.

635
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,199
Good luck with that.

636
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,238
Tiantian is a nice girl.

637
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,478
You really have a good eye.

638
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,878
Remember to invest in our village.

639
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,759
Sure, sure.

640
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,840
I will. I will.

641
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,319
Just get yourselves back.

642
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,439
Why did you bring so many gifts?

643
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:26,800
It's good that you didn't bring any gifts.

644
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,119
So many gifts.

645
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,519
Mom, come and take them.

646
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,199
Don't feel shy.

647
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,959
Uncle, auntie, happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

648
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,478
Look at you.

649
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:43,678
It's difficult to work in a big city.

650
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:44,439
We've got everything here.

651
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,398
You don't need to buy all the stuff.

652
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,399
There's more.

653
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,360
- So many gifts.
- My god.

654
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:53,519
Look, Zhuang is a college teacher.

655
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,599
And you only work once or twice.

656
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,398
You have to be careful about spending money.

657
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,760
Don't buy anything for us.

658
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,679
Auntie.

659
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,359
Do you like this one?

660
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,919
Is it for me?

661
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,799
The scarf must be made of good fabric.

662
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,119
It must have cost hundreds of bucks.

663
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,319
It should be more than that.

664
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,678
You see,
I'm only living in a village.

665
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,198
Who would I wear this to?

666
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,279
To show your toxic friends

667
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,878
and let them see how beautiful their captain is.

668
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,319
Yeah? Do I look pretty?

669
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,359
Very pretty.

670
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,718
You should get through to Zhuang.

671
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,040
Don't spend money on us.

672
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:37,198
I can't help. All his family members are like that.

673
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,360
Just get used to it. I can't stop him.

674
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,958
This is my first official visit.

675
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,918
I have to abide by the etiquettes.

676
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:45,600
OK, OK.

677
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:47,599
Zhuang, that's very kind of you.

678
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,519
It's like you're moving your home here.

679
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,718
You must be from a wealthy and influential family.

680
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,560
Exactly.

681
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,360
Is it wealthy?

682
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,839
Well, not very much.

683
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,438
We only do a small business.

684
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,239
What business does your family do?

685
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,079
Only some food services.

686
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,238
We're usually very busy.

687
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,039
Good. Good.

688
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,478
Send our greetings to your family.

689
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,718
We welcome them to come here at any time.

690
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,319
OK, I'll tell them.

691
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,000
How nice.

692
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:16,638
Don't just stand there. The sun is bright.

693
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,559
Let's come inside.

694
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,360
I've already made the tea.

695
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:19,679
Let's go, come inside.

696
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,159
Dad, I got this.

697
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,239
What a lovely family.

698
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,718
This is...

699
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,120
Gou Fei.

700
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,678
Yu Meiren, I knew it was you.

701
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,999
What do you mean?

702
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,198
Pretending to be innocent and playing the victim.

703
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,279
I can't beat you for that.

704
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,438
I admit I lost.

705
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:46,479
Little girl,
some words can't be said irresponsibly.

706
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:49,238
Our homestay isn't open for business today.

707
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,000
Trespassing on private properties is illegal.

708
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,760
Yu Meiren.

709
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:57,438
Don't you call yourself an independent woman?

710
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:58,559
What now?

711
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,279
You only know how to hide behind men and act weak?

712
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,319
Disgusting.

713
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,519
Hey, show some respect to my sister.

714
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,918
Alright, alright.

715
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:07,158
You guys can leave us.

716
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,559
I'll talk to her alone.

717
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:08,959
Is that okay?

718
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,479
Can you manage it?

719
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,878
- Get inside.
- Call me if there's anything.

720
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:16,119
I'll be fine. Just get inside.

721
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,959
Let's go and drink tea.

722
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,520
You're afraid they'll know
about your shameful secrets?

723
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:31,438
I'm afraid you'll think we're bullying you.

724
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,080
Cut it out.

725
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,399
Did you write this?

726
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,600
Keep acting.

727
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:44,839
If I was bitten by a dog,
do I need to bite back?

728
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,279
The dog isn't afraid of pain,

729
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,638
but I'm afraid of getting my mouth dirty.

730
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,439
You knew it?

731
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,958
You used our photo from junior high

732
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:54,039
and your article was bought by Xingfu.

733
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,198
I shouldn't be lucky enough

734
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,198
to have another classmate
from junior high in Xingfu.

735
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:58,999
Then why didn't you...

736
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,639
Why didn't I pull your hair and yell at you?

737
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:03,999
I have enough.

738
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,879
I don't need to care about meaningless things.

739
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,958
Yu Meiren.

740
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,158
That's what makes me different from you.

741
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,280
You're too hypocritical.

742
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,439
I admit what I did.

743
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,439
But you justify all the
dirty things you did.

744
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,419
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

745
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,059
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

746
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,180
♫ I'm sure you are ♫

747
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,980
♫ my future ♫

748
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,120
What?

749
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,678
My supervisor asked me to get a paper published.

750
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,599
I reviewed the literature
and found a relevant article

751
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,958
which is excellently written.

752
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:53,198
The more I looked at it,

753
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,559
the more it looked like a draft I published myself.

754
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,918
I became very nervous.

755
00:42:55,919 --> 00:42:58,238
I was afraid that the duplicate check tool
missed checking it.

756
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,238
If people find it out,
my degree will be revoked for plagiarism.

757
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:02,198
And then?

758
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:05,800
Then I checked the author's
name and found it was me.

759
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:08,399
Look how bad my memory is.

760
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,999
Where are you gonna publish it?

761
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,800
PNAS.

762
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,519
District 1?

763
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Yes.

764
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,878
It's not easy.

765
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:20,319
You also think so?

766
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,280
I only published two articles in District 1 a year.

767
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,169
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫
