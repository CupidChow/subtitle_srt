[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,300
[Episode 05]
[This is the will of God.]

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,720
The Qingshui Mountain in Qingshui Village
has complex terrain.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,360
If going up the mountain,
a local guide is a must.

26
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,679
Handsome boy, are
you tidying up the room?

27
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,720
Right, here is the welcome fruit.

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
I'll send it in for you.

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,399
So many things and so neat.

30
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,249
I'll put it here.

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Thank you, madam.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,399
You're welcome.

33
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,199
You've booked this room for a month here.

34
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,880
I should thank you.

35
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:42,672
You're welcome.

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,759
If you need anything,
just call the reception.

37
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,479
The number is 520, easy to remember.

38
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,312
Good.

39
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,960
Handsome boy, where are you from?

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,199
You will stay here for a month.

41
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,520
Are you a tourist?

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,620
It's just that our village is a bit small.

43
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,759
I... I'm not.

44
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:08,080
You're here for healing your broken heart?

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,399
Definitely not.

46
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,800
This grape is our speciality here.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,279
You can try it.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,440
The man looks good.

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,160
But it seems that
he has some problem in talking.

50
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,759
Thank you.

51
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,919
Good, I'll leave you to it.

52
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,392
Go ahead.

53
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,872
Go ahead.

54
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,112
Go ahead.

55
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:57,240
What... What's wrong with the...
What's wrong with the teammates?

56
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,199
What a coincidence!

57
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,320
The handsome boy upstairs, is
also from Huaguang Unversity.

58
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,279
Look at his back.

59
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,679
You should come and see!

60
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,720
Is it exactly the same?

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,433
Look closely,

62
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,399
various traces are able to prove

63
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,760
the high probability that he is Mei's boyfriend.

64
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,320
Mom, you're like the incompetent official.

65
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,160
What do you know about it?

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,679
Yu, stop the game!

67
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,760
Come on!

68
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,079
Check it out and tell me.

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,799
In my opinion,

70
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,279
no.

71
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,279
Mei said that her
boyfriend is a professor.

72
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,679
So he must be over forty.

73
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,280
Look at him.

74
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,320
This young man is just in his twenties.

75
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,270
How is it possible?

76
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,279
What do you know?

77
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,792
Step aside！

78
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Sherlock Feng in action.

79
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,959
Okay.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,079
1993. How old is he?

81
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,399
Twenty-nine.

82
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,760
That's not right.

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,799
He is just a few years older than Mei.

84
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,359
But Mei hasn't been entitled like anything.

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,440
It shouldn't be him.

86
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,519
Mom, if you really want to
know, just go up and ask!

87
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,359
How can it be? What if he is not?

88
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,720
Then he will say we harassed him.

89
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,880
Now our store is increasing the credibility.

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,519
A bad review, and we're over.

91
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,799
What if there is no mistake?

92
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,239
That means they have other arrangements.

93
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,139
If the enemy doesn't move, I won't move.
I'll wait and see.

94
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,392
Hello?

95
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,040
Hello, what's up?

96
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,600
In our village,

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
are there any villagers who are familiar
with the mountain terrain?

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,720
In our village, people
plant in the orchards,

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
or open a tea plantation.

100
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,079
Most of the activities are
at the foot of this mountain.

101
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,799
The situation on the mountain,

102
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:04,799
only Mr. Zhang and those
who often pick medicine are familiar with.

103
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,799
- Yes.
- How about this?

104
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,099
I'll draw it down for you.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,720
Out of this door, you just
keep walking along the left side.

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,200
This is the village council.

107
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,839
After the village council, there
is a tea plantation over here.

108
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,672
Further on,

109
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,000
Zhang Shouyi, Mr. Zhang.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
His house can be recognized easily.

111
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,239
This wall is white.

112
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,839
That's it.

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,760
Thank you.

114
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,239
Young man, why do you go to the mountain?

115
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:31,000
There is nothing fun on this mountain.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,760
Mei went there last month.

117
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,210
Except grass, there is grass.

118
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,330
I look for grass.

119
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,600
Looking for grass?

120
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,079
Think about it.

121
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,279
What's the profession of Mei's
boyfriend last time she said it?

122
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,672
Planting grass?

123
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,279
Mom, even if you don't dare to
ask him, you can ask my sister.

124
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,849
You little brain, sometimes
you can be trusted.

125
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,600
I'll ask your sister now.

126
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,000
I know his name, right?

127
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Mei?

128
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,359
Hello, mom?

129
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,559
What is it?

130
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:10,440
I want to know what is
your boyfriend's name?

131
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,640
Why do you ask?

132
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,079
Action! What's going on? Why don't you move?

133
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,880
Well... I'm concerned about you.

134
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
Where are you?

135
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,200
Why is it so noisy?

136
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm... I'm having a seminar at school.

137
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Mom, I can't talk to you anymore.

138
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,679
It's my turn to speak.

139
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,399
That's all for now. Bye.

140
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,232
Okay.

141
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,920
That was close. I don't think they can hear.

142
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,119
Miss Long-leg, I'm speaking
to you, what's going on?

143
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,320
Didn't you hear it?

144
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,160
Miss Long-leg is in this doll
suit, she can't hear very well.

145
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,881
My fault.

146
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,959
I didn't take that into consideration.

147
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,880
Influencers take photos in the studio.

148
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,559
When they come to this wilderness,
she can't be familiar with it.

149
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,239
I'll speak louder later!

150
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:55,160
No... Director, I'm sorry for the delay.

151
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,399
Let's continue.

152
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,559
Okay.

153
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,640
Lights!

154
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Go go go!

155
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,600
She mumbles.

156
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,399
She is mysterious.

157
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,640
There must be a catch in it.

158
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,079
What is it?

159
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,000
Every time we mention her boyfriend,

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,079
she either hangs up or interrupts.

161
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,000
Until now, we only know
her boyfriend is a professor,

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,640
plus a photo of his back.

163
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,040
We don't even know his name.

164
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,079
There must be a problem.

165
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,839
Sherlock Feng, how to solve this case?

166
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,479
Start with the handsome boy upstairs.

167
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,739
- That's right.
- That's right.

168
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,919
Come on, action!

169
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,840
Cotton pads with tea tree oil
give you a more natural enjoyment.

170
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,280
Cut! Not low enough.

171
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,359
Do you know how to show
the feeling of being in nature?

172
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:47,881
One more!

173
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:50,280
Get ready, action!

174
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:56,119
Cotton pads with tea tree oil
give you a more natural enjoyment.

175
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,080
Cut.

176
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,440
Lower. One more.

177
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,200
Cotton pads with tea tree oil... Cut!

178
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,280
Watch your pose.

179
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,630
What's wrong with her pose?

180
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,000
I think it's okay.

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,799
Action!

182
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,119
- Cotton...
- Cut!

183
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,400
What's wrong with director Lin?

184
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,679
I heard director Lin had
another shooting, not this ad.

185
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,799
But that star used their own director.

186
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,159
He had to take this.

187
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,880
So he is a little emotional, right?

188
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,520
How can this be so?

189
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,400
It's okay, one more time.

190
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,320
Come on, one more.

191
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,273
Cotton pads with tea tree... Cut!

192
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,512
Cotton pads with tea tree... Cut!

193
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
Cotton... Cut!

194
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,673
Cotton pads with tea tree... Cut!

195
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,919
- Adjust this again.
- Okay.

196
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,320
What is this?

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
A starlet shooting ads.

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,679
A starlet?

199
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,599
Good.

200
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,719
You know what?

201
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,919
I saw her not wearing the doll suit.

202
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,039
She really looks familiar.

203
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:15,960
Is her name... Her name is on
my lips, but I can't remember.

204
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,560
That's terrible.

205
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,799
Who says I'm no longer famous?

206
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm so famous.

207
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,239
I can be recognized by villagers
even wearing a suit like this.

208
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,960
People loves me so deep.

209
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,200
Miss Feng!

210
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,679
Yes, that's her! Miss Feng!

211
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,000
Come on, let's do it again.

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
A little bit lower.

213
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,880
Slightly lower.

214
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,719
Come on, good.

215
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,799
Ready.

216
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,719
Three two one, action.

217
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,960
Yes, the view here is really nice.

218
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,119
Of course, it's definitely
not comparable to Maldives.

219
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,761
But it's okay.

220
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:46,719
Wait for me, dudes.

221
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,239
Once I find that professor,
I'll go to you guys.

222
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,593
Bye.

223
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,119
Director Lin is going too far.

224
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,880
He repeated so many times for just one shot.

225
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:20,559
Isn't out of a director's artistic pursuit?

226
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,960
What are you talking about?

227
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,400
He is being such a snob!

228
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,320
He takes out his frustrations on you.

229
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,640
Can I not know what he means?

230
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,479
Then why...

231
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,799
Whatever he does, we do our best.

232
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,599
We can't let others find fault.

233
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,200
Getting paid to do the job,
we should at least be dedicated.

234
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,320
He may be picky,

235
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,120
all we have to do is
to let him have no mistakes to pick.

236
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,440
Later, this side, we should
take the overall picture.

237
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
And this side.

238
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,960
Meiren, have you had enough rest?

239
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,599
It's only been two minutes since the break.

240
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:53,799
- He won't get heat stoke...
- It's okay.

241
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,119
- I'm coming.
- They didn't even buy water for you.

242
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,400
Go ahead, I'm going to buy you water.

243
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,559
And that place, it's quite good too.

244
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,559
Hurry up, everyone!

245
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,059
It's time to change the scene.

246
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,039
Director,

247
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,080
the tea trees here have not been picked yet.

248
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,520
When you're moving the
props, can you be more careful?

249
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,840
What? How can we be careful?

250
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,640
So many props and machines.

251
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,799
We can't keep on if we don't move them.

252
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,679
Keep going.

253
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,359
Director Lin!

254
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,960
Can you give me a few minutes?

255
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,640
Let me pick it up.

256
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,840
When you move the props later,

257
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,479
a little bit of attention will be enough.

258
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,719
We've got this land under contract.

259
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,159
It's good that you have a good heart.

260
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,400
But you can't make the whole crew
busy for you, right?

261
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,280
You don't have to do it.

262
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,159
Just take your time.

263
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,520
I'll pick it.

264
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,240
Twenty minutes.

265
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,400
Give me twenty minutes.

266
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,840
I guarantee we can shoot on time.

267
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,960
What do you think?

268
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,039
Twenty minutes, start!

269
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,919
I didn't expect that I'm still good at it.

270
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,312
Are you okay?

271
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,512
I'm okay.

272
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,320
Take this.

273
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,153
Thank you.

274
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,640
Let me help you.

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,799
Handsome boy, are you from the city?

276
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,719
You're quite skillful.

277
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm a botany student.

278
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,640
I never thought I would apply what I learned.

279
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,880
Botany again.

280
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
When did this major become so popular?

281
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,840
Stay here and you will be home tomorrow.

282
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,859
- Tomorrow is the casual clothes shooting.
- Right.

283
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,760
Director, then the shooting will be easier.

284
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,713
Director.

285
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,080
Today, we changed the
name, and picked the tea.

286
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
What a day!

287
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,919
That's true.

288
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,919
Thanks for your hard work today.

289
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,159
Have a good rest.

290
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,159
Let's go.

291
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,359
What a day...

292
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,359
It's okay.

293
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,192
My bag.

294
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,119
You, like director Lin, go
to the best hotel in our town.

295
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,080
Meiren, you're being so nice to me.

296
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,000
Miss Long-leg, you're being so generous.

297
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,960
After all, it's my hometown.

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,080
Otherwise, if you go to Meiren
Homestay, do I have to lie to my mom

299
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,960
this is the promotional film crew
of the university?

300
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,320
Meiren, are you not coming with us?

301
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,039
Since the fund is limited,
we need to save money.

302
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,080
Meiren, you...

303
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,599
It's a lie.

304
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,760
Since I'm back, if I don't go home,

305
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,840
my mom should say that I'm like Da Yu.

306
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,590
Have a good rest. See you tomorrow.

307
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,233
Bye bye.

308
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,072
Bye bye.

309
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,679
Meiren Homestay, I'm coming!

310
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,640
Good, thank you.

311
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,400
What are you doing?

312
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:47,760
Meiren Homestay,
now it's true to its name.

313
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,239
Look at the cute guy.

314
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:55,599
If your sister is at home,
he must be her type.

315
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,640
Mom, she has a boyfriend.

316
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,039
Did you forget it again?

317
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,039
Yeah, it's her fault for being single
for too long.

318
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,920
I'm used to finding a boyfriend for her.

319
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,520
By the way, can you help me with my luggage?

320
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,040
Sure.

321
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,873
Go!

322
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,040
Okay, you're checked in.

323
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,199
Let me introduce to you.

324
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,800
The biggest and best house we have
here is the garden-view king room.

325
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,160
The original price is 688 yuan.

326
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,400
- Now it's cheaper.
- 688, right?

327
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,450
Please book it for me for two days first.

328
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,239
I mean, it's cheaper now. 288 yuan.

329
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,239
So many things just for two days.

330
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,920
The humidifier won't be used.

331
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,839
The climate here is humid.

332
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,479
Maybe I need a dehumidifier.

333
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,199
Right.

334
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,160
Call a courier for me later.

335
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,119
Send this back.

336
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,760
Then order a dehumidifier for me.

337
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,479
The money is included in the room charge.

338
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,240
Good.

339
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,160
The dehumidifier will be ordered.

340
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:49,220
By the way, is there a man
named Zhuang Yu who lives here?

341
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,760
We can't divulge other customer's information.

343
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,040
Then there is him.

344
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,520
Young man, why do you ask him?

345
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,320
Nothing.

346
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,830
Book me a room which is furthest from him.

347
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,680
Handsome boy, you're back.

348
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,599
Isn't this Professor Zhuang?

349
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,161
It's fate.

350
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:12,439
I can meet you here.

351
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,319
It's hate.

352
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,669
Don't go, Professor Zhuang.

353
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:19,760
I've traveled a long way just for you.

354
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,319
I remember I told Mr. Li

355
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,920
I research without undergraduate students.

356
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,520
Coincidentally, I graduated from college.

357
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,719
And I just got into graduate school.

358
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:29,640
Entering graduate school, you still
don't know who your supervisor is.

359
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,160
You can hear it yourself whether I'm wrong.

360
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,040
Lv, work hard following Professor Zhuang.

361
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,959
I told him all about it.

362
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,719
feel free to contact him.

363
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,959
When you have time talking to
your father, the funding for our lab...

364
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,479
You can continue his voice message.

365
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,800
I won't change my mind.

366
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,959
All right, Professor Zhuang.

367
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,839
Since you're determined,
I'll tell you the truth.

368
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,400
Please do me a favor and sign this form.

369
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,160
I can go back to show it to my parents.

370
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,920
And I won't bother you again.

371
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,079
Let's mind our own business.

372
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,959
Each takes what he needs.
[Certificate of Internship]

373
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,119
I never teach an idiot.

374
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,920
Excuse me?

375
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,800
I got it ordered!

376
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,439
The latest dehumidifier.

377
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,339
The dehydration function is excellent.

378
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,720
I see.

379
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,719
Please continue to help me with the luggage.

380
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,552
Sure.

381
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,280
So handsome.

382
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,880
Just about right.

383
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,040
I know I'm handsome.

384
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,560
Who said you? Sit down!

385
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm talking about Mr. Zhuang.

386
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,800
Look at him.

387
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,959
A professor at a young age.

388
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,040
Maybe he is Mei's boyfriend.

389
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,319
The university is right,
the major also matches.

390
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,319
How can this be such a coincidence?

391
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,520
Right.

392
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,270
How can this be such a coincidence?

393
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,200
Put her on speakerphone.

394
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,880
[Mei]

395
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,800
Hello?

396
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,520
Does Mrs. Feng miss me a lot lately?

397
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,040
You call me a lot recently.

398
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,680
Really good.

399
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,640
Not bad.

400
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,161
Mei, I have one question.

401
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:09,760
How old is your boyfriend?

402
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,959
Less than 30. Why?

403
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:18,359
Bring him back for the
summer and show us, okay?

404
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,479
It's been so long.

405
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,599
Don't you miss mom?

406
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,719
Don't you miss the osmanthus cakes I made？

407
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:25,880
Don't you want to see if I get younger?

408
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,839
Of course I miss you.

409
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,479
He is busy with work.

410
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,400
Whenever there is a holiday,

411
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,439
he go to the various hills to do research.

412
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,199
- He can't go away.
- That's him.

413
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,760
Then you need to come back yourself, right?

414
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,319
Tell us clearly in person.

415
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,520
I'll think about it.

416
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,560
After all, my work is also super busy.

417
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,513
Hello?

418
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,040
Why don't you say anything?

419
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,000
Are you angry?

420
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,920
Okay, let me tell you.

421
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,400
He has white skin and a high nose.

422
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,239
He is very gentle.

423
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,199
A high nose, that's him.

424
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,359
You will know it when you see him.

425
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,319
And, he is the youngest
Youth Changjiang Scholar,

426
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,439
ace in the field of botany,
and the academic leader.

427
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,000
Is there a retail store around?

428
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,239
Yes, turn left after the door.

429
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,072
Thank you.

430
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,560
How does this voice sound so familiar?

431
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,640
Are you hungry?

432
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,560
We can cook in our own home.

433
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,800
- Very tasty.
- We can cook.

434
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,359
Hurry up, go to cook for him.

435
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,400
Make some dishes.

436
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,439
Go!

437
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:34,359
Mom, who are you talking to?

438
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,041
I have a guest here.

439
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,079
Talk to you later.

440
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,439
Thank you. Don't bother.

441
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,160
Okay, bye.

442
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Really good.

443
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,633
Really handsome.

444
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,560
Oh no!

445
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,239
Why is he here?

446
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,479
OMG!

447
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,920
He's the action-motivated type.

448
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,119
He was just told on Weibo
that there is Artemisia annua

449
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,560
and he got here.

450
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,760
It must be the Mercury retrograde.

451
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,640
Oh no, I haven't made up the story.

452
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,199
That was close.

453
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,839
But, maybe this is the will of God.

454
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,479
I'll just give it a go.

455
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:40,199
Last time I asked you to check
the hearing aid.

456
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,520
Any new clues?

457
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,479
This type of behind-the-ear hearing aid

458
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,959
has wide range of applications.

459
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,319
It's difficult for experts to find

460
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,319
the user's information relying on this alone.

461
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,000
If you can provide more clues,

462
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,769
chances of finding the owner
should be significantly improved.

463
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,119
President Jin, it's been a long time

464
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,019
since I've seen the look on your face.

465
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,353
That's right.

466
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,400
In this world, there is
nothing I can't handle.

467
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,000
Is it something important?

468
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,119
It's someone very important.

469
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,479
These eyes of mine

470
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,230
have seen through too much.

471
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,400
A few meters away,

472
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,319
I would be able to see from a
person's eyes what he really wants.

473
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,760
I'm not saying it's bad to want something.

474
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,910
Mutual benefit is the basis of cooperation.

475
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,640
But she is different.

476
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,040
Her eyes are as clear as glass.

477
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,719
No desire.

478
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,680
With only goodwill.

479
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,520
Can you understand?

480
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:15,920
Is this a trick of
attracting your attention?

481
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,239
What?

482
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,072
Nothing.

483
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:27,359
If there is a chance to meet
her again, I'll repay her well.

484
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,760
Professor Jin, you're free this afternoon,

485
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:32,959
how about I make an appointment
with Dr. Chen for you?

486
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,920
Here is the deal.

487
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,599
Your left leg hasn't been
reviewed over six months.

488
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,233
I'm worried about... Stop.

489
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,513
Okay.

490
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,239
Is this my old house?

491
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,400
Not living for several years,
how did it become so eerie?

492
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
Tonight,

493
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:30,800
I'll just stay here for one night.

494
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,880
What is it?

495
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,040
No.

496
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,640
I'm not meeting an old friend, am I？

497
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,319
It's okay.

498
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,439
The elderly in the village
said if you meet an old friend,

499
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:04,680
itchy little rashes will be seen on the body.

500
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,319
I'm doing very well now.

501
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,760
Who is it?

502
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,319
I... I am also an old friend here.

503
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,400
Don't come to me.

504
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,439
Zhuang Yu!

505
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,439
You usually look fierce.

506
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,272
What?

507
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,640
Why are you scared like this?

508
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,079
Who?

509
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,439
Who is scared?

510
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:01,280
Let me tell you.

511
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,199
This is Yu family's old house.

512
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:05,199
Let me take you inside for a tour.

513
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,040
Your place,

514
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,560
it's really worth visiting.

515
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,119
Professor Zhuang, like
the three strikes law,

516
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,079
we meet with each other again and again.

517
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,239
No one would believe it
if you said it wasn't stalking.

518
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,040
There is a first come, first served rule.

519
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:41,999
Since you're here, why don't you
go home with me to see my parents?

520
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,680
I've already met your parents.

521
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,719
How did you know it was my parents?

522
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:47,599
Unluckily,

523
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,299
I heard her daughter's phone call.

524
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,040
I heard that

525
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,400
the houses unoccupied for years
in the village are easy...

526
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,599
What?

527
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,319
To grow climbers.

528
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,199
You scared me to death!

529
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,119
Climber attracts mosquitoes,

530
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,339
and causes damage to the wall.

531
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,680
So it's the sound of the wall falling off.

532
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,560
I wore the doll clothes all day today.

533
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,839
That's why there is...

534
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,839
Professor Zhuang, why do you
suddenly care so much about me?

535
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm not used to it.

536
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm used to your flattering yourself.

537
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Really?

538
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,560
Handsome, dashing, and
knowledgeable Straight-A Zhuang.

539
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:53,520
Since you're here, why not go
home with me as my boyfriend?

540
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,599
You can ask help from others.

541
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:01,839
Although I always bother you,
it's not a loss if you help me.

542
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:02,680
Think about it.

543
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,920
Knowing that you were my boyfriend
I brought home,

544
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,800
my parents must have provided you a free room.

545
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,760
I'm not poor enough to sell my body.

546
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,839
Why do you talk like that?

547
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,640
It's mutual help.

548
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,280
The core value of twenty-four characters.

549
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
This is called amicability.

550
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,319
Before amicability,

551
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,479
it should be integrity.

552
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,079
I...

553
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,110
I don't think you need to talk like that.

554
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,640
This is also a white lie.

555
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,479
No.

556
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,079
It's not all lies.

557
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,000
At least my heart has fallen for you.

558
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,119
It's made of 24K pure gold.

559
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,319
No adulteration, it's real.

560
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:45,079
I'm so pretentious.

561
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,560
Sorry, it's itchy.

562
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,479
I... I'll look for the ointment.

563
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,640
No ointment.

564
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,079
Professor Zhuang, do
you have any ointment?

565
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,920
What?

566
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,280
I can't count on him.

567
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,640
Who is it?

568
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,800
It's me.

569
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,920
Your old friend.

570
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,079
Li Tiantian, come out!

571
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Now I can't even scare you!

572
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,920
How could I not recognize your voice?

573
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,000
Mei, you're becoming
really attractive now.

574
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You just got back, there
is an admirer in the village.

575
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,239
His back, wide shoulders and narrow waist.

576
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,040
It's a masterpiece!

577
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,290
But I'm not sure whether he is a back killer.

578
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:26,199
It won't be a man in a
sweatshirt who is running?

579
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,319
Amazing.

580
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:31,800
While you're pursuing Zhuang
Yu, you're seeing another guy.

581
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,280
He even comes to the village
to send you flowers.

582
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,000
Sorry to disappoint you.

583
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,040
It's the same guy.

584
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,959
What is he doing?

585
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:47,160
Sanguisorba officinalis L. for eczema.

586
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,430
He has started the implementation
of the core value of 24 characters.

587
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,400
Who did you talk about? Zhuang Yu?

588
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,041
We haven't seen for just a few days.

589
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,199
What have I missed again?

590
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:56,199
Tell me about it.

591
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:58,280
Why did you two meet here?

592
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,800
What's so hard about it?

593
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,839
You're destined for each other.

594
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,639
You two will definitely be together.

595
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,552
Let me do it.

596
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,880
You know, a pretender as he is,

597
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,760
it's often the signal that he is flipped.

598
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,160
What the hell!

599
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,400
Then why did he disagree about

600
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,450
my proposal of pretending to be a couple?

601
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,680
As far as I know, a cold fish like him,

602
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,119
he usually wants to say yes in
his heart, but he won't show it.

603
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,959
You have to give him an out.

604
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,599
I'm all ears.

605
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,400
Does he usually look like
he is a no-man to everybody?

606
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,839
So if he suddenly becomes enthusiastic,

607
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:48,959
and promises you some absurd
request, isn't that very OOC?

608
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,239
OOC? What do you mean?

609
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,400
Out of character.

610
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,239
Since he needs to keep the consistency
of his character,

611
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:58,520
you have to give him a reason to say yes.

612
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,160
That makes sense.

613
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Even if you're a cold fish,

614
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,040
you can't escape from me.

615
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:17,639
Remember to keep me posted.

616
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,673
Nope.

617
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,280
Perhaps you and I are not meant
to be, but I can't get over you.

618
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,600
Meinan, come here.

619
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,919
Is what Zhuang wears today
exactly the same as that in the photo?

620
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,639
Mom, what do you call him?

621
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,639
So affectionate.

622
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,639
You know nothing.

623
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,560
If he is confirmed to be the guy,
you also need to call him another way.

624
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,320
Listen, don't keep prying
into the privacy of Zhuang.

625
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,719
What if there is a mistake?

626
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,879
When Mei returns in a couple of
days, then the truth will come out.

627
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,080
That's true.

628
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,840
Dad, why do you call him Zhuang too?

629
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
It's just like that.

630
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,840
We have to wait so long.

631
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,919
I can't wait.

632
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:28,719
If it's going to rain, let it rain.

633
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,552
Good point.

634
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,280
Zhuang,

635
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,079
the machine is repaired. You can use it now.

636
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,840
Zhuang, you're so handsome.

637
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,719
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

638
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

639
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,560
Mrs. Yu, you can ask me about it.

640
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,760
I know him very well.

641
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,760
He has always been a scholarly man,
not a womanizer.

642
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,239
Am I right, Professor Zhuang?

643
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,120
Professor Zhuang, Since I
answered this question so well,

644
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,719
why don't you sign it for me?

645
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,719
I don't teach the matchmaker profession.

646
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,000
He is so stubborn.

647
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,399
Mrs. Yu, do you want to
introduce your daughter to him?

648
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,249
It's really hard.

649
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,280
How do you know?

650
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,560
You're wrong.

651
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,560
I told you, it's not him.

652
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,159
What are you talking about?

653
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,959
You, take that bowl and put it away.

654
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,353
Wait a minute.

655
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,320
It doesn't make sense!

656
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:30,439
College, major, title, they are all the same.

657
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,639
There is only one possibility.

658
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:36,360
Secret love. It's not public.

659
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,919
Your mom and dad must be
very happy seeing you back home.

660
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,919
It's a long story.

661
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,879
I didn't even see my parents yesterday.

662
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,760
What's wrong?

663
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,159
Yesterday...

664
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,399
Isn't this Professor Zhuang?

665
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,439
How did he get here?

666
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,719
I get it.

667
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,800
You are after Professor
Zhuang, and take this ad.

668
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,520
Why are you talking for him?

669
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,000
Couldn't he have come to woo me?

670
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,679
I guess it's okay.

671
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,600
Be confident.

672
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,080
It's perfectly fine, right?

673
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,199
Professor Zhuang!

674
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,800
Zhuang, I think I heard my
daughter's voice just now.

675
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:34,820
Miss Long-leg, you don't
have to wear this today.

676
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:38,080
Are these people shooting some TV series?

677
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,199
I don't know where they live.

678
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,280
It's a lot of money.

679
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,399
Let me count it.

680
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,673
Xiaofang,

681
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,870
has the lady next to Professor Zhuang left?

682
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:54,712
One.

683
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,153
Two.

684
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,000
Not yet. What's wrong?

685
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,320
It's a long story.

686
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,639
Four.

687
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,679
Three thousand and sixteen yuan.

688
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,719
Really?

689
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:09,840
If they are staying in my place for
two days, I can get Yu a new sofa.

690
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,040
Zhuang, I knew it. As a
professor at the age of 28,

691
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,639
you've made the calculation
before I finish the counting.

692
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,639
You're smarter than any of us!

693
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,719
If his gene can combine with
Mei's, wouldn't it be perfect?

694
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,040
Zhuang, wait for me.

695
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,879
Mrs. Yu, the way to the guide's house,

696
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:33,479
is it a right turn at the intersection ahead?

697
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,239
Tern left at the intersection ahead.

698
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,840
You just said you were there yesterday.

699
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,120
You don't need me to lead the way.

700
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,159
The roads in the village look similar.

701
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,959
I can't remember them clearly when we walked here.

702
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:45,040
It's okay, I'll show you the way.

703
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,120
Young people don't remember the way.

704
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,399
Come on, this way.

705
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:49,280
Let's go.

706
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,600
Not bad.

707
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,750
You're kind of helpful.

708
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,360
It's really difficult to come back home.

709
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,719
No way. It's already the second day.

710
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,620
You haven't gone back yet.

711
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:15,479
Returning home is a complicated feeling.

712
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,360
Come on.

713
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,100
Look at this big tree.

714
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,679
Go up.

715
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,512
Mrs. Yu,

716
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
I know the way.

717
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,239
We just came here, you know it now?

718
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,879
Are you sure?

719
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:42,800
Follow this road up, I will
come across a tea garden.

720
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,320
There is a white house there.

721
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,919
Yes, you remember very well.

722
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:49,199
Then why did you... Thank you for that.

723
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,520
I won't waste your time.

724
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,399
Okay, go ahead.

725
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,560
Look at the water and mountains.

726
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,520
It's so beautiful. I've just realized it today.

727
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,199
There was such a good opportunity.

728
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,040
How come I didn't ask him in person?

729
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,000
I still don't know whether he knows Mei.

730
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,552
Meinan,

731
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,320
buy me two pig brains, quick!

732
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,560
What's wrong with my brain?

733
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,010
I need some nutritional food.

734
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,479
Really!

735
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,000
Professor Zhuang.

736
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,140
What's wrong? I can't go with you?

737
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,390
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

738
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,870
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

739
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:09,720
♫ I'm sure you are ♫

740
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,420
♫ my future ♫

741
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,320
No.

742
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,239
There are thirteen people.

743
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,919
If 300 yuan per person,
that should be 3,900 yuan.

744
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,520
Why did he miscalculated 300 yaun?

745
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,399
He must have done too much research work.

746
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,749
He didn't see them clearly.

747
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,040
It's so hard.

748
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It's not easy.

749
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,730

750
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,030
