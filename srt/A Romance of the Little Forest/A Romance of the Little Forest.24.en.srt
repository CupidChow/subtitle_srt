[When beef becomes dregs, it means a bad guy]

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,719
709... 709, here it is.

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,919
I'm coming.

26
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,680
What a coincidence.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,479
Miss, get in.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,638
I can't park here for too long.

29
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,400
Get in the car.

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,240
Go to school?

31
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,359
Miss.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,999
It seems he knows you.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,119
He was talking to you.

34
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,360
The phone number is familiar.

35
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,919
What a coincidence.

36
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,199
What bad luck.

37
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,118
Since your phone number didn't change,

38
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,278
I'll call you.

39
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,918
You can save my new number.

40
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,160
No need, no one calls others now.

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,759
Then, can I add your WeChat?

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,320
Sorry, my phone is out of battery now.

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,160
You have shootings in school?

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,439
Are you going to...

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,199
Professor Zhuang.

46
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,558
Do you think I go to school to find you?

47
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:02,039
It's been a year, you're so narcissistic now?

48
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,999
The school has many summer courses.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,879
You're interested in birds.

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,519
You're there to listen to courses?

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,199
Listen to it?

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,478
Yes, I'll be there to listen to it.

53
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,759
Professor Zhuang,
what do you want to say?

54
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,398
You might like this.

55
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,558
What is it?

56
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,918
A gift.

57
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,119
For me?

58
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,079
I appreciate your kindness,

59
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,239
but I won't accept it.

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,919
It's yours.

61
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,839
I don't want to owe you anything.

62
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:40,880
You don't owe me.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,080
I owe you.

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,359
You two,

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,519
can you decide whether you'll accept it or not?

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,198
We're arriving soon.

67
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,080
I can't park there for too long.

68
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:26,879
Professor, following
a girl in daylight,

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,358
is this appropriate?

70
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:31,839
My academy building is there.

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,760
You can go first.

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,880
Take this, and I'll go.

73
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,479
Is that Professor Zhuang?

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,799
It's him, he is back.

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,480
Don't think I'll forgive you
even after I take this.

76
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,559
Meinan.

77
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,439
Miss Tiantian.

78
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,200
Let's go.

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,039
Well done.

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,559
You look like a driver in a luxury hotel now.

81
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:23,239
This is a private service for you.

82
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,440
Let's go.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,839
Get ready.

84
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,518
The acquisition meeting is in the grape yard?

85
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,920
Several large farmers
in our village will go as well.

86
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,398
Did we make a little contribution
to the most beautiful village evaluation?

87
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,599
It's not a little.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,958
We made many contributions.

89
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,278
Only a few grapes
in our village would be sold before.

90
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,200
The sales volume is not as much as now.

91
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,118
And in recent years,

92
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,759
we applied for organic grape certification,

93
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,199
and opened a Taobao shop.

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,719
Although we sold much more than before,

95
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,798
there is no acquirer to come
to the village to buy in large volumes.

96
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:12,439
It's all because of the title
of the most beautiful village.

97
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,159
You're right, there are more guests
in our homestay hotel.

98
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,599
That's right.

99
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,958
Well, Miss Tiantian,

100
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,278
our homestay hotel prepared
activities for Chinese Valentine's Day.

101
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,319
Will you come?

102
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,278
Chinese Valentine's Day is coming?

103
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,278
That's right.

104
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,479
There will be embroidery,
throwing colorful ropes,

105
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,199
throwing needles and temple fair.

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,958
It's interesting.

107
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,040
You will like it.

108
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,480
Tiantian.

109
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,559
Miss Tiantian.

110
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,720
Will you come?

111
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:44,679
What?

112
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,679
Chinese Valentine's Day activities.

113
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,600
Chinese Valentine's Day?

114
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,398
I won't celebrate this day anymore.

115
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,479
You won't?

116
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,759
What do you mean?

117
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,838
Have you ever celebrated it?

118
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,799
We're here.

119
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,999
I didn't notice.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,398
Okay, Meinan, pick the guests.

121
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,199
I shall go in, thank you.

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
Can I...

123
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,320
pick you up later?

124
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,518
This is too much.

125
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,799
There are more.

126
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,159
So many?

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,479
These are from the lab.

128
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,439
Well, I just came back
from a business trip as well.

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,394
Why didn't I receive anything?

130
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,558
It's different.

131
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,999
You just went on a business trip.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,078
Zhuang came back after giving up
the chance to be a tenure.

133
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:36,958
Yes.

134
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,439
It's not easy to get a chance to be a tenure.

135
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,199
Whether it's easy or not,

136
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,838
it depends on who he is.

137
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,319
Zhuang has increased
the artemisinin content in Artemisia annua

138
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,999
by 80% compared with the highest record.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,599
This is a breakthrough in global difficulty.

140
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,798
We heard Professor Zhuang's lecture as well.

141
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,039
He said it's just the first step.

142
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,798
There is still room for further improvement.

143
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,879
So they gave Professor Zhuang a tenure.

144
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,159
It's such a good chance,

145
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,398
but Professor Zhuang abandoned it.

146
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,798
I knew he would come back.

147
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,440
How could he leave me here?

148
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,118
You don't trust me?

149
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,238
Our relationship is like,

150
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,558
as a famous sentence goes like,

151
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,880
if time could stop
at the moment when we first met.

152
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:18,199
Director Li, are you sure it means that?

153
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,119
Isn't it?

154
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,159
I'll use one word to describe our relation,

155
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,518
as strong as gold.

156
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,719
Really?

157
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,879
Why didn't I know that?

158
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,039
Welcome, Professor Zhuang.

159
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,919
- You're back.
- Welcome.

160
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,639
Let me see if you're thinner.

161
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,479
You must be haggard because of missing me.

162
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,759
Welcome, Professor Zhuang.

163
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,478
The country encourages scientific innovation.

164
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,319
When you were absent,

165
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,839
the school allocated us a large sum of money,

166
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,798
and added much new equipment to the lab.

167
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,678
I'll show you later.

168
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,319
Then let's have a meal.

169
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,238
Can you reimburse it?

170
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,718
The money is used in the scientific field.

171
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,879
We can't spend it freely.

172
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,678
Miss Wu means,

173
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,839
since your close junior brother is back,

174
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,159
will you treat us to a meal?

175
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,679
You mean that?

176
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,279
It's been a long time.

177
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,478
I'll treat you to a meal.

178
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,639
No way, I'll treat you.

179
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,079
But there is one condition,

180
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,158
don't be too expensive.

181
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,158
Qi, Ni Ke.

182
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,319
You two go together.

183
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,359
Thank you, Director Li.

184
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,158
Stop cleaning.

185
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,598
Let's go to see the lab first.

186
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,280
Then let's have a meal.

187
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,399
Here is the thing.

188
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,079
Many students heard Professor Zhuang is back.

189
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,158
They went to the lab to see him.

190
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,919
We'll meet the crowd if we go there now.

191
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,999
Did I come on the wrong date?

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,880
Where are they?

193
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,199
Professor Zhuang Yu from
the Department of Botany is back today.

194
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,319
They went to the lab to see him.

195
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,038
See Zhuang Yu?

196
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,519
Miss Yu, don't be angry.

197
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,718
They'll come back soon.

198
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,639
They'll be back after they
saw Straight-A Zhuang.

199
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,279
Straight-A Zhuang?

200
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,919
Why did they go to see him?

201
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,079
Why didn't you go?

202
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,479
I...

203
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, put it down.

204
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,279
Don't push.

205
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,479
Calm down.

206
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,118
Don't push.

207
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,280
He just came back, calm down.

208
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,038
Professor Zhuang!

209
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:22,879
Calm down.

210
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,679
Don't push.

211
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,839
Be careful.

212
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,439
Welcome back!

213
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,159
Welcome back!

214
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,999
How's it? An automatic sprinkler system
based on temperature and humidity.

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,880
Is this advanced?

216
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,759
- It's good.
- Of course.

217
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,598
Go to the lab later.

218
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:41,798
The latest flow mass
spectrometer is so advanced.

219
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,798
I tried hard to get it,

220
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,280
or I couldn't persuade you to come back.

221
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,718
I would be back without this.

222
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:47,479
I know.

223
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,279
You'll come back to work for our country.

224
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,840
I didn't imagine you'd be back in a year.

225
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,960
Did you have an agreement with your family?

226
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,400
Why are you looking at me?

227
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,038
Let me ask you,

228
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,280
did you buy the bird fossil
you asked me about last time?

229
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,598
See?

230
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,038
It's so expensive.

231
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,918
You didn't ask for money from your family.

232
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,840
You could afford it?

233
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,358
Don't tell me,

234
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:19,400
you'll go home and inherit the family property.

235
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
You're imaginative.

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,960
Did you sell yourself for this stone?

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,119
She deserves it.

238
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,759
Penny.

239
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,799
Miss Yu.

240
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,879
As the only student in the class,

241
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,840
this is for you.

242
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,039
Really?

243
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,280
Thank you, Miss Yu.

244
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,640
This...

245
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,478
I'll say, you don't
need to thank me.

246
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,479
First, we should thank
our government, right?

247
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,718
Then, we should thank the boss,

248
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:24,478
who came to our village
to buy grapes in large quantities.

249
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,559
Let's applaud him.

250
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,960
Jin Xi, is that you?

251
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,760
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

252
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,879
You scared me, Lv Jian.

253
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,598
Where did you jump out from?

254
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,320
Sorry, sorry.

255
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,358
Did I scare you?

256
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,519
Of course.

257
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,639
I'm old, so you can't jump out suddenly.

258
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,718
You're not old at all.

259
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,238
Well, how about having lunch together?

260
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,999
I'm not hungry.

261
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,279
Did you have the breakfast I brought you?

262
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,999
I want to tell you about this.

263
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,558
Don't buy me so much breakfast.

264
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,880
It would be a waste if there wer too much.

265
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,678
It wouldn't be a waste,

266
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,639
if you can have one bite.

267
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,558
Lv Jian.

268
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,879
The country advocates Operation Empty Plate now.

269
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,158
You can't say that.

270
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,598
I had the breakfast
with my student to finish them all.

271
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,558
Okay, it depends on you.

272
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,918
I'll buy less breakfast.

273
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,439
What do you want to eat for lunch?

274
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,399
I'll buy whatever I want to eat.

275
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,880
I shall leave now.

276
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,038
Miss Meiren.

277
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,119
What's wrong?

278
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,959
When I bought you breakfast this morning,

279
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,199
I fell and it still hurts.

280
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,079
Why are you so careless?

281
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,319
Let's go to the infirmary.

282
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,239
No need.

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,799
It's just,

284
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,679
it might be inconvenient
for me to have lunch alone.

285
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:03,520
Let's go.

286
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,640
Okay.

287
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,639
Jian.

288
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,399
You don't need to let me treat you here.

289
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,558
You're not tired of eating in the canteen?

290
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,639
Although I have fewer
advertisements to shoot now,

291
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,959
I can treat you to a good meal.

292
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,999
It's okay.

293
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,799
The food here is delicious.

294
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,118
I like it.

295
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,199
Besides,

296
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,919
you won't go to any restaurant
far from here with me.

297
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,239
Well,

298
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,999
you didn't tell anyone that I'm a
teaching assistant in the school, right?

299
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,079
Absolutely not.

300
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,199
The thing you asked
me to do, I'll definitely...

301
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,358
Stop.

302
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,559
You don't need to be so exaggerated.

303
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

304
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,718
Are you satisfied with our lunch?

305
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:52,718
Of course.

306
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,038
Director Li is so generous today.

307
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,719
That's right.

308
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,359
Of course.

309
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,640
He invited us to a restaurant with
a per capita price of more than 35 yuan.

310
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,358
Why do you laugh?

311
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,519
It's good enough.

312
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,280
It was less than twenty yuan before.

313
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,640
What's wrong?

314
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,478
Thank you for welcoming me back.

315
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,880
I have something to do, I shall leave now.

316
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,558
Professor Zhuang.

317
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,038
What's wrong?

318
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,039
He must be still hungry.

319
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:37,919
Thank you, grandma.

320
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,719
Drink some tea.

321
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,079
Thank you, grandma.

322
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,279
You can just come here.

323
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,279
Why do you bring so many gifts?

324
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,639
It's okay.

325
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,279
I was Tiantian's colleague.

326
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,358
I'm Jin Xi.

327
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,558
Just call me Jin.

328
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,519
Okay, Jin.

329
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,239
You're back?

330
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,320
You...

331
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,796
Zhuang.

332
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,520
[Huaguang University]

333
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,159
You said you had something to do.

334
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,559
Is it settled?

335
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,200
Not yet.

336
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,319
You are not anxious.

337
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,119
It's not important, right?

338
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,959
Isn't it important to cultivate endurance?

339
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,999
Fine, take your time.

340
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,079
When you went abroad,

341
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,478
you got a back injury again, right?

342
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,279
It hurts when you stand.

343
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Be careful not to break your back.

344
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,358
I have a blind date.

345
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,999
I can't stay with you here.

346
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
Just go.

347
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,880
If you miss her, she won't wait for you.

348
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,598
In this world,

349
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:55,200
you are not the only choice of anyone.

350
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,678
Someone might come from behind.

351
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,439
Why did you say that?

352
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,358
But it's right.

353
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,280
Goodbye.

354
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,359
Walk slowly.

355
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,760
Is your leg okay?

356
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,319
I'm fine.

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,919
Miss Meiren.

358
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,198
Can I send you back?

359
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,040
No, thanks.

360
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,198
Your leg is injured.

361
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,198
If there's anything wrong,

362
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,879
your parents would blame me for that.

363
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,999
There is nothing wrong with my leg.

364
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,639
It's here, it can't park here for too long.

365
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,238
Just go back, bye-bye.

366
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,238
I can send you...

367
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,400
No need.

368
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,280
What a coincidence.

369
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Class is over?

370
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,799
You usually take a taxi to school?

371
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,920
I will if I have money.

372
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
Then when will you come here every week?

373
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,958
What do you want?

374
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,039
When you come to school,

375
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,640
we can take a taxi together.

376
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,999
Why?

377
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,760
I have money.

378
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,520
We can have class together.

379
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,079
Actually, I don't have to take a taxi.

380
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,759
And,

381
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,318
we're not that familiar with each other, okay?

382
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,599
Who are you?

383
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,759
Drink some tea.

384
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Thank you, grandma.

385
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,198
We're building the most beautiful village.

386
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:41,159
The director will blame you
if he sees you treat a guest like this.

387
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,118
What kind of guest is he?

388
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,039
Just go back to where you belong.

389
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,879
Tiantian, I...

390
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,238
I don't want to listen to you nor see you.

391
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:50,718
Here is the thing.

392
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:53,639
Jin said, he has something
to do in the village,

393
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,358
and dropped by to see you.

394
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,679
What a coincidence, right?

395
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,792
Bullshit.

396
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,118
Enough.

397
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,639
Why are you so aggressive today?

398
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,999
I always talk like that.

399
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,680
If you don't like to listen, the door is there.

400
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,159
I like it very much.

401
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,959
Then I won't say that.

402
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,238
Tiantian, he came a long way here,

403
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,279
and brought so many gifts,

404
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,199
you should treat him
a cup of tea and a meal at least.

405
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,800
What are you doing?

406
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,560
These are for grandma.

407
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,079
Your leg is okay.

408
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,520
Just leave here.

409
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,198
What are you doing?

410
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,239
Leave or not?

411
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,318
You won't leave?

412
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,119
Okay, I'll call the police.

413
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,559
Enough.

414
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,759
It's okay, grandma.

415
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,198
Tiantian is in a bad mood today.

416
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,399
I'll come tomorrow.

417
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,919
I'll be in a bad mood tomorrow.

418
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,838
Then I'll come the day after tomorrow.

419
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,519
If you still don't have a good mood,

420
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,718
I'll come here when you have a good mood.

421
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,078
What's wrong with you, President Jin?

422
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,759
You can't find someone to cheat?

423
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,238
You can't find someone
who is gullible as I am?

424
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,198
Grandma, he is a liar.

425
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,039
We can't be cheated by him anymore.

426
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,958
He is not a liar.

427
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:07,199
He is the boss who buys grapes in our village.

428
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,399
Jin Xi, why did you lie to my grandma?

429
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,119
I didn't lie to her.

430
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,559
I saw the boss who bought our grapes.

431
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,958
It's not him.

432
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,399
I was blind being cheated by you once.

433
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,760
I won't be cheated by you a second time.

434
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,238
Zhou, come here now.

435
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,679
What do you want to do?

436
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,040
Wait here.

437
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,159
Well... President
Jin, you called me?

438
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,958
Grandma, let me
introduce you, this is Zhou.

439
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:36,318
He is here to assist me to buy grapes here.

440
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,519
Hello, Zhou.

441
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,598
Hello, grandma.

442
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,640
It's okay, just go.

443
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,560
Just go.

444
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,839
Don't think I'll treat you well
because you're here to buy grapes.

445
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,199
Look at you.

446
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,119
Grandma.

447
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:04,160
I didn't think you would l treat me well.

448
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,119
I'm happy to see you.

449
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Well, grandma,

450
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,078
Tiantian is in a bad mood today.

451
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,598
I'll find another day to see you.

452
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,438
I'll put the gifts here.

453
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:19,079
Come here to have a meal.

454
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,919
It's a deal.

455
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
Grandma, don't...

456
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,358
Goodbye, grandma.

457
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,400
Do come.

458
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,359
What is wrong with you?

459
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,920
My one-week food is here.

460
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,479
Thank you...

461
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,879
Mom, why are you here?

462
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,879
What a surprise.

463
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,639
Your dad is also here.

464
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,040
Where is he?

465
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,358
I came up the stairs.

466
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,318
He is waiting for the elevator with the stuff.

467
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,159
Yu, hurry up.

468
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,679
Coming, don't call me.

469
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,400
Dad.

470
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:07,679
Meiren, look at you.

471
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,718
Where's the stuff?

472
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:12,318
I was waiting for the
elevator, and met Zhuang.

473
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,759
He insisted to help me with it.

474
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,478
My son-in-law really takes care of me.

475
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,040
Come here.

476
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,759
Zhuang, come here.

477
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,039
On the way here, I
said you might be busy,

478
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,358
and we might not see you.

479
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,238
What a coincidence.

480
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,479
What bad luck.

481
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,560
What did you say?

482
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,959
What a coincidence.

483
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,358
You must be tired.

484
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,438
Come in.

485
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,520
Be polite.

486
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
Silly girl.

487
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,358
This is heavy.

488
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,318
I can help you with it.

489
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,400
It's okay, give it to me.

490
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,639
That's the bedroom.

491
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,719
Stop looking around.

492
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,399
Mom, you must be hungry.

493
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,238
Eat some snacks.

494
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,920
There are snacks, right?

495
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,718
There is so much junk food.

496
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:19,679
There are trans fatty acids in puffed food.

497
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,520
It will make you fat.

498
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,639
There is much sugar in the milk tea.

499
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,598
Don't you afraid you may get hyperglycemia?

500
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,799
Zhuang, you need to supervise her.

501
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,880
It's none of his business.

502
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,078
Mom, look.

503
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,759
There are also canned tomatoes.

504
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,559
Tomatoes are good for our health.

505
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,520
It's healthy.

506
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:39,718
Aunt.

507
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,958
It's my bad.

508
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,000
I'll take more care of her.

509
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,760
Okay.

510
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,639
Mom, dad, don't just stand here.

511
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,598
Regard this as your home.

512
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,679
My home is your home.

513
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,719
Come on, sit down.

514
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,118
Are you going to stay at my home?

515
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:56,999
Just go back.

516
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,559
Why did you ask him to go back?

517
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,838
We just saw Zhuang.

518
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,999
It's hard for us to meet.

519
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,438
We haven't talked yet, right?

520
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,318
He is busy.

521
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,438
I'm free today.

522
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,920
Great.

523
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,118
What is wrong?

524
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,679
We're not familiar with each other, okay?

525
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,118
Uncle and aunt took care of me before.

526
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,599
I should treat them to a meal.

527
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,040
You...

528
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,959
What happened?

529
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,559
You argued?

530
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,160
No.

531
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:23,078
Then why did you shout?

532
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,199
Don't treat Zhuang like this.

533
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,319
It's too rude.

534
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,039
Aunt, it's my fault.

535
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,239
My hearing is not good.

536
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,959
Pretending to be nice?

537
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,679
Don't refuse him for me.

538
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,279
After I ate the dishes Zhuang cooked,

539
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,838
I can't forget the taste.

540
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,439
I even drooled in my dreams.

541
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,718
When she woke up in the morning,

542
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,559
the pillowcase was wet.

543
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,838
Don't let Zhuang cook for us.

544
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,799
He is a scientific researcher.

545
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,279
His time is precious.

546
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,478
You rarely come here.

547
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,118
A chance to cook for you is more precious.

548
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,799
You're so nice.

549
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,479
That's right.

550
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,598
Okay, I'll help you to
clean the vegetables.

551
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,559
Me, too.

552
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,039
Uncle, aunt, it's okay.

553
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,999
I can do it myself quickly.

554
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,478
Zhuang is so smart.

555
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,279
He can do everything quickly.

556
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,679
This is an advantage.

557
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,519
Zhuang Yu would
cheat others with his innocent face.

558
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,280
Dad, mom.

559
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:23,078
Don't be cheated by this bad guy.

560
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,639
What are you doing?

561
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,399
Is there any vegetable?

562
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,438
Do you have eggplant?

563
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:28,799
He'll eat here with us?

564
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,639
Of course.

565
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,999
We've discussed it.

566
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,399
We?

567
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,238
He is not with us.

568
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:39,319
Dad, mom, I'm with you.

569
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,559
Okay, have a meal, right?

570
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,759
There is no food here.

571
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,759
Let's eat in your home.

572
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,640
Well...

573
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,718
Zhuang, is it okay?

574
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,679
Of course.

575
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,118
I just ordered online.

576
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,159
The vegetables will be here in half an hour.

577
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,559
He arranged everything well.

578
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,040
He is so considerate.

579
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,479
Provocation, this is a provocation.

580
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,280
Okay, don't regret it.

581
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,040
Eat slowly. No hurry.

582
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,238
Of course, these are mine.

583
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,718
I won these from you.

584
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,879
You can't go back on your promise.

585
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,879
There is no way I could do that.

586
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,478
You've eaten a bite of all dishes.

587
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:35,958
But, honestly, how did you know

588
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,838
the boss won't eat with us today?

589
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,800
You want to know?

590
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,160
Give me that.

591
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:43,239
Here.

592
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:49,838
It's not hard to guess.

593
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,519
The boss even gave up the chance
to be a tenure for Yu.

594
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,639
He finally came back.

595
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,800
He'll surely find some time to behave well.

596
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,478
What's your face?

597
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:00,838
Let me tell you,

598
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:03,078
the boss is definitely with Yu now.

599
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,119
If not,

600
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,198
I'll eat this plate.

601
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:07,879
Enough, you even want to eat a plate?

602
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,358
These dishes are not enough for you?

603
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,400
Eat some vegetables.

604
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,640
- Zhuang.
- Come in, please.

605
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:20,318
Are your houses the same size?

606
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:20,920
Yes.

607
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,160
Thanks.

608
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,039
How could it be the same size?

609
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,198
This house is larger.

610
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,279
How could it be? It's the same size.

611
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,958
But it's different.

612
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,078
It's really different, see?

613
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,159
Professor Zhuang has so many plants.

614
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,759
- It's beautiful.
- That's right.

615
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,118
Meiren didn't clean her room.

616
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,959
It's so messy...

617
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,318
The floor is so clean.

618
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,879
Why didn't you change your shoes?

619
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,879
You need to change them,
even if it's your boyfriend's home.

620
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,759
Who said I'm his girlfriend...

621
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,239
You...

622
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,198
so I have to change my shoes.

623
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,039
Look at you.

624
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,078
It's okay, uncle and aunt.

625
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,839
I should clean the floor recently.

626
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,999
Okay.

627
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,920
You're so impolite, put your foot down.

628
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,399
There is no one to serve us a cup of water.

629
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,519
We're thirsty. This is how he treats guests?

630
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,760
Behave well.

631
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:15,358
You're his girlfriend, not his boss.

632
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,838
Help him with it.

633
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,520
Just go.

634
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:19,679
He wouldn't want me to help him.

635
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,319
Just go.

636
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,439
Look at her.

637
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,159
What do you want to drink, uncle and aunt?

638
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,639
Jinjunmei tea or Yinzhen tea?

639
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,958
Zhuang, don't bother.

640
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,719
Water is okay.

641
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,119
Yes, water.

642
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,479
Enough.

643
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:50,800
Be careful.

644
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:51,999
Are you okay?

645
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,639
I didn't do it on purpose, sorry.

646
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,838
Is your hand okay?

647
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,279
I'll help you to clean it.

648
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
- It's okay, I'll do it.
- Look at you.

649
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,639
Oh my god.

650
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,680
Why am I so silly?

651
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,319
Meiren, have some rest on the sofa.

652
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,118
Come here.

653
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,119
Look at you.

654
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,519
You can do nothing well.

655
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,159
Why are you so lazy?

656
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
You're even lazier than me.

657
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,839
Grandma,

658
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,239
hello.

659
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,800
President Jin.

660
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,400
Tiantian.

661
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,599
Miss Tiantian.

662
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,439
Meinan is here?

663
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,359
Grandma.

664
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,078
My mom asked me to bring you some dishes.

665
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,879
Thank you for coming all the way here.

666
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,279
Look at your sweat.

667
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,238
Tiantian, come on.

668
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,839
Bring Meinan a bottle of water.

669
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,238
Okay.

670
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:12,159
You always come here and bring us food.

671
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,718
We can't eat them all.

672
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,919
Grandma, you're welcome.

673
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,838
I just dropped by.

674
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,639
Come on, come in.

675
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,239
President Jin.

676
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:19,760
Are you okay?

677
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,958
There are so many gifts.

678
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,599
It's...

679
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,718
Why did you put them here?
Tiantian, you bought these?

680
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,118
Here.

681
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,118
I didn't buy these, I threw them here.

682
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,880
Throw?

683
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,438
They look new.

684
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,040
It would be a waste.

685
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,238
Health products?

686
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,599
It's for grandma?

687
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,599
Forget it, just keep them.

688
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,479
Look at her.

689
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,999
I know.

690
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,999
Are these health products expired?

691
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,400
You want to throw them away,
but grandma wants to keep them?

692
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,079
Let me tell you,

693
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,318
it's okay
if health products are expired not for long.

694
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,760
Look how anxious grandma is.

695
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,279
Then you can take them away.

696
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,879
I'm still young.

697
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,478
I don't need those.

698
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,519
We eat this.

699
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,879
My parents went
to visit my sister and her boyfriend.

700
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,639
They made these and put them in the fridge.

701
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,000
Wonton and the chicken soup made yesterday.

702
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,159
Your parents always take care of us.

703
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,759
Thank you so much.

704
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,160
Have supper here.

705
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,478
I'll warm the soup.

706
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,718
Okay, grandma.

707
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,640
Miss Tiantian.

708
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,479
What happened?

709
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,519
Just ignore her.

710
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,718
Let her be alone for a while.

711
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,039
Let's go.

712
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,160
I'll do that.

713
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,439
Zhuang is such an expert.

714
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:19,559
Meiren is so lucky.

715
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,238
Her boyfriend is
not only a scientific researcher,

716
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,718
but also an expert in cooking.

717
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:27,159
Meiren also learns things fast.

718
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,879
She is also smart.

719
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,919
That's right.

720
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,039
Dad, mom, there is too much smoke.

721
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,039
Come and sit here.

722
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,358
Meiren, come here.

723
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,519
Come here and help him.

724
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,958
Meiren is right.

725
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,319
I can cook here alone.

726
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:45,920
Zhuang.

727
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:49,639
We spoiled her too much before.

728
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,199
Please forgive her.

729
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,520
She knows me well.

730
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,198
Uncle and aunt,

731
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:01,799
you can go to the sofa to have some rest.

732
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,078
No way.

733
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,879
I'll help you with it.

734
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,680
It's okay.

735
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:07,159
There is only one dish left.
It'll be ready soon.

736
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,519
So quick?

737
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,999
Then we can take bowls and chopsticks.

738
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,879
That's right.

739
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,039
Let's clean the table.

740
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,958
Let's put the dishes on the table.

741
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:14,999
Come on.

742
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,719
It smells delicious.

743
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,598
Meiren, come on.

744
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,999
I said I can't do that.

745
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,718
Just take the chopsticks.

746
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,958
I didn't ask you to cook.

747
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,280
Okay.

748
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,759
This smells delicious.

749
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,880
Where are bowls and chopsticks?

750
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,880
The chopsticks in the top drawer
and the bowls in the second.

751
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,919
See? She didn't know
where the bowls and chopsticks are.

752
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,919
She definitely didn't do housework here.

753
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,719
Just like you at home.

754
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,999
Dad, mom, don't worry.

755
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,359
I know how to put chopsticks.

756
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,958
Look at you.

757
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,318
Why did you...

758
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:54,198
You don't know how to put the chopsticks?

759
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:58,160
Don't you think
it's innovative to put them like this?

760
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,560
The stiff face of OCD.

761
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,080
Zhuang Yu, is it
good-looking to be put like this?

762
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,039
Occasionally using chopsticks
of different lengths and thicknesses

763
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,238
can exercise the flexibility of hands,

764
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,718
and increase appetite.

765
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,839
That's right.

766
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,199
It can increase appetite.

767
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:33,839
Mom.

768
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,560
Here.

769
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,239
Eat more.

770
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,000
You...

771
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,879
Stop cleaning, and eat more.

772
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,279
Want to have supper with me?

773
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,719
This is the price you need to pay.

774
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,600
Grandma.

775
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,439
Thank you.

776
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,158
Miss Tiantian,
let me get one bowl of soup for you.

777
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,000
Thanks.

778
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,280
Well,

779
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:14,519
I saw the boss who came
to our village to collect grapes.

780
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,119
He ordered a room
for a month in our homestay hotel.

781
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,479
Really? A month?

782
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,878
I thought the boss would live in the town.

783
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,959
I didn't imagine he is really nice.

784
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,398
What's wrong, Miss Tiantian?

785
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,999
It's okay, a chicken bone choked me.

786
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,279
Then don't eat it.

787
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,759
Eat one more.

788
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,759
It didn't choke her here.

789
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,679
It choked her here.

790
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,159
Come on, eat.

791
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:48,878
When I saw him, I
felt he was familiar.

792
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,198
And I remembered,

793
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,718
he is the boss who bought grapes last time.

794
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,319
He looks thinner.

795
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,878
I can hardly recognize him.

796
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:58,399
He did too many evil things.
Of course he'll get thinner.

797
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,719
Grandma.

798
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,158
I thought he was a liar,

799
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,238
but he helped us to sell grapes twice.

800
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:09,320
He is a benefactor to our village.

801
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,079
The reason why we can become like this today

802
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,599
is the help of our Party and government.

803
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,279
It is because of
the rural revitalization strategy.

804
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,878
They gave us subsidies,
so that we can become rich,

805
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:28,638
and let people see the beautiful scenery
and economic growth in Qingshui Village.

806
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,520
It's none of that Jin Xi's business.

807
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,638
Stop talking about him.

808
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,439
Just eat.

809
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,760
Come on, eat.

810
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,638
Here.

811
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,679
Thank you, grandma.

812
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:48,040
Meiren, don't you like eggplants?

813
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,958
I bought the hottest pepper.

814
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,559
Have a taste to see if it's hot enough.

815
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,959
It's been a long time, my taste has changed.

816
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,159
Zhuang, the fish you made is delicious.

817
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,878
Mandarin duck fish, it's delicious,

818
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,839
and has a good meaning.

819
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,398
That's right.

820
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,279
Mandarin duck has a good meaning?

821
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,918
During a year,

822
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,999
they are only together
during the breeding month.

823
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,918
The reason why the male stays with the female

824
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,918
is not to love and accompany her,

825
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:20,238
but to pretend the female from betraying him.

826
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,319
After the breeding month,

827
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,479
the male would leave without hesitation.

828
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,559
And mandarin ducks often change their couple.

829
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,198
They have nothing to do with loyalty.

830
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:32,198
But it matches well with this dish.

831
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,999
What's wrong with the beef?

832
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,839
The beef is good.

833
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,000
It's easy to bite and delicious.

834
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,280
When beef becomes
dregs, it means a bad guy.

835
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,999
And this fish matches you well.

836
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,360
Here, eat more.

837
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,279
This is the nature of birds.

838
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,678
To apply human moral standards to birds,

839
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,360
is this fair?

840
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:03,678
Humans have moral standards?

841
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,760
I almost forget about that.

842
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:08,079
We're eating, stop discussing that.

843
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,158
That's right.

844
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,759
Zhuang, the fish is so delicious.

845
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,199
See?

846
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,878
The two sides are both delicious.

847
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:16,718
That's right.

848
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,478
A double-dealer cooked a double-side fish.

849
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,159
Of course he'll cook it well.

850
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,519
What is wrong with you today, Meiren?

851
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,119
What did you say all day?

852
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,039
Why are you saying that to Zhuang?

853
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,399
This is Meiren's humor, I know.

854
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,999
See?

855
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,198
Enough, you need to save face for him.

856
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,119
Don't say that.

857
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,840
Mom.

858
00:38:35,841 --> 00:38:38,438
You always say that to dad.

859
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:39,839
I'm used to it.

860
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,918
What did you say?

861
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,879
You should do that.

862
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:46,319
Your relationship is so close.

863
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,759
There must be some tips.

864
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,239
I should learn from you more, uncle.

865
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,279
Zhuang, you're a professor.

866
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,319
Why do you learn from me?

867
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,040
You don't need to do that.

868
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:57,919
I'm full.

869
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,199
Wait, clean your bowl.

870
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:01,919
Clean it.

871
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,439
Okay.

872
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,159
Be careful.

873
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,120
What? Afraid that I'll drop your bowl?

874
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,320
I'm afraid you'll get injured.

875
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,320
I'm sleepy, goodbye.

876
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:32,320
Wait, Meiren.

877
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,438
Sorry, Professor Zhuang.

878
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,279
We'll clean it.

879
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,718
It's okay, aunt and uncle.

880
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,039
I'll do it.

881
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,678
You must be tired of the journey all day.

882
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,718
Have some rest early.

883
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:44,678
But there are too many bowls.

884
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,639
It's okay, I like washing bowls.

885
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,398
Zhuang is so considerate.

886
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,238
That's right, he is so nice.

887
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,599
To be honest, if
no one forces you,

888
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,959
who would say he likes washing bowls?

889
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,799
Actually, washing bowls
can bring me much inspiration.

890
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Really?

891
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,999
When Zhuang is washing bowls,

892
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,039
he is making a contribution to society.

893
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,039
When you're washing bowls,

894
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,519
you're just wasting water. What else?

895
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,719
Break two bowls.

896
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,359
Zhuang, we won't disturb you anymore.

897
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,719
We shall leave now.

898
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,918
Good night, uncle and aunt.

899
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,718
Dad, mom, come on, the elevator is here.

900
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,760
Coming.

901
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,040
Zhuang.

902
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:29,840
Actually, Meiren is just a paper tiger.
She's just self-willed.

903
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,559
Create some chances,

904
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,279
take the initiative and coax her.

905
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,040
I'll support you.

906
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,858
♫ The wind blows in the sky after the rain ♫

907
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:46,030

Collect the live broadcast tools in your home.

It's none of your business.

00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:27,679
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

927
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,550
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

928
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,699
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

929
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,099
♫ You show up in my sight ♫

930
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,999
♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

931
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,430
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

932
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,299
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

933
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,749
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

934
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,749
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

935
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,449
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

936
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:09,429
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

937
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:15,149
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

938
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:20,379
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

939
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,799
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

940
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,779
♫ You make all the stars
in the sky shine for me ♫

941
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,479
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

942
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,349
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

943
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:46,730
♫ Even the air is filled
with the scent of flowers ♫
