[Episode 28]
[I owe... owe you a word "I like you".]

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,359
Grandma, when was this roof repaired?

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,519
It was fixed by Jin
and Zhou in the past two days.

26
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,160
Jin Xi?

27
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,759
He can fix this?

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,119
Jin is very nice to you.

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,838
But you're always cold to him.

30
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:52,039
I didn't help with the cooking that day.

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,719
Then he found there was a leak in our roof.

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,679
He got up there and replaced
the old tiles with Zhou without saying a word.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,959
He fixed it as good as new.

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,878
It's so high up there.

35
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,318
He's not the kind of person who can do that.

36
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,598
Yeah. That's exactly what I said.

37
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,838
But he did it.

38
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,558
He asked me not to tell you.

39
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,679
But you don't see it yourself.

40
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,759
It's so beautiful.

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,559
What's wrong?

42
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:31,880
Nice.

43
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,600
Idiot!

44
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,079
I'm checking the contract.

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,440
I think there are some problems with two things.

46
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,720
His payment method is not right.

47
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:17,080
We've been waiting for two and a half hours.

48
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,799
Do you think I'm corn?

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,039
Why do people always stand me up?

50
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:41,638
Why don't you answer me?

51
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,678
Maybe... it's because there's a problem
with the English name you call yourself.

52
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,838
The English name?

53
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,239
Corn poppy.

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,198
Little corn. Did you forget it?

55
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,558
Boring.

56
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,359
What... what... You... you...

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,838
No... come on.

58
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,599
I don't hit you that hard.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,278
- The beard.
- What happened to it?

60
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,039
It fell off.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,679
It shouldn't. Let me see.

62
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,440
It's pretty tight, isn't it?

63
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,200
Maybe it's loose because you just touched it.

64
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:30,390
Here. Sit and rest.

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,914
I guess Boss Wang should
be calling me any minute.

66
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,559
Don't lie.

67
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,114
[Boss Wang]

68
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,399
We're not in danger, aren't we?

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,040
Don't worry.

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,479
I got it handled.

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,285
Could you tell me how you handle it?

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,827
A folding knife.

73
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:24,278
Isn't it for cutting fruit
in the wild investigation?

74
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,229
Why do you carry it with you?

75
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,285
For getting the second brother fruit to eat.

76
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,760
It's for you.

77
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,399
For me?

78
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,571
I can't let you repair the roof for nothing.

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,559
- Grandma.
- Come on. Sit.

80
00:05:58,342 --> 00:06:00,078
Grandma, Tiantian gave it to me.

81
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,959
It's from her?

82
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,559
- Sweet?
- Yes.

83
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,159
Come on, you don't even taste it.

84
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,970
It's from you. It must be sweet.

85
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,070
You can only say some sweet words.

86
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:19,839
Here.

87
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,000
Why are you looking at me? Eat.

88
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,679
Eat.

89
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,399
Tiantian.

90
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,480
Do you want...

91
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,399
No, I don't want it. It doesn't look delicious.

92
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:53,085
Are you sure you don't want it?

93
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,656
What?

94
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:01,320
Do you still want to wait here?

95
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,827
Of course not.

96
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:08,390
Professor Zhuang, could you
show it soon if you have any good plans?

97
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,627
Here's the good plan.

98
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:13,558
This is not an ordinary compressed cookie.

99
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,838
Then what's it?

100
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,838
Could it be the ginseng fruit cookie
Zhuang Wukong brought?

101
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,760
Boss Wang will come if you eat it.

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,439
Are you hallucinating from hunger?

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,920
Why don't you eat it?

104
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,790
You'll see him after you eat it.

105
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,839
Does your beard have some magic power?

106
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,171
Why do I feel you keep lying when you put it on?

107
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,320
You'll know if I'm lying after you eat it.

108
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,759
You can't see him until you finish it.

109
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,239
You're kidding me.

110
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,239
- Where's he?
- You're full?

111
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,238
What's it got to do with Boss Wang's coming?

112
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm relieved if you're full.

113
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,440
Why?

114
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,141
Honey.

115
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:36,759
Honey, what's wrong? Wake up!

116
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,770
Don't scare me.

117
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:41,000
We're not doing the business.
We weren't bullied like that.

118
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,080
11 o'clock.

119
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,880
Don't look.

120
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,279
It's the outer wall at 11 o'clock.

121
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,319
There's no glass by the wall but a reflection.

122
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,400
They should be there.

123
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,079
I'm here. I won't let you suffer anything.

124
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,559
Let's go.

125
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,478
I'm really sorry.

126
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,879
The situation is tense lately.

127
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,084
I have to be cautious.

128
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:18,080
Please don't blame me.

129
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:40,879
Boss Wang, I don't care if you're cautious.

130
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,141
My wife just almost
passed out from heatstroke.

131
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:45,350
If something happens, can you be responsible?

132
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,427
Come on, Boss Yan.

133
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:51,884
I fear those dubious people would follow you.

134
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:55,710
It's not good for you, let alone us. Right?

135
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,339
Alright.

136
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,628
Which one of you will
go to get the goods with me?

137
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,320
- Me.
- Me.

138
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,478
Boss Wang, what do you mean?

139
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,656
You want live ones.

140
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:10,080
How could I bring live ones here?

141
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,314
- I'll go with you.
- Just the usual.

142
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,470
Come on, Boss Yan.

144
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:40,550
A knife for self-defense when I'm out.

145
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,159
Boss Yan, you're cautious.

146
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,279
But don't worry. Our place is very safe.

147
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,228
And you'll be escorted along the way.

148
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:56,150
I think you can just leave it to Boss Hua.

149
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,639
I know. Bargaining.

150
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,320
Trust me. I can do it.

151
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,440
Come here.

152
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,718
Zhuang Yu, this is serious.

153
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,400
We had a deal.
Safety is first. Do you forget it?

154
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,257
No, I don't.

155
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:29,350
As I said, I'd do whatever
you wanted to do for you.

156
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,678
Please, no.

157
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,913
This is my business.

158
00:11:34,914 --> 00:11:36,550
You don't owe me anything.

159
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,239
I owe...

160
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,640
owe you a word that's "I like you".

161
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,719
I'll say it to you seriously when I come back.

162
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,960
Boss Hua, do you want to go
yourself to make sure it's safe?

163
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,519
Boss Wang, what's your place?

164
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,238
Do you fear we won't leave if we go there?

165
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,760
I just fear we can't
take good care of you if you both go.

166
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,000
Boss Wang...

167
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:38,759
Boss Wang, you're kidding.

168
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,640
We're here to do business,
not to be your guests.

169
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,760
The best care for us is to
let us get the goods smoothly.

170
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:51,760
So, I'll go with you.

171
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:03,710
Take care of yourself.

00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:40,520
My wife hasn't left me since she got pregnant.

182
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,960
So, I have to tell her something.

183
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:49,369
♫ I want to keep our time so badly ♫

184
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,599
♫ If I can pretend ♫

185
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,049
♫ pretend that I'm very happy ♫

186
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,279
♫ Tell a lie ♫

187
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,085
♫ and keep that lost starlight ♫

188
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:11,819
♫ I want to stand by you ♫

189
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,284
♫ leaning on your shoulder ♫

190
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:15,080
Wait for me...

191
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:17,709
♫ I want to keep our time ♫

192
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,314
Wait for me and I'll say it to you.

193
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,399
♫ I don't want to pretend anymore ♫

194
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,019
♫ It's my happiest moment ♫

195
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:37,828
♫ to see the starlight with you ♫

196
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,358
Give me some of this.

197
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,558
All units, wrap it up now!

198
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,319
Just got word that Boss Wang shows up.

199
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
They took a hostage. Go to save him first.

200
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,589
What about the other group?

201
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,371
Let another unit catch them in advance.

202
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:18,279
Have you caught them?

203
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,839
We've destroyed a nest.

204
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,439
But it's not Boss Wang's lair.

205
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,640
He's not here.

206
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,279
Get them under control.

207
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,918
Don't let them tip off so as not to alert him.

208
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,239
I'm going to save the hostage.

209
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay.

210
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,856
Wei, Yunhai.

211
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:41,200
Arrange sentries to check suspicious people
when you get to the brick factory.

212
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,799
Tiantian, can you accompany
me to someplace today?

213
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:00,358
It's in the village.

214
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,919
It won't take you too long.

215
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,256
Where's the fun in the village?

216
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm sure you've never been to that place.

217
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:09,709
It's mysterious.

218
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,942
Is there any place
I don't know about the village?

219
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:37,910
The old place has been renovated.

220
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,880
It's still warm. It smells good.

221
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,000
Strange.

222
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,719
Where's he?

223
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,485
[Unknown caller]

224
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:13,880
Hello?

225
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,560
It's Zhou.

226
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,118
Mr. Zhou.

227
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,099
Something came up.

228
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,879
President Jin asked me to tell you
he couldn't make it.

229
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,680
He's not coming?

230
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,279
Well, could I ask...

231
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,839
No, it's his personal schedule.

232
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,079
Okay, forget it.

233
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:37,159
Miss Li sounds unhappy anyway.

234
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,639
Do you think it's okay for us to say that?

235
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
It's fine. Just say that.

236
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,559
Why not I explain to Miss. Li?

237
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,239
No need.

238
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,078
But she...

239
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,959
Just drive.

240
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,598
We've already received a tip
that Boss Wang would trade today.

241
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,084
I didn't expect it to be you.

242
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,999
Do you know it's dangerous for you to do that?

243
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,400
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

244
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:09,110
I was eager to save the birds.
I dragged Zhuang Yu into it.

245
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:15,313
We can't keep waiting like this.

246
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:18,056
Captain Wang, shall we expand the search area?

247
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:21,040
We don't know the location
of Boss Wang's nest yet.

248
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm afraid we can't find the place
even with more guys

249
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
but will alert the enemy.

250
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,628
[Click to turn it off]

251
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,118
It's a long drive.

252
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,118
Boss Yan, you were up early. You must be tired.

253
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,520
Why don't you rest your eyes?

254
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:05,485
Boss Wang, that's thoughtful of you.

255
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,479
But... it's too hot in this car.

256
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:13,319
Can you open the windows to get some air?

257
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:17,399
Yeah, sorry, I didn't think about that.

258
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,599
Of course. You should have said it earlier.

259
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:27,230
The air out here is not good.

260
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,571
Let's turn on the AC. It's good to enjoy it.

261
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,719
What's the smell? Can you smell it?

262
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,684
- It stinks!
- What's it?

263
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:57,760
Where's it from?

264
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,838
What's it?

265
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,920
I don't know.

266
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,359
Uh.

267
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,719
Wang, it seems to come from the AC.

268
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,280
Open the windows.

269
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,640
Sorry, Boss Yan.

270
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,509
What's this?

271
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,800
A gift that I didn't
have time to give yesterday.

272
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,955
Professor Zhuang, do you have girls in Baiyuan,

273
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:53,942
so you have to send gifts around?

274
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes, there's a girl.

275
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,942
I have to give it to her in person.

276
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,857
I wish you two a happy marriage.

277
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:09,000
That girl is not very good-tempered.

278
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
She always likes to frown.

279
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,399
Don't talk nonsense.

280
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,280
Tell me, what's it?

281
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:23,760
I gave her flowers without perfume yesterday.

282
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:27,478
It's said that wildflowers are always prettier.

283
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,238
Professor Zhuang,
you can't even smell wildflowers.

284
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,800
Is your nose not working?

285
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:37,941
It seems I'm like entering
a room full of fragrant orchids

286
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:39,880
and getting used to the sweet smell.

287
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,238
What do you need perfume for?

288
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,800
To educate your smell?

289
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,520
Not yet.

290
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,078
Professor Zhuang,
you're not an excellent scholar.

291
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:00,039
This... this smell doesn't...
doesn't match that.

292
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,742
Only... only Vileplumer deserves it.

293
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:06,645
This is Indole Solution,
100 millimoles per liter.

294
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:07,944
Skatole?

295
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:13,282
Dilute it to one millimole per liter,
and it'll be the flowery smell.

296
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:18,217
Jasmine.

297
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:20,332
Why do you choose this scent?

298
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,031
Because someone likes it.

299
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:29,318
You'd better be careful.

300
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,520
If you spill it,
it'd smoke ten of Boss Wang out.

301
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:36,399
Wang, what's wrong with the AC?

302
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,118
It's been a while.
Why doesn't the smell go away?

303
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:39,959
Boss Wang.

304
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,680
How long will we be there?

305
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,159
The sun is going down if we keep driving.

306
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,400
Boss Yan, easy.

307
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,599
You'll know it's worth the trip
when you see the goods.

308
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,280
Of course.

309
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,478
You've prepared it so well.

310
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,880
The goods must be great.

311
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:05,040
But... if I go back late,

312
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,319
my wife will be anxious.

313
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,319
Boss Yan.

314
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,719
Boss Yan.

315
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:01,427
Here we are?

316
00:24:01,428 --> 00:24:02,570
Sorry.

317
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,799
It's rough to go up the mountain.

318
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,759
Bear with us.

319
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,079
It's okay.

320
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,456
Thank you.

321
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:11,520
Not at all.

322
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,599
Please.

323
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,198
Boss Yan, the road up to
the mountain is narrower.

324
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,570
The car can't get up there.

325
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:26,230
You got to walk.

326
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,713
The sun is bright up there.

327
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,760
Boss Wang, that's thoughtful of you.

328
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,040
After all, you're our guest.

329
00:24:35,714 --> 00:24:36,800
Please.

330
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,114
- I've confirmed there were no followers.
- Got it.

331
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,760
Boss Yan.

332
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:55,919
The hill is muddy.

333
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,119
Watch your step.

334
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,078
It's nothing.

335
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,280
If the deal is done,
a broken pair of shoes is nothing.

336
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,713
Boss Yan, you're from a big city.

337
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,484
You've seen more of the world.

338
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:11,879
Guangzhou is really a good place.

339
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,838
If not for the business,
we wouldn't have stayed here.

340
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,239
Boss Wang, you're joking.

341
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,159
You know it rains several months
a year in Guangzhou.

342
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,770
It's too wet to live
when the continuous humid weather comes.

343
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:26,800
My wife likes the climate of Baiyuan.

344
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:30,559
The weather is nice in Baiyuan.

345
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,478
Summer is long.

346
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:35,160
Like the last two days,
it rained, and it stopped soon.

347
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:43,598
We can't wait, Captain Wang.

348
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,880
Another half hour has passed.

349
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,598
Yu, take it easy.

350
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,880
We have a second plan.

351
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:54,169
This message is written
in the character description.

352
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,142
Did you forget it?

353
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:56,350
Here.

354
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
What's it?

355
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,880
Lucky Star.

356
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:19,160
Here you are.

357
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,219
The goods?

358
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,885
The goods are all ready.

359
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,839
Excuse me, where can I take a leak?

360
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,542
Take Boss Yan to the toilet.

361
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,227
Here?

362
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:55,559
There's no curtain?

363
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,400
Cut the crap.

364
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,800
Hurry up!

365
00:26:58,857 --> 00:27:00,742
Would you leave me, please?

366
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,958
Officer Wang, it's been an hour and a half.

367
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:12,958
We're a couple.

368
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:16,000
They shouldn't suspect
anything if I call him now, right?

369
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,319
You're right.

370
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,238
It's useless to wait here.

371
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:25,309
It's bad for the arrest
and it might affect his safety.

372
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,000
Call him.

373
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:38,959
Hold on.

374
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,941
However, there's only one chance.

375
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:45,519
If you reveal yourself...

376
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,280
Don't worry, I'm ready.

377
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,741
[Honey]

378
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:00,740
[No signal]

379
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:06,628
What are you doing?

380
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:14,189
Are you here to pee?

381
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,028
No, so many of you are watching me.
I feel embarrassed.

382
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,085
Forget it. Let's go back.

383
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:27,519
Sorry. The number you
have dialed is not available.

384
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,959
Please try again later.

385
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,040
Could they be in the mountains?

386
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,713
Look.

387
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,999
Baiyuan is surrounded by hills.

388
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,141
Wherever there are men,
there will be signal towers.

389
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:46,110
Only these places have no resident population.

390
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:49,656
Since we can't get through on his phone,

391
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:51,640
he'll find a way to call us back.

392
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:02,399
Check the goods first.

393
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,200
Okay.

394
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:10,070
That's all?

395
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:11,920
No, there's more.

396
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:17,657
How?

397
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,970
It's worth the trip.

398
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,227
Boss Yan, how much do you think they're worth?

399
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:27,256
Money.

400
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:29,399
This is the last contingency he left.

401
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,759
The money in the suitcase is just for show.

402
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,475
If we want to get in touch with him,

403
00:29:33,476 --> 00:29:35,427
sending money to him is the best excuse.

404
00:29:35,428 --> 00:29:38,470
Boss Wang, are you satisfied with the price?

405
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:42,350
Boss Yan, it depends on your sincerity.

406
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,827
That's the first time we deal with each other.

407
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,679
Boss Wang, you don't trust me.

408
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,828
I also have some reservations about you.

409
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:03,040
What do you mean?

410
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:09,110
Boss Wang.

411
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:13,198
Business is business.
It's the first time we made a deal.

412
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,639
This is your territory.

413
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,456
And I'm surrounded by your men.

414
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:18,598
We're all out to do business.

415
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,680
If I don't leave myself an out,
then I'd be manipulated.

416
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,541
So, what's your plan, Boss Yan?

417
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,370
Only two ways to get money.

418
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:30,456
Either we deliver it or they come and get it.

419
00:30:30,457 --> 00:30:32,399
The rest of the money is with my wife.

420
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,456
I took a few guys with me for this deal.

421
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,719
Tell me the exact location.
I'll let them send the money here.

422
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,284
But Boss Wang won't agree.

423
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:46,228
Well, I know.

424
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,657
This black shed is not
for me to keep the sun out.

425
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:56,227
So, it's up to you how to get the money.

426
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,838
Then there's only one way.

427
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,000
- I'll send someone to get it.
- Okay.

428
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,119
But this place is in the middle of nowhere.

429
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,856
It's too far from Baiyuan.

430
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:09,885
It'll be dark when they come back.

431
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,913
Don't worry about it, Boss Yan.

432
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:16,913
Although it took some time to get here,
there's a shortcut.

433
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:19,999
Then why did we take a long way?

434
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,238
We drove here so we had to take a detour.

435
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:26,520
But it just takes about half an hour
to get here by motorcycle.

436
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,770
Come on. Call first.

437
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:30,430
Go.

438
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,040
Please, Boss Yan.

439
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:41,999
[Animals and other things
in this scene are all models.]

440
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,999
Please.

441
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,160
- Sit here.
- Please.

442
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,520
Watch your mouth.

443
00:31:58,457 --> 00:31:59,470
Be polite.

444
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:03,190
Boss Yan knows what he's doing.

445
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,084
Yes.

446
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,310
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

447
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:12,800
He's calling.

448
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,239
Satellite phone.

449
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,078
Hello?

450
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,560
Hello, honey, it's me.

451
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,438
Damn. You finally called me.

452
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,639
Look what time it is!

453
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,238
You didn't answer my phone.

454
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,718
Honey, let me explain.

455
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:36,838
It took a long time...

456
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,639
Explain?

457
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,799
If I hadn't seen you get into Boss Wang's car,

458
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,141
I'd have suspected that
you'd gone to do something dirty.

459
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:44,742
Honey, what are you talking about?

460
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,999
How could that be?

461
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,919
I wanted to call you as soon as I got here.

462
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,478
But my phone disconnected.

463
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:54,519
I finally borrowed
Boss Wang's phone to reach you.

464
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,118
It's been so long and you just arrived there?

465
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:57,920
Yeah.

466
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,118
I didn't miss a moment.

467
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,238
Alright, enough of this crap.

468
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,238
Have you seen the goods?

469
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,238
Yeah.

470
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:05,598
They're all first-rate.

471
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,718
All alive.

472
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,879
But a few are dying.

473
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,314
I'll kill them when I get them.

474
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,799
You must hurry.

475
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,598
Once they're dead, they're worthless.

476
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,118
Be careful.

477
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,079
How many in total? What's your price?

478
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,198
So expensive! You can't even bargain.

479
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,119
No way. You can't give them that much.

480
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,438
No, I've made a deal with Boss Wang.

481
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:34,239
What matters most in business? It's honesty.

482
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,358
It's not right to change
the price at the last minute.

483
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,719
Do me the honor.

484
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,559
Forget it. I'll deal with you later.

485
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,599
Check them out. No dead ones.

486
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,118
Don't worry. Boss Wang knows what he's doing.

487
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,358
How can I give you the money?

488
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,159
I'll ask Xiaochen to send it to you.

489
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,159
You can't take so many goods yourself.

490
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,942
Money?

491
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,679
I don't know.

492
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,759
Just wait!

493
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,039
It's just a small thing
and you can't make it clear.

494
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,319
Forget it. It's my fault.

495
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,918
If I had known you were disoriented,
I shouldn't have let you go.

496
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,599
You don't know if you're sold.

497
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,238
Yeah, honey, you're right.

498
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,040
Don't be angry.

499
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,398
Cut the shit.

500
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,198
It's my birthday tonight.

501
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,320
I'm not done with you
if you can't make it home for dinner.

502
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,119
Honey, don't worry. It's your birthday.

503
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,760
I'll go back no matter what.

504
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,519
What do you want for dinner?

505
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,314
I'll let the cook make it for you.

506
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:38,800
Your stomach was bad in the last few days.

507
00:34:39,314 --> 00:34:40,600
How about pumpkin?

508
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,519
Why pumpkin again?

509
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,359
We had pumpkin porridge three times a day.

510
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,914
I'm tired of it.

511
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,084
Be good.

512
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:51,878
Make it different.
It'll be delicious, I promise.

513
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:54,239
Tell me. I'll think about it.

514
00:34:57,142 --> 00:34:58,470
I know.

515
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,319
Well, my wife is angry.

516
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,638
I need to butter her up.

517
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,398
Two minutes, just two minutes.

518
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,320
Thank you.

519
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:10,958
Make a pumpkin pot.

520
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,079
Dig up the flesh.

521
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,438
Use the pumpkin as a bowl.

522
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,718
Put the chicken soup that's ready in it.

523
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,919
Then the soup is delicious with pumpkin flavor.

524
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,149
It's easy.

525
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,941
I'll ask the chef to stew
the chicken soup for you now.

526
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:28,399
It should be stewed for an hour or two
before it's put into the pumpkin,

527
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,119
but when you put it in the pumpkin bowl,

528
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,079
just stew it for another half an hour.

529
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,718
This is the exact time.

530
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,199
I see. What else do you want besides this?

531
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,570
It's been hot lately.

532
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,238
Have some watermelon after dinner. That's it.

533
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,399
That's it? No more dishes?

534
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,800
The rest is up to you.

535
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,919
You're not over?

536
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,919
Hello?

537
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:57,000
How?

538
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,313
- Did you get a trace?
- Not yet.

539
00:35:59,314 --> 00:36:02,799
Boss Yan, satellite phone call
is very expensive.

540
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,158
If you want to chitchat, you can do it at home.

541
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,199
Okay.

542
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:11,714
Sit for a while.

543
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,109
Hurry back.

544
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,000
Is it going to be a problem?

545
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,079
Not really.

546
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,141
He still got time to care about dinner.

547
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:36,470
How could he even think of that
if there's a problem?

548
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,120
I guess we'll have to use the second plan.

549
00:36:42,057 --> 00:36:44,000
Give me the walkie-talkie.

550
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,319
All units, be in place in advance.

551
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,718
See if any hidden sentries near the location.

552
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,170
Yu and I will go to the meeting spot
to send money to Boss Wang's man.

553
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:59,656
I'll take him down on the exchange
and ask him to take us there.

554
00:36:59,657 --> 00:37:01,141
What if...

555
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:05,279
Take them to Meifeng Mountain
if something happens.

556
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,600
I've got someone there.

557
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:11,039
There's a man with a chicken cage
waiting there when you get there.

558
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,760
Okay, I'm leaving.

559
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,456
I've confirmed it. No sentries around there.

560
00:37:24,457 --> 00:37:26,519
It takes a long time to arrange spotters.

561
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,479
Looks like Boss Wang is anxious.

562
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:31,371
He'll make mistakes when he's anxious.

563
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,469
Don't worry.

564
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,914
We'll return a complete Professor Zhuang to you.

565
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:40,470
- Thank you, Officer Wang.
- The car is coming.

566
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,239
Don't move.

567
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,919
Don't move.

568
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,600
Be honest. Where's the lair?

569
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,839
Say.

570
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,370
Okay, I'll say.

571
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:12,638
Meifeng Mountain.

572
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,399
Cuff him.

573
00:38:15,028 --> 00:38:16,000
Get in the car!

574
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,599
Don't move.

575
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,799
Yu, this trip is dangerous.

576
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,341
Just wait for us here.

577
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:32,638
Officer Wang, Zhuang Yu
just said some birds were dying.

578
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,799
There's food and medication in it.

579
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,657
I can save them at once if I go.

580
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,513
Okay.

581
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:42,319
But you must conceal yourself.

582
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,519
You can't let Boss Wang
see you before we catch him.

583
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,542
Or Professor Zhuang will also be in danger.

584
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:49,199
Get in.

585
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,885
[Meifeng Mountain]

586
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,280
Why isn't he here yet?

587
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:14,879
- Any news from Meifeng Mountain?
- Not yet.

588
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,159
That's strange.

589
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,519
Boss Wang, take it easy.

590
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,000
Whatever will be, will be.

591
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:27,158
Look. He's coming.

592
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:27,760
Go check.

593
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,170
Don't move!

594
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,559
Get down! Hands on your heads!

595
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,878
We got reports that you're making
illegal wild animal transactions here.

596
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,719
All get down, hold your heads. Cuff them.

597
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:40,870
Take them away.

598
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:44,080
Captain Wang.

599
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:46,999
All members are under control.

600
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,158
- We've caught them all.
- Good. Check out the goods.

601
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:50,719
Okay.

602
00:39:52,114 --> 00:39:53,150
That's all.

603
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:58,684
They're dying.

604
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:00,040
Hurry. Take them away.

605
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:05,119
Luckily, you got here in time.
They should be saved at once.

606
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,760
Yeah.

607
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:08,320
It's not easy.

608
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,718
Explain the location with
the question of what to eat for dinner.

609
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,478
The white gourd represents the east.

610
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:32,279
And pumpkin, the south.

611
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,389
You know it rains several
months a year in Guangzhou.

612
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,319
It's too wet to live
when the continuous humid weather comes.

613
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,120
My wife likes the climate of Baiyuan.

614
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,718
The weather is nice in Baiyuan.

615
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,519
Summer is long. Like the last two days,

616
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,399
it rained, and it stopped soon.

617
00:40:51,428 --> 00:40:52,999
The direction of the sunlight.

618
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,878
Leaves are growing towards the southwest.

619
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:57,519
Plenty of sunshine here.
Not much rain all year round.

620
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,639
But it has these plants.

621
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,599
Your stomach was bad in the last few days.

622
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,759
How about pumpkin?

623
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,198
It's been hot lately.

624
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,599
Have some watermelon after dinner. That's it.

625
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,439
Southwest.

626
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,279
It should be stewed for an hour or two
before it's put into the pumpkin,

627
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,079
but when you put it in the pumpkin bowl,

628
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,839
just stew it for another half an hour.

629
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,718
Which one of the two times is right?

630
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:21,399
One or two hours should be the time
they took a detour on their way over there.

631
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,713
It's the same sign again.

632
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:27,678
We drove here so we had to take a detour.

633
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,638
It just takes about half an hour
to get here by motorcycle.

634
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,119
Use the form of food to
describe the feature of the place.

635
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,158
Dig up the flesh and use the pumpkin as a bowl.

636
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,878
Use the pumpkin as a bowl,

637
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:43,040
which means the place is not on the hills,

638
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,159
but in a pit.

639
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:00,839
You ruined my business.

640
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,600
I'll ruin your life.

641
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:09,709

00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,999

What's it?

647
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:34,679
This is the code he left for us.

648
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,884
Explain the location with
the question of what to eat for dinner.

649
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:41,999
The white gourd represents the east.

650
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,599
And pumpkin, the south.

651
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,770
Use the cooking time of the dish

652
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,280
to describe the time
of getting to the destination.
