[Episode 27]
[I'm beautiful, but he's unreliable]

24
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,919
Have you got wild game,

25
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,800
as what he's having over there?

26
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,439
No, no.

27
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,518
We're a decent restaurant.

28
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,760
We don't have what you asked for.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,319
He's having chicken.

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,598
Come on, sir, stop it.

31
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,518
We all get it.

32
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,000
I am asking for chicken.

33
00:01:58,559 --> 00:01:59,639
The wildest kind.

34
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:02,958
Rest assured. We have money.

35
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,839
It's about money, right? We've got it.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,520
Since my wife wants it,

37
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,638
you can name a price.

38
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,199
Sir, this isn't about money.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,159
This is illegal.

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,118
We really don't have it.

41
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,559
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,558
Look at the menu, please.

43
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,639
Forget it.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,198
I'll have these ones.

45
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,360
OK, please wait.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,399
I told you not to come here.

47
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,478
How boring.

48
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,039
The game here is not so much as
we have in Guangdong.

49
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,079
Honey.

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,918
Calm your nerves.

51
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,239
Our family runs a restaurant.

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,918
Whatever you want,
I'll have the cook make it for you.

53
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,999
Here.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,599
Don't you just think that

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,478
the stores next to us are having more business?

56
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,118
I heard their goods are from Baiyuan.

57
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,359
You just want to know the supply channel, right?

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,079
It's all Lingling's fault.

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,838
She just wouldn't tell me.

60
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,999
She must be afraid that
our business gets better than hers.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,520
You bet.

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,639
We're rich people, aren't we?

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,159
She knew that we would bid
higher because we're richer,

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,918
and is afraid that she wouldn't win us

65
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,038
once we know the source of goods.

66
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,399
Where are you from in Guangdong?

67
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,758
We've been looking for them for ages.
Where are they?

68
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,679
You're asking me?

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,398
They're neither at the pick-up point
nor the homestay.

70
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,079
Can they vanish into thin air?

71
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
So... why are we here in this street?

72
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,558
I... I'm not dressed up today.

73
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,160
What do they mean by looking at me?

74
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,439
I don't think they mean that.

75
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,399
Then what is it? Keep searching.

76
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,278
Grapes! Organic grapes!

77
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,879
Big sweet grapes!

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,118
Come and check them out!

79
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,319
Sweet and watery grapes!

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,439
Come and have a taste!

81
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,278
Miss Tiantian, you're sweating.

82
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,600
Let me wipe it off for you.

83
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,359
Here.

84
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,358
Thanks.

85
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,279
President Jin, Mr. Zhou.

86
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,238
President Jin, what are you doing here?

87
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,199
Wanna find out how our commoners suffer?

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,518
Or you're here to celebrate the festival?

89
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,398
No, no, no.

90
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,319
Then go away. Don't affect our business.

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,558
You don't allow me to buy grapes here?

92
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,920
I dare not. What if you exchange them again?

93
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,119
I'm not here to buy them.

94
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,440
I'm here to help you sell them.

95
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,439
You know what?

96
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,838
I practiced juggling when I was a kid.

97
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,039
It works well when we're
calling out in the street.

98
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
You have to juggle them or
no one will come to buy them,

99
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,880
you know?

100
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,439
Don't play with my grapes.

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
You'll drop them.

102
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,600
Excuse me, what are you selling here?

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,159
Grapes.

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,959
- How about having a try?
- I'll have a bunch.

105
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,078
OK, a bunch of grapes. Weigh them.

106
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,439
Hurry.

107
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,798
Meinan, come on.

108
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,319
Help me weigh them.

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,759
You've got a good eye. Our grapes are the best.

110
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,759
You have great skin.

111
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Eating grapes will perfect it,
right?

112
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,319
Is this bunch good?

113
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,559
- Yeah, good.
- Okay.

114
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,279
How much is it?

115
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,040
How much...

116
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:38,920
12 yuan.

117
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,239
Is she...

118
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,879
10 yuan will do.

119
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,039
The proprietress isn't in a good mood.

120
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,639
You can scan the code there.

121
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,720
Who... Who's the proprietress?

122
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,919
It's selling well.

123
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,958
What if the grapes are not enough?

124
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,958
Yeah, it's almost empty.

125
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,279
Exactly.

126
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,358
There's some more in the truck.

127
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,398
Some... Some more in the truck?

128
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,678
Perfect. I'm going with you
and helping you move them.

129
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:02,399
Right, right.

130
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,160
Go, go ahead.

131
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,720
No, no, but...

132
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,279
No hurry.

133
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,518
But there's plenty in here.

134
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,760
No hurry. Take your time.

135
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,160
Let's go.

136
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,359
Who told you to give them a discount?

137
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,319
They were interested in buying them.

138
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,078
How could I let them go?

139
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,799
That's it.

140
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,200
Are you jealous?

141
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,759
Why would I be jealous? Boring.

142
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,600
Then why are you getting so uptight?

143
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,480
You...

144
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,959
You're sweating.

145
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,078
I'm not.

146
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,119
Here.

147
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,078
It's wonderful to be young.

148
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,118
Chinese Valentine's Day,
May 20th Festival,

149
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,359
they've got so many holidays to celebrate.

150
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,519
I'm very envious.

151
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,799
Take a bite then.

152
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,558
Why would I?

153
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,640
You forgot what day it is today?

154
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,958
Look at me. I nearly forgot.

155
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,320
It's such a big day.

156
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,518
Your dance team's learning a new dance today,

157
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,599
right? Hurry up and eat.

158
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,919
So we can leave early. Don't be late.

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,078
Or you'll be relieved of your duties
as the captain. Come on.

160
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,919
Yu Dazhao, you...

161
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,399
Stop, stop. Calm down.

162
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,880
Happy Valentine's Day.

163
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,039
Isn't it pretty? Did you think I'd forgotten?

164
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,319
You don't take jokes, just like when you were a kid.

165
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,319
We're not young anymore.

166
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,639
Why do you send me flowers as the kids do?

167
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,599
How much did it cost?

168
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,599
You're the prettiest of all in Qingshui village.

169
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,558
Shouldn't I spend some money to make you smile?

170
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,358
Am I right? If I don't do this,

171
00:07:57,359 --> 00:08:00,159
you'd look for guys better than me.

172
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,278
I'm getting old.

173
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,200
I'm not the prettiest now.

174
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,200
In my heart,

175
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,119
you've always been the prettiest.

176
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,278
But everyone else sends roses,
why you sent me sunflowers?

177
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,278
Roses are tacky.

178
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,159
Only sunflowers can express my mind.

179
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm like these sunflowers,
and you are my sun.

180
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,639
That's more like it.

181
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,519
How much did it cost exactly?

182
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,398
I stole the money Meinan
got from selling scrap.

183
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,080
It's fine. Don't care about the cost.

184
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,718
It's been days since I
called Meiren last time.

185
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,159
I don't know how she's doing today.

186
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,159
Hey, man.

187
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,199
You're from Guangdong, too?

188
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,719
I used to work in Guangzhou.

189
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,478
Where's the restaurant you talked about?

190
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,839
At the intersection of Yuexiu Road.

191
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,558
It's called Swan Restaurant.

192
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,959
Do you know it?

193
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,678
Seems to ring a bell.

194
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,238
The place where I worked is on Zhongshan Road.

195
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,879
That's close.

196
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,440
You're from out of town?

197
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,358
You speak Cantonese well.

198
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,839
I wouldn't say that.

199
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,798
Don't be so modest.

200
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,158
My wife isn't like you.

201
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,279
Having been married
to Guangzhou for so many years,

202
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,718
she still doesn't understand Cantonese.

203
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,320
Since you know that,
why didn't you speak Mandarin?

204
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,319
He just said...

205
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,880
There you go.

206
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,358
he's from Guangzhou,
and the place he worked

207
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,558
is near our restaurant.

208
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,599
Isn't it a coincidence?

209
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,718
It is, of course.

210
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,718
So, why don't you come to
our restaurant if you have time?

211
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,279
I'll offer you discounts.

212
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm not staying in Guangzhou anymore.

213
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,479
I've returned to Baiyuan.

214
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,320
That's a pity.

215
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:44,239
Then, are you a local in Baiyuan?

216
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,280
Well,
do you know where can I buy wild game?

217
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,559
Come on, man.

218
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,478
I hope you don't mind it.

219
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:14,158
My wife doesn't
have a sharp brain.

220
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,679
We eat almost everything,
and aren't fussy at all.

221
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,880
Here.

222
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,880
Have a drink.

223
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,760
Sir.

224
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,598
Things are tense now.

225
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,960
If you get caught breaking the law,

226
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,080
you'll open yourself up to a lawsuit.

227
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,399
This is not the first time we've done this.

228
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,959
Rest assured, we're very cautious.

229
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,839
We've got connections outside Baiyuan.

230
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,918
But we don't want those of average quality.

231
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,919
It's better if you have one of those rare ones.

232
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,440
Excuse me.

233
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,558
Sorry, the dish is ready.

234
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,718
Excuse me.

235
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,479
Enjoy yourselves.

236
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,119
Recently, a few volunteers came
to the Wildlife Protection Station,

237
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,520
investigating around all the time.

238
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,559
You'd

239
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,640
better be extra careful.

240
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,199
What can the volunteers do?

241
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,038
Relax, if you introduce us to the sellers,

242
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,239
we'll give you commissions as a thank you.

243
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,959
That bunch of greenhorns.

244
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,119
Will I be afraid of them?

245
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,718
I've been in this trade for so many years.

246
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,839
Not to mention the big restaurants around,

247
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,918
I've delivered lots of goods from Guangdong.

248
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,919
So...

249
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,640
So you have the goods.

250
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,880
Honey, we came to the right restaurant.

251
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,919
This is fate. May I ask

252
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,959
what is your family name?

253
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,358
Jia.

254
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:03,558
What do I call you?

255
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,319
My last name is Hua,
and my husband's surnamed Yan.

256
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,718
Hua means beautiful.

257
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:11,640
And Yan means unreliable.

258
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,798
By the way, Mr. Jia,
what kind of goods do you have here?

259
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,599
I can get anything

260
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,039
as long as it has wings.

261
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,960
Eurasian teals are pretty common.

262
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,918
Swans, white storks, and turtledoves.

263
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,640
Do you have any of these?

264
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,280
Good choice.

265
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:51,719
I will get anything you want.

266
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,279
Mr. Jia, you're so resourceful.

267
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,880
But we want them alive.

268
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,080
Alive?

269
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,000
Why?

270
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,359
Ms. Hua, that's not how business works.

271
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,879
When corps solve crimes,

272
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,200
or volunteers save lives, they want them alive.

273
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,919
You're up to something else, aren't you?

274
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,959
Mr. Jia, you must be kidding.

275
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,399
What do you mean by that?

276
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,159
You know better than I do what I mean.

277
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,119
You look fierce.

278
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:36,280
Mr. Jia, if you have any concerns,

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,119
please be frank.

280
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,798
I've been doing this business for years,

281
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,599
but I've never met people like you.

282
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,200
If you're really ordering for your restaurant,

283
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,119
wouldn't it be better to kill them?

284
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,760
As customary,

285
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,880
it is the case.

286
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,679
But we have our own rules.

287
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,359
We don't accept the poisoned or stale ones.

288
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,358
I'm embarrassed to admit,

289
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,119
my wife just got scammed a few days ago.

290
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,759
That thing, em, Eurasian teal,
she got from others

291
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,038
was found with a stomach full of poison.

292
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,918
My wife got furious.

293
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,079
She took a picture and showed it to me.

294
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,918
It took me days to calm her down.

295
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,000
I know Mr. Jia wouldn't
try to fool us with these.

296
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,320
But don't blame us.

297
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,320
You know, once bitten, twice shy.

298
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,039
The ones alive

299
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,400
charge different prices.

300
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,999
Relax.

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Money won't be an issue.

302
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,959
Mr. Jia.

303
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,719
We are sort of fellow townsmen.

304
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,678
This half is a down payment.

305
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,039
I will give you the rest after delivery.

306
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,119
Okay.

307
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:13,238
But the game you
asked is not common.

308
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,080
How about this?

309
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,478
Leave me a contact.

310
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,479
After we negotiate a price,
I'll get back to you.

311
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:20,760
Good.

312
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,159
Come on, bro.

313
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,000
Thank you.

314
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,279
Why are you thanking me?

315
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,678
That's what I was supposed to do.

316
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:39,519
But you, you always have a poker face.

317
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,799
I didn't know you're such a good actor.

318
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,119
I've been eating the two-faced fish.

319
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,200
Maybe I've become two-faced.

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,598
They all say Professor Zhuang's aloof.

321
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,839
It's even hard to get your phone number.

322
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,719
Lucky for Jia San. He got that easily.

323
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,760
It's just a bunch of numbers.

324
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,080
For the people who matter,

325
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:04,919
I can give anything I have.

326
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,039
Moreover, I'm the lucky one.

327
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,200
Otherwise,

328
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,520
how could I get the famous
beauty blogger's WeChat?

329
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,640
Boring.

330
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,999
Be serious.

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,719
How was my performance today?

332
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,320
Pretty good.

333
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,440
We didn't fall short of success.

334
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,239
What do you mean?

335
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,718
I was praising you for being
brave, resourceful and good-looking.

336
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,959
Liar. That's clearly longer.

337
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,238
How can it mean the same thing?

338
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,279
It does.

339
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
What?

340
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,119
Yu Meiren.

341
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,238
Well... I... I haven't asked you.

342
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:58,200
Where did you learn Cantonese?

343
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,640
My parents worked in Guangzhou when I was young,

344
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,760
so I went to school there for two years.

345
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:06,358
No wonder. I can also speak a few words of Cantonese.

346
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,598
I learned them from watching Hong Kong dramas.

347
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,919
Like thanks, good fortune,
and I like you.

348
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,000
Me too.

349
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,199
I was just about to ask you.

350
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,598
Hua means beautiful...

351
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,520
What? You've got a problem?

352
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,040
No, it's accurate.

353
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,959
And Yan means unreliable?

354
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,800
It was a spur of the moment.

355
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:45,920
Besides, you're worthy of the name.

356
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,078
I sent you the message,

357
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,199
asking you to meet me at the botanical garden.

358
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,040
Why didn't you come?

359
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,959
I... I was...

360
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,940
[Jia San]

361
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,479
Pick up, pick up.

362
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,838
Hello, Mr. Jia.

363
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,198
Mr. Yan.

364
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:10,959
It's me.

365
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,880
Come over now.

366
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:14,920
Now?

367
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,759
Let's go.

368
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,599
To where?

369
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,719
To find the person behind Jia San.

370
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,078
Here you are. Come again.

371
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,599
Thank you.

372
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,439
Take care.

373
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,718
How could I have feelings for someone else?

374
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,880
In this world,
I only have feelings for one girl.

375
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,119
Cheesy lines.

376
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,438
I'm not listening. I'm not.

377
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,680
Then I'll stop.

378
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,800
But you know what I'm talking about.

379
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,519
Well, I don't have many left here.

380
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,039
Sit there and have a rest.

381
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,958
No, there are too many mosquitoes.

382
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,239
I have to drive them away.

383
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,040
He didn't take a rest at all this whole night.

384
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,438
Tiantian, after we sell them all,

385
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,040
wanna go for a walk with me?

386
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,639
No.

387
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't be fooled by the Drawbridge Effect.

388
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,399
I'm not going. I got tired.

389
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,000
Why hasn't Meinan come back?

390
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,319
Grapes! Come and have a look!

391
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,078
Mr... Mr. Zhou.

392
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,318
Meinan, we know each other well.

393
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,719
Just call me Zhou.

394
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,199
Zhou.

395
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,760
You haven't floated enough?

396
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,599
Sorry, I'm a bit of a talker.

397
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,559
Enjoy it, then.

398
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,639
I'm going to check on Tiantian,

399
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,478
and see if she needs any help.

400
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,318
No, no, no.

401
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,919
Don't go, don't go.

402
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,839
If you leave...

403
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,479
If you leave, I'll get lost.

404
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,520
Zhou, you mean that?

405
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:31,599
Of course. I won't be able to find the way.

406
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Yu Meinan.

407
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,639
Do you have any wishes? Write one on it.

408
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,319
Come on.

409
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,238
No, thanks.

410
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:39,838
Come on, write something.

411
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,560
Hold on.

412
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,318
I do have a wish.

413
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,400
Then hurry and write it down.

414
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,839
Next year,

415
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,160
I will never

416
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,000
spend Valentine's Day...

417
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,238
Spending Valentine's Day with men.

418
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,679
What bad luck!

419
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,559
Why are they two enjoying it?

420
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,718
Don't bring it up.

421
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,958
Why should I listen to you?

422
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,560
What? You're in charge?

423
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,958
I'm serious.

424
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,399
Never bring it up again.

425
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
Alright.

426
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,958
Are you sure this is the right place?

427
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,719
There should be no other possibility.

428
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,800
Why aren't they here yet?

429
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,400
Are you afraid?

430
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,879
Why would I be afraid?

431
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,800
People are afraid because of the unknown.

432
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,118
I know that sound. It's a nighthawk.

433
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,479
I don't need to be afraid.

434
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,959
But,
are you afraid of Boss Wang?

435
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,359
Honey.

436
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,399
We already know who they are.

437
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,519
Don't be afraid.

438
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,959
Don't call me...

439
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,199
Have you met him?

440
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,400
So have you.

441
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,478
Boss Wang.

442
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,400
If we close this deal,
won't you treat us to a big dinner?

443
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,958
We're a decent restaurant.

444
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,078
We don't have what you asked for.

445
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,560
He's having chicken.

446
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,439
Excuse me.

447
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:55,359
Sorry, enjoy yourselves.

448
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,198
You have sharp eyes.

449
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,198
You don't look like a restaurant owner.

450
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,999
You must be kidding, Mr. Wang.

451
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,759
I can't see anything else,

452
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,959
but I can tell the way you serve food.

453
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,959
I'm not supposed to do business with strangers.

454
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,318
Mr. Wang, we're all born strangers.

455
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,879
We shall understand one another by and by.

456
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,519
Our family is doing a big business.

457
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,880
You'll be our only supplier.

458
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:32,118
Your restaurant is called Swan Restaurant,
isn't it?

459
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,040
Yes.

460
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,319
Check it online.

461
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,239
It's fine.

462
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,958
Mr. Wang doesn't seem to trust us.

463
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:57,999
That's not a fun way to do business.

464
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,799
Ms. Hua,
you just mentioned that we will stay in business.

465
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,279
So, we should make a good start.

466
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,958
At this hour,
your restaurant should still be open.

467
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,359
Of course.

468
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,079
Please go ahead.

469
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,560
Swan Restaurant?

470
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,399
I'm a friend of your boss's.

471
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,559
But I couldn't reach him for something urgent.

472
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,078
Is he in right now?

473
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,318
If he is, please get him for me.

474
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,639
No, our boss is out to buy stock.

475
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,438
May I have your name? I'll let him know.

476
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:34,559
How about you text me his phone number?

477
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,879
I'll call him.

478
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,519
No, this won't do.

479
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,198
This is our boss's private information.

480
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,799
It's inconvenient to tell you.

481
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,999
I'm Mr. Yan's good friend.

482
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,159
I was there when your
boss and his wife got married.

483
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,359
His wife's surnamed Hua, right?

484
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,760
Well...

485
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,879
You go first, and I'll catch up.

486
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,318
You can catch up?

487
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,879
I... I... I... I can stall
for some more time.

488
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,198
You run to notify Officer Wang.

489
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,640
Do you hear me?

490
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,919
I can't get away.

491
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,198
Then what to do? It's too late.

492
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,759
I'm calling Officer Wang now.

493
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,400
See how long we can hold out in the corner.

494
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Calm down.

495
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,119
We can make the best out of the corner.

496
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,799
Fine, then.

497
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Take a note.

498
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,560
137-106 -86958.

499
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,639
Why is the phone number the same...

500
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,839
So you've known my phone number by heart.

501
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,680
Mr. Yan.

502
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:55,198
The goods are not cheap.

503
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:57,679
If it weren't for a restaurant as big as yours,

504
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,358
it'd be too many to take in.

505
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,160
Mr. Wang, that's funny.

506
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,439
My wife said

507
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,478
as long as we get the goods this time,

508
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,238
money won't be an issue.

509
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:12,718
How about we pay you
and pick up the goods tomorrow?

510
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,560
There's no hurry.

511
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,519
You must be tired from the long journey.

512
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,039
Take an early rest. Tomorrow morning,
I'll call you

513
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,560
and let you know the location.

514
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,718
How could the call...

515
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:47,238
Have everything arranged.

516
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,839
You taught me that, didn't you?

517
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,719
Glorious!

518
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,520
What?

519
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:12,839
So pretty.

520
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,838
He hasn't sat down all night
and still has the mood for fireworks?

521
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,520
Why didn't he take a rest?

522
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,079
Why... Why don't you watch it?

523
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,199
There's nothing to see.

524
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,438
No.

525
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:27,639
I hear the fireworks are of the latest design.

526
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,799
That design was inspired by, em...

527
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,519
No way. We don't have money for that.

528
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,118
Who told you it's the latest design?

529
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,919
This is false advertising.

530
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,318
You can go to the
mini-program and report them.

531
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,238
No.

532
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,118
Make way. Step aside.

533
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,280
You're getting in the way.

534
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:45,880
Let me help you.

535
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,879
No need. You can go.

536
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,159
How could she get angry over fireworks?

537
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,760
Doesn't she like it?

538
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,639
Tiantian, I have a car.

539
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,118
Let me give you a ride. It's on my way.

540
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,759
You don't like a hard bench but a fancy car?

541
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,159
Then drive home by yourself.

542
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,399
What hard bench?

543
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,639
My car isn't a fancy one this time.

544
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,039
Oh, really? I don't buy it.

545
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,280
It really isn't. Look for yourself.

546
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,079
Do you think

547
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,839
we should tell Officer Wang?

548
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,358
We don't know the location yet.

549
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,319
Let's tell him tomorrow.

550
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,160
We can go by ourselves first.

551
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,479
What?

552
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,439
Scared?

553
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,159
Are you kidding?

554
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,078
I've been through all sorts of things.

555
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,078
This is nothing to me.

556
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:58,159
But if something happens to you,

557
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,999
your fans will tear me to pieces.

558
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,999
I can't afford to take on the responsibility.

559
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,560
You want to take responsibility for me?

560
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:09,119
What did you say?
I'm talking about something serious.

561
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,319
So am I.

562
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,800
You don't have to take responsibility for me,

563
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
but I have to do that for you.

564
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,680
I...

565
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,119
I have to make sure you're safe.

566
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,078
If they get suspicious,

567
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,279
I'll go by myself. You can wait for my news.

568
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,000
No!

569
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,078
You said it, too.

570
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,759
Those people are criminals.

571
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,199
They're capable of doing anything.

572
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,520
Rescue the surviving birds,

573
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,078
and bring Boss Wang, Jia San to justice.

574
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,760
Aren't these what you want to do?

575
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,198
But you can't do them alone.

576
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,000
As long as it's what you want to do,

577
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,319
I will do it for you.

578
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,119
They've got the birds.

579
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,439
I can see how worried you are.

580
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,680
If one of us has to take the risk,

581
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,680
I wish it to be me.

582
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,198
Professor Zhuang, this is my territory.

583
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,358
I don't need to listen to whatever you say.

584
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,119
I dare not.

585
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,959
I'm just giving a suggestion for Ms. Hua.

586
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,880
That's more like it.

587
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,559
After all, you gave me my surname.

588
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,719
Yan, should mean obedient.

589
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,039
I think you should have the surname Hua.

590
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,719
It also means blandishment.

591
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,078
This hotel looks a bit
different from yesterday.

592
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:01,958
Really?

593
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,639
Yeah, this light board was unlit last night.

594
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,919
And this door.

595
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,920
When the wind blows, it crackles.

596
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,239
Have a try.

597
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,920
What do you mean?

598
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,439
Why is there no sound anymore?

599
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:30,919
Weird. I heard that yesterday.

600
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,879
Was I hallucinating?

601
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,159
It's the same hotel.

602
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,479
It's just that you've changed your perspective.

603
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,838
Was it because of the blackout

604
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,760
that it got a spooky atmosphere?

605
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,959
Hey, what's wrong?

606
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,520
Wait a minute.

607
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:50,919
It's a short circuit again.

608
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,680
Is it spooky now?

609
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,880
It doesn't seem so spooky anymore.

610
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,959
In fact, it has never changed.

611
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:07,920
Why not change a perspective

612
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,039
and give it another chance?

613
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,879
What... do you mean?

614
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,838
We won't be living here for long.

615
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,800
What are you talking about?

616
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,319
Happy Valentine's Day.

617
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,999
Don't pick wildflowers by the roadside.

618
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,239
No one ever told you that?

619
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,079
Don't worry! I found them on the street!

620
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,118
Poser didn't pick up the flowers,

621
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,439
but his silver tongue, right?

622
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,160
Dried flower.

623
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,760
So he was already prepared.

624
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,140
[Yu Meiren]

625
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,540
[Love in the dark]

626
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,120
Good night.

627
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,039
Look, I said it would fit perfectly.

628
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,800
How is it? My car isn't bad, huh?

629
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,919
Your car

630
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,360
isn't fancy at all.

631
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,319
You know I'm right.

632
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,958
But it's Chinese Valentine's Day.

633
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:47,600
Look.

634
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,280
The cowboy Niulang

635
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,840
and Fairy Zhinv, aren't they made for the scene?

636
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:58,119
Look at the glitters and veils.

637
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,158
Which girl gave you this idea?

638
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,039
What girl?

639
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,199
I designed it by myself.

640
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,799
This car is tacky.

641
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,000
Well...

642
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,999
Of course, it doesn't exactly represent my taste.

643
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,678
It's mainly to adapt to local conditions.

644
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,839
If it hadn't gotten stuck in the mud the other day,

645
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,559
how would I, Jin Xi the omnipotent man,
be reduced to this?

646
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,279
This oxcart looks pretty cool.

647
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,119
But this cushion is so hard.

648
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,718
How could a privileged man like him stand it?

649
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:34,119
Better go home in his fancy car.

650
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,839
I'm glad you're happy.

651
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,359
I'll move these things myself.

652
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,759
No, don't leave.

653
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,559
I did all this just for you.

654
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,879
If you don't like it,
I'm having them removed.

655
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,158
Where's your fancy car?

656
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,438
It broke down.

657
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,839
Or I wouldn't have done this.

658
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,238
The oxcart is shabby,

659
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,000
but it's a good tool to bring us close.

660
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Fine. Get in.

661
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,280
Tiantian! Tiantian!

662
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,079
Why? Why was I hotheaded
and designed this oxcart?

663
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,280
Has it brought us closer?

664
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,760
And why this tricycle doesn't have electricity?

665
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,639
Make way.

666
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,080
Even she's walking faster than us.

667
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,599
Meinan, don't you have a car?

668
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,279
Why are you suffering here with us?

669
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,799
Well, Miss Tiantian came here in my car.

670
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,839
Grandma Li gave her to me.

671
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,799
I'm gonna get her home safely.

672
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,319
Give her to you? That's a misnomer.

673
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,638
It's a wrong expression.

674
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:57,719
What? Wrong?

675
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,718
I'm doing it right.

676
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,678
Relax, my body is strong.

677
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,638
It's no problem.

678
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,439
Or I wouldn't have lost him.

679
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,719
Lost him? What do you mean?

680
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:10,678
I wanted to take him to see the fireworks.

681
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,280
Yeah, yeah.

682
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:12,119
By the way, what do you think?

683
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,039
Do you guys like the fireworks?

684
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,839
President Jin specially asked me...

685
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,198
Asked Zhou to check

686
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,000
the fireworks' schedule.

687
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,279
- Right.
- Oh, really?

688
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,040
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,918
It's the same old routine.

690
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:28,039
No, I just like fireworks.

691
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,279
And I like to see them with you.

692
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,759
What are you chatting about?

693
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,079
I didn't hear you back there.

694
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,398
I'll stand here.

695
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,398
No, no, hold on.

696
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,438
If you stand here,
we won't be able to move this cart.

697
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,799
You have to go back there.

698
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,438
Relax.

699
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,319
These days,

700
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,319
I've been having a good time at Tiantian's place.

701
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,559
And I ate plenty of food.

702
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,158
I've built muscles. Let's push.

703
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,239
This won't do.

704
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,320
No.

705
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:54,279
Even if you have muscles,
you have to lose some weight.

706
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,600
Right?

707
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:57,239
Now girls pay attention to body management.

708
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,760
- Do they?
- Of course.

709
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,999
Tiantian, what kind of guys do you like?

710
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,080
Quiet ones.

711
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,000
OK, I'm home. See you.

712
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
Well...

713
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,320
OK.

714
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,360
Push.

715
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,600
What? I'm busy now.

716
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,638
What's important?

717
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,079
What I'm doing now is the most important.

718
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,959
Nothing is as important as this, you know?

719
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,079
That's what I pay you for.

720
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,679
Solve it by yourself. Bye.

721
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,159
Grandma.

722
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,398
Grandma. Grandma.

723
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,360
I thought you'd be back by now.

724
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:43,839
Why are you so happy?

725
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,479
Look at your radiant face.

726
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,239
I've sold all the grapes. Of course I'm happy.

727
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:48,719
That's true.

728
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,800
Grandma.

729
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:54,398
When did you fix this roof?

730
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:57,560
Jin fixed it the other day with Zhou.

731
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,199
Jin Xi?

732
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,799
He knows how to fix this?

733
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,279
He's really nice to you.

734
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,999
But you always give him cold shoulder.

735
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,198
I didn't even have a chance
to help with the cooking that day.

736
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,238
He found our roof was drafty,
without another word,

737
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,839
he replaced the old tiles with Zhou.

738
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,120
Now it's as good as new.

00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,140
Mr. Zhuang, you have to fix the light board outside.
