This large world is full of miracles.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,838
When fruits from big-leaf
Mahogany fall to the ground,

27
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,719
the sound is large enough
that you might be intimidated.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,918
Other than that,
there are plenty of mysteries

29
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,079
left unsolved in the wild nature.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,799
There are sounds that
you've never heard of.

That's impressive!

Keep going.

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,838
These lipsticks are from Heshi.

37
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:18,398
Many bloggers yearn
to promote for them.

38
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,838

39

You've become one of their brand friends.

40

Only superstars get that title.

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,160
You have no idea how
President Jin praised you today.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,439
Self-centered as he is,

43
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,558
he must be bragging about his resources.

44
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,359
You know him well!

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,038
He keeps boasting about himself.

46
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,319
What about me?

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,039
I've been working so hard on this cooperation.

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,879
- What a shame!
- Right?

49
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,039
He could have taken the chance
to stimulate the employees.

50
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,359
I'm talking about the lipsticks.

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,799
Brick orange.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,959
Rosy red.

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,678
Hot pink, and iridescent black.

54
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,880
None of them is for Asians.

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,478
Your skin is bright enough.

56
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,999
Still, the color looks pale.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,678
It would look terrible on me,
with warm dark skin.

58
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:11,038
I've tried other moisturizing lipsticks.

59
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,880
This one doesn't have enough radiance.

60
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,360
And it's hard to wipe them off.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,999
With similar poor quality,
this one is much cheaper.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,039
The price of this one is
only one-eighth of Heshi's.

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,399
Take a look.

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,758
Anyway, Heshi is a super big brand.

65
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,519
That's why it stands out.

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,319
It costs a few bucks for
the amount you just applied.

67
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,439
Lipsticks are made of wax, oil, preservatives,

68
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,879
fragrances, and pigments.

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,319
The major difference is the pigments.

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,638
If the color is not right,

71
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,439
there's no reason to promote it at all.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,398
But the package looks fancy.

73
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:58,239
Paying a few thousands
only for the package?

It's by gene distance.

175

The recombination frequency

176
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,798
is positively correlated to the distance.

177
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,879
The closer the two genes are,

178
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,559
the less likely the recombination occurs.

179
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,000
Thus, the frequency is lower.

180
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,238
This one looks good on you.

181
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:31,919
Sure!

182
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,320
Meiren is born for this.

183
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,918
You are undoubtedly our most treasured KOL.

184
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,279
Coming early with your makeup ready.

185
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,679
Saved our money for a makeup artist.

186
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,598
I'm flattered, President Yuan.

187
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,079
My warm and dark skin doesn't look good.

188
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,678
I've been practicing for a long time.

189
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,118
It's faster if I do it myself.

190
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,079
Too modest of you.

191
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,959
You're a born beauty.

192
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,760
Thanks.

193
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:53,918
If it wasn't for Shaye's product,

194
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,199
good looks would be monopolized.

195
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,319
But now,
even normal people like me can pursue a good look.

196
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,479
Right on!

197
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
I want that line in our script.

198
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,400
One last question.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,880
Professor Zhuang, I have a question.

200
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:19,199
If I find a strange fruit
I've never seen it before,

201
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,359
how do I know if
it's edible or not?

202
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,559
I'd have someone else try it out.

203
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,519
That's a good answer!

204
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,679
Professor Zhuang,

205
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,639
I want to study botany with you as a graduate.

206
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,399
Are there any good-looking flowers

207
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,319
that you study other than artemisia annua?

208
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,799
I want to learn to grow flowers with you.

209
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,598
Growing flowers?

210
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,039
Is she serious?

211
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,358
She must be here to audit the class.

212
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,640
Sure!

213
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,199
Guys.

214
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,440
Why did you pick up botany?

215
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,400
A lower enrollment requirement? Got switched?

216
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,479
Love eating fruits?

217
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,159
Enjoy flowers?

218
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,679
Last year,

219
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,759
450,000 people die from Malaria.

220
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,400
300,000 of them were children.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,839
There are over 3 billion
people under the risk of Malaria.

222
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,039
Generations of hard work
wipe out the disease in China.

223
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,239
But to the vast population worldwide,

224
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,719
we can't and won't stand by.

225
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,358
Artemisinin, the miracle Malaria drug,

226
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,239
is still in short supply.

227
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,079
I'm working my best
to boost up the content

228
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,280
for a few decimal points.

229
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,520
Maybe,
it could be enough to save hundreds of children.

230
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,200
It's not an easy job.

231
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:53,960
It's for aesthetics alone.

232
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,238
Think before you choose your career.

233
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,359
Yes, boss.

234
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,760
We'll have a quiz in the next class.

235
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,199
Hand in your homework by 8 tomorrow morning.

236
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,718
Yes, sir.

237
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,479
Ni Ke, I want to see your homework in person.

238
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,159
Come on.

239
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,199
We would like to stress that

240
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,999
this lipstick can make girls
more attractive to men.

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,158
The plot goes on like this.

242
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,079
Try to talk to a handsome man without it.

243
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,118
He'd be reserved.

244
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,519
Then, you put it on.

245
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,158
Attractive as you are,
he finally smiles.

246
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,038
To make it look natural,

247
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,200
the shot will be taken from our candid camera.

248
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,319
President Yuan.

249
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,439
I thought you chose this
location for the pastoral scenery.

250
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,080
It turns out to be a plot.

251
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:49,999
But I like it.

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,999
Simple and catchy.

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,400
It suits me.

254
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,359
Glad you like it.

255
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,000
Where is Lucas?

256
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,959
Excuse me, Meiren.

257
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
I'll pick him up at the gate.

258
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,038
Fang.

259
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,880
I think we could add a scene here.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,038
Boss, that's too modest of you.

261
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,279
Do you have any secrets about the experiment?

262
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,640
Please teach me.

263
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,799
Practice peeling.

264
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,719
I get it!

265
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,558
I'll go to the lab and practice mounting,
PCR,

266
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,519
electrophoresis, and TLC.

267
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,280
Come on.

268
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:31,798
Stop bothering boss.

269
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,639
You're right! It's the critical
moment of acclimatization.

270
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,280
- Goodbye!
- We're leaving.

271
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,238
Meiren.

272
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,999
Here is the outfit design.

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,678
Lucas will show up this suit.

274
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,839
President Lu said that he was new to this job.

275
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,718
She wants you to demonstrate it for him.

276
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,440
Sure, I got this.

277
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,598
Is Lucas here?

278
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,400
That's the same suit from the photo.

279
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,840
He looks cute.

280
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,080
Shall we start now?

281
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,158
The light is great.

282
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,079
The top light will be too strong at noon.

283
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,880
Sure.

284
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,559
I'm going in.

285
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,799
This way.

286
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,798
Hi. Handsome.

287
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,918
Excuse me.

288
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,280
Do you know the way?

289
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,280
Why don't you ask me what way it is?

290
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,479
This is not your way.

291
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,999
Please show me the way to your heart.

292
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Have I arrived?

293
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,479
Remember to call me!
[Cuihu Apartment]

294
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,479
Stay right here. I'll take a look.

295
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:11,598
Sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

296
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,879
It's my fault.

297
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
We're shooting a video here.

298
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,560
- I'll clean it up.
- Get out.

299
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,039
It's alright. Just stay outside.

300
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,839
We'll clean it up.

301
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,198
I didn't touch the shelf.

302
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,199
It went down on itself.

303
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,520
I will pay for your loss.

304
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,318
Are you available?

305
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,039
I want to invite you to lunch.

306
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,358
You like steamed buns, right?

307
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,560
I remember back in school...

308
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,599
Do I know you?

309
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,920
Finding a way, huh?

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,639
Think before you ask!

311
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,920
Are you smart enough to ask for directions?

312
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,999
You're in a school.

313
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,959
Idiots are not welcome here.

314
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,560
I'm sorry.

315
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,879
How is it? Is there any hope?

316
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,238
It's contaminated.

317
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,959
The measure will be affected for sure.

318
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,318
Our department wants to increase the income.

319
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,478
That's why we allow the crew in.

320
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,680
We didn't expect...

321
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,718
How do you find the plan today?

322
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,799
It's perfect!

323
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,159
Thanks, President Yuan.

324
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,519
You've worked hard.

325
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,399
Looking forward to the next cooperation.

326
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,160
Sure.

327
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,920
I will go to Meiren for sure.

328
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,640
Apart from the accident,
the shooting went on well.

329
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,358
We must say sorry for the inconvenience.

330
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,119
It's not your fault.

331
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,719
It's our mistake.

332
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,799
President Yuan,
the man in the greenhouse, is he a teacher?

333
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,679
I reckon so.

334
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,958
I've talked to the school.

335
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,438
We made a deal before
shooting on their campus.

336
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:46,159
The manager said no need to worry.

337
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,318
That's a relief.

338
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,318
I'm sorry, President Yuan.

339
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,358
I hope it didn't cause
you too much trouble.

340
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,198
Not at all.

341
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,879
The footage would look great for sure.

342
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,160
Don't worry.

343
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,000
See you at the product launch next week.

344
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,640
- Bye.
- Bye.

345
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,319
President Jin?

346
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,680
Fang, you may leave.

347
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,839
Not again.

348
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,159
Who are you?

349
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,318
Well, Lili, I must confess.

350
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,039
She... she is my...

351
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,839
Mom.

352
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,839
Jin Xi is my son.

353
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,838
I marry to your dad at such a young age.

354
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,078
Can't you tell me what I want?

355
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,559
Security! That's all!

356
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,958
What about now?

357
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:04,958
Your dad is always fooling around outside.

358
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:08,000
And you, my step-son,
keep making troubles.

359
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,559
Don't give me that look.

360
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,958
Don't you remember that engagement

361
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,199
with President Wang's daughter two months ago?

362
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,598
How could you do this?

363
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,759
What should your dad do?

364
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,439
What about our contract with their company?

365
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,718
I'm terribly sorry.

366
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,598
It's my son's fault.

367
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,119
He fails you.

368
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:33,759
To be honest,
I wouldn't be bothered at all

369
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,118
by his girlfriends months ago.

370
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,119
But now he's engaged.

371
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,799
Stop standing there.

372
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Apologize to her.

373
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,838
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:45,959
Lower!

375
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,519
Miss.

376
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,598
He's made an apology.

377
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,359
I will teach him a lesson!

378
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,359
How about...

379
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,760
Jin Xi! This is not over!

380
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,520
She's gone.

381
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,839
Dear son, you're welcome.

382
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:21,680
Are you smart enough
to ask for directions?

383
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,599
What's wrong? You look depressed.

384
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Your phone.

385
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
[Mom]

386
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,639
Hello? I know you're busy.

387
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,759
But you still have a life schedule!

388
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,639
Do you remember Wang Xiumei's daughter?

389
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,479
She was your classmate in elementary school.

390
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,718
Her baby will soon be one-month-old.

391
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:53,999
Her second daughter!

392
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,479
Look at you.

393
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,358
You are at the golden stage of mate selection.

394
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,078
Go find a boyfriend and get married.

395
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,519
Where did you learn that phrase?

396
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,198
Stop wasting your time
on the love experts' articles.

397
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,238
Stop exaggerating it!

398
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,919
Think independently, please.

399
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,399
Alright, fine. I'll skip it.

400
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,719
Still, be sure to attend the blind date.

401
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,199
What do you think of the guy I just sent you?

402
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,800
I'll take a look.

403
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,999
Mom, I hate No. 335!

404
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,198
This photo is taken by his girlfriend!

405
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,559
Attending blind dates after having a partner?

406
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,399
Unreliable!

407
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,598
You didn't even meet him.

408
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,399
The first impression doesn't count.

409
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,078
But he is unreliable!

410
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,879
Don't tell me it's by his parents.

411
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,399
No parents would take photos like this.

412
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,079
I see love and tenderness in his eyes.

413
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,279
What if it's by his friends?

414
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,118
- Or colleagues?
- That's right.

415
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,958
Then he must have a crush on her.

416
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:49,640
Alright.

417
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:51,198
You don't like this one.

418
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:53,118
I'll get another one for you.

419
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,438
No, no, no. Stop it.

420
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:57,078
What do you mean?

421
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,358
You're out there on your own.

422
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,598
You need someone to take care of you.

423
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,519
Or, I'd be worried.

424
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,920
Don't be.

425
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,198
Why are you looking at me?

426
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,680
Don't worry. I have a boyfriend.

427
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,119
What?

428
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,759
Who is it? When is that?

429
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,399
What does he do?

430
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,159
A while ago.

431
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,399
He's a colleague.

432
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,280
Colleague?

433
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,039
Sister.

434
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,318
The off-season is approaching.

435
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,238
We'll pay you a visit in Shanghai,

436
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,318
and take a look at my brother-in-law.

437
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,399
What? Seriously?

438
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,760
Are you sure about coming?

439
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,279
Mei,
we didn't check on you after your graduation.

440
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,718
Do you still live by your school?

441
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,318
Come on.

442
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,318
You should have told us about it earlier!

443
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,358
Why are you hiding it from us?

444
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,838
Alright, got to go.

445
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,838
That's a deal.

446
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,119
Hello? Hello?

447
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,799

448
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,479
No, my stepmom.

449
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,399
Finally,
the time has come where I save your life.

450

453
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,118
Don't think too much. You don't deserve it.

454
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,280
Seriously?

455
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,838
Fang,
find me an apartment near my school.

456
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,400

457
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,478
My treat.

458
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,800
Do I deserve it now?

459
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,280

You're so great, Mei!

466

With just a strike,
you've won such a great man, huh?

467
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,119
You went to the same high school
with Zhuang Yu, right?

468
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,838
Is that when you have a crush on him?

469
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,159
No way!

470
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,760

472
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,759

549
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,849
♫ There you stand, staring at the rainbow ♫

550
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,149
♫ In my eyes, there is no other scenery ♫

551
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,899
♫ more beautiful than you looking back at me ♫

552
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,749
♫ The wind is breezing after the rain ♫

553
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,449
♫ There I stand, touched by your appearance ♫

554
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:53,449
♫ Your eyes look pure and clean ♫

555
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:58,050
♫ How I wish I could stop the time ♫

556
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:15,398
You didn't even give a like to my post.

557
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:17,079
I was packaging the grapes.

558
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,519
Too busy to check my phone.

559
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,279
I'll like it now.

560
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,319
That's not enough.

561
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,559
You must like all my posts this month.

562
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,199
Alright, I get it.

563
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,520
By the way,

564
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,319
answer me.

565
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,600
Do you want some grapes from my hometown?

566
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,399
Not at all.

567
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,919
One more time.

568
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,320
Are you sure about that?

569
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,438
Not very much.

570
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:41,839
The plan was that I deliver it to you in person.

571
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,279
Now that you don't want it,
I'll go home.

572
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,760
Li Tiantian, are you here in Shanghai...

573
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,759
Tiantian!

574
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,478
It is you!

575
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:57,599
Alright, enough.

576
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,399
Take the grapes. They are heavy!

577
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,120
Come on in.

578
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,799
I know you miss me.

579
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,718
But with your poor hearing,
can you handle the journey?

580
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,559
Where's your hearing aid?

581
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,839
Don't flatter yourself.

582
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,359
I'm here to get my hearing aid fixed.

583
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,040
I drop by your house and bring you some grapes.

584
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,678
Before I could get it fixed,
my umbrella is broken.

585
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,799
Luckily, I lent the broken umbrella

586
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,559
to a middle-aged man who didn't have one.

587
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,478
The garbage sorting here
is giving me a headache.

588
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,599
What about your hearing aid?

589
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,399
I lost it.

590
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,438
Lost it? How could do without it?

591
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,678
I'll buy you a new one.

592
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,559
No need for that.

593
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,079
I was wearing it to
filter out the noise.

594
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,759
Besides, unlike here,

595
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,439
Qingshui Village is a place without much noise.
I can live without it.

596
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,198
If my parents knew I
was wasting my time here,

597
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,158
they would be furious.

598
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,678
You're living in a villa!

599
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,718
Wasting life doesn't get you there.

600
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,319
In their mind, only teachers,
doctors, and civil officers

601
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,878
are the ones with decent jobs.

602
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:13,599
By the way,
I told them that I have a boyfriend.

603
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,959
Cover it up for me.

604
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,878
Are you seeing someone?

605
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,040
Not at all.

606
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:23,918
Can't believe you're carrying an old photo!

607
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:28,958
Is he the cute boy
who cursed you with the name of a tree?

608
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,360
What was the name?

609
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:33,599
Sabina.

610
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,000
He's just a turtledove.

611
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,000
What does that mean?

612
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,438
Do you know the turtledoves' nests?

613
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,718
It's shabby and empty.

614
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:49,878
If you ask me,
that's deep hate from sincere love.

615
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:51,599
What's going on?

616
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,839
Is the old affair rekindled?

617
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,639
You know, one cannot avoid one's enemy.

618
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,439
I thought he ended
up as an actor.

619
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,040
He didn't recognize me.

620
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:07,559
The charming Ph.D. in ornithology,

621
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,199
and the reserved botany professor.

622
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,599
What a lovely match!

623
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,360
I'll back you up!

624
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,799
Stop it.

625
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,519
He studies grass.

626
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,799
Sounds like I'm feeding on him.

627
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,560
I don't like that.

628
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:26,478
Be honest,
do you still have a crush on him?

629
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,639
No way!

630
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,678
He's too arrogant!

631
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:33,398
He always judges others.

632
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:35,559
Why would I like him?

633
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,080
I must prove that he's the real idiot.

634
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,438
You don't mean it, do you?

635
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,918
You still like him!

636
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,039
Tiantian, you've seen many shows.

637
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,280
Help me out with it.

638
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:53,359
The most common plot is to
pay him back in his own coin.

639
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,399
Explain it.

640
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,559
He despises fools, right?

641
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,079
Have him fall in love with a fool then.

642
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,599
Don't tell him about your Ph.D. degree.

643
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,639
Just go after him as you are.

644
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,239
Are you saying that...

645
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:11,638
I should act superficial
and go after him.

646
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,520
Then...

647
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,559
Cliche, but practical!

648
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,478
Tiantian, your mind is full of ideas
from those dramas.

649
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:22,478
I'm afraid that's not what I meant.

650
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:28,040
By dating him,
I'd be free from my parents' urge.

651
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,559
Killing two birds with one stone.

652
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,638
Well, let's work out a plan.

653
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,080
My computer.

654
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:47,918
I need to catch the
bus tomorrow morning.

655
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,599
I couldn't help you with your moving.

656
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,638
No problem.

657
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,239
Keep in touch!

658
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:55,080
I must have him love me.

659
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,360
Go for it!
[Cuihu Apartment]

660
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,520
This way.

661
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,678
Put the box in the lift.

662
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,360
Sure.

663
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,479
- Be careful.
- I'm sorry.

664
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,958
Professor Zhuang, here I am.

665
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:29,120
For our happy future days as neighbors.

666
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,760
Have you got the results
with the artemisia annua?

667
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:40,279
I've tried my best to
remove the interference.

668
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,159
The results aren't satisfying.

669
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,438
If you ask me,
the equipment here should be updated.

670
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:47,799
If we have the new equipment,

671
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,439
we could easily rule out the interference.

672
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:53,158
By the way, it almost slipped my mind.

673
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,719
The shelf fell down again.

674
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,360
Don't worry.

675
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:58,438
I've had it fixed.

676
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:01,638
That's to say,
the shelf is broken on itself.

677
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,199
It has nothing to do with that girl.

678
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,439
Are you a mermaid?

679
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,039
Is there any candid camera here?

680
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,599
No. We'll be neighbors.

681
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,759
The grapes are from my hometown.

682
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,999
Please have a try.

683
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,399
Thank you!

684
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:41,399
A girl as polite as you
are is one of a kind.

685
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,999
I have a nephew,
he's about your age.

686
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,839
Are you interested...

687
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,999
Thanks, but no.

688
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,079
Granny, I have a boyfriend.

689
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,120
Thank you.

690
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,999
This balcony looks decent.

691
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,639
The owner must have a taste.

692
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,280
Why are you here?

693
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,280
I live here.

694
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,600
It looks shabby now.

695
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,678
Professor Zhuang, it must be destiny

696
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,279
that brings us together.

697
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,158
Let me introduce myself.

698
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,439
I'm Yu Meiren.

699
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:35,799
Sorry for the last time.

700
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,438
I get some fresh grapes for you.

701
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,800
Please take it.

702
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:46,080
Having no manners at all.
Just like the old days.

703
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,560
Professor Zhuang, please wait.

704
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,639
Professor Zhuang.

705
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:58,320
Wait for me.

706
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,600
This is a private apartment.

707
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,120
I know. I live here.

708
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:11,119
Room 202.

709
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,879
What a coincidence!

710
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,040
Do you live here, too?

711
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:18,320
Yu, is that your boyfriend?

712
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,919
Aunt.

713
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,800
He's shy.

714
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:27,760
Good for you.

715
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:32,079
See? I tell no lie.

716
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,198
I do live here.

717
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,678
It's a courtesy to all my neighbors.

718
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,879
Just take it.

719
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,158
Don't bother. We've met before.

720
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:48,918
It's said that don't turn down
well-meaning offerings.

721
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:51,958
We're neighbors.

722
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,360
Would you...

723
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,638
Sorry, I know it was abrupt.

724
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,919
Sorry about that.

725
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:05,760
I'll leave the grapes here.

726
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,239
I'm leaving.

727
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,359
Five, four, three, two...

728
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,199
Wait.

729
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,899

Alright!

737
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:55,120
What is this book about?

738
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,280
Well, it's about...

739
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,519
Who's that long face?

740
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,478
That's Straight-A Zhuang!

741
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:02,918
He won gold at Math Olympiad!

742
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:04,478
Straight-A Zhuang?

743
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:05,599
Zhuang Yu!

744
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,560
He's not only intelligent
but handsome.

745
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,958
He skips all the exams.

746
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:15,158
And I lost the no.1 rank to him!

747
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:18,119
Why doesn't he skip this autumn tour, too?

748
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,319
Straight-A Zhuang?

749
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,599
I don't buy that! He could be a fake.

750
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,279
He didn't take the rank from you.

751
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,279
It's a special treatment from the school.

752
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,478
That way, Straight-A Zhuang could devote himself

753
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:27,759
to Math Olympiad.

754
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,198
He gets to skip all the exams.

757
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,718
I wouldn't have lost it
to that unearned student.

758
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:40,279
But he's a real talent.

759
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,519
