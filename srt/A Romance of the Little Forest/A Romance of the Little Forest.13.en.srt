00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,360
Way back in five years ago,

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,238
I didn't even pant after I reached the mountain top.

26
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,120
Why am I getting heat stroke so easily now?

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,959
Otherwise how could my face be so hot?

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
It's hot.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,159
It's really hot.

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,959
I could hardly tell.

31
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,480
Reached the mountain top?

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,080
Impressive.

33
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,559
Are you in a hurry to prove yourself?

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,639
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,639
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,600
Checking on whether you've swallowed water.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
But you look radiant.

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,039
I... I'm fine.

39
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,119
Oh, right.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,079
The alert is over.

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,240
You don't have to pretend that hard.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Also, about that post on Moments,
thanks for that.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,439
You didn't set permissions,

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360

delete that picture.

It's fine.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't browse on Moments.

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,638
Besides,
I didn't take what just happened to heart.

I won't take it seriously.

54
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,558
And you won't tell anyone about it, right?

55
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,080
Don't mention it.

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,880
It was nothing.

Eh, right.

Uncoordinated? What do you mean?

bear that thing in mind.

I understand that you've been busy with your career,

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,159

Except for the ones we know about.

scallions, and raw ginger.

I guess that's not

157
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,679
what she wanted.

158
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,279
You got to be kidding me.

159
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,880
How can we modern
women be trapped by love?

160
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,359
Clear my mind and eliminate all distractions.

only cluster in the epidermis of leaf veins

167
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,000
and do not endanger the branches.

168
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,840
It's Aegeriidae.

there wouldn't be moths.

Don't worry about it.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,798
Though we're not allowed to use pesticides,

176
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,158
there are other solutions.

177
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,118
Can they be saved?

178
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,118
Of course.

179
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,080
He means what he says.

180
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,718
First,
remove such withered leaves,

181
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,879
then use fluorescent lights
and yellow vessels to lure and kill insects.

182
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,158
Those very sick plants behind your back

183
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,038
can be treated with fungal preparations

184
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,000
such as BT and bacillus albicans.

185
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,399
The grapes are now in the growing season.

186
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,879
You can also use
Bordeaux liquid to prevent

187
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,039
other grape vine diseases.

188
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,598
Aunt Chen.

189
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,478
It's all written here.

190
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,159
Thank you.

191
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,039
Aunt Chen.

192
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,919
There's actually another way.

193
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,798
You can put the newly emerged female adults

194
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,519
into a cage made of window screens,

195
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,919
and then place it on the edge of a basin filled with water

196
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,999
besides the grapes.

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,719
Many male adults will be induced every night.

198
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,558
I know this. A honey-trap.

199
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,199
Even heroes fall for beauties.

200
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,118
It's the same for bugs and people.

201
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,080
Professor Zhuang knows this method very well.

202
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,479
Professor Zhuang, are you all right?

203
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,399
This method has limited effect.

204
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,358
It's mainly dependent on biological treatment.

205
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,079
We'll continue the sampling today,

206
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,358
and see if there are other factors

207
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,119
that affect fruit setting.

208
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,478
I'll count on you then.

209
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,558
I was worried sick.

210
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,158
Thank you for all the timely solutions you gave me.

211
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,880
You're welcome.

212
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,400
Thank you, thank you.

213
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,200
Such a mature and calm man
like you even choked on water?

214
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,840
You were observant.

215
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,719
Why not behave like this when you study?

216
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,080
Snap.

217
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,239
Miss Meiren also said I had academic potential.

218
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,679
What's the big deal?

219
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,598
It's like moths.

220
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,079
It's predestined in the genes.

221
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,599
Nothing to be ashamed of.

222
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,158
Except for the theory of evolution,

223
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,119
try to read other articles.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,440
Humans are not just animals.

225
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,719
So you don't have any feelings for Miss Meiren?

226
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,039
That's not your concern.

227
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,799
Will Miss Meiren feel sad if
she learns about your attitude?

228
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,159
That's also not her concern.

229
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,359
Are you sure?

230
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,000
Come in.

231
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,879
So many flowers! How pretty!

232
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,039
President Jin, where did you get all these flowers?

233
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,759
Look around the office.

234
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,679
What else is different?

235
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,280
What is it exactly?

236
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,880
Follow me.

237
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,559
Check out the door.

238
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,599
It seems

239
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:15,880
heavier.

240
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,598
No way.

241
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,999
Is it that he thinks my work is too easy

242
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,718
so he wants to give me heavier work load?

243
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,559
Close the door.

244
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,039
Do you feel any change?

245
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,320
Put your ear to the wall.

246
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,358
It's like the world has gone quiet.

247
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:58,118
The higher the density of the door,

248
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,478
and the heavier and thicker it gets,

249
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,080
the better the sound insulation of the door.

250
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,598
I had people add acoustic
insulation in the wall overnight

251
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,678
to increase the absorption of sound waves.

252
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,319
It seems to be working pretty well.

253
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,079
President Jin, you are...

254
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,839
You didn't accept the hearing aid,

255
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,559
so I could only use this way
to reduce noise in your world.

256
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,279
There are always kind people.

257
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,400
I didn't expect a capitalist to be so benevolent.

258
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:27,718
President Jin.

259
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,359
I'm just one of your employees.

260
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,519
You really don't have to do this for me.

261
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,399
No.

262
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,279
Now is not a good time to profess my love.

263
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,640
I have to keep my cool.

264
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,959
It was nothing.

265
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,199
I have to create the most

266
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,598
comfortable working environment for my employees,

267
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,280
so that they can create the most value for me.

268
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,158
Well,
remember to take these flowers.

269
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,918
Consider it a thank-you gift

270
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,839
for the longan and date tea you gave me last time.

271
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,279
I can't take these.

272
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,199
I made that tea myself.

273
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,319
It didn't cost much.

274
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,158
But these look expensive. I won't take them.

275
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,039
You put efforts into making that, right?

276
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,158
Kind of.

277
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,880
And I put efforts into buying the flowers, right?

278
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,880
Who knows what's your real intention?

279
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,479
Yeah.

280
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,558
You can't look down upon them

281
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,798
just because I spent some money.

282
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,199
We both put our efforts.

283
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,439
Why should my gift be inferior to yours?

284
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,559
I don't mean I look down upon them.

285
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,038
As the saying goes,

286
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,000
the roses in her hand, the flavor in mine.

287
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,679
You can't...

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,599
You...

289
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:37,080
You can't deprive me of the
chance to return your favor.

290
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,279
You make sense.

291
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,359
I'll take them then, thanks.

292
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,239
Go ahead.

293
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,319
President Jin, I'll come back later for them.

294
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,279
I can't hold them all.

295
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,520
Sure, take your time.

296
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:02,640
What a silver tongue I have.

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,238
He bought flowers even though he's allergic?

298
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:14,159
It must have been someone else who gave him
but he has got no place to put them.

299
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,759
Capitalists make the best use of everything.

300
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,440
Forget it. I'll just think it as a mutual benefit.

301
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:21,919
Smells great.

302
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,239
You remember what I like to drink.

303
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,800
What are you looking at, Miss Meiren?

304
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,118
What, Lv Jian?

305
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,759
You learned Shadowless Kick from my mom?

306
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
You got something on your mind?

307
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:13,559
No. Why do you ask?

308
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,640
What have you come to see me about?

309
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,598
You forgot to take the grapes.

310
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,959
I've washed them and put them there.

311
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,479
Thanks.

312
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,679
Miss Meiren.

313
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,439
You and Professor
Zhuang seem weird today.

314
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,958
Why do you say that?

315
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,399
I just feel you seem to be
intentionally avoiding him.

316
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,160
Did you have a fight?

317
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,598
No.

318
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:32,959
We...

319
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,879
We're good.

320
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
You're being paranoid.

321
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,839
I know.

322
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,880
Now Professor Zhuang
gets in front of me.

323
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,879
But I can still
wait in the line.

324
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,520
I believe I will stand a chance someday.

325
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,318
Have you been hanging out with Tiantian lately?

326
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,160
Why do you talk like someone from TV series?

327
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,040
Actually

328
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,839
I knew about everything.

329
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:09,198
We're already exposed,
but why are you still cooperating?

330
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:13,119
Is it because you enjoy
pretending to be a couple with me?

331
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,079
Who's it?

332
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,920
Miss Meiren.

333
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,319
From the first day I saw you

334
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,160
picking tea leaves,
I couldn't get you out of my head.

335
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,238
Later,
I found you were Professor Zhuang's girlfriend.

336
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:56,239
I felt surprised and pitiful.

337
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,920
I felt pity that I didn't meet you earlier.

338
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,599
Of course, I won't come in between you.

339
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,079
But

340
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,198
every time when you're around,
I can't help but want to

341
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,599
get a little closer to you.

342
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,239
No one has ever known me this well.

343
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,599
You saw right through me.

344
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,719
Since Professor Zhuang's not your boyfriend,

345
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,479
could you give me a chance?

346
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,598
Lv Jian.

347
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,999
Thank you.

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,119
Oh no, that's not a good start.

349
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,279
Maybe others don't understand,
but I do know

350
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,399
how hard it is to summon the courage

351
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,040
and profess your feelings.

352
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,760
So you deserve a
sincere thank you.

353
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,679
Other than this,
I also want to thank you

354
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,599
for not telling everyone else
even if you knew our secret.

355
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,640
My relationship with Zhuang Yu
is much more complicated

356
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,160
than just a fake couple.

357
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,239
As for what it is exactly,
I'm kind of confused myself.

358
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,799
So, thank you for your kindness.

359
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,160
But sorry, I can't accept you.

360
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,759
I've guessed you'd say that.

361
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,399
But that's okay, like I said,
I'll always wait in the line.

362
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,520
But I'll be in the front of the line.

363
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,999
It's better if you change a target.

364
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,319
So you won't need to wait in the line.

365
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,598
It was as if I had never stood in line

366
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,078
since I could remember.

367
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,719
It's kind of a life experience.

368
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,599
Oh,

369
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,358
- and...
- And

370
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,679
you're gonna give me compliments as customary.

371
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Save that.

372
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,760
Except for the compliments,
I have a favor to ask you.

373
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,318
Characteristically,

374
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,399
Zhuang Yu doesn't like to do these things.

375
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,119
So I'm grateful for his help.

376
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,400
Could you please
don't ask him about it?

377
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,680
I don't want to trouble him.

378
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,399
That's it?

379
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,880
What?

380
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:01,799
Am I a blabbermouth to you?

381
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,639
Of course not, I was just reminding you.

382
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,358
Don't take it to heart.

383
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,239
I almost forgot,
this is for you.

384
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,838
What did I do?

385
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,400
Did I just tell him about my feelings for Zhuang?

386
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,079
No, no, that was just an excuse.

387
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,100
[The bird is made by CG]

388
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,300
[The bird is made by CG]

389
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,838
[Following]

390
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,598
The picture taken by a phone isn't very clear.

391
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,680
I'll just look at the photos someone else took.

Tillandsia. Don't need soil
and can grow while being hanged.

393
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,719
Weird. Why am I checking his posts?

394
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,759
I found your account through G.

395
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,438
Would you tell me
what kind of bird is this?

396
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,560
Feels like it can peck my head off.

397
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,599
An adult night heron. It prey on fish,
instead of your head.

398
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:23,078
While being hanged.

399
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,639
Instead of your head.

400
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,118
What? I created a rhyme?

401
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:33,759
Unconsciously imitate every
move of the person you like.

402
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,319
Stop it, Li Tiantian.

403
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,679
I'm not done yet.

404
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,799
The most important thing is that
when he's around you,

405
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,718
you get that blissful and giddy feeling

406
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:47,040
like you've got fireworks in your head.

407
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,838
How can it be fireworks?

408
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,239
It's a wake up call!

409
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,719
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

410
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,358
Thanks, Tiantian.

411
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,279
- Bye bye.
- I gotta go, Xiaofang.

412
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,800
Bye bye. See you tomorrow.

413
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,238
It smells good.

414
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,319
This is the first time I've received flowers.

415
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,160
President Jin.

416
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,318
Where did you get these flowers?

417
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,239
From Tiantian.

418
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,079
Tiantian?

419
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,959
President Jin, I should leave.

420
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:18,879
President Jin.

421
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,999
I'll be going.

422
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,599
Hold on.

423
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,559
Did you give away all the flowers?

424
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,478
Yeah.

425
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,759
Isn't that what you said?

426
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,078
The roses in her hand, the flavor in mine.

427
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:28,839
You know what?

428
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,718
After I gave all the flowers to my colleagues,

429
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:33,439
and saw how happy they were,
I felt a lot better.

430
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,598
Besides,
how am I supposed to get all those flowers home?

431
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,000
If I squash the flowers on the subway,
I'll feel sad.

432
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,879
All of them?

433
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,238
You did leave a single bunch for yourself?

434
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:43,959
Oops.

435
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,039
There were so many flowers.

436
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,759
There's got to be some
which doesn't get people allergic.

437
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,759
I should have left a little for him.

438
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,399
I was being negligent.

439
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,359
Sorry, President Jin.

440
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,839
Tomorrow,
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

441
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,239
I'm leaving then.

442
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,479
What answer?

443
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,199
Meiren.

444
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,799
Why are you late?

445
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,358
We've all been waiting for you.

446
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:14,839
Hurry.

447
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,560
Come on.

448
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,599
Sit and have lunch with us.

449
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,438
Don't rush. Wait a minute.

450
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:24,959
- You can eat it in a little while.
- Thank you.

451
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,639
What's wrong with you?

452
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,880
Look how inattentive you are.

453
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,719
See? Aren't they showing hospitality?

454
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,959
You mean courtesy, right?

455
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,839
Never mind. Forget it.

456
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,879
Meiren, your dad was cooking,

457
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,999
and I was helping him. But Zhuang saw us

458
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,399
and insisted on helping us.

459
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,318
In the end, he was the only one cooking

460
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,040
and we couldn't help out at all.

461
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,640
So all the dishes are made by Zhuang.

462
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,479
They look so delicious.

463
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,358
Mom, since Meiren is here,
shall we start eating?

464
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,519
You glutton.

465
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,920
Come on, let's eat.

466
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,559
Yeah, yeah, dig in.

467
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Have a taste.

468
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,760
This looks delicious.

469
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,159
OK.

470
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,680
Dad.

471
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,000
Good.

472
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,760
Tastes great.

473
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,199
Don't just eat. Give a few comments.

474
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:38,598
The broth is just incredible.

475
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,599
And with the chewy beef,
I can't help but keep eating.

476
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,959
So tasty.

477
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,999
Of course. Zhuang cooked all these.

478
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,760
Zhuang.

479
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:52,520
I have to apologize.

480
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,639
You were busy working during the day,

481
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,239
and you had to cook for us.

482
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,479
I wanted to take this chance

483
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,040
to thank you.

484
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,319
The completion of Artemisia annua sampling

485
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,759
cannot be accomplished without the support

486
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,079
of both of you and Meinan.

487
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,838
- That's what we should do.
- Don't say that.

488
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,159
You're professional.

489
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,799
All we did was act as your assistants.

490
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,718
It was nothing to speak of.

491
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,280
Thank you, Uncle.

492
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,599
Eat.

493
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,280
Of course.

494
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,719
I should also thank Meiren for being my guide.

495
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,479
Without her,

496
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,359
I couldn't have got the job done.

497
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,280
I...

498
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,639
I'm full.

499
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,519
Thanks for the dishes.

500
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,040
What's wrong with this kid? Geez.

501
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,800
I reckon

502
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,079
she's tired.

503
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,039
It should be. My sister said

504
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,919
we have to sleep for three days for a stay-up

505
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,679
and one week for an early get-up.

506
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,640
She got up so early.

507
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,560
You make sense.

508
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,359
Then forget about her. Let's eat.

509
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:11,920
Let me taste this.

510
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,198
The vegetables are really tasty.

511
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,399
Get me some beef.

512
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,319
The beef has taken in all the flavors.

513
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,119
Try it.

514
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,238
Let's drink a toast.

515
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,319
Come on, cheers.

516
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,000
What did she mean by
the satisfactory answer?

[Qin Ya's platform activity]

518
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,159
Let me remind you again.

519
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,358
Don't forget that you are in debt.

520
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,478
The platform activity of Qin Ya

521
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,799
that I told you about is next week.

522
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Keep that in mind.

523
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,198
Don't worry, President Jin.

524
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,639
I'll get the job done, I assure you.

525
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,479
See you next week.

526
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,919
If the fireworks are still
in my head until next week,

527
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,478
my mind will explode.

528
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,319
Why are you so happy?

529
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:20,199
Mom, I'm joking with my colleague on WeChat.

530
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,680
How's work been going?

531
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:27,759
It's on the summer vacation,
so I've been writing my papers

532
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,000
and reading articles online.

533
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:32,358
Do you and Zhuang work together?

534
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,559
Yeah.

535
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,399
Then why has he been running
outside doing researches,

536
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,198
and you've only been sleeping at home?

537
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:41,560
Do you only need to work on the laptop?

538
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:45,559
So Zhuang's way better than you,
I see that now.

539
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,759
No wonder he's an associate professor.

540
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,920
You have to work harder
and put more energy on it.

541
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,160
People say the best part of
love is you grow up together.

542
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,198
Not bad, Mom.

543
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:00,079
You even know how to quote now.

544
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,159
Well, where's Zhuang?

545
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,799
He went to the village director's place.

546
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,079
Guess they figured out
what happened with the grapes.

547
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,358
I should go.

548
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,478
Where are you going?

549
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:13,280
Growing up together with him.

550
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,279
I will try to set off the fireworks
a few more times,

551
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,599
and maybe I'll become desensitized.

552
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,119
President Jin.

553
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,238
My gift for you.

554
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:23,159
Begonia.

555
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,718
I checked. This has no pollen
and you won't be allergic.

556
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:28,239
I'm making it up for the fact
that you didn't receive flowers yesterday.

557
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,880
I... I didn't receive flowers...

558
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,160
That's... fine by me.

559
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:38,118
This kind of green plant can
survive longer than flowers,

560
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,279
and you can see for yourself

561
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,679
how it branches out and grows up.

562
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,880
Isn't it a better gift?

563
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,479
Good thing it's cheap.

564
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,839
It's very special.

565
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,078
Take this. Save the courtesy.

566
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:52,760
Thank you.

567
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,160
Oh, right.

568
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,319
Please hand out the gift
boxes to everyone for me.

569
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,119
Sure, got it.

570
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,318
Don't forget yours.

571
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,160
The summer gift box is for everyone.

572
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,118
Thanks, President Jin.

573
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,639
Our company's nice to us employees.

574
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Of course, look who's the bo...

575
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:23,719
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

576
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,239
President Jin's gifts.

577
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:28,359
They're for everyone.

578
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:29,839
Here.

579
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,439
Here.

580
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,380
- Thanks.
- What's this?

581
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:34,280
President Jin's gift.

582
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,239
Seafood.

583
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,639
Eggs, sesame, walnuts, seafood.

584
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,000
What are all these?

585
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,680
When have we ever figured
out what the boss thinks?

586
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,839
- Thanks.
- Here.

587
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,640
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

588
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Let me see.

589
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,318
Professor Zhuang, have some water, please.

590
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:03,959
Thank you.

591
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,078
If Yu hadn't mentioned it
when we were playing chess,

592
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,519
I would never know
such a capable young man

593
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,719
is the son-in-law of our Qingshui Village.

594
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,759
Thank you, Professor Zhuang.

595
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,318
This time,
you helped our farmers solve a big problem.

596
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,280
Otherwise,
we don't know what will happen.

597
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,799
It's my job.

598
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,318
Meiren was quite
famous in our village

599
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,718
when she was only a student.

600
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,358
We all call her...

601
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,639
Call her...

602
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,439
Bully...

603
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,358
School bully?

604
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,759
School bully.

605
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Are these the right words?

606
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,999
Then yes.

607
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,839
Or else she wouldn't have
found a boyfriend as good as you.

608
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,239
Where's she? She isn't with you?

609
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,760
It's either Stockholm or Drawbridging.

610
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,639
Maybe I've been single for too long.

611
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,040
Even if a pig kissed me,
I'd fall in love with it.

612
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,958
Right.

613
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:58,920
That must be it.

614
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:02,319
I have to think more the real about him,
and clear my head.

615
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,958
What was that?

616
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,438
It changed channel in my head?

617
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,759
No, I'm trying again.

618
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,719
I mean,

619
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,318
she asked you out, why don't you go?

620
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,879
I thought you like this type of girl.

621
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm not interested in those simpleheaded.

622
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,039
That's more like it.

623
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,958
Our sampling analysis suggests,
insect infestation

624
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:36,478
was not the main cause of low yields.

625
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:39,439
We did an analysis of plant
growth regulators in grapes.

626
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:46,799
Gibberellin and cytokinin levels
were found to be excessive,

627
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,160
which shows the setting
fruit is problematic in itself.

628
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:53,318
Plus,
days of heavy rain have also led to pollen loss

629
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,040
affecting pollination.

630
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,159
You can actually repair the canopy regularly

631
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,400
to avoid the effects of low
temperature and rain on grapes.

632
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,160
Also,
you can improve fruit setting

633
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,718
by stabilizing tree growth,
preventing excessive growth,

634
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,920
and pre-flowering spraying
of plant growth regulators.

635
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,159
Professor Zhuang,
can we ask you more questions

636
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,358
about the plants in the future?

637
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,598
Anytime.

638
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,358
Professor Zhuang's busy with the national projects.

639
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,560
How could he have the time
to solve your small problems?

640
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,879
Neither silver nor gold

641
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,239
is as good as the reputation among the villagers.

642
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
This is also our original intention to do research.

643
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,639
I'm glad that I
could help you out.

644
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,958
We want to thank you.

645
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,399
Thank you. Thank you so much.

646
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,238
If you leave in a couple of days,
how can we find you?

647
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:37,198
Right.

648
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,119
You can go to Meiren.

649
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,359
Find her and you'll find me.

650
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,399
Meiren, you're here.

651
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,118
I came to call Zhuang Yu home for dinner.

652
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,198
Look.

653
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,920
People in love can't get separated.

654
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:50,359
You came to tell him only that?

655
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,719
- Exactly.
- Meiren's calling you home.

656
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:54,399
Look at them.

657
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,599
- Pretty, huh?
- What a smart match.

658
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,198
They make a good couple.

659
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,279
You see?

660
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,359
They look great together.

661
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,519
What's on your mind?

662
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,479
I'm thinking

663
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,000
how do you know if you like someone.

664
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,199
Why don't you keep asking?

665
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,239
Not interested.

666
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,399
I heard if you like someone,
you'll become more like him.

667
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:40,320
Unscientific conclusions cannot be trusted.

668
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,079
That's not true.

669
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,519
It's based on social experiments.

670
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,559
There maybe is statistical significance.

671
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,479
How much is the significance?

672
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,319
That sounds kind of mean.

673
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,360
So according to your conclusion,
that maybe what you like.

674
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,280
Very well, Zhuang Yu!

675
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,479
Take this!

676
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,560
Wait for me.

677
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,999
Wait for me.

678
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,439
You're not waiting for me,
that's why I hit the piggy.

679
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,958
You... You're right.

680
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:17,080
I probably like a pig.

681
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,398
I can see that.

682
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,439
How do you see that?

683
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,360
You're blushing.

684
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,040
Never mind.

685
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,119
I've come through.

686
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,879
I forgave you in the spirit
of being a generous person.

687
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,959
You're welcome.

688
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,678
Mom.

689
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,560
Gou Fei.

690
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,999
You're really something.

691
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,159
How long has it been? Where's the money?

692
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,039
Are you not going to recognize me as your mom?

693
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,958
Mom.

694
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,599
How could you say that?

695
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,479
I've been...

696
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,198
I've been tight on money this month.

697
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,918
That's not a big amount.

698
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,158
Is that so much to ask for?

699
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:17,959
Mom.

700
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,438
I'll transfer the money to you next month.

701
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,799
And I'll make up for this month.

702
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,559
We're starving.

703
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,279
What bad luck I have!

704
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,158
Why do I have such a daughter like you?

705
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,559
How useless.

706
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,559
Look at Yu Meiren.

707
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,878
She's got such a good
boyfriend and a nice job.

708
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,599
She's a teacher in college.

709
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,478
An iron rice bowl.

710
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:38,600
Can't you learn from her?

711
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,158
What did you say?

712
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,679
A teacher in college?

713
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,580
[Another bottle]

714
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:12,679
Sometimes,
we have to try one more time to get lucky.

715
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,438
Mom, mom.

716
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:17,999
I just won a prize.

717
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,839
What prize?

718
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,119
Give me another bottle.

719
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,438
Show me.

720
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,679
Mom, see?

721
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,079
How many times have I told you?

722
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,398
Don't drink such iced drink in summer.

723
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,638
It's bad for your stomach.

724
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,999
You had a bottle just now.

725
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,319
And you still want another one?

726
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,999
You just don't listen to me, do you?

727
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,918
Well,
I also told you your phone has a small screen,

728
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,519
and you can't keep staring at it.

729
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,279
You're straining your eyes.

730
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,638
Also,
the articles about health preservation

731
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:46,439
are just made up. Don't get misled.

732
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,878
Good. Now you know how to talk back to me?

733
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,638
Are you giving me a lecture?

734
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,879
I'm not.

735
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,119
This is for you.

736
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,879
Or what?

737
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,799
You want to take another bottle?

738
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,360
I dare not.

739
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,800
Come back.

740
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:08,519
What... what are you looking at?

741
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,800
Didn't you just take a shower?

742
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,679
Why are you still wearing makeup?

743
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,119
You don't understand.

744
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,799
This is called idol baggage.

745
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,560
It means to always put your
best foot forward to everyone.

746
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,799
You're a college teacher.

747
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,600
Why do you learn this?

748
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,999
Aren't you like those low types now?

749
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,438
What's wrong with me being into my looks?

750
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,000
Mom, this is stereotype.

751
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:30,560
Look.

752
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,398
Just because of this idol baggage,

753
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,520
people mistook others for you.

754
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,199
See?

755
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,718
Mom, this is clearly a star.

756
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,398
Your daughter is so beautiful now.

757
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,398
It's normal for me to look like a star.

758
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,759
How could she be a star?

759
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,560
Look again.

760
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:02,918
How revealing is the dress.

761
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,000
She can't be a decent girl.

762
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,198
Why do you sound so harsh?

763
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,878
This... this... This dress
looks very expensive.

764
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:11,478
How can it be indecent?

765
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:12,479
She can't be more decent.

766
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,319
Are you defending this kind of person?

767
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,119
What kind of person?

768
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,238
It's the 21st century now.

769
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:21,678
Isn't this kind of dress normal?

770
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,040
You have the same kind of clothes?

771
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,639
Of course I don't.

772
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,199
That's my girl.

773
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,359
Don't forget you're
the only female doctor

774
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,999
in our Qingshui Village,
and a college teacher.

775
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,759
You don't know how many
people are envying us.

776
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,839
Be good.

777
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,279
Take your makeup off.

778
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,199
You look great and decent without makeup.

779
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,678
Mom.

780
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,918
So by your definition, the uglier, the more decent.

781
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:51,399
You're so pretty,
so are you decent or not?

782
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,359
Don't talk nonsense. Go to bed.

783
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,040
Alright.

784
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:05,040
Rhizosphere soil.

785
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,520
Why do we sample the same
piece of land multiple times?

786
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,519
Artemisia annua releases

787
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,839
large amounts of terpenoids and flavonoids to soil

788
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,479
through leaf litter and root
exudates during growth.

789
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,438
Chemical and microbial components in soil

790
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,360
change with the growth of artemisia annua.

791
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:30,520
102.83.

792
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:33,560
So it means

793
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,319
not only the growth of flowering plants

794
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,958
depends on the content of soil,
and in turn,

795
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,560
it also changes soil conditions.

796
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
You can put it in this way.

797
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,359
There you go.

798
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,478
Then why does everyone always think

799
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,199
that rick kids are all good-for-nothings?

800
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,800
Including you.

801
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:50,360
At first, you didn't bother to look at me.

802
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,958
You think I'm biased against rich kids?

803
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:53,840
Otherwise?

804
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,799
But it's normal to have this
"rich people suck" idea. I'm used to it.

805
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,919
What makes you think that?

806
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,119
It's fine. I don't mind.

807
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,679
I feel content that she thinks I'm good.

808
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,399
Contentment is also a virtue.

809
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,638
Don't be sarcastic.

810
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,279
I've heard that this experiment failed every time.

811
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,158
How about this time? Is it going to work?

812
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,199
Perhaps no.

813
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,719
No?

814
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,079
Then all our efforts will be in vain.

815
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,999
If you stop trying for the fear of failure,

816
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,519
you will only be further away from success.

817
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,879
136.46.

818
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,478
A failure is no big deal.

819
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,319
For someone as successful as I am,

820
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,040
failure is also a new life experience.

821
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,438
Soap?

822
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:38,959
Yeah.

823
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,080
From a customer. Take it as a gift.

824
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,718
No gains without pains. I've said that 100 times.

825
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,119
I'm not accepting it.

826
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,799
I'm not letting you use it for free.

827
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,158
You'll need to write an experience report.

828
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,080
I see.

829
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:51,279
All the more reason for me to refuse it.

830
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,319
I don't know how to write it. Find someone else.

831
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,759
The company is busy these days.

832
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,520
You fit our client portrait.

833
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,678
Portrait? I don't know how to draw.

834
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,759
You don't... You don't have to draw.

835
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,238
Just write something.

836
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,878
Think of it as a favor, and take it.

837
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:07,399
Well then.

838
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,239
Hold on a little bit.

839
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,919
Five minutes later, action.

840
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,060

00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,420

Seafood.

846
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:58,840
Milk.

847
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,599
Sesame.

848
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,639
Walnut.

849
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,718
Linda.

850
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,040
I need you to get me gift
boxes for every employee.
