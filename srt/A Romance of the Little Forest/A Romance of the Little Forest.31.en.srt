[It's not about catching, but waiting.]

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,318
Actually, some people asked me before.

25
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,799
But I was worried about the authorization.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,639
Lv Jian?

27
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,279
Is that what you and Lv Jian talked about?

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,638
No.

29
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:47,598
I had dinner with him for nothing.

30
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,199
We just had a casual dinner and a chat.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,160
And we haven't had time to
talk about the conservation area.

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,558
There are other important matters.

33
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:59,720
Maybe.

34
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,800
I think there is.

35
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,720
What's it?

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,919
Maybe, now,
I can't tell you yet.

Something you can't tell me?

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,599
Oh no, what should I say?

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,559
Forget it. Show a cough.

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,839
I will drink. Don't be mean.

Nothing.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,398
Then why are you so mean?

45
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,478
You'll find out sooner or later anyway.

46
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,959
But not now.

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,558

Nothing.

If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

you can take it.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,759
I think it would look better with color.

Forget what I said.

57
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,600
Exaggerated.

58
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,559

59
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,119
What would be good to paint with it?

60
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,600

He colored it.

64
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,518
It seems that one should be bold.

65
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,040

74
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,879
Besides, it needs to be colored.

Where's it? Show it to me.

76
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,679

I know.

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,880
I envy you for having such a great friend.

187
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,718
The idea of selling for charity is quite good.

188
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,798
If we do it big, we can do it for a long time.

189
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,598
But I worry that the audience
may be a little limited.

190
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,759
Fang, you're great.

191
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,238
You've seen the key to the problem right away.

192
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,639
Over the years,
I haven't actively operated my microblogs.

193
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,558
Just by myself,
the influence is indeed a bit small.

194
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,199
If there is a more high-profile occasion,

195
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,359
it may be more popular.

196
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,479
Let me answer the phone.

197
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,359
Hello.

198
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,679
Really? It's done so quickly.

199
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:36,919
Thank you.

200
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,719
Bye bye.

201
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,239
Done.

202
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,478
Meiren, for the concerns you just mentioned,

203
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,599
I have thought of a good solution.

204
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,399
You are not in the circle of KOL this time,

205
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,199
you probably don't know that in a few days,

206
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,759
there will be a large charity reception.

207
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,960
Charity reception?

208
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,118
This charity reception

209
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,879
will not only invite all the elites of KOL,

210
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,598
but also many brands will
send their public relations.

211
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:07,639
On the one hand,
they will promote these bloggers.

212
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,999
On the other hand,
they will also donate to charity projects

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,479
that they like to build a brand image.

214
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,880
Meiren, what's wrong with you?

215
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:24,079
Fang, look at me now,
I'm not an elite at all.

216
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,359
I'm afraid that I don't deserve to go to…

217
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,158
Meiren, you still have me.

218
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,519
Don't worry, leave this to me.

219
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,359
Really?

220
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,798
Frankly, I'm not a big shot,

221
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,399
so I can't guarantee that I'll get a spot,

222
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,679
but I'll do my best.

223
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,478
Thank you, Fang.

224
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,760
Meiren, don't mind it.

225
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,839
But I'm working at Xingfu now,

226
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,439
which is our competitor at that time,
do you mind?

227
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,960
No, I don't mind. Of course, I trust you.

228
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,718
She took the bait so easily?

229
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,520
She's anxious to get ahead.

230
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,000
Look.

231
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,159
This is Zhuang Yu…

232
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,919
A surprise for you.

233
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:30,678
Where did you get it?

234
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,199
She's still as sloppy as before.

235
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,400
I guess she brought it here by accident.

236
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,279
Yu Meiren, how can you do this?

237
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,639
You're treating something

238
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,200
that others hold in their hands like this.

239
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,678
With a face of hypocrisy,

240
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,279
your heart is darker than anyone else.

241
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,719
What face she has,
I know it better than you.

242
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,238
I am really for the good of Meiren.

243
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,119
I have absolutely no other ideas.

244
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,880
President Jin.

245
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,919
Linda,

246
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,358
you don't believe me either?

247
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,350
It doesn't matter

248
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,598
whether I believe you or not.

249
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,718
I'll explain to Meiren right now.

250
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:18,039
Dear,

251
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:21,719
President Jin means that you
leave in the name of vacation,

252
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,279
which is good for all of us.

253
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,960
I…

254
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,239
Is it her decision?

255
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,358
She even asked others to say those wicked words,

256
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,678
she just didn't want to dirty her hands.

257
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,839
She sent me a message later saying that

258
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,760
she respected my decision to take a vacation.

259
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,319
For such an arrogant person like her,

260
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,199
there is no one else in her eyes.

261
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,880
She is just hypocritical.

262
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,319
It's my fault to be too nice

263
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,359
to let more people see what she really is.

264
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm afraid

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,320
there is only one person, right?

266
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
Does it matter?

267
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,760
Anyway, our purpose is the same.

268
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,238
Isn't this relationship

269
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,519
more reliable than the so-called sisterhood?

270
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,880
Do you have a plan for the next step?

271
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
No rush.

272
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,520
Let me make good use of this first.

273
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,999
What is this?

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,960
Headphones?

275
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,599
Earplugs.

276
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:37,479
Try it.

277
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,519
Li Tiantian is the most beautiful in the world.

278
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,760
What did you say? Are you cursing me?

279
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,839
It seems that this earplug works a little.

280
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,520
Why did you buy this?

281
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,239
Do you remember when we were in Shanghai,

282
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,718
I don't know where you got a wheelchair,

283
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,679
and said you wanted to know how I felt.

284
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,039
I was moved and ashamed.

285
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,000
I thought how could I ever
get the love of such a girl?

286
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,238
At that time, I was even more ashamed of myself.

287
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,718
I couldn't say the words that

288
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,399
I wanted to confess that I was lying.

289
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,799
You are unreasonable.

290
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,958
You cheated and you blame me for it.

291
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,438
How dare I?

292
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,159
I was just inspired.

293
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Today,

294
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,959
I also want to feel the same way.

295
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,039
By the way,
I've been studying lip-syncing for a while.

296
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,920
We should have no problem communicating.

297
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,319
But I'm deaf in one ear,
why do you put on two?

298
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,478
I know.

299
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,559
You've always done more than me.

300
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,000
Are you sure that's what I'm talking about?

301
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,238
I love you too.

302
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,560
Do you want to take this opportunity
to talk nonsense?

303
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,879
Well, that's a little hard.

304
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,958
You might have to say it again.

305
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,040
Childish.

306
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,879
Eat? Hungry?

307
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,318
Come on, let's go to have dinner in town.

308
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,478
Let's go.

309
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,920
How can you communicate with people like that?

310
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,159
I can't communicate with other people,

311
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,560
you have to take me with you.

312
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,679
Why does your lip-sync
work sometimes and sometimes not?

313
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,959
Let's go to the town.

314
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,318
Qi ran the gel for you, right?

315
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,479
How could you tell that right away?

316
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,319
How is it?

317
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,560
Actually, it was Lv Jian who did it.

318
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,680
Still need to be improved.

319
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,598
But it's also better than me.

320
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,159
I'm not lazy.

321
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,639
When I think of the basic job
as gel electrophoresis,

322
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,718
I can't do it well after studying
biology for so many years,

323
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:04,519
the more I don't do well,
the more I dare not do.

324
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,559
Maybe I am afraid to face the truth.

325
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,839
Boss, you can understand, right?

326
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,079
You tied this knot yourself, right?

327
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,560
What's wrong?

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,119
This is not appropriate.

329
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,359
Actually, I...

330
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,400
Look who's here?

331
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,760
Miss Meiren.

332
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,560
Boss, your hand.

333
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,599
I...

334
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,319
Why is it tied so nicely?

335
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,519
It was just tied yesterday.

336
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,640
Don't break it for me.

337
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,760
Boss.

338
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Put back buffer A.

339
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,680
His girlfriend tied it.

340
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,439
Yesterday…

341
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:12,280
Stop gossiping and work hard.

342
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,279
So anxious to leave.

343
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,679
I have nothing to talk about with you.

344
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,679
Then why are you here?

345
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,399
I used to, but now I have nothing to talk about.

346
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,199
But I have.

347
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:20,990
I don't want to know.

348
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:21,879
Don't walk so fast.

349
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,680
It's easy to fall over.

350
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,760
You didn't even break a bone.

351
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,760
I never said that.

352
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,390
Then why did you say you can't move your hand?

353
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,399
I can't move with this bandage.

354
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,199
You…

355
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,719
You weren't shot.

356
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,599
Yes, I was.

357
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,358
You saved my life.

358
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,078
And you don't have a concussion at all.

359
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,799
I went back to the hospital a few days ago,

360
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,799
and they ruled out the possibility of a concussion.

361
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,029
The possibility is little.

362
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,169
Otherwise, the doctor wouldn't

363
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,499
have let me leave the hospital early.

364
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,238
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

365
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,839
I always said I was fine.

366
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,479
I thought… I thought
you mean that

367
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,880
you were fine to be a man.

368
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,198
I even went to invite Lv Jian to dinner,

369
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,879
and asked him to help you contact a specialist.

370
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,400
But you're fine.

371
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,520
You invited Lv Jian to the canteen?

372
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,438
You're welcome.

373
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:30,159
You were injured for me.

374
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,599
I couldn't care less about you, who knows you…

375
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,479
Hello, Tiantian.

376
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,079
I'll be right there.

377
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,479
Professor Zhuang.

378
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,699
You'll be sad after I tell you this.

379
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,280
But I can't bear to see
you being kept in the dark.

380
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,479
15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

381
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,479
Tiantian.

382
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,760
It's been a long time.

383
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
[Cuihu Apartment]

384
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,238
Use the position

385
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:57,958
to make the subject agree to endorse the brand.

386
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,400
Binding to the subject by
the job to increase the contact.

387
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,399
Surrounding the Wei to save the Zhao.

388
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,999
Test multiple variables to find out

389
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,559
what the subject really wants to eat.

390
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,198
Then carry out the plan.
These are fresh grapes in season.

391
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:17,119
This is a small token of my appreciation.

392
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,559
Waiting for rabbits.

393
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,238
Waiting at the subject's daily haunts,

394
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,839
show a sense of presence.

395
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,718
Yu Meiren is good to you,

396
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,359
which is just a show from the very beginning.

397
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,358
You know her handwriting.

398
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,599
This can't be faked.

399
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,800
Professor Zhuang,

400
00:23:56,439 --> 00:24:00,198
if you're just her subject from the beginning,

401
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,319
you don't mind it?

402
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,519
It's impossible to say
that I don't care at all.

403
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,318
Cheating is cheating.

404
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,880
There is no excuse for this fault.

405
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:19,719
But the reason why I care about this

406
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:23,760
is because I care about this person.

407
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:31,519
Since I care about him,
I shouldn't hold on to the past.

408
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,598
We have to move on in life, - right?
- Yes.

409
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,958
I'll write it down right now.

410
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,118
And I'll copy it 10 times.

411
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,198
And then I'll memorize it all.

412
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:39,990
10 times are not enough.

413
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,680
20.

414
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,319
No.

415
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,399
30 No less than 50.

416
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,920
40.

417
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:45,119
Stop.

418
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,598
So you called me here in such
a hurry to show off your love?

419
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,679
No.

420
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,078
The beans just came from Sumatra.

421
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,400
Taste it. You too.

422
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,000
Is it good?

423
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
Eat something sweet.

424
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,279
It is delicious.

425
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,199
Have another sip.

426
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,560
I'll eat it myself.

427
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,479
What's wrong?

428
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,438
Nothing.

429
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:26,040
It's just wonderful to see you in this way.

430
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,609
It's been a long time

431
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,179
since you saw such a handsome young man closely.

432
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,279
You don't feel used to it, right?

433
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,598
I really haven't heard

434
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,438
such fascinating comments for so long.

435
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,958
So I'm not used to it at first.

436
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:39,838
Li Tiantian, how can you stand such people?

437
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,478
What kind of person am I?

438
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,160
You are…

439
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:44,319
A narcissist.

440
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,598
Jin Xi, after all these years,

441
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,559
you finally have someone who can handle you.

442
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,559
How can you call this handle?

443
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,478
I'm willing to do it.

444
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,718
Narcissism is a disease, which should be cured.

445
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,438
When have I ever been a narcissist?

446
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,599
It's always someone else who loves me, okay?

447
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,559
Who else? Tell me.

448
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,549
Who called me? Bad signal.

449
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,989
Meiren, you've known him for a long time,

450
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,239
- you tell me.
- Okay.

451
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,400
Yu Meiren,
I treated you well before.

452
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,520
The signal is on?

453
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,400
I count as your talent scout in your career, right?

454
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,958
I guess so.

455
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,839
For your love,
I am also your Cupid who shoots arrows.

456
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,920
Without me,
would you have met that Professor?

457
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,560
Wait a minute.

458
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,400
You and Jin Xi were college classmates.

459
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,479
You and Professor Zhuang
were also college students.

460
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,680
Then you and Professor Zhuang are alumni.

461
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,040
You lowered Professor Zhuang's rank.

462
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,559
Meiren, this time,
the school will give you

463
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,799
the only recommended quota
of the municipal key high school.

464
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,799
When you study there,
remember to win honor for our school.

465
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,199
Okay, Mr. Zhang.

466
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:10,280
If I had gotten that spot back then,

467
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,399
would I have been the one to know you,

468
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,479
and would everything be different now?

469
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,838
It's been a long time, are you still here?

470
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,438
During the time I've been absent,

471
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:33,759
do you want to know what I've been up to?

472
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,478
Give you a few hints.

473
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,318
It's okay if you don't guess right.

474
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,159
Tomorrow I will tell you the answer.

475
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,078
No selfie is bad.

476
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,238
It's been a long time.

477
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,639
I can't forget your beautiful face.

478
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,859
Having seen too many Internet celebrities,

479
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,718
now I only want to see a natural beauty like you.

480
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:46,519
Hug you.

481
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,400
A big kiss to you.

482
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,800
Unforgettable.

483
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:55,959
Your sister's original
face is really unforgettable.

484
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,039
Who are you looking for?

485
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,838
Is Professor Zhuang working here?

486
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,040
Professor Zhuang?

487
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,239
He's in the lab.

488
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,958
I'll find him in the lab.

489
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,000
Thank you.

490
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,160
A hypocrite. You don't deserve it.

491
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
[Fang]

492
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,238
Not everyone is worthy of being my alumnus,
okay?

493
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:21,159
All those pretending professors,
or fake professors,

494
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,520
I've never even heard of them.

495
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,438
Professor Zhuang is a popular figure.

496
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,640
I know that.

497
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,399
Jin Xi was the president of the student union,

498
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,879
who was also a famous person.

499
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,838
So great.

500
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,318
If you can talk, then talk more.

501
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:44,358
You know,
the student president is so popular.

502
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,799
At that time, there was a saying in our school.

503
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,318
Different beauties for the same Jin Xi.

504
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,279
If you don't know how to use idioms, don't use them.

505
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,718
She got poor marks in Chinese.

506
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:54,879
When she was in school,
she copied my homework every day.

507
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,318
She can't express herself well now.

508
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,079
Yes.

509
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,399
My Chinese is not good.

510
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,519
In fact,
Jin Xi was totally ignored at that time.

511
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,438
There's homework in college?

512
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,040
Yes.

513
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,078
I was so miserable.

514
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,559
The required arts classes were my nightmares.

515
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,599
The essays and the
reading almost killed me.

516
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,719
Hello.

517
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:18,920
Really?

518
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
What are you looking at?

519
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,319
It's like we're back to the past,

520
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,920
but it seems not.

521
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,520
It's a little strange.

522
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,800
It's not real anyway.

523
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:45,400
Sour.

524
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,879
Is it real?

525
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,639
Where did you get such sour grapes?

526
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,759
I always wanted to ask you

527
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,198
where did you get a box of rotten grapes?

528
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,359
I can't tell you.

529
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,519
Did you pinch them?

530
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,160
No.

531
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,640
Tell me.

532
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,239
Don't tell you.

533
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,399
- Tell me.
- I won't tell you.

534
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,920
I won't tell you.

535
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,519
Fang, you're great.

536
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,238
It must have taken you a lot of work.

537
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,718
Thank you so much.

538
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:11,198
Meiren, don't be so polite to me.

539
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,679
I asked around at the office.

540
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,598
It just so happens that

541
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,598
a blogger broke her arm two days ago.

542
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,639
So I asked for this spot for you.

543
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,760
But is it really okay for me
to take someone else's spot?

544
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,799
Xingfu is the co-organizer
of this charity reception.

545
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,999
There are a lot of vacancies,

546
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,238
no one knows if there is one more or one less.

As an elite scholar,

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,520
you learn this kind of devious ways quite quickly.

656
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,718
I don't dare.

657
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:38,280
Besides, it's not about catching,
but waiting.

658
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,438
You learned to play with words.

659
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,718
Then tell me the
difference between them.

660
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,520
This question is really difficult for me.

661
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,799
It's my academic incompetence.

662
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,599
I should go back to read the textbook.

663
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,840
Don't say such inexplicable words.

664
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,080

Of course, I came up with the idea myself.

670
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,119
It must be interesting.

671
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,639

a justifiable begging.

I'm not nervous.

682

I would be willing to study for a doctorate.

♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

728
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,499
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

729
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,739
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

730
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:29,139
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

731
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:34,139
♫ You make all the stars in the sky shine for me ♫

732
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:39,819
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

733
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:44,699
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

734
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:50,100
♫ Even the air is filled with the scent of flowers ♫
