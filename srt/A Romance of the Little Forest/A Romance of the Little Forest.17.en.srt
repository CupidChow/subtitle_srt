I'm embarrassed to hear you say that.

00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:05,880
No.

552
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:09,399
I mean that he doesn't know
it's my birthday this Sunday.

553
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,318
Even if he doesn't know that,

554
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,198
he can't always make you work on weekends.

555
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,479
You didn't sell yourself to him.

556
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,039
It's okay.

557
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,679
Anyway,
I only have you as a friend here.

558
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,759
When the time comes,
we can spend it in advance.

559
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,718
Do not have to wait until that day.

560
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,359
Fine.

561
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,919
As long as you are happy.

562
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Enjoy the food.

563
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,958
Thanks for your work.

564
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,559
No.

565
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,640
Thanks for your work.

566
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,519
Miss Jing, thanks for your work.

567
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,079
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

568
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,318
Have something to drink.

569
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,239
Thank you.

570
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,559
I know you are doing well here,
and know you often

571
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,359
do some experiencing activities for charity.

572
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,358
My friend's birthday is on Sunday,
so I'm here

573
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,680
to make a humble request to you.

574
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:04,399
You're really capable.

575
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,639
I'm flattered.

576
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,679
You treated me so badly before,

577
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,759
but now you could put yourself down to beg me.

578
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,399
It really makes me change my attitude toward you.

579
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,358
You're really a man of greatness,

580
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,619
who knows when to yield and when not.

581
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,919
You haven't changed much either.

582
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,000
You're still as beautiful
and reasonable as ever.

583
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,399
If I had heard that for the first time today,

584
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,759
I would have been
fooled by your rhetoric.

585
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,958
Unfortunately,
I've heard your rhetoric

586
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:30,039
and I've seen your ruthlessness.

587
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,078
What ruthlessness?

588
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,718
What are you talking about?

589
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:36,838
I've always been gentle to

590
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,999
such a beautiful and
sensible girl like Miss Jiang.

591
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,078
Miss Jiang?

592
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,920
Wenjing.

593
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,799
I still know you well.

594
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,919
After all, we've known each other for so long.

595
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,799
I know you are a kind person.

596
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,118
I also know that you will help me with this.

597
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,799
Okay, don't say pretty words.

598
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,199
I just want to ask you one thing.

599
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:02,400
If you knew it, why did you do that before?

600
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,000
Before.

601
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,478
Before I knew if you left me,

602
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,039
you would have a better future.

603
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,760
Look,

604
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,680
I was right, right?

605
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:18,280
Your friend is a girl?

606
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,079
Unexpectedly,

607
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,239
the love prodigal son has changed.

608
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,239
Interesting.

609
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,318
I can help you if you want.

610
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,359
But you have to meet one requirement.

611
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:38,800
I'll do my best to meet it if I can.

612
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,239
How's that?

613
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:51,959
I'll do it.

614
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,160
2709.

615
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,199
It's been an hour,
and the number hasn't changed.

616
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,520
If you don't want to play games,

617
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,239
then do your homework.

618
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,719
By the way, brother,

619
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,400
are these invoices for Sister Meiren?

620
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,358
Brother,
do you want me to send a message for you

621
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,079
to ask Sister Meiren to get the invoices?

622
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,040
Don't make a typo.

623
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,319
Are all office jobs so unfree?

624
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,279
Of course.

625
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,678
Do you think everyone is like you?

626
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,999
Do you think I'm not exploited by my boss?

627
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,159
He just called to remind me to hand in my work.

628
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,879
The only good thing about
my job is that I have free hours.

629
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,958
Just be satisfied with that.

630
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:27,560
Many people are envious of that.

631
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,800
That's true.

632
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,279
By the way, my college teacher called me again,

633
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,939
and asked me to return as a teaching assistant.

634
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,359
That's good.

635
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,999
You've got a Ph.D,

636
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,360
with so much knowledge waiting for you to shine.

637
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,760
But I think

638
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,718
being tied to a class schedule and a title

639
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,079
is like a bird with its feathers cut off,

640
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,879
wanting to fly but having no energy.

641
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,119
You said so much.

642
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,359
You're just lazy.

643
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,799
You don't have to be embarrassed.

644
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,119
Laziness is the nature of human beings.

645
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,079
Isn't everyone going to work

646
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,959
just to be able to stop working one day?

647
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,399
You know me.

648
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:12,040
Your message.

649
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,678
My parents are taking a nap now.

650
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,478
It's either my boss or spam.

651
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,120
I don't want to see either of these.

652
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:22,599
What if your boss is merciful enough

653
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,879
to let you hand your work late?

654
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:25,280
That's right.

655
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,280
The invoice has arrived,
come to repay it.

656
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,879
Reimburse.

657
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,760
This Zhuang Yu is also
so serious about typos.

658
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,060
[The invoice has arrived, come to repay it.]

659
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
[Reimburse.]

660
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,560
Quite attentive.

661
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,478
Your Professor Zhuang?

662
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:16,478
How do you know?

663
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,839
You're grinning like this.

664
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,398
I am not.

665
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,559
Well, then I won't keep you from dating.

666
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,320
Pay the bill.

667
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,599
What dating?

668
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,918
We're talking purely about money.

669
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,040
Reimbursement.

670
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,919
You are so happy to spend money.

671
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,238
When will I be able to

672
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,959
have such a magnanimous state of mind as yours?

673
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,840
I'm happier spending money on beautiful girls.

674
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,840
I haven't been this happy in a long time.

675
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:54,319
Here you are.

676
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,080
Thank you.

677
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,600
How is it? Are you satisfied?

678
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,520
You've never let me down in this area.

679
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,198
On Sunday, I'm going to hold a charity event

680
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,359
of experiencing the weather forecaster.

681
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,040
Come at 2:00.

682
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,679
Miss Jiang would not break her promise.

683
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:19,319
After this, I'm Miss Jiang again.

684
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,769
Knowing each other for a long time,

685
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,080
you know what kind of person I am.

686
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,970
Aren't you afraid I'll go back on my word?

687
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,520
You won't.

688
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,049
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

689
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,349
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

690
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,419

00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,649
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,158
♫ You show up in my sight ♫

694
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,198
What is it?

695
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,024
Is this for launch?

696
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:18,475
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

697
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,079
A small scene, calm down.

698
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,824
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

699
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:26,924

709
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,000
Your house is really well-equipped.

710
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,040
1798.

711
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
How could you…

712
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:47,039
Sister Meiren is very good at math.

713
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,959
My last homework…

714
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,679
Our secret.

715
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,559
Are you sure it's just a few?

716
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,600
Is it so cheap to renovate the house now?

717
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,759
I saw that you have a mortgage to pay.

718
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,879
If you don't have enough money,
don't try to save me money.

719
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,040
Okay.

720
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,918
You really don't have to worry about that.

721
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:13,000
He can…

722
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,280
He won't save you money.

723
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,519
It's all here.

724
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,479
Really?

725
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
Alipay.

726
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:30,678
Don't steal my energy points.

727
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,679
I'm saving them up to plant poplars.

728
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,879
Others can't take away what belongs to you.

729
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:42,000
Sister, look,
this is the model you won for me last time.

730
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,878
This model looks difficult to assemble.

731
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:47,040
Did you put all these together yourself?

732
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,999
Yes, it took me a few days.

733
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,238
Awesome.

734
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,600
Compare with my brother,
I'm just good.

735
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,519
He's a doctor. Don't compare with him.

736
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,079
You're a very good elementary school student.

737
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,478
Sister,
the last time you helped me win the model,

738
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:02,839
I haven't thanked you yet.

739
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,039
Don't mention it.

740
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,638
I had a lot of fun that day too.

741
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,360
Thank you.

742
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:08,520
If you really want to thank me, buy me a meal.

743
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,999
Explain the WeChat thing by the way.

744
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,238
WeChat?

745
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,478
What?

746
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:17,478
It's me who sent the message to you.

747
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:19,439
That's why I made a typo.

748
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:27,759
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

749
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,000
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

750
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,000
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

751
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,398
I almost forgot the important thing.

752
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:55,079
Zhuang Yu walks a lot every day,

753
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,560
he must have many energy points.

754
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,320
What?

755
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,398
He has two poplars.

756
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:10,959
Really a big family.

757
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,159
What the hell?

758
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,599
Didn't you say that

759
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,559
no one else can take away what belongs to me?

760
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,439
Energy only belongs to the early risers.

761
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:38,830
