My boss needs me. I'll talk to you later.

31
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:46,765
Okay.

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,040
Hello? I'm sorry.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,079
My mistake. I missed a call from
President Jin, the most handsome man.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,300
Be honest, are you in a relationship?

35
00:01:56,839 --> 00:02:01,120
Don't tell me that your mom
still phoned you at this late.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,559
Come on.

37
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,319

You're calling me yourself

Don't worry. Buy one and get one free.

by then. Satisfied?

69
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:07,095
Why does she care about the stars?

70
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:27,028
It's stained.

71
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:29,766
Are you going to stay until it's dry?

72
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,351
One day,

73
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,871
I'll deserve to be with you.

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,519
Are you taking photos to record the features?

75
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,320
I don't think your macro lens are good enough.

76
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,684
Why not use mine?

77
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,057
It doesn't matter if the camera is good.

78
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,965
The point is to choose the key feature.

79
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:36,057
So, it's not quite the bud stage yet?

80
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,714
The branch stage has gone.

81
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:39,994
The bud stage is in the next few days.

82
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:44,440
Its stalk is reddish.

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,040
And it's flush with leaves.

84
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,117
It might have high Artemisinin.

85
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:53,680
I didn't realize there were times
when Professor Zhuang was nice.

86
00:05:56,057 --> 00:06:00,201
As I said, the academic conversation is welcome.

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,079
Including teaching me
to take identified photos?

88
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,296
A good camera is not a plus, but it's not a minus.

89
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,079
Tent and sleeping bag.

90
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,191
Did you sleep here last night?

91
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,768
Watching flowers at night is
not funnier than fighting a boar.

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,608
These are more interesting than boars.

93
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,428
Qingshui Mountain is rich
in species and medicinal plants.

94
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:33,686
Try to know them if you're free.

95
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:47,257
I haven't been to the gym lately.
I could get some exercise.

96
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:51,269
By the way, Professor Zhuang,
do you get plans today?

97
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,096
I've got plans. Don't mind it.

98
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
You're back.

99
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,519
Are you tired?

100
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,519
Miss Meiren.

101
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:19,611
You also went up to the hill?

102
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,760
Let's have breakfast.

103
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Go.

104
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,559
Here. Come on.

105
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,839
Just sit down.

106
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,279
It's a big day.

107
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,342
You should be well prepared.

108
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:37,679
You can't wear that.

109
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,040
It's kind of casual.
Zhuang doesn't have to get changed.

110
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,800
Zhuang is great. He looks radiant in anything.

111
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,640
Right.

112
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,399
There are many activities
in our town these days.

113
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,480
It's lively.

114
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,720
Why not you show Zhuang around

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,799
and experience our Qingshui Village's folklore?

116
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,959
Sure, I'll give him the tour.

117
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,976
Zhuang went down the hill for it.

118
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,136
You know what, it's Qixi.

119
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,600
Yeah.

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,328
Here.

121
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:13,040
This is... This is our
traditional custom.

122
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,263
Tie the bean sprouts up
with this colorful thread.

123
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,519
What custom is it?

124
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,359
Why hadn't I heard of it as a kid?

125
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:23,480
- You knew nothing as a kid.
- But eating.

126
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,735
Silly girl. Do it.

127
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,880
What's going on?

128
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,520
Why so secretive?

129
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,159
No. I must get it done quickly.

130
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,039
I can't let it affect my next plan.

131
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,432
Okay. I'll do it.

132
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,000
Miss Meiren, let me help you.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,641
Hold on.

134
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,799
Handsome boy, you can't help her with that.

135
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,919
- They have to do it themselves.
- Right.

136
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,040
It doesn't seem to get in.

137
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,719
Done.

138
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,142
That's destiny, right? Great.

139
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:10,742
Bean sprouts grow towards the
light, so they grow in one direction,

140
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:12,937
which makes it easier.

141
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,304
You're showing off.

142
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,080
Zhuang is different.

143
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,664
Educated.

144
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,303
Knowledgeable.

145
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:22,760
What are you doing?

146
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,863
Oh, yeah.

147
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,520
Mom, what's this?

148
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,799
Put it back.

149
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,030
It's Qixi.

150
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,571
Sow and you'll get a child.

151
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:38,741
Wish you have more kids
and more blessings.

152
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:41,119
Yu, do you think how many kids they'll have?

153
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,159
The more, the better.

154
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,520
The point is to give me a granddaughter.

155
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,080
Well, then am I almost an uncle now?

156
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,960
No, you're not!

157
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,592
Eat your steamed bun.

158
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:54,119
Dad, did you make them?

159
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,200
Nice.

160
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
Your mom said it's for luck.

161
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,679
What luck?

162
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,239
Look at them. They're white and fat.

163
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:04,200
Mom. Are you finished?

164
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean, we're getting better.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,440
What? What are you thinking?

166
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,240
You're thinking of that again?

167
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:18,910
I'm sure Professor Zhuang
got a gift for this day.

168
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,120
I know. My brother-in-law is romantic.
I'm sure he got a present.

169
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,000
Thank you.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,004
Be careful when you open it.

171
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,760
Professor Zhuang, what gift is it?

172
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,776
That's so sweet.

173
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,119
What's it?

174
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,400
Mom, you're afraid of worms.

175
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,479
Don't look.

176
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,599
Worms?

177
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:53,840
Yeah. We have breakfast,
So does the great tit.

178
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,760
Thank you for thinking of it.

179
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,280
I love this gift. Thank you.

180
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,485
You're welcome.

181
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,119
Remember not to degrade
the quality of its life.

182
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,119
You're overthinking it.

183
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:07,000
I serve them well.

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,456
They're fat and lively.

185
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,919
It's time already.

186
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,552
I've got to feed my kids.

187
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,399
Here, eat more.

188
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,000
Wait.

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,036
I almost forgot something important.

190
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:26,571
Remember to make a wish
when you stop by the divine tree later.

191
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:27,440
It works.

192
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,752
Divine tree? Also about babies?

193
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,598
Sister, I think you seem pretty desperate.

194
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,919
It's the divine tree.
You can ask it for anything.

195
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,919
If you have to ask for a baby,
we can't stop you.

196
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sure it works.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,880
No, I don't.

198
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,655
It works.

199
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,008
She's being coy.

200
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,968
This kid.

201
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,110
Silly girl.

202
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,910
We can't do anything about it.

203
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,184
Is this good?

204
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,968
That's better.

205
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,152
Just get up here.

206
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,720
Geez, I should be in the wheelchair.

207
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,736
I suck when it matters.

208
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,351
President Jin.

209
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,360
What happened? Are you okay?

210
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,505
I'm fine.

211
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,855
Slowly.

212
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Easy.

213
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,855
- Is your leg okay?
- It's fine.

214
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,960
- Am I hurting you?
- No, it doesn't hurt.

215
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,640
President Jin, why did you suddenly fall?

216
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,568
Oh, no. Fairy doubts me.

217
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,287
Shall I confess?

218
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,519
Oh, crap. I rub it in.

219
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,287
- Well, I...
- Sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

220
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,119
President Jin, trust me.

221
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:35,384
I'm here for you. I'll never let you fall.

222
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,896
President Jin.

223
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,679
Nothing. I'll take you to a nice place later.

224
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,311
- No?
- Yeah.

225
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,080
What's it?

226
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,431
The divine tree works so soon?

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,359
You said yes so fast.

228
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,703
It's not like you.

229
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,760
I don't object to everything.

230
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,345
[The bird in the picture is made by CG.]

231
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,554
Are you done with the samples?

232
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:27,680
Just one more time up there
after the bud stage in two days.

233
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,115
What's wrong?

234
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,479
It's nothing, you know.

235
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:35,479
I just wasn't expecting you to
agree to go to the town with me so fast.

236
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,823
Surprising to me.

237
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,568
I'm surprised I conquered you so fast.

238
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:47,806
I won't rest easy if you go alone.

239
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,103
You're worried about me?

240
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,771
I'm worried about it.

241
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:04,302
Don't you go there to deliver the bird?

242
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,257
President Jin, are we there yet?

243
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:20,257
Are you tired?

244
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,480
No, I'm not.

245
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,832
I can't be. I'm ready to serve you.

246
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,960
Horrible.

247
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,504
He can't even leave a yawn alone.

248
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,392
Stop. It's here.

249
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,919
Mr. Jin, what's this...

250
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,039
Well, uh, it's okay.
Take this lady to pick something.

251
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,280
- Can I take your name?
- Li Tiantian.

252
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,624
Miss Li, please.

253
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,120
It's about picking a gift?

254
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,400
I pick?

255
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,550
How much?

256
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,912
Affordable.

257
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Okay.

258
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,336
This is perfect for you.

259
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,600
Fairy takes it seriously.

260
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,231
It's too costly, not affordable.

261
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,880
This is for the runway this summer.

262
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,400
It compliments Miss Li's skin.

263
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,596
But don't you think it's too long?

264
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,599
I feel it's hard to walk in this.

265
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,479
It's fit for attending a dinner.

266
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:01,039
Or activities you don't have to walk too much.

267
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,016
Miss Li, if you like casual style,

268
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,399
you can try this one.

269
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,199
It's not about me.

270
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:09,352
Try it out.

271
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,184
Great.

272
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,728
Thanks.

273
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,544
- I'm done.
- How do you like them?

274
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,190
Not bad.

275
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,939
It doesn't matter what I like,
the point is, what you like.

276
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,971
You look good in anything.

277
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:45,160
The clothes I just tried on are all my size.

278
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,745
The one that you're sending is my size?

279
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,119
The one that I'm sending?

280
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,903
Yeah, isn't it for your girlfriend?

281
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,200
I... I'm sending...

282
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,240
sending...

283
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,680
Bird?

284
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,280
I know you're doing it for the bird.

285
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,304
I called Wildlife Protection Station yesterday.

286
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,103
Look, it got fat in a few short days.

287
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,919
Would you give the breeder a little reward?

288
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,119
How could I make that sound?

289
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:27,801
Disgusting.

290
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:30,160
Here's the thing, I got an assignment.

291
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,742
I have to shoot a vlog about Qixi.

292
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:34,439
But I need someone to run the camera.

293
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:36,160
Will you help me?

294
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,959
I'm good at it.

295
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,314
Miss Meiren, check this.

296
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:40,365
Am I qualified?

297
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,760
It's so clear.

298
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,679
640 or 856?

299
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,079
You always carry it?

300
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,440
Yeah. Piece of cake, isn't it?

301
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,439
This is the best camera ever!

302
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:08,375
That's a young man, alive and dynamic.

303
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,914
I was thinking,
it just happens to be a nice day.

304
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:12,439
Wanna shoot the birds with me?

305
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:13,543
Today?

306
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:17,119
I got a date with Professor Zhuang today.

307
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,760
How about another time?

308
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,816
Go or not?

309
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,232
Yeah. Go.

310
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,976
We're leaving.

311
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,535
Wait for me.

312
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:34,880
What did you just say, shooting birds?

313
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,943
I'm interested. Take me.

314
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,319
Go.

315
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:43,874
Could you lower the price?

316
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,760
15 yuan.

317
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,775
Look at this. Do you like it?

318
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,104
Here, kid. Taste it.

319
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,239
Buy one.

320
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:54,699
Begging for skills by threading a needle.

321
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,760
I sent my kid away so quickly.

322
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,775
I can't bear to part with them.

323
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,380
I saw how happy your kid was out there.

324
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:07,040
It sure knows I'll miss it
when it's freed in two days.

325
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,640
Besides, it belongs to the sky.

326
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,615
I've kept it for a few days. That's enough.

327
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,839
It's not like us.

328
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,912
Our time is not over yet.

329
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,359
I'm really grown up.

330
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,428
My sweet talk comes so easily.

331
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:25,521
About what I just told you,
running the camera, say yes, okay?

332
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,040
Begging for skills and blessings.

333
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,839
Meet the true love
after threading seven needles.

334
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,880
Come on. Wanna have a little fun?

335
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,719
One yuan at a time.

336
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,919
Have a try?

337
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,359
Here.

338
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,360
That's the deal.

339
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,615
You should help me if I succeed.

340
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,455
Hold it for me.

341
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,975
Amazing, right? Come on.

342
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,319
Oh, no. I shouldn't have chosen this booth.

343
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,040
I should pick the dessert stall.

344
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,679
I can eat 10 in a row.

345
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:31,455
Come on.

346
00:21:40,114 --> 00:21:42,651
Congratulations! You got skills.

347
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:47,623
It's a compulsion.

348
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,000
Professor Zhuang, just be cool.

349
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,543
If you want to help me, just say so.

350
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,640
Film for me all day.

351
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,423
Till the romantic stars appear.

352
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:09,154
A video shot by a compulsive man,
could be something to look forward to.

♫ You know how to call me,
honey, I'm your Miss Pretty ♫

365
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,119
These are tears of Cowboy Niulang and Fairy Zhinv.

366
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,819
You'll be quick and agile if you put them on.

367
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:05,484
I think you need it more than I do.

368
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,915
♫ Welcome to my heart ♫

369
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:12,514

377
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:33,337
♫ So pretty ♫

378
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,760
A video by a photographer
who got the title Professor must be amazing.

379
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,104
Let me check.

380
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,936
Where's me?

381
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:03,839
- Do I have to film you?
- Or what? It's my vlog.

382
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,000
People watch it for me.

383
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You.

384
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,335
Are you screwing with me?

385
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:13,705
You're overthinking it.

386
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,399
If not for the rain, I wouldn't have been here.

387
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,248
Rain...

388
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,053
[There's a 50% chance of rain at 1 p.m.]

389
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:32,519
You can't see monkeys,
let alone the stars, if it rains.

390
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,279
Most precious metals in the universe
come from a supernova explosion.

391
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,024
We're just nothing in the universe.

392
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:45,176
But we're lucky to have
an old fragment of the stars for it.

393
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:49,692
It's romantic, right?

394
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,719
President Jin, if a relationship
is all about materials,

395
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,200
it's just like sand.

396
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,857
The wind could blow it over.

397
00:24:58,857 --> 00:24:59,857
It's useless.

398
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,943
That's the fairy.

399
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,560
Poor me.

400
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,800
It's a big day.

401
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,544
Can you let me go back
to date my boyfriend on TV?

402
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:13,119
How? Anything you like?

403
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,710
President Jin, don't waste money.

404
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,571
I'm asking you if there's anything you like.

405
00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:20,910
No, I can't afford them.

406
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,096
Take them off.

407
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,767
Uh, you don't want any of them.

408
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,159
Try these...

409
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,599
Are you getting tired?

410
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,514
Shall we get some rest?

411
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:34,502
Let's see a movie upstairs.

412
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:36,959
Okay.

413
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,880
I asked Linda to choose a movie for me.

414
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,520
It can't be wrong.

415
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,828
Go to buy two tickets for me later.

416
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:46,050
The plot doesn't have to be complex.

417
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:50,560
As long as it can create
a romantic and passionate atmosphere.

418
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,007
Okay, no problem. Trust me.

419
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:00,342
A few minutes went by.

420
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:02,704
Both sides are doing nothing.

421
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:06,520
At this moment, suddenly, the watering hole...

422
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,679
There's a film of Animal World.

423
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:13,886
Though the air is still,

424
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,888
a larger beast... It's 3-D.

425
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,228
The movie is on,
why are there only the two of us?

426
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:26,880
In fact, I... I... Yeah. It's Qixi.

427
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,028
Others must go to watch romantic films.

428
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:34,627
Photographers see it happen
in the Wildlife National Park.

429
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:37,040
About that, photographers think,

430
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,079
just need to follow and find an
angle, soon... This chair can move.

431
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,599
President Jin.

432
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,687
I'll let you feel it.

433
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:10,359
No, don't bother.

434
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,239
Sit back.

435
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:14,888
It's okay. Serving you is my biggest thing.

436
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,521
How's it?

437
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:17,640
Feel like running, right?

438
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,567
It's alright. You just watch the film.

439
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,088
Sit back.

440
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,696
Sit down.

441
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,663
Are you okay?

442
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:47,223
I'm tired of watching it. Let's go.

443
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,500
I'm tired of watching it. Let's go.

444
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,257
Sorry, you didn't finish it because of me.

445
00:27:57,257 --> 00:27:58,920
You're right. It's Qixi Festival.

446
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,328
We should see a romantic film.
I don't want that movie.

447
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,920
Thank you, President Jin.

448
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,791
It's nothing.

449
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,885
It's inconvenient
if one of your ears can't hear.

450
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:13,714
Well, it's alright.

451
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:16,457
Deafness in one ear is not
a serious problem for my daily life.

452
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:19,828
But it's easy to have some
ringing in a loud environment.

453
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:24,006
However, I think I'm luckier than most people.

454
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,839
I'm sorry, President Jin.

455
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,336
I... I don't mean that.

456
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,657
Well, don't be too sad.

457
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:39,657
Compared to able-bodied men,
we have a little physical defect,

458
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:42,359
but our spirits are the same as theirs.

459
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,759
We can even do better than them.

460
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,592
Look, President Jin,
you're young and accomplished.

461
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:50,959
You're an example to me.

462
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,640
Fairy is so kind.

463
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,560
I must be nicer to her.

464
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,040
I've complimented you.

465
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,400
It's late.

466
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,560
Your date should be on.

467
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,104
Can I go home now?

468
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:04,601
You're right.

469
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,000
Don't eat it.

470
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,340
I'll take you to a nice dinner. Go.

471
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,828
Will he start his date?

472
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:18,518
Why is it not over yet?

473
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,160
Be careful. Don't break it.

474
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,400
Don't worry.

475
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,350
Please don't rain.

476
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,771
Remember to make a wish
when you stop by the divine tree later.

477
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:41,110
It works.

478
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,599
Why not I worship it?

479
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,999
I'll see how magical it can be.

480
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:49,176
Cut. Let me check.

481
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,110
Why is my face still so small?

482
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,863
You look good in this way.

483
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,304
Okay.

484
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,504
I know.

485
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,560
Your technique sucks. Don't just use one hand.

486
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,983
Use both hands and put
the viewfinder on my face, okay?

487
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,719
Like this.

488
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,920
Your arm.

489
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,342
Nothing.

490
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:29,719
It's badly bruised.

491
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,351
What caused it?

492
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:37,656
- Is it because of that day...
- No.

493
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:42,199
You were hurt for me.
I have to be responsible for you.

494
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:43,314
No need.

495
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:46,249
- I'll buy you dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

496
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:49,989
I'll be with you every day
and take care of you forever.

497
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,880
I'm not ready to die.

498
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,680
I'll marry you.

499
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,503
I don't deserve you.

500
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,561
How about this?

501
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,218
I'll buy you a flower boat.

502
00:30:58,914 --> 00:31:00,959
Miss Meiren, you want a flower boat?

503
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,839
It's for you.

504
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,119
Handsome boy, Meinan.

505
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,040
Why are you here? You finished the shoot?

506
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,599
Come on. I thought we'd
shoot the birds with slingshots.

507
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,239
But with a camera. I can't do it.

508
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,560
Come on. How dare you?

509
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,239
What did I tell you as a kid?

510
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:18,116
You know what,
birds on the mountain are wildlife.

511
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:20,239
If you dare shoot them, you'll be caught.

512
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm sorry, sister.

513
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,800
That's just casual talk.

514
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,335
No way.

515
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,142
But, why are you here?

516
00:31:29,142 --> 00:31:31,839
He bought all the flower boats
as soon as he got here.

517
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,359
And he said it was the only road.

518
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,615
I don't know what he wants.

519
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:39,760
Anyway, my job is to watch him.

520
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,400
Why do you watch him?

521
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,903
Miss Meiren, I've been
saving this biggest one for you.

522
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:47,303
Hold it.

523
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:53,920
Write your wish on it and put it in the river.

524
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,400
It's right on time. I was just thinking...

525
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,807
A wish without price won't come true.

526
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,924
- Really?
- Yes.

527
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,320
Then I'd rather not do it.

528
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,164
Thank you, handsome boy.

529
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,470
Meinan, what tree is
the divine tree our mom said?

530
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,000
It's Immortal Camphor Tree.

531
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,599
It's been over 1,000 years.

532
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,485
Sister, you don't know it?

533
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:15,400
Yes, I know it.

534
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,000
Go ahead, you guys.

535
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,434
We're going to film the divine tree. Go.

536
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,640
Miss Meiren.

537
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Handsome boy, how much for it?

538
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,464
Yeah, how much?

539
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,280
Well, that's for you.

540
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,816
You're nice.

541
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:44,479
Here's the premeal bread. Enjoy.

542
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,679
Thank you.

543
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,415
How? This place is great, right?

544
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,280
The candlelight dinner in the TV show
seems so romantic,

545
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,760
while it's dark in the real world.

546
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,040
Looks like we don't
have access to electricity.

547
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,119
Besides, the serving is slow.

548
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,759
It's been a while and we only get the bread.

549
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,319
Excuse me, here's your steak.

550
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,855
Thank you.

551
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,752
Please enjoy.

552
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,057
Here, eat it.

553
00:33:30,057 --> 00:33:32,662
- Thanks, President Jin.
- Not at all.

554
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,096
Excuse me.

555
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,657
What can I help you?

556
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,551
This steak is not well done. It's raw.

557
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,119
Don't worry.

558
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:49,839
Every cow of our steak can
trace back from their birth to death,

559
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,840
which eliminates parasites from the source.

560
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,560
As they're imported,
they need to be frozen.

561
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,880
It's safe to eat.

562
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,479
Can you get the drink for us?

563
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:58,479
Okay.

564
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:03,239
Parasites in the beef can't live
at minus 18 degrees.

565
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:07,520
Bacteria at the surface
will disappear at a high temperature.

566
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,928
So, it's safe to eat.

567
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:18,342
Why do you still not eat?

568
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:21,840
Well, I just feel, you know a lot.

569
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,080
Excuse me, here's your wine.

570
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,479
It's nothing.

571
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,539
After all, in terms of food,
I'm a bit of an expert.

572
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,199
Sorry, President Jin. I'm so sorry.

573
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,784
It's okay.

574
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,360
President Jin, your leg... My leg.

575
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,320
- Last time, you...
- Sir, I think you're being rude.

576
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,080
Mr. Jin told you, he's okay. Why even ask?

577
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,239
Mr. Jin and I... Alright. You can go.

578
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,800
I'm fine. Thank you.

579
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,912
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

580
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,768
I'm all right. Eat.

581
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,176
Fairy's eyes are stern.

582
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm sleepy. Don't close eyes.

583
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,679
Don't close eyes.

584
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,408
Fairy's footsteps are firm.

585
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:31,719
Is it really an electric wheelchair?

586
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:34,071
Why do I feel so tired?

587
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,320
That's the fairy.

588
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,480
She has a heart of gold.

589
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,360
I regret it. Had I known that it was a long day,

590
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,879
I wouldn't have stayed up
late watching the TV show.

591
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,679
I want to go to bed.

592
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,199
Wish this great night could be longer.

593
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,159
Damn capitalist!

594
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,335
When can I go home?

595
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,719
It's here.

596
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,592
Probably this one, the divine tree.

597
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,999
Hold it for me.

598
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:48,586
Please, let it be a clear night
so as to see the stars.

599
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:57,152
I knew it. It doesn't work at all.

600
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,159
Look.

601
00:37:12,457 --> 00:37:14,959
I'm sure, this divine tree works.

602
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:18,511
Look, there are so many wishes hanging up there.

603
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,719
Professor Zhuang, why don't you mock them?

604
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,478
Ask nature for something, nothing to mock.

605
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:37,000
I believe butterflies are a good omen.

606
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,032
Like crickets, lizards and four-leaf clovers.

607
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,000
What's that look?

608
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:59,560
It's the Alchemist, isn't it?

609
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,391
What? Can't I read?

610
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:08,520
Okay, I admit that
my Chinese isn't good enough.

611
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,600
However, I have a good memory.

612
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,440
I remember all the books I read very well.

613
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:18,473
That book is short. It's right for you.

614
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,320
Professor Zhuang, you don't think
you still can discourage me by saying this now?

615
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,439
Why discourage a reader?

616
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,360
I like the book, too.

617
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,159
It's just so rare I read a book.

618
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,080
Come on. Let's talk.

619
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,568
Which part do you like?

620
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:42,114
The words the Alchemist said to the boy.

621
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:45,800
There's only one thing that
makes a dream impossible to achieve:

622
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,007
the fear of failure.

623
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,312
You do look like you're
not afraid of dreaming.

624
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:56,199
You earned the highest score
on College Entrance Examination.

625
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,120
You're considered a genius.
You've got a great future.

626
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,942
But you chose a major
that can't make a lot of money,

627
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:03,800
which shocked everyone.

628
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,239
You jumped into the Artemisinin world,
not knowing when to stop.

629
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,024
You have to solve a worldwide problem.

630
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,239
Zhuang Yu, I know you want
to carry out our teacher's work.

631
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,199
But, don't be too stubborn.

632
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,999
Now, the world's leading
level of Artemisinin is 3%.

633
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,567
I'll let China be the leading one.

634
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:27,959
You're the boy who wanted to cross the desert

635
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,840
and find the pyramid, aren't you?

636
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:38,432
The beginning of things is a decision.

637
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,792
Making a decision was
only the beginning of things.

638
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,303
When someone makes a decision,

639
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:48,359
he's really diving into a strong current

640
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,119
that will carry him to
the places he had never dreamed of

641
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,567
when he first made the decision.

642
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:59,120
Professor Zhuang, you're not sincere.

643
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,160
The only two lines you spoke
at a time are from the book.

644
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,831
Because the book has a point.

645
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:12,472
You weren't a student who
recited the full text, were you?

646
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,360
I didn't do such homework.

647
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Right. You didn't have to do homework.

648
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,320
You just need to snatch someone else's grades.

649
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,600
I mean, you were the top student.

650
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,120
Of course, you didn't have to do homework.

651
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,855
What about you?

652
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:34,583
Me?

653
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,731
I'm different from you.

654
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,000
You want to make your dream come true.

655
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,199
I just want to be an owner
of a bakery or a crystal shop.

656
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:51,032
Think of the dreams as the stars.

657
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,560
I know I can't own them.

658
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,543
But it'll be enough if I can
take a look at them sometimes.

659
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:05,887
We don't have to own the stars.

660
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,192
It's also great to see fireflies.

661
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:22,220
♫ Just for finding you ♫

662
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,885
♫ The light eventually
shines through the black clouds ♫

663
00:41:25,885 --> 00:41:29,314
♫ falling between us ♫

664
00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:31,709
♫ Find you ♫

665
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:43,959
You have told me about your dreams,

666
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,438
about the old king and your treasure.

667
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,503
And you've told me about omens.

668
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,783
So now, I fear nothing,

669
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,103
because it was those omens

670
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,688
that brought you to me.

671
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:01,607
And I'm a part of your dream,

672
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:07,767
a part of your destiny, as you call it.

673
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,792
What's wrong?

674
00:43:06,057 --> 00:43:08,437
Let's see the paper cuts out there.

675
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,399
Girl, make a paper cut.

676
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:14,040
