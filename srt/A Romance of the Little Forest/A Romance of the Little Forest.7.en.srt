[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,359
[Episode 7]
[Let's go home to have dinner!]

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,040
Meiren, when did you become his girlfriend?

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,318
I heard that there's a fan group about him.

26
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,238
No news has been leaked.

27
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,279
That's strange.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,839
Are you suggesting that he doesn't deserve me?

29
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,800
Well, maybe I am.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,598
Looks like Professor Zhuang owes me a lot

31
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,679
for making his life a much better one.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,720
Is Professor Zhuang also serious
when he's hanging out with you?

33
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:04,518
No, he's actually very expressive.

34
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,519
He frowns a lot.

35
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,758
You are not honest to me, Professor Zhuang,

36
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,038
yesterday you said you knew no pretty girl.

37
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,960
Yet today, you have a pretty girlfriend.

38
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,520
Maybe we understand 'pretty' differently.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,879
Fair point.

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,799
For a man so devoted to botany,

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,279
he may need to work up the appreciation of other things.

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,439
Or he just takes the fragrance of flowers for granted

43
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,320
because he has been with them for too long.

44
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,440
Really, flowers?

45
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,638
Way to flatter yourself.

46
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,399
Just stating the obvious facts.

47
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,720
I'll leave some time for you two. I'm leaving.

48
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:54,999
Professor Zhuang, why the long face?

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,758
You're not jealous, are you?

50
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,279
There are only teas here,
no vinegar to make me jealous.

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,119
Indeed, not so many drinks in here.

52
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:09,038
No vinegar, and no GENKI FOREST.

53
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,118
A miss is as good as a mile.

54
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,638
Professor Zhuang, which flavor do you prefer?

55
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,919
Maybe we could...

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,838
Rude...

57
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,600
Leaving without saying goodbye.

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,558
You guys officially announced it?

59
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,240
What did I miss?

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,080
We gave in to the massive pressure.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,558
He also agreed to have dinner
with my parents tomorrow.

62
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:48,320
That's my favorite scene in TV dramas.

63
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,299
Grandpa misses you.

64
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,850
- Come to dinner if it's okay for you.
- Okay!

65
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,478
Nothing can help contract lovers develop feelings
towards each other

66
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,678
better than displaying affection in front of parents.

67
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,279
Keep me posted tomorrow.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,320
The couple I'm shipping
are finally getting together.

69
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,040
I should be the Picasso in our times.

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,000
Linda, come in for a second.

71
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,920
This is...

72
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,558
President Jin asked us to post it and find her.

73
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,959
He wants to sign this girl.

74
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,199
But what is this?

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,518
I guess it's one of his marketing ideas.

76
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,719
The more ambiguous the picture is,

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,518
the more people will think it's them,

78
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,679
the more public attention we'll receive.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,358
Linda. It's like you can read President Jin's mind.

80
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,160
Impressive.

81
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,079
Boring... how did you know to turn right?

82
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,600
Who else can be so boring except you?

83
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,040
Well,
does this mean that I'm quite special to you?

84
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,799
Yes, especially boring.

85
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,640
Stubborn.

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,440
So... you got up this early for sampling?

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,879
Maybe I should have another guide.

88
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,238
No, I checked the weather forecast.

89
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,319
It will rain, so you can't go to the mountain.

90
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,439
Relax, and don't question my work ethic.

91
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,879
I always keep my word.

92
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,399
Come have lunch with my family.

93
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,519
Here... the eggplant goes here...

94
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,678
Perfect... have a seat.

95
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,640
We're here.

96
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,359
Come have a seat.

97
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,799
- Come on.
- Wow.

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,439
You made so many dishes for my guest.

99
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,759
Fried eggplant, your favorite.

100
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,199
Zhuang, come join us.

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,799
Here, take a seat.

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,479
I don't know if you like these dishes.

103
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,399
Try some, please.

104
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,839
Don't be shy.

105
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,838
Dad, your eggplant is amazing.

106
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,879
So authentically spicy, try it.

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,078
Look at yourself, not ladylike at all.

108
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,720
Zhuang, on the other hand, is a true gentleman.

109
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,159
Cool gentlemen like Zhuang

110
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,319
love girls like me, who are perky.

111
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,599
- Right?
- Cheeky.

112
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,039
Zhuang, take a bite.

113
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,238
It's very refreshing.

114
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,078
Thanks, Mr. Zhuang.

115
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,160
Not at all.

116
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,319
Zhuang, how long have you two been seeing each other?

117
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,040
Over two months... I think.

118
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,358
How did you two meet?

119
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,599
- We...
- We work together.

120
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,719
We met each other at college.

121
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,958
Zhuang is the Prince Charming in our college.

122
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,239
I fell in love with him at first sight.

123
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:32,399
Zhuang, how long have you been at college?

124
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,359
Over three years.

125
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,238
So has Meiren.

126
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,599
Why did you just know each other?

127
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,678
There are so many people at college.

128
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,719
I can't possibly know everyone.

129
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,759
You just said he's the Prince Charming
for all the girls.

130
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,239
Then how can you don't know him?

131
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,238
She spends much time on work.

132
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,719
And I'm not Prince Charming.

133
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,999
Come on, Zhuang.

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,319
No one deserves the title except you.

135
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,158
I mean, look at you.

136
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,118
So handsome and so educated.

137
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,319
If my daughter marries you one day,

138
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,880
- then I...
- Mom!

139
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:16,760
Listen to yourself.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,358
What?

141
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,880
Zhuang, if I may...

142
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,400
what do you like about Mei?

143
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,799
She is honest and straightforward.

144
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,640
Remember to call me.

145
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,719
Committed despite the result.

146
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,239
So you're an optimist.

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,119
Bubbly...

148
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,760
and smart.

149
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,439
Zhuang, you do have good taste in women.

150
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,718
You know what, Mei is very outstanding.

151
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,038
Smart since she was little.

152
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,519
All our friends in the neighborhood

153
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,759
would line up to introduce their sons to her.

154
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,038
That's right.

155
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,279
Do you remember?

156
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,079
The day Mei was born... the
sky was full of colorful clouds.

157
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,039
Mom, that's too much.

158
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,118
Sorry, I got a little carried away.

159
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,879
Zhuang, what food do you like?

160
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,279
Mei, you know that, right?

161
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,960
Take good care of him.

162
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,439
Yes, come on.

163
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,840
Of course I know what he likes.

164
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,599
Celery.

165
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,080
Leeks.

166
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,399
And ginger.

167
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,599
All his favorite.

168
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,358
Come on, dig in.

169
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,960
We have much of them.

170
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,358
Zhuang, your taste is quite... special.

171
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,399
He's a Doctor of botany.

172
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,520
Healthy eating.

173
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,558
Are you okay?

174
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,238
You're both doctors.

175
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,079
You must never run out of topics.

176
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,039
Of course.

177
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,359
We need to finish the whole play.

178
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,799
Impressive.

179
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,759
You even know only doctors can be tutors.

180
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,000
I may be simple-minded,
but I know my ABCs.

181
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,640
Patience means self-suffering.

182
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,598
Don't just sit around.

183
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,399
You dad also prepared us...

184
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,959
Fruits are ready.

185
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,799
We'll have them after lunch.

186
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,759
Must we come to the yard?

187
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,759
Yes, to enjoy the sunshine.

188
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,119
Mom, I'm wearing a sweater.

189
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:51,319
Why do you wear it when you're with Zhuang?

190
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,879
He can give you all the warmth.

191
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Am I right?

192
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,159
Let me.

193
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,879
Well... Mei is actually... good at it.

194
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,279
She's just nervous with you here today.

195
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,358
Let your dad handle it.

196
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,279
Right, give it to me.

197
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,959
It's okay. Allow me.

198
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,200
Sure, sure.

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,358
See?

200
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,158
Zhuang is very dexterous.

201
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:25,999
A professor of botany.

202
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,478
Of course he's dexterous from years of species-cutting.

203
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,759
Where's your manner?

204
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,718
A Youth Changjiang Scholar doing this for you

205
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,319
is a waste of talent.

206
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,000
It's what a boyfriend does, isn't it?

207
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,760
My good deed of the day.

208
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:43,039
Meinan, come on.

209
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,639
Zhuang, look.

210
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,759
Here are the photos of Mei as a little girl.

211
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,839
She has changed a lot.

212
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,399
I bet you can't recognize her.

213
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,038
Mom!

214
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,399
I don't know you still keep this.

215
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,238
Put it away.

216
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,279
Zhuang will laugh at me.

217
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,399
No, he won't.

218
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,238
She was so adorable.

219
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,639
Look, this is her in the kindergarten.

220
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,840
Isn't she cute?

221
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,079
Can you find her in this group photo?

222
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,238
How can he possibly find me?

223
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:10,919
This one.

224
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,760
How do you know?

225
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,840
Looks like her when she's eating.

226
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,000
Thanks.

227
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,118
There's more.

228
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:27,719
There's one of her as a
merit student in high school.

229
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,358
Well... he came here for... scientific research.

230
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:35,718
Let's not distract him.

231
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,319
Let me show you the room where you can work.

232
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,519
But the fruit...

233
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,678
Don't worry.

234
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,960
I'll bring it to him later.

235
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,359
Your sister is being shy.

236
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,959
Look at her photos, so adorable.

237
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,400
Look.

238
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,479
Come on.

239
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,798
I think Zhuang is a good boy.

240
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,880
Steady and considerate.

241
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,678
- I like him.
- Me, too.

242
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,679
Really great.

243
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,279
Stop being so rude to him.

244
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,439
Act like a lady.

245
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,079
But I'm already so gentle to him

246
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,478
that it almost makes me puke.

247
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,798
See my point now?

248
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,320
A perfect son-in-law like him
would make me smile in dream.

249
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,959
I can't wait to let Wang Xiumei see us together.

250
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,678
A good-looking and educated family,

251
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,238
Just imagine the scene.

252
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,759
Giant surprise.

253
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,598
Mom, your face is cracking.

254
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,759
Would you like a massage?

255
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,440
Are you okay?

256
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,199
If you bring me a good daughter-in-law one day,

257
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,880
even if I get a cramp from smiling,
I'll be happy.

258
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:39,759
Mei, tomorrow Xiumei's daughter Er Ya
will host a lunch party

259
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,959
for her one-month-old child.

260
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,999
You should go.

261
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,798
Er Ya is married to Gou Xiang,

262
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,879
who has a twin sister called...

263
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,559
Gou Fei.

264
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,718
Right, you two were classmates.

265
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:49,759
I don't want to go.

266
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,358
Your dad and I wanted to go,

267
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:53,038
but we need to go in town tomorrow.

268
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,199
Go bring them our red pocket and good wish.

269
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,238
Mom, since when did you
become friends with aunt Xiumei?

270
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,760
Speaking of my personality charm...

271
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,478
It's not mom's personality charm.

272
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,079
They fought to lead the dancing team.

273
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,279
Very fierce competition.

274
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,320
Now she's pretending to be generous.

275
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,479
Afraid if she doesn't show up,
the neighbors will talk.

276
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:15,919
You know-it-all.

277
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,319
What are you mumbling?

278
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,839
Ignore them.

279
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,999
Here, have some orange.

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,118
I'm good.

281
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,319
I don't care; I'm not going.

282
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,038
Mom,
you know that Mei was never friends with them.

283
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,760
They always got her into trouble.

284
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,399
Talking about stuff like
no one would marry a female doctor.

285
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,118
I don't understand why a baby makes them so proud.

286
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:38,918
Mom, don't make her go to the party.

287
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,158
That's exactly why she has to go.

288
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,279
Look at her now.

289
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,439
Well established in career.

290
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,080
Dating a wonderful guy.

291
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,839
Why don't you bring Zhuang with you tomorrow?

292
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,399
Wang Xiumei will be so jealous.

293
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,959
End of discussion.

294
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,199
Take this to Zhuang.

295
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,880
Here you are.

296
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,159
- Be nice.
- Nice cutting.

297
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,238
Professor Zhuang, you left the door open for me?

298
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,239
Surprise.

299
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,919
No attached service for today's show.

300
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,559
Attached service?

301
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,400
Relax.

302
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,039
You must be tired.

303
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,000
Here, have some fruit.

304
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,119
Thank you.

305
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,999
They look the same.

306
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
How can you put them together?

307
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,160
What do you want?

308
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,519
Speaking of attached service,
can I get another one?

309
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,359
Say, come to a lunch party with me?

310
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,160
You ran out of the attached service at lunch.

311
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,318
I... I mean... the weather is not so good.

312
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,478
Rainy for days.

313
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,119
You can't go to the mountain.

314
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,079
Staying here by yourself would be boring, right?

315
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:02,478
Fine, I don't want to go to the party, either.

316
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,559
It's all because of my mom.

317
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Making square dancing
like filming Game of Thrones.

318
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,438
Anything else?

319
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,959
Yes!

320
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,959
Thank you for playing along with me.

321
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,238
My career doesn't make much sense to my parents.

322
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,559
I work far away from home.

323
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,520
If I don't have a stable job,
they will be very worried.

324
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,679
Lucky for me that they don't use the Internet much,

325
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,318
and that Yu Meinan is not a girl.

326
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,639
Or an Internet celebrity like me

327
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,560
would have been busted long ago.

328
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,199
Am I right?

329
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,920
Fine, I'll leave you alone.

330
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,640
Bye.

331
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:09,318
Boss Tian, am I doing good?

332
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,520
Maybe you can hire me in a long term?

333
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,759
Long term? You're planning to stay?

334
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,919
No, I have to go back...

335
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,079
when I finish the whole boyfriend thing.

336
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,879
Anyway, it's impossible to make money for a while.

337
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,438
Boss Tian, take care of me.

338
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,599
Okay, I'll take care of you.

339
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,999
A bunch of grapes everyday.

340
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,839
No more.

341
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,079
Stingy.

342
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,680
Sweet.

343
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,958
If I make a Vlog about rustic country life,

344
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,478
will netizens be interested?

345
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:55,318
They will, and how about this title...

346
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,358
Big News! Internet Celebrity

347
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,760
Travels All the Way to Sneak A Bite.

348
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,839
You're talented.

349
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,640
Speaking of the devil.

350
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,318
Hello?

351
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,920
A country life Vlog?

352
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,359
Not a bad idea.

353
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:19,359
Way to blaze out a new path.

354
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,799
I like it.

355
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,319
It's so rare you reach out to me for work.

356
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,078
Are you doubting my work ethic?

357
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,958
Of course not.

358
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,039
I'm just trying to recall

359
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,359
how I was able to sign such a wonderful blogger.

360
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,599
Must be my personality charm.

361
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,799
Save it.

362
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,598
What do you want?

363
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,358
I sent you a picture on WeChat.

364
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,919
Post a search notice for me.

365
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,759
What do you have in mind?

366
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,640
Just hurry.

367
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,039
It's supposed to be a girl?

368
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,199
No idea, but it's typical of him to be whimsical.

369
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,438
These are the first bunch.

370
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,719
How about waiting for the second?

371
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,759
I don't understand it.

372
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,159
Such a vivid drawing.

373
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,879
Why can't those people
see that they're not the girl?

374
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,199
Actually... I think...

375
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,718
Check the photos against my drawing before

376
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:42,718
you bring them to me.

377
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,640
Go, and take this.

378
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,000
Yes, sir.

379
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,839
Here you are.

380
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,559
By the way, as for the lunch party tomorrow...

381
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,760
is Professor Zhuang coming?

382
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,159
No, but it's a good thing.

383
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,358
Who knows what they'll say.

384
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,358
I don't wanna lose face in front of him.

385
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,159
How about you don't go either?

386
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,560
No, if I don't go,
the neighbors will think less of my mom.

387
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,439
Then don't worry,
because I won't let anyone bully you.

388
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:28,279
Relax, we're all grown-ups now.

389
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,799
I'm sure they won't be so childish.

390
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,118
Plus, if they're going to say something bad,

391
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,238
it will be how ugly I am,

392
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,880
or nobody will marry a female doctor.

393
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,879
I don't care.

394
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,799
Instead of them,

395
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,160
let's think about how to make our country life vlog.

396
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,199
Good point.

397
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,249
♫ True love for you ♫

398
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,200
♫ Yes, yes ♫

399
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,949
♫ Pretty is you ♫

400
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,500
♫ The one I like ♫

401
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:18,125
♫ You, you, you ♫

402
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,160
Nice breeze.

403
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,640
The electric fan's on?

404
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,839
It's automatic?

405
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,039
Mei, dinner is ready.

406
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,640
Coming.

407
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,199
Hurry.

408
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,859
Coming.

409
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
♫ Follow my heart ♫

410
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380
♫ Everything will be better ♫

411
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,160
Mr. Zhuang...

412
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,718
my sister is off to Er Ya's lunch party,

413
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,119
which she asked me to tell you.

414
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,879
Okay.

415
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,839
Mr. Zhuang...

416
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,159
my sister has a task for you.

417
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,719
She wants you to learn
about her glorious history.

418
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,680
I've already learned about it.

419
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,719
But...

420
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,640
Are those photos of Miss Meiren as a child?

421
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:38,199
Professor Zhuang,
why don't you care about your girlfriend?

422
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,599
Whether I care about her
or not is not your concern.

423
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,358
Professor Zhuang, you don't like me, do you?

424
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,238
Sign on my internship certificate, and I'll leave.

425
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,640
I don't own Qingshui Village.

426
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:52,999
You can leave as you please.

427
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,959
Fine, don't you regret when I'm gone.

428
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,800
Food is coming.

429
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,958
We'll leave after giving him the money.

430
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:40,680
Just ignore them.

431
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,718
I was bullied today, again,

432
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:52,400
by the same guys who made fun of my face.

433
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,680
Ugly girl with clumsy bear forever.

434
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,800
Look, ugly girl has a tail.

435
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:13,400
How did I mix her diary into here?

436
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:19,159
My sister really had a hard time back then.

437
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,879
She never said anything,

438
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,358
but we could tell from
her messy notebook and clothes

439
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,520
that she was bullied.

440
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,598
Really? She could be bullied?

441
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,679
She was not a beauty back then,

442
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,520
but her name literally means beauty,

443
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,799
Her classmates constantly made fun of her.

444
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,639
The dad of today's lunch party,

445
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,160
Gou Xiang, was the worst one.

446
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,239
The guys liked to make jokes
about them being a couple.

447
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:47,319
You can't imagine how furious my sister was.

448
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,919
No kidding, poor...

449
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,919
Gou Xiang, there you are.

450
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,760
Congrats.

451
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,800
Where are you from, beauty?

452
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,199
Isn't my girlfriend beautiful?

453
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,559
Look who's being shy.

454
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,958
You guys were a couple with names

455
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,598
put on the blackboard together.

456
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,639
Don't be shy.

457
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,680
Right on.

458
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,719
No doubt her classmates will be there today.

459
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,238
But this is just my personal opinion.

460
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,199
My sister told me not to disturb you.

461
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,880
So... just forget about it.

462
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,280
It is your idea to make me read her diary.

463
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,040
A girl who hates the past so much

464
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,800
would keep this from others.

465
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:45,359
I'm really worried about her being there alone.

466
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,879
I'll have a cross-cupped wine with Meiren.

467
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,039
Er Ya, this is your child's one-month party.

468
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,519
Are you gonna tolerate this crap?

469
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,238
If you didn't come here showing off,

470
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,559
he wouldn't act like this.

471
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,279
Er Ya, are you serious?

472
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,598
Your mom invited Mei.

473
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,799
We're here to bless you.

474
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,119
How could you be so rude?

475
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,118
Er Ya, calm down.

476
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,999
A ferocious tigeress like Yu Meiren

477
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,039
can never be accepted in a marriage.

478
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,879
You have a husband and a baby.

479
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,318
Much better than her.

480
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,478
- He's right.
- True.

481
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:23,239
Do you know why Lao Zi writes the Tao Te Ching?

482
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,958
What are you suggesting?

483
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,400
Because Lao Zi is happy to.

484
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,919
Come on, we're just kidding.

485
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,719
Can't take a joke like always.

486
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,199
Mei.

487
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Her boyfriend really comes.

488
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:51,880
I just got out of work.

489
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,119
Why did you come without me?

490
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,800
But you said you were busy, why...

491
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,599
Do you know why Lao Zi writes the Tao Te Ching?

492
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,838
You have a boyfriend now.

493
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,838
- Don't forget me.
- What are you looking at?

494
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,639
Where's the red pocket for your nephew?

495
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,319
What?

496
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,318
You have to wait till the party starts?

497
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,479
Don't make me ask.

498
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's all?

499
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,958
I mean, look at your dress,
your shoes, and your bag.

500
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,959
And that's all you are gonna give?

501
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,399
What's she doing here?

502
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,079
Why are you staring at her boyfriend?

503
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,520
Look at Yu Meiren now.

504
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,039
A Doctor, dating a professor.

505
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,559
Mei was real ferocious,
getting in fight constantly.

506
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,639
She also created her own boxing technique,

507
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,519
called... Yu's boxing technique.

508
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,318
Come on, Mei, show it.

509
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,919
Don't listen to him.

510
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,119
There's no such thing.

511
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,280
It's a pity that I didn't meet Mei early.

512
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:05,920
However, I'm her only boyfriend,
from beginning to end.

513
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:10,999
My boyfriend can't drink.

514
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,160
I'll drink for him.

515
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,759
Boyfriend...

516
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,079
Well, jealous?

517
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,958
You spend so much money on skincare.

518
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,000
For what?

519
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,199
Finished.

520
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:36,880
Wait.

521
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,238
I'll drink with Mei.

522
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,118
- Enough.
- Mei...

523
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,400
Come on.

524
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,359
See, high tolerance for wine.

525
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,520
No fermentation flavor.

526
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,118
Anyone who stands close to you

527
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,078
should know this is grape juice.

528
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,358
That's quite impressive.

529
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,839
Whatever, as long as they didn't notice.

530
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,000
Here, have a seat.

531
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,639
Tiantian, stay with him.

532
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,598
I'll go use the toilet.

533
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,560
Okay.

534
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,599
Mom, I have to go.

535
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,760
Without having lunch?

536
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:16,679
Spoiled by the big city,
now you can't eat in our village.

537
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,799
Aunt Gou, who's that?

538
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,318
Mei, don't mind her.

539
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,439
It's Gou Fei.

540
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,718
Are you looking for the toilet?

541
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:25,039
Go that way.

542
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,319
Thank you.

543
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,040
Cheers.

544
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Why does she look so familiar?

545
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,880
You're back, so I'll go say hi to others.

546
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,399
Professor Zhuang,
you've seen enough folk custom.

547
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,520
Shall we leave?

548
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,359
Professor Zhuang, I'm so sorry.

549
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,040
If I had known you are her boyfriend,

550
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,000
I would have been your guide.

551
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,719
It's okay, Uncle Zhang, I understand.

552
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,759
Uncle Zhang, it was my fault.

553
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,880
I should have told him how
popular I am in our village.

554
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,559
Am I seeing right?

555
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,559
My fake boyfriend is smiling.

556
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,679
Come on.

557
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,838
A toast to you two.

558
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,000
Cheers.

559
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,000
It's white liquor.

560
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,279
Mei, what's wrong?

561
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,000
Are you alright?

562
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,358
Uncle Zhang, I'll take her home.

563
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,280
Okay.

564
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,160
Be careful.

565
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:59,599
♫ Migrant birds fly into the forest ♫

566
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,749
♫ Passing through beams of light ♫

567
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,749
♫ Meet with the bright weather ♫

568
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,060
♫ Meet with the best one ♫

569
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,850
♫ An unexpected response ♫

570
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,560
You...

571
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,800
I have been nice enough.

572
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,999
Take the win.

573
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,039
How do you know I'm not drunk?

574
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,399
You can't drink wine,
yet you drank up the white liquor.

575
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,279
You must have been prepared.

576
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,838
Impressive, Professor Zhuang.

577
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,399
You know me well.

578
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,838
Despite your icy appearance, you can be

579
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,718
counted on at critical times.

580
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,238
Just playing my part.

581
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:44,718
You played it well.

582
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:48,599
Like a superhero surrounded
by colorful auspicious clouds.

583
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,039
Still, I can't compete with you,

584
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,599
the creator of Yu's boxing technique.

585
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,318
I don't do boxing.

586
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,919
I'm gentle and tender.

587
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,160
Anyway,
thank you for getting me out of the trouble.

588
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,760
You knew it was trouble.

589
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
Why went to it?

590
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,438
I didn't want to.

591
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:09,958
But I was already there,

592
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:13,000
I couldn't run away without a fight.

593
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,599
Besides, I have help sent by god.

594
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,519
Last night, I observed the stars,

595
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,159
and found that god would send me help
at a critical moment.

596
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,478
Professor Zhuang, you did a good thing to help me.

597
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,198
Don't be shy.

598
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,718
Wait, Professor Zhuang, here.

599
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,080
Have some water.

600
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,600
I also found that you like drinking water.

601
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,119
70% of me is made up of water.

602
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,840
You like drinking water,
which means you like 70% of me.

603
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,840
Then you two have a lot in common.

604
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,119
You... what do you mean?

605
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,398
So... star observer,

606
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,519
how about you figure out
if we go to the mountain at 7 am tomorrow,

607
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,999
when should you get up?

608
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,199
7 am? That's too early.

609
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:08,000
How about... one hour later?

610
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,120
No.

611
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Wait... 30 minutes later?

612
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,479
15 minutes?

613
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,238
Fine, ten minutes?

614
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,359
10... 9 minutes?

615
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,879
8?

616
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,279
7?

617
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,800
5 minutes?

618
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,678
Come in, please.

619
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,158
Professor Zhuang, I asked around.

620
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,559
On every research trip,
besides the plant species,

621
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,439
you also sample the soil.

622
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,638
Is this the purple soil?

623
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,360
May I get that for you?

624
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:54,918
Isn't it a great idea?

625
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,679
This way, we'll both have something to do.

626
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,800
I took a walk in the town today,
and bought some snacks.

627
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,478
Bribing the examiner won't help you pass the exam.

628
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:11,359
Come on, it's not for you, Professor Zhuang.

629
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,479
I just wanna ask you about
snacks Miss Meiren likes.

630
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Why did you show him this?

631
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,560
What?

632
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,679
I said...

633
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,000
why did you show him this?

634
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:33,319
So you know.

635
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,158
Put it away if you don't want me to know.

636
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,319
I walked in, and the album
was right there on the desk.

637
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,000
Easy to figure out.

638
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,959
He turned in early last night,

639
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:43,359
without seeing your photos.

640
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,679
I... I just wanted to tell him
about your glorious history.

641
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,399
But I didn't mean to give him your diary.

642
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:57,280
Seeing you smile so happily,
I'm happy, too.

643
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,519
Don't be angry, or worried.

644
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,319
I'm sure he won't laugh at
you because of what you wrote.

645
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,839
Worried? Please, my writing was so good

646
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,438
that they can be published for students to read.

647
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,800
Why should I be worried?

648
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,198
Thanks for your concern.

649
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,158
Here.

650
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,760
All yours.

651
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,520
Hello everybody, this is Mermaid With Long Legs.

652
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,359
Mermaid With Long Legs?

653
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,239
What's that?

654
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,839
A video to help Tiantian sell grapes.

655
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,718
Her grapes aren't selling very well.

656
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,519
So I want to send the video
to the school's online group chat,

657
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,678
and get my students to buy them.

658
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,840
Sounds complicated.

659
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,079
Good sister, keep playing.

660
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,560
I want to hear what Tiantian said.

661
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:50,478
An enthusiastic admirer she doesn't know.

662
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:52,158
Why don't you show it in front of her?

663
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:54,319
I don't know what you're talking about.

664
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,999
Please, I can see right through you.

665
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,799
But from what I know of Tiantian,

666
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,878
you don't stand much chance.

667
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,198
Why?

668
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,718
In TV series, girls always choose

669
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,799
a surprise romance over a childhood friend.

670
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,000
Well... but there's still hope for me, right?

671
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,158
Um... there's always hope.

672
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,638
Depends on how hard you try.

673
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,320
After all,
enough efforts will set an old house on fire.

674
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:20,759
Old house?

675
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,119
Yes, those who give all efforts will never regret.

676
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,959
I'm rooting for you.

677
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,479
Miss Meiren.

678
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,839
For me?

679
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,159
Yes, I was in town,
and bought your favorite snack.

680
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,119
Cake with five-nut filling?

681
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,199
Right, is it inauthentically flavored?

682
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,319
My sister never eats cakes with five-nut filling.

683
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,158
She would force it to me whenever she was given one.

684
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:53,999
Really?

685
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,760
Professor Zhuang said
that it is her favorite snack.

686
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,600
Celery.

687
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:04,520
Leeks.

688
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:07,039
And ginger.

689
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,919
All his favorite.

690
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,958
Damn fake boyfriend.

691
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,760
All his wits go to hold grudges.

692
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,359
Why is there such anti-human dark cuisine

693
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,320
as the cake with five-nut filling?

694
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,718
Wait and see.

695
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,840
I'll make you pay.

696
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,520
Would you like to share the umbrella with me?

697
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,800
This way, please.

698
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:20,840
President Jin, that's the last one for today.

699
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,639
Still no?

700
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,279
Today's coffee isn't strong enough.

701
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,918
Since Lili dropped by, you asked me

702
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:29,600
to replace the coffee machine
with the water fountain.

703
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,679
Exactly.

704
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,439
Pure water.

705
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,159
I'm looking for a girl like pure water.

706
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,439
Sweet aftertaste, long-lasting appeal.

707
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,079
Pure water is fantastic.

708
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,040
So fantastic.

709
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,239
Get me a glass of pure water.

710
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:36,679
What a beautiful day.

711
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,119
Setting off at 7 am.

712
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,280
He must have been ready by now.

713
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,679
Professor Zhuang!

714
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,560
Professor Zhuang, I'm coming.

715
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,599

00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,124

00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,929
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

732
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,730
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

733
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:58,579
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

734
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:03,450
♫ Heatbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

735
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,599
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

736
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,999
♫ You show up in my sight ♫

737
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,899
♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

738
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,330
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

739
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,199
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

740
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,649
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

741
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,649
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

742
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,349
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

743
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:40,329
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

744
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:46,049
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

745
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:51,279
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

746
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,699
♫ Heatbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

747
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,679
♫ You make all the stars in the sky shine for me ♫

748
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,379
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

749
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,249
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

750
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:17,630
♫ Even the air is filled with the scent of flowers ♫
