[Episode 29]
[But I'm pursuing more than this.]

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,829
Thankfully, we arrived in time.

25
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,659
They need treatment.

26
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,380
Exactly.

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,750
You've worked hard.

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,230
Yes, captain.

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,660
Right.

30
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,030
Get up.

31
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,180
Zhuang Yu.

32
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,429
Are you alright? Zhuang Yu?

33
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,260
Help! Help him!

[Three days later]

35
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,980
It is so touching.

36
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,619
For love,

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,739
I will sacrifice my life.

38
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,539
He'd save you with his life.

39
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,069
It must be true love.

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,589
The hero came to the rescue.

41
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,510
That's an unforgettable scene.

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,789
I don't want it at all.

43
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,309
I just want him to be safe.

44
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,739
It's a natural instinct

45
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,789
for someone who loves you.

46
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,230
Don't blame yourself.

47
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,699
Volunteers disguised

48
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,619
as the buyers who came for the birds

49
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,339
and got into the den

50
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,539
of the wildlife smuggling criminals.

51
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,099
Brave and clever as he is,

52
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,389
he cooperated with the police

53
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,149
and capture the criminals on sight.

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,790
It was a great success.

55
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,310
Yu, that's a heroic undertaking.

56
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,620
Magnificent.

57
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,429
Don't worry.

58
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,459
I will take your turn

59
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,670
and stand at the post
of Artemisia annua cultivation.

60
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,700
Stop it.

61
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,100
What's wrong?

62
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,389
I need a break.

63
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,669
Hold on. Wait.

64
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,819
Where are you heading? I'll lead the nurse in.

65
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,070
Take a walk.

66
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,019
You just got wounded. Slow down.

67
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,549
First of all, it's only a bruise.

68
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,140
What's the difference? It is serious.

69
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,139
Second, I could still walk.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,949
You must take it seriously.

71
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,269
The doctor said you had a severe head injury.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,579
You might suffer from a cerebral concussion.

73
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,670
You need rest.

74
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,579
What are the symptoms of a concussion?

75
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,389
Let me think.

76
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,829
What did the doctor say?

77
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,019
Temporary coma, retrograde amnesia.

78
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,710
Syncope, nausea.

79
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,739
Please be serious.

80
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,269
There could be an incubation.

81
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,339
If your brain is damaged,

82
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,620
you'd never find yourself a date.

83
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,339
Just do as I say. You'd better go back.

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,180
Why would I?

85
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,389
Lie in the bed. It's good for your brain.

86
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,900
Stop making fun of me.

87
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,989
Did you make up with Yu?

88
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,139
Make up with her?

89
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,709
We were never an item. Stop it.

90
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,579
He saved your life!

91
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,389
It's only a matter of time.

92
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,989
My life was at risk.

93
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,989
I didn't get to think

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,950
about my relationship.

95
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,740
So...

96
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,740
You didn't talk to her, nor did she to you.

97
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,020
I wanted to.

98
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,420
But I didn't have the chance.

99
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,069
- I want to say...
- I know, it hurts. Right?

100
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,419
Hang in there,
we'll arrive at the hospital soon.

101
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,070
It's not about that.

102
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,299
Nurse, is there anything you could do

103
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,859
to ease his pain?

104
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,989
I'm not.

105
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,619
I get it.

106
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,989
You must be painful.

107
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,899
It's alright.

108
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,550
You can tell me about it.

109
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,389
You have no idea what it was like.

110
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,789
Even for a proud man like him,

111
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,459
he was too painful to say a word.

112
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,139
Yeah, he is badly wounded.

113
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,419
What did the doctor say?

114
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Do we have Zhuang Yu's family members?

115
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,459
Doctor, how is he?

116
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,899
We don't have much equipment or medicine here.

117
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,789
We could only apply some emergency treatment.

118
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,069
I suggest that you take him

119
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,580
to a larger hospital for a thorough inspection.

120
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,550
Are you Zhuang Yu's wife?

121
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,070
We weren't married.

122
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,459
Not married yet.

123
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,179
It's not like that.

124
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,459
I get it.

125
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,300
That's what the young do.

126
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,789
I'll teach you

127
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,300
how to take care of his wounds.

128
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
She didn't deny it!

129
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,859
That seemed promising.

130
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,459
You ought to take the chance

131
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,580
and march forward.

132
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,270
Of course.

133
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,550
Good for you.

134
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,899
It's said that

135
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,179
being sick would make you smarter.

136
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,900
That is true, isn't it?

137
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,950
What did I just say?

138
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,420
Sago cycas is blooming.
That's once in a lifetime.

139
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,020
Take a closer look at it.

140
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,390
It's the same plant.

141
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,420
But it's misunderstood by the viewer.

142
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,620
Mei.

143
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,340
You're awake.

You've been burning for days!

145
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,779
The doctor says

146
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,069
the large wound is infected.

147
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,540
You scared me a lot!

148
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,510
I thought you'd never wake up.

149
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,910
I feel...

150
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,860
great.

151
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,219

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,029

If you talk like that again,

196

00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,949
being waited on hand and foot.

375
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,660
Is that the life that a scientist pursues?

376
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,540
I am pursuing.

377
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,870
But I'm pursuing more than this.

378
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,659
I stewed the chicken soup for one hour.

379
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,500
Then steamed it with the pumpkin
for another 30 minutes.

380
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,469
Did you make this?

381
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,869
I got that from you.

382
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,109
Is it good?

383
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,499
What my teacher's wife made

384
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,259
must be great!

385
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,180
Boss.

386
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,419
Hi, Mrs. Zhuang.

387
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,709
Hello.

388
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,660
I'll leave it here.

389
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,229
Boss, I could finally meet you.

390
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,589
Director Li said you had a bad fever.

391
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,539
And you were in a coma.

392
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,259
We were worried about you.

393
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,659
Upon hearing that you're awake,

394
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,710
we're here to check on you.

395
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,589
Boss.

396
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,629
Looks like

397
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,780
you're doing great.

398
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,869
Mrs. Zhuang takes care of him.

399
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,829
No wonder he looks great.

400
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,899
Don't you say?

401
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,779
By the way,

402
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,660
how did you get injured?

403
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,300
I was too careless.

404
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,830
The criminals were cunning.

405
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,350
I could have been more careful.

406
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,500
Anyway, the injury is worth it.

407
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,300
I've saved

408
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,539
many innocent wild birds.

409
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,659
I know. That's a noble moral principle!

410
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,380
- Your noble character is like a mountain.
- I can't help but follow your behavior.

411
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,300
Tiantian.

412
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,900
Let me explain.

413
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,990
I'm listening.

414
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,990
I...

415
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,630
I left without telling you.

416
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,710
It's for a reason. I didn't mean it.

417
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,259
It's something urgent with my company.

418
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,110
- I had to show up in person.
- Jin Xi.

419
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,540
Look at me.

420
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,230
Tell me where you have been.

421
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,350
Well...

422
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,989
It's confidential. I couldn't tell you.

423
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,749
What's so urgent

424
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,989
that you couldn't even make a call?

425
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,380
Did you go to Mars?

426
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,380
It's not like that.

427
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,300
The signal there was not good.

428
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,020
No signal.

429
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,180
So you couldn't call me.

430
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,900
But you did call Zhou, right?

431
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,630
Believe me, Tiantian.

432
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,710
I believed you before.

433
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,500
I thought

434
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,500
you'd be different this time.

435
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,110
It was my fault.

436
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,500
Tiantian, listen to me.

437
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,950
♫ The star is hiding away from the moon ♫

438
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,179
♫ We just let it go ♫

439
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,900
Just leave.

440
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,350
Don't come to me again.

441
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,470
Tiantian.

442
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,350
♫ The rain drops on my faces ♫

443
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,530
♫ It is caring about me ♫

444
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,289
♫ How I wish to stand by your side ♫

445
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,809
♫ and lean on your shoulder ♫

446
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:12,269
♫ How I cherish the moment we spent together ♫

447
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,609
♫ If I could ♫

448
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,539
♫ I want to put on a smile ♫

449
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,630
After a few days,

450
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,830
the flowers are blooming now.

451
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,900
It takes a long time for them to bloom.

452
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,180
But they wither in a short time.

453
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,750
So is love.

454
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,509
♫ How I wish to stand by your side ♫

455
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,489
♫ and lean on your shoulder ♫

456
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,769
♫ How I cherish the moment we spent together ♫

457
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,129
♫ I'm tired of pretending ♫

458
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,589
♫ Turns out, it was the happiest moment ♫

459
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:13,250
♫ when we sit together enjoying the starry night ♫

460
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,629
Why are you silent all of a sudden?

461
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,539
I thought you were holding a commendation conference.

462
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,379
You've ruined our mood. I couldn't think of
any commentary terms.

463
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,629
That's right.

464
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,709
Even if you could,

465
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,990
the terms are not qualified for me.

466
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,419
All I have for you are derogatory terms!

467
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,469
Qi, look at him.

468
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,869
Stop it.

469
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,949
Haven't you had quarrels enough with me?

470
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,139
You're no match.

471
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,749
Lv is a worthy opponent.

472
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,869
Director Li.

473
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,710
You're all present.

474
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,709
Alright, that's it.

475
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,539
You've met Zhuang.

476
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,779
You should go back.

477
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,259
Zhuang needs more rest.

478
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,349
Hurry up.

479
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,829
Goodbye, boss.

480
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,749
Meiren, don't you have a class this afternoon?

481
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,589
I'll send you back.

482
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,950
Right, I need to go back to school.

483
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,419
No, no.

484
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,779
I didn't mean to tell him.

485
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,019
I met him on the way here.

486
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,350
I didn't mean to tell him that.

487
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,420
I mean it.

488
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,749
I cough a lot recently.

489
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,659
I don't talk much at all.

490
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,350
I mean it.

491
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,990
- Shall we go?
- No!

492
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,590
I'll go by myself.

493
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,630
Meiren, what happened to your throat?

494
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,709
You're heading back to school.

495
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,869
So are we.

496
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,629
Give us a lift.

497
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,539
It's a small favor.

498
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,750
Better no excuse for that.

499
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,379
Let's go.

500
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,069
Bye, boss. Bye, Director Li.

501
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,230
No, I'm not heading that way.

502
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,470
What are you thinking?

503
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,419
I want to be discharged.

504
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,899
How could you?

505
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,299
The doctor says you need rest.

506
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,500
Where are you going?

507
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,989
Just leave it there.

508
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,590
I can take care of it.

509
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,419
Look at you.

510
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,539
You're being overly responsible.

511
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,659
It's summer vacation now.

512
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,899
The school doesn't function with or without you.

513
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,869
Is that so?

514
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,949
Fine, it doesn't need me.

515
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,419
But it couldn't function well without you.

516
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,299
Talents like you

517
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,499
are backbones of the country.

518
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,350
It's my obligation to take care of you.

519
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,590
You're being overly responsible, too.

520
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,379
You're a meticulous man.

521
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,139
Now, you've got only one arm to use.

522
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,899
It is inconvenient.

523
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,350
I have to look after you.

524
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,540
How about me moving in?

525
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,900
That's so considerate of you.

526
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,070
Have you found a date?

527
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,019
It has nothing to do with that.

528
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,950
Just let it be. I'm not in a hurry.

529
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,710
I see!

530
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,379
I get it. Alright.

531
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,949
I've got a meeting this afternoon.

532
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,179
I must set off now.

533
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,780
I'm leaving.

534
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,500
Let it be?

535
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,070
[Yu's Wechat Moment: Gradually]

536
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,419
What would you have for dinner?

537
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,380
Shall I help you out?

538
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,779
Fine, I'm leaving.

539
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,630
This time, for real.

540
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,869
Jin.

541
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,539
Madam.

542
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,229
What's up? Something wrong with the food?

543
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:19,900
Not at all.

544
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,539
I've lost my appetite.

545
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,259
Here.

546
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,539
Try this syrup of plum, I made it.

547
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,350
- It's appetizing.
- Thank you.

548
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,180
You must be busy recently.

549
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,750
You've lost weight.

550
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,749
We met one year ago,

551
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,899
when Meiren came back.

552
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,230
Right, you have a good memory.

553
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,629
And you're Meiren's...

554
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,780
We're colleagues.

555
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,829
Meiren must have caused you some trouble.

556
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,299
Not at all. If it wasn't for her,

557
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,870
my company would not function at all.

558
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,229

But I understand her.

560
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,990
For a doctor, this job isn't very...

561
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,899
Oh! I...

562
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,379
I said we were colleagues...

563
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,630

564
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,469

565
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:16,299
for birds' protection.

566
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,139
Meiren worked for me as my consultant.

567

571
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,109
Not at all. I'm not nervous.

572
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,780
Now that you're Meiren's friend,

573
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,420
I'll take you as my family. May I?

574
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,829
Tell me about it.

575
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,630
You're not here for Meiren this time, right?

576
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,230
Right.

577
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,750
I'm here for someone else.

578
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,829
But I failed.

579
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,830
Why?

580
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,260
I lied to her.

581
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,179
Do you know the saying?

582
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,660
A lie could be comforting for a short period.

583
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,590
But true love will face the truth bravely.

584
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,230

Smart as the fox is,

631

♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

750
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,819
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

751
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,819
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

752
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,070
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

753
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:25,919
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

754
