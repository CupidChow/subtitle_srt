[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,899
[Episode 18]
[Nothing has shaken my pursuit of profession.]

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,318
Explain the WeChat thing by the way.

25
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,558
WeChat?

26
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,799
What?

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,799
It's me who sent the message to you.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,060
That's why I made a typo.

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,838
What's the score of your Chinese final exam?

30
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,700
Over 90 scores.

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,620
Don't always mention the past.

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,499
Thank you. Anyhow, he's not that rich

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,079
so don't always spend on me.

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,940
You can save money to buy some models.

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,700
Don't worry about that.

36
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,359
We'll have a hot pot at home.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,220
No cost.

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,460
That would be better.

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,918
Though their date
has been made several days ago...

40
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,199
it's my birthday.

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,239
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you, dear.

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,719
Here you are. Do you like it?

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,060
I like whatever you send to me.

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,918
Hello, Meinan.

45
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,319
Tiantian, happy birthday!

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,460
Thank you.

47
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,740
Where are you? At my home?

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,558
Grandma!

49
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,678
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

50
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,118
How do you feel recently?

51
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,198
Not bad.

52
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,629
You've asked about it a few days ago.

53
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,339
Meinan has helped me with the housework

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,799
so you can be at ease.

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,420
Thank you so much. You've worked hard.

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,340
It's what I should do.

57
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,220
Tiantian...

58
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:15,038
How will you spend your birthday?

59
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,500
Has Meiren arranged it for you?

60
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,420
I...

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,220
She should arrive...

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,059
It's noisy on the road.

63
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,180
Take care of yourself.
Take a taxi and I'll pay for it.

64
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,719
Of course, she has. It's my birthday, isn't it?

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,459
I'm now on the way to the restaurant.

66
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,020
What about the hearing aid?

67
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,719
Don't worry. It's here.

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,700
Miss Tian...

69
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,779
- I want to tell you that...
- Hold on a second.

70
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,879
It's getting late so I have to go now.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,580
Let's chat later. Bye bye.

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,539
Fine. Happy birthday to you again.

73
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,999
Bye bye.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,358
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

75
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,940
She's so hasty.

76
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,279
Brother.

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,819
We told her to have lunch, right?

78
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,740
Should we make a call to her?

79
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,579
Don't you know not
to urge a girl who's dressing up?

80
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,060
You really know a lot.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,479
Why are you here?

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,100
The hot pot smells so good.

83
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,798
Well, when I thought to come here, I met them.

84
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,599
More people, more fun.

85
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,039
So I invited them to come.

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,549
Lv always behaves stealthily at lunchtime.

87
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,279
So Qi and I followed him here.

88
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,859
We carried some vegetables with us.

89
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,269
You're stealthy!

90
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,340
So boring.

91
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,678
Boss.

92
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,069
Will we ruin your date time?

93
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,219
Come inside.

94
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,899
Zhuang Hui.

95
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,940
Serve the dish.

96
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,820
With deep sulci again?

97
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,278
What's the difference?

98
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,380
He doesn't like eating
pig brains with shallow sulci.

99
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,579
What did you say?

100
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,499
He doesn't like eating
pig brains with shallow sulci.

101
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,639
He thinks deep ones are chewy.

102
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,379
I don't know what he thinks.

103
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,860
I can't find their difference.

104
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,859
Why didn't go dating her?

105
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,949
I thought you would like it.

106
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,620
I'm not interested in shallow sulci.

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,669
So disgusting.

108
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,159
Don't put them in front of Miss Meiren.

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,340
Let me move them away.

110
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,580
Come and help us.

111
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,180
Do you like eating pig brains?

112
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,079
The red-oil brain of Huaguang University
was quite famous, right?

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,319
Only small steamed buns can compare with it.

114
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,260
That's it. And he always eats deep sulci ones.

115
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,180
You all know that?

116
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,319
Boss must bring you to decent restaurants.

117
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,259
He might mind bringing you to the canteen.

118
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,269
- Am I right?
- Yes!

119
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,380
So it's hard for you to know that.

120
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,820
You dislike it?

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,700
No. I love it.

122
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,740
Here's the whole live broadcast studio.

123
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,460
This way, please.

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,820
Are you ready?

125
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,039
Why are we here?

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,919
A charitable activity here.
To experience the job of a forecaster.

127
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,799
I thought you would like it.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,959
So it's not working overtime.

129
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,420
You just want to fulfill my dream?

130
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,039
But I'm wearing in...

131
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,100
Director Zhang.

132
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,260
Miss Li, this way, please.

133
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,460
Where will I go?

134
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,140
Steamer Li's dressing room.

135
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,639
What about you?

136
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,619
Don't worry. I'm here waiting for you.

137
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,340
Go ahead.

138
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,580
I can't wait.

139
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,420
Thank you.

140
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,839
It's not boiling. Shall we play a game first?

141
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,919
Never Have I. Have you played before?

142
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,020
Childish.

143
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,740
What "I"?

144
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,119
Oh, come on. Does the lab drive you numb?

145
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,798
Even the pupil knows it.

146
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,519
He's sinking in scholarliness.

147
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,580
I'll play with you.

148
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,620
Miss Meiren, will you join us?

149
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
Yes!

150
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,379
Let me introduce the rules first.

151
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,359
Everyone needs to extend a hand.

152
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,119
Ni Ke will be the first.

153
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,839
You need to start with
"Never have I done something before".

154
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,579
Tell us what you've never done before.

155
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,039
If someone else has done it before,

156
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,718
he or she needs to put one finger back.

157
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:34,759
Whoever puts back all fingers
needs to have a drink.

158
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,469
Pupils can understand it.

159
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,100
- How can't we understand?
- That's it!

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,740
Professor Zhuang... Will you join us?

161
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,540
Come on!

162
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,419
Zhuang Hui is a child
so pay attention to your words.

163
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,439
It seems you know it well.

164
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,959
Don't worry. I won't let
restricted-16 things exist.

165
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,700
Besides,
I'm juvenile so I can't drink if I lose.

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,260
Eat it if you lose.

167
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,300
It's showtime. Action!

168
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,939
- Here's the script.
- Thank you.

169
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,519
Miss Jiang will make a speech

170
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,179
on the introduction of the activity first.

171
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,478
After he finishes,

172
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,079
All the contestants will
broadcast the scrips one by one.

173
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,279
Don't be anxious.

174
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,349
The prompter is there.

175
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,599
Just get familiar with it.

176
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,980
I see. Thank you.

177
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,340
I can't show you my ability as a child is here.

178
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,599
Hurry! Don't flirt with each other!

179
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,980
Otherwise you drop.

180
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,540
Never have I slept in class.

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,619
Be sincere, okay?

182
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,039
Have you slept in class?

183
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,439
Don't try to show yourself!

184
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,999
Though my beauty will mislead you,

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,119
actually, I study pretty hard, okay?

186
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,740
- Next.
- My turn.

187
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,820
Never have I failed to sleep because of noises.

188
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,718
I see. The class is too noisy for you to sleep!

189
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,140
Can't it be that my home is noisy?

190
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,380
Boss. Why did you draw back two fingers?

191
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,180
It's normal to sleep in class
as it's too noisy last night.

192
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,340
When has he become so easygoing?

193
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,359
He's changed a lot
after being together with her.

194
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,118
The reason why you are so cold as a rule is that

195
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,820
you're too tired to keep enthusiastic, right?

196
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,718
His bedroom is soundproof.

197
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,340
He sleeps well every night.

198
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:58,580
Except for the unexpected guest coming here.

199
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,158
Forget it. It's my turn.

200
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,660
Never have I taken an economics class.

201
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,038
Mind your words.

202
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,038
You're edging to the red line.

203
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,118
What red line?

204
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,820
Is it the red line from the matchmaker?

205
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,678
Why did you take back so many fingers?

206
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,580
It shows that... the
game is suitable for me.

207
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,780
Are you sure?

208
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,900
Time to eat!

209
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,580
Great!

210
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,380
Here you are.

211
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,740
- I have to work first.
- Okay.

212
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,940
She's the forecaster on television!

213
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,900
She's so pretty and charming!

214
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,620
You're prettier than her.

215
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,918
Be ready?

216
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,038
It's time to start.

217
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,140
Come on. Cheer up!

218
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,718
Hi, everyone.

219
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,719
Welcome to today's weather report.

220
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,959
It'll be cloudy to overcast in Shanghai tomorrow.

221
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,598
Later, there will be rain or thunderstorm.

222
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,399
Please remember to carry rain gears with you,

223
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,140
preventing yourself from catching a cold.

224
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,158
The temperature tomorrow
will be 20 to 30 degrees.

225
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,279
Really a big gap.

226
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,999
Don't forget to put on more clothes
in the morning and evening.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,639
Pay more attention to the temperature.

228
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,479
There are more windy days coming recently.

229
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,079
Pay attention to the protection outside.

230
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,598
Hope you have a nice day.

231
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,909
That's all for today.

232
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,940
See you tomorrow.

233
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,399
What are you digging up here?

234
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,820
Brains.

235
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,540
She likes meat.

236
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,879
We haven't finished the game, yet.

237
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,140
- Whose turn?
- Mine.

238
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,620
Well...

239
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,420
Never have I had college homework.

240
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,759
You've gone too far.

241
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,419
Why are you fussy about a pupil?

242
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,598
That's it.

243
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,158
Have you done your homework before?

244
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,540
Nonsense. Next.

245
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,158
Nothing has shaken my pursuit of profession.

246
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,158
Professor Zhuang, why did you mention it?

247
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,479
Is it your oath-rite?

248
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,319
How can you be as insightful as him?

249
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,669
- My turn!
- What do you want?

250
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,820
My turn now!

251
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,579
Never have I made an appointment with a girl

252
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,559
and then stood her up at college.

253
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,260
Your statement is quite particular.

254
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,740
You haven't made appointments with girls?

255
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,340
I haven't stood girls up.

256
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,539
Finished?

257
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,660
Come on. I lose.

258
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,900
Hadn't he read my letter?

259
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,999
- Here you are.
- Fine.

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,839
I lost to Meiren...

261
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,020
I really admire her.

262
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,049
You should say you admit defeat.

263
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,239
A crushing defeat.

264
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,479
Knock off.

265
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,339
- You can leave now.
- Thank you so much.

266
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,238
- Kids, we can leave now.
- Bye-bye.

267
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm so happy today.

268
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,500
You'll have another chance.

269
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,260
Happy birthday.

270
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,140
You know that?

271
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,700
So... this is my birthday gift, right?

272
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,740
You know my birthday?

273
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,540
Thank you.

274
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,439
Actually, a long time ago, I...

275
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,319
President Jin and Steamer Jiang?

276
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,598
She's his old sweetheart.

277
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,598
A few days ago, he came to find her

278
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,319
and no one was allowed to be present.

279
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,319
They had stayed in the room for a long while.

280
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,639
Really?

281
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,839
Right here? What were they doing?

282
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,999
What else could they do?

283
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
Everyone knows that.

284
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,598
Everyone knows it?

285
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,199
Why don't I know it?

286
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,460
Well... forget it.

287
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,220
Shall I see you off?

288
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,820
Well...

289
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,780
Shall we leave?

290
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,319
We'll see ourselves out.

291
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,118
Sorry, we've helped you nothing.

292
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:04,559
Never mind. You still need to go back to school.

293
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,078
I can stay here and help him.

294
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,039
Boss, your slicing skills are superb.

295
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,779
Only know to fawn on him.

296
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,999
Miss Meiren, let me stay here and help you.

297
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,279
No thanks. Only several plates.

298
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,980
Freshmen should leave others a good impression.

299
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,460
Fine.

300
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,318
Bye bye.

301
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,619
- Then we're leaving.
- Boss, see you.

302
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,198
Goodbye, boss and Ms. Zhuang.

303
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,559
Bye.

304
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,959
- Goodbye, Miss Meiren.
- Bye.

305
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,980
Hurry up.

306
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,100
Rock, paper, scissors.
The loser will wash the dishes.

307
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,740
Let me wash them.

308
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,059
I'm so embarrassed.

309
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,358
I've been staying for free lunch
and doing nothing here for days.

310
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,780
We're so close, not strangers.

311
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,340
You're welcome.

312
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,359
I've never seen you wash a bowl.

313
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,380
So?

314
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,959
So I can't rest my heart.

315
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,980
Have a rest.

316
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,639
You've just lost the game
and had two glasses of wine

317
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,100
so I'm afraid you can't keep your feet.

318
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,879
Lose?

319
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,380
Isn't it the winner who drinks it?

320
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,660
Do you really know the game?

321
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,379
Please enjoy your meal.

322
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,419
Thank you.

323
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,020
Hungry? Have something first.

324
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,780
Thank you so much. Sorry to have bothered you.

325
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,420
You really care about her.

326
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,220
You flatter me.

327
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,540
Just take that thing as our secret.

328
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,540
It's fine. I don't mind if you tell them.

329
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,500
It's up to you.

330
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,940
Tiantian.

331
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
President Jin.

332
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,438
I'm not hungry. You can eat first.

333
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,198
I'll send you back as you're full.

334
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:28,479
What's the matter with you?
Are you uncomfortable?

335
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,598
No. I'm fine.

336
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,959
Maybe it's stuffy here.

337
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,300
I want to get some fresh air outside.

338
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,140
- Sir!
- The cake is still here.

339
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,519
Pack the cake. I'll carry it.

340
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,429
Pay the bill on credit first. Hurry!

341
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,460
I see.

342
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,039
They're perfectly matched.

343
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,500
How can a monster like you stop them?

344
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,740
What's wrong?

345
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,540
You finished? Let me send you back.

346
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,420
Are you angry?

347
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:38,260
How could I be unhappy with the big present?

348
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,460
How can I deserve you
to beg your ex-girlfriend?

349
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,260
- Are you angry about it?
- Yes.

350
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,500
No! I'm not angry. I'm so glad now!

351
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,900
Are you too happy to eat?

352
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,919
Yes.

353
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,060
Can't I?

354
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,859
She's not my ex-girlfriend.

355
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,039
I know.

356
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,340
I misunderstood.

357
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,838
After all, not all your sweethearts

358
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,139
can be entitled to be your girlfriend.

359
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,699
I have no love affairs with her.

360
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,900
Though my hearing is poor,
I think I can hear their words.

361
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,140
You can't be decided by hearsay.

362
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,899
I'm deaf, not blind.

363
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,879
You two look so close.

364
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,860
Are you going to tell me
it's your first day to know each other?

365
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,059
We could only be old friends at last.

366
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,820
Not the relationship in your imagination.

367
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,900
Jiang Wenjing came to my firm to find me

368
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,259
when she just graduated.

369
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,019
She thought the competition
between platforms was too fierce

370
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,779
so she wanted to be a signed blogger.

371
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,279
She has good qualifications
and professional training.

372
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,399
She could have a better future on big platforms.

373
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,019
Then I refused her to join.

374
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,679
Anyway, she still insisted.

375
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,839
She worked as an intern
in my firm for a month,

376
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,019
coping with chores,
but I still persuaded her to leave.

377
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,380
She could go all out
so what else couldn't she complete?

378
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,740
It seems that I'm right.

379
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,700
- Is that all?
- Yes.

380
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,940
If you don't believe it, you can ask Linda.

381
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,979
But why did they say
you stayed in the room quite long?

382
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,900
What did you do?

383
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,358
Actually, Jiang Wenjing is a nice person

384
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,019
but she bears grudges.

385
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,420
When I went to find her that day,

386
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:47,318
she asked me to clean the preparation room

387
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,620
till she was satisfied with it.

388
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:52,260
The compensation of being my intern.

389
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,739
I haven't labored for so long.

390
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,740
It took a long time.

391
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,020
Can you blow out your candle
and have the cake now?

392
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,099
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

393
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,279
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

394
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,140
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

395
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,220
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

396
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,659
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

397
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,919
♫ You show up in my sight ♫

398
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,919
♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

399
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,859
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

400
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,419
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

401
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,559
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

402
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,699
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

403
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,659
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

404
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,860
What are you thinking of?

405
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,540
I'm watching birds. So beautiful.

406
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,279
You can watch them on the sofa.

407
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,540
No. The angle here is pretty nice.

408
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,279
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

409
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,079
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

410
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,100
Let me help you.

411
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,718
Let me interview you, Professor Zhuang.

412
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:53,900
There should be many girls confessing
or sending love letters to you, right?

413
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,199
I don't know.

414
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,460
You don't know?

415
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,420
Maybe a few.

416
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,540
Li would collect
what was delivered to the lab for me.

417
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,220
I have no impression.

418
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,860
So you've read none of the letters?

419
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,859
And you've made no appointment with anyone?

420
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,940
I have no time.

421
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,620
Come on. How could you
disrespect others so much?

422
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,420
You've been stood up by boys before?

423
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,078
How could it be?

424
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,660
Others were eager to send love letters to me.

425
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:40,580
Girls like me have busy schedules to meet...

426
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,260
What are you doing?

427
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,500
I'm making a glass of tea.

428
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,580
To "enjoy" your stories.

429
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,419
What stories?

430
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,339
Met a new boy every three days.

431
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,260
So you should have
at least 487 stories during your college.

432
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,859
I've already finished...

433
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,100
Finished?

434
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,460
Then what did I learn?

435
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,100
Shall you speak again with your microphone?

436
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,980
I do have a story of being stood up.

437
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,180
I... want to say...

438
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,260
I want to ask you...

439
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,580
Wait a moment.

440
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,940
[Mail from PMB UYC.]

441
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,340
- I need to...
- I haven't...

442
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,519
I don't know how to tell you.

443
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,319
Can we talk about it another time?

444
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,820
Fine, and I have something to deal with.

445
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,479
I need to go back to school now.

446
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,580
Let's find another time.

447
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,300
It might rain soon.
Take an umbrella with you.

448
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,598
Meiren, come here!

449
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,820
Let's play together.

450
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,639
Okay.

451
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,819
- What should I do?
- Put it here.

452
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,220
And I'll put this one here.

453
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,740
No. You did wrong.

454
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,900
What's the matter? Any cream on my face?

455
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,598
Once again.

456
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,238
Don't look at me with that face.

457
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,539
I won't be enchanted.

458
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,820
What face do I have?

459
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,438
The face you show to Jiang Wenjing.

460
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:20,339
Both your behaviors and expression...

461
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,860
No wonder they misunderstood it.

462
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,780
Oh, dear.

463
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,820
They know nothing about me.

464
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,198
How could I ask my ex-girlfriend
to help my present love?

465
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,500
That's rude, okay?

466
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,460
What did you say?

467
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,679
Hurry in!

468
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,220
Haven't you seen the lighting?
It's going to rain!

469
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,980
He told me to let you drink
three glasses of water before he's back.

470
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,580
Shall we take it as the second glass?

471
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,019
You know I'm not good at math.

472
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,260
I think he could understand it.

473
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,639
Your mind is so flexible.

474
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,739
You're very good at handling people like him.

475
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,100
Come on. Tell me more details.

476
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,740
So what kind of people is he?

477
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,860
Drink some water
to moisten your throat. Take your time.

478
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,900
He's pretty simple.

479
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,499
Only studying and plants are in his life.

480
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,140
Just like he said

481
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,940
"Nothing has shaken my pursuit of profession".

482
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,598
He was the top scorer

483
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,879
and could choose whatever major he wanted.

484
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,118
My family wanted him to learn
finance but he chose botany

485
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,999
and got a doctorate.

486
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,740
10 years to grow trees
and 100 years to nurture talents.

487
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,900
Hello. Are you off duty now?

488
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,740
[Certificates]

489
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,580
[Send]

490
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,219
He devotes himself to experimenting,

491
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,580
having few friends and no girlfriend.

492
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,159
Our parents are worried about him.

493
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,500
But he answered

494
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,659
"there's no such plan in my life."

495
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,478
How could it be?

496
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,780
It could be.

497
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,438
Though many people choose
to marry and have babies,

498
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:45,299
it doesn't mean everyone needs to do so, right?

499
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,599
He seemly said the same words as you.

500
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,860
Really?

501
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,079
You're so awesome

502
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,639
for you can speak out so many things about him.

503
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,340
Just like articles.

504
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,438
I've just finished one named "My Brother".

505
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:04,759
10 years to grow trees
and 100 years to nurture talents.

506
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,340
Perfect application, right?

507
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,660
Yes. I'm sure you can get high scores.

508
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,679
Awesome! You finished drinking so fast!

509
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,639
Let me make another glass for you.

510
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,118
Why?

511
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,109
Wasn't it the second glass?

512
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,699
So this should be the third.

513
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,198
You drank it yourself. So it doesn't count.

514
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,639
Here's the one I ask you to drink.

515
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,358
I'm not good at math
so you can understand, right?

516
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,279
Come on! Both you and he like playing tricks on me.

517
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,639
Take your time.

518
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,860
You can drink it after playing for a while.

519
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,620
Oh, no!

520
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,100
It's all up.

521
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,519
Don't cry.

522
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,799
Parts are all there.

523
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,198
Stay in the room and I'll take them back.

524
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:57,078
- Let me join you.
- No. Young kids have poor resistance.

525
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,679
What if you catch a cold?

526
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,759
Then what about you?

527
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,660
Don't worry. There's a canopy.

528
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,639
Calm down. I promise I'll get them all for you.

529
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,340
Don't cry.

530
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,118
Come in first.

531
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,679
I'll call my brother to come back at once.

532
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,759
Don't. He must have something urgent to deal.

533
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,620
Don't trouble him with trifles.

534
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,039
Only I can hear your words now.

535
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,819
So just go ahead.

536
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,660
No. I have nothing to say.

537
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,300
- Fine. Then I'll start.
- Hold on!

538
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,799
I take back my question.

539
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,300
I heard nothing.

540
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:49,420
I never take back my words.

541
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,300
Do you want to hear it again?

542
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,700
You're the one who I love.

543
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,900
Li Tiantian.

544
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,439
Stop.

545
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,540
What's the matter?

546
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:25,359
Is there a hidden camera
or microphone on your car?

547
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,380
Otherwise, why is it like an outdated drama here?

548
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,980
It's not outdated.

549
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,740
It's classical.

550
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:46,420
♫ The sun sprinkles its circles of light ♫

551
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,459
♫ I exert myself to run toward you ♫

552
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,959
♫ I raise my head to breathe deeply ♫

553
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,740
♫ I won't hesitate no matter how big the storm is ♫

554
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,900
As long as you tell me...

555
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,220
it's true, then I'll trust you.

556
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,879
♫ All the scenery in my eyes ♫

557
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,659
♫ can't compare with your glance to me ♫

558
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,159
♫ The wind blows gently after the rain ♫

559
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,660
I'm really in love with you.

560
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,740
- In fact, my legs...
- I want my birthday gift.

561
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,940
♫ I really hope the time can stop here ♫

562
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,220
♫ The dark clouds are dispersed ♫

563
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,019
♫ Time goes slowly ♫

564
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,900
♫ The sun sprinkles its circles of light ♫

565
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,239
♫ I exert myself to run toward you ♫

566
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,659
♫ I raise my head to breathe deeply ♫

567
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:17,559
♫ I won't hesitate no matter how big the storm is ♫

568
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,180
♫ The wind blows gently after the rain ♫

569
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,100
Are you looking for it?

570
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,039
Yes. Fortunately, we found it.

571
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,100
Let's go back.

572
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,919
♫ The wind blows gently after the rain ♫

573
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,699
♫ I'm moved by you in the rain ♫

574
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,300
♫ I look into your clear eyes ♫

575
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,940
♫ I really hope the time can stop here ♫

576
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:58,420
♫ I really hope the time can stop here ♫

577
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,740
We've arrived.

578
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,180
Do you want to...

579
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,060
It's too late. Go back and have a rest.

580
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,900
Okay.

581
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,239
Go back.

582
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,799
I'll leave when you're home.

583
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,900
I'm leaving.

584
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,260
Happy birthday.

585
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,140
I'll find another chance to explain it to you.

586
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,460
Take it.

587
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,460
No. I don't like ginger.

588
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,780
But your hair needs to be wiped up.

589
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,039
I'm exhausted.

590
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,900
Please help me.

591
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,540
After you drink it.

592
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,660
Done.

593
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,519
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

594
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,500
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

595
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,700
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

596
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,020
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

597
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,159
♫ I like the sunshine on your face ♫

598
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,419
♫ You show up in my sight ♫

599
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,419
♫ My heart flips are like the summer rhapsody ♫

600
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,339
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

601
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,779
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

602
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,019
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

603
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,079
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

604
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,860
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

605
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,519
Tell me, why didn't you go dating with her?

606
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,739
I thought you would like this type.

607
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,580
I'm not interested in shallow sulci.

608
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,419
How did you describe shallow sulci yesterday?

609
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,340
- Sabina Chinensis.
- That's it.

610
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,340
Sabina Chinensis.

611
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,699
♫ I want to guard our memories ♫

612
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,819
♫ I don't want to beguile anymore ♫

613
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:06,100
♫ My happiest time is to be with you ♫

614
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,398
But where she invited you to go is newly opened.

615
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:10,860
You've already tried?

616
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:15,599
I really can't understand your love for brains.

617
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,540
Then tell me which shop nearby
has deep sulci brains.

618
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:37,060
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

619
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,899

620
