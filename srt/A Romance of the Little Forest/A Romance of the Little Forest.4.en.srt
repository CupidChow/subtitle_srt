I told you not to call
me before the sun rises.

Today is a sunny day.

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
What gives you
the illusion that it is still dark?

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,367
In my quilt kingdom,
it's still midnight now.

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Okay.

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,959
Then choose one from
the king of quilt kingdom and the brand friend of Lami.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,720

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,880

I really envy you for having such a good boss.

40
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,720
A friend of a brand needs
to promote its products.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,199
Think about how to increase the brand's sales.

42
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,119
Don't worry.

There is nothing like home here.

It's better to see than hear.

00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,520
The expression of beauty can be so concrete.

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,960
China pays attention to charm.

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,080
But in western countries,

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,520
a good botanical scientific
illustration is also priceless.

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,887
there are about twenty possible areas.

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,016
So the most possible area is Zhejiang.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,119
The temperature and soil conditions
in Zhejiang are the most consistent.

63

invited before are famous stars.

to find a cemetery for him.

00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,379
The voltage is too high. Haste makes waste.

183
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,400
I'll go to Zhejiang recently.

184
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,520
Take care of Ni Ke.

185
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,479
Okay.

186
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,000
Boss.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,119
Why did you ask him to take care of me?

188
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:17,192
If boss didn't say that,
who would bother to do that?

189
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,919
Boss.

190
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,896
Did you get definite messages?

191
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Let's go.

192
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,840
I told you that.

193
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,535
He should have been here by now.

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
[You got a message]

195
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,599
Mei, do you want grapes?

196
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,720
We can bring you some next week.

197
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,519
I can't wait
to let brother-in-law treat us a meal.

198
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,400
Where is brother-in-law?

199
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,119
I spent a whole night
editing the video to come here.

200
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,991
Will he stand me up again?

201
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,520
Dear, I would like to ask you

202
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,280
to make a short video for our new product.

203
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,799
Now we will arrange staff
to deliver the new products to you.

204
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,799
Give me an address, okay?

205
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,960
Now?

206
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,216
Yes, just give me the address.

207
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,400
Okay, here.

208
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,640
The staff will arrive soon.

209
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,472
What clothes do you wear, Miss Yu?

210
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,912
White T-shirt and black glasses.

211
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,479
I shot it last week.

212
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:32,579
It's in Qingshui Village, Zhejiang.

213
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,000
It's valuable.

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
Thank you very much.

215
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,320
His WeChat doesn't have a notification,

216
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,420
but he responded actively on Weibo.

217
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,311
Did he set a special notification
for No Time to Talk?

218
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,815
You're welcome, bro.

219
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,479
Miss Yu.

220
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,944
President Wang.

221
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,368
You changed your clothes.

222
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,280
You have a different charm now.

223
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,760
No wonder I almost didn't recognize you.

224
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,320
I work in this field.

225
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,239
I should do that.

226
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,688
Unlike President Wang,

227
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,487
you even sent me the product yourself.

228
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,479
What?

229
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,550
Miss Yu.

230
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,470
You don't invite me to sit down?

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,239
I'm afraid you haven't come
to the college cafeteria for a long time,

232
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,520
so you're not used to it.

233
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,440
Even you can come here,
why would I be not used to it?

234
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Sit down.

235
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,799
President Wang, you must be busy with work,

236
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,719
so you must have something important to tell me.

237
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:50,503
Is it because of that staff for one day VLOG?

238
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,455
I've watched that.

239
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,255
It's good.

240
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,727
I just want to know, Miss Yu, have
you seen the messages I sent you?

241
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,200
You're knowledgeable.

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,619
I'm stupid, so I can't understand it.

243
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,119
It's okay.

244
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,184
I can teach you.

245
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,760
No, thanks.

246
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm stupid.

247
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,376
I have no literary obtainment.

248
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:21,719
So I know, you're an
interesting person, Miss Yu.

249
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,840
No wonder I felt
you are my friend at first sight.

250
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,863
And, every time I see you,

251
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,143
I want to talk with you.

252
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:36,535
I wonder what you're thinking, Miss Yu.

253
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,880
President Wang.

254
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,200
I think you're nice, too.

255
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,175
To be honest, you look like my uncle.

256
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,559
If it's not because of your noble status,

257
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,207
I even want to call you uncle.

258
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,558
Well... Do I look so old?

259
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,679
No, no.

260
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,960
With you as a young and honorable
uncle, your niece would be proud.

261
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,312
You're right, Miss Yu.

262
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,400
Honor must go through
the precipitation of years.

263
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,200
I know it's hard to work in this field.

264
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,798
I hope this cooperation
is just the beginning of us.

265
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,159
I can help you a lot.

266
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:29,480
Of course, if you're willing to.

267
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,400
You're a valuable guest of Xingjin Entertainment.

268
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,039
Not only me, President Jin
must be more willing to cooperate.

269
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,880
I'll let him treat you
a great meal and thank you in person.

270
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,919
I have something to do.

271
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,640
I shall leave now.

272
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,231
Miss Yu, I can drive you home.

273
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,960
No bother, President Wang.

274
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,400
I can go home myself.

275
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,144
It seems our friend is not sincere enough.

276
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,440
President Wang.

277
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,408
What do you mean?

278
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:59,320
I wanted to use the brand friend of Lami

279
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,039
for a chance to be your friend.

280
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,783
I didn't imagine
you didn't give me the chance, Miss Yu.

281
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,400
You didn't understand?

282
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,799
Without my permission, how
could a makeup blogger like you

283
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,879
to be the brand friend of Lami?

284
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,704
An old saying goes,

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,980
never reject a face-saving offer.

286
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,599
Miss Yu.

287
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,280
You're smart.

288
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,247
You won't do such things, right?

289
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,640
President Wang.

290
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,479
Using the friend of a brand as a chance,

291
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,640
you're good at
polishing your behavior of a stalker.

292
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,400
Well done, President Wang.

293
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,656
You read a lot of sonnets, right?

294
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,200
I don't know how you hired the former friends.

295
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,840
But you can't get what you want here.

296
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,240
I don't want to be your friend.

297
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:54,280
And, if you want to write
poems to show your sentiment,

298
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,968
you can put the sonnets in one message.

299
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,479
Or if you send Song of Eternal Sorrow,

300
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,440
the girl needs to charge
to receive the whole poem.

301
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,503
It's too troublesome.

302
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,799
You little girl, how dare
you play hard to get with me?

303
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,808
Let me go.

304
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,896
Let me go!

305
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,220
You didn't hear that?

306
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,112
She said let her go.

307
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,960
Hey, hey.

308
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,120
You don't want your lab sponsorship?

309
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:28,416
I think, I don't need such a sponsorship.

310
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,359
Go away.

311
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,919
If I remember it right, in
Lami's activity last time,

312
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,440
you said you're not familiar with Miss Yu.

313
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,720
It seems you can talk, President Wang.

314
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,767
Since you can talk,

315
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,979
how can you not understand her?

316
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,799
I thought you keep a distance
with women, Professor Zhuang.

317
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,103
But now, you fall for a woman.

318
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,280
Okay.

319
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Miss Yu.

320
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,919
You can leave now.

321
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,335
But think about
the liquidated damages you need to pay.

322
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,479
Okay.

323
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:18,552
How about me driving you home?

324
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,240
If you want to act wildly,

325
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,160
go back to your home.

326
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Why did you say I act wildly here?

327
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,424
You need to show me the evidence.

328
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,000
In order to be famous,

329
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,239
a small makeup blogger
flattered the senior executive.

330
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,239
When she was refused,

331
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,479
she blamed all the fault
on the senior executive.

332
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,520
I'm the innocent one, right?

333
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,959
Nonsense!

334
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,408
There is chat history on my phone.

335
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,280
So what?

336
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,199
I thought the makeup blogger is not well-educated,

337
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:52,239
so I sent you a poem for you
to learn and be more literate.

338
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:58,144
Nonsense! You... So you're
here to learn, President Wang.

339
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,160
But the knowledge you want to learn...

340
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,939
I think the police can be your teacher.

341
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,959
So what?

342
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,110
I just touched her hand.

343
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,640
Do I need to pay for that?

344
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,978
Any physical contact that makes
the other person feel uncomfortable

345
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,479
is sexual harassment.

346
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,511
If you can't learn it, let Lami learn it.

347
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,719
Not leaving?

348
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,219
Want to wash dishes here?

349
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,152
Wait for me.

350
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
We're here.

351
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
So...

352
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:12,208
Sorry.

353
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,200
I didn't imagine
you would say go away, Professor Zhuang.

354
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,376
Thank you.

355
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,096
I shall leave now.

356
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:34,282
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

357
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:39,920
I didn't imagine
you ignored me in front of others,

358
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,903
but you carried my note with you secretly.

359
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,800
I just have no time to throw it.

360
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,660
I'll return to you now.

361
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,160
Professor Zhuang, you're handsome today.

362
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,704
I suggest you make it a semipermanent one!

363

[Semipermanent makeup]

368
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,640
So at the crucial moment,
Zhuang Yu helped you,

369
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
so that you left there safely.

370
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,599
I didn't see that.

371
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,319
He seems to be indifferent,
but he is willing to help.

372
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,959
I'm also surprised that he helped me.

373
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:35,680
And by doing so, he lost
the sponsorship from Lami.

374
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,776
Well, will President Wang ask
the platforms to ban Xingjin?

375
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,680
I'm okay with it.

376
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,839
I'm afraid others might be influenced.

377
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,040
Ban me?

378
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,199
Are you kidding me?

379
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,520
I should ban him.

380
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,920
Let me tell you, we
refused Heshi and Lami.

381
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,760
We're so great.

382
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,920
Maybe our price will be much higher.

383
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,640
Of course, it also
benefits from my operation.

384
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,760
After you told me that yesterday,

385
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,160
I sent them the letter of Termination.

386
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,520
It's like breaking up.

387
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,680
The one who said it first
will gain the initiative.

388
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,599
What about the breach?

389
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,979
They didn't mention it.

390
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,561
Thank you.

391
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,520
Don't thank me.

392
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,160
I advocate people
to do things out of their own will.

393
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,280
I hate those who force others
to do things they want.

394
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,079
I just feel pitiful for the plans
you made at midnight,

The internal feedback on the two videos was good.

397

Look at your dark-eye circles.

398
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,560

What brand of concealer is this?

401

I need to fix my makeup back home.

402
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,760
There's a shooting in the afternoon.
I need to be charming.

403
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,424
I think you can add more bubbles.

407
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:09,480
Don't.

408
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,760
- Put it here.
- Don't let the bubbles get into your eyes.

409
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,680
As long as the effect is
good, just add more bubbles.

410
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Okay.

They borrowed this only wedding dress
from the brand manager of S.T., Vincent.

414
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,640
From material selection to sewing,

415
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,520
Vincent made this wedding dress himself.

416
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,760
I've never seen
such an expensive premium custom dress.

417
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,920
Qinxin really costs a lot,
but that wasn't for me.

418
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,655
It's for the promotion of their own brand.

419
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,239
You're not the only KOL
they cooperate with this time.

420
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,719
But there is only one dress.

421
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,359
Isn't it obvious?

422
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,400
After you wear this dress,
others will look plain in the camera.

423
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,880
You're so sweet.

424
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,119
It would be a waste if President Jin
didn't deploy you to the marketing department.

425
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,560
Do you want me to leave you?

426
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,360
Of course not.

427
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,400
But I can't be your obstacle to success.

428

Wait.

429
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,100
Why is there no such dress
in the dresses just taken for me?

430
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:17,560
Qinxin borrowed this from
Vincent, and it's for Miss Yu.

431
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,680
After the shooting is over,

432
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,000
Miss Yu will take it back to make
a promotion video, so... Really?

433

But I think this dress suits me better.

434
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,640
I'm familiar with Vincent.

435
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,160

436
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,599

I can tell him about it.

438

After all, your skin is not white.

439

But this dress is customized
according to my size.

443
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,479

00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,799
What can I do now?

542
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:43,079
I need to handle something tough.

543
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,952
Just wait for me outside.

544
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,936
Wait for me outside.

545
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:18,535
You're optimistic.

546
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,015
Well,

547
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,648
Professor Zhuang, can you
help me to take off the dress?

548
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,728
What is this?

549
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,640
Neighborhood cooperation?

550
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,079
Yes, neighborhood cooperation.

551
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,911
It's positive.

552
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,318
I spent much effort,
but I can't unzip it.

553
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,575
Can you help me to unzip it?

554
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,960
Please.

555
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,199
Thank you.

556
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,839
Okay.

557
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,792
Wait for me here.

558
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,455
Don't peek.

559
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,984
Okay, come out.

560
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,247
Let's go to appraise the damage.

561
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,640
Oh my god.

562
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,599
If these things need to be changed to new ones,

563
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,287
it will cost his salary half a year.

564

[Pay the loan]

565
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,439
I'm so sorry.

566
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,400
I didn't imagine it would be so serious.

567
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,860
Don't worry, I'll be responsible for you.

568
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
How?

569
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:15,416
After all, I'll pay you for these.

570
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:30,808
Although I'm lack of money now,
I can't make the professor suffer.

571
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,976
Oh no,

572

573

This dress is more than 100 thousand yuan.

574
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,520
Dear Ms. Yu Meiren,

575

thank you for your support
to the public welfare of birds.

576

of 50,000 yuan this month.

[Your account income defeated 2% people]

578
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,679
The most perfect guy in
the world, please tell me,

579
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,224
how can I make money now?

580
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,120
The cotton towel ad in Qingshui Village.

581
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,560
But you need to go back,
if you meet your parents,

582
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,520
you would expose the fact
that you're not a teacher.

583
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,639
It depends on you.

584
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,792
I'll go.

585
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:21,159
Miss Meiren.

586
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,399
Why don't we take a normal bus?

587
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:27,240
Because your Miss Meiren is broke.

588
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,559
I hope you can
enjoy the beautiful countryside better.

589
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:37,512
But you can see nothing now.

590
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,159
Is this clearer?

591
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,439
Well, when we enter the
village, don't call me Miss Meiren,

592
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:49,239
just call me Miss Long-leg.

593
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:49,480
Okay.

594
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,199
The company arranged this for you.

595
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:56,135
You've never had
such experience elsewhere, right?

596
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,992
It's special.

597
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Xiaofang, don't pat the tractor too hard.

598
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,679
Be gentle.

599
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,688
Okay.

600
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:05,159
The tractor is also expensive.

601
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:07,079
I have no money to pay for this.

602
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,239
See? A yellow dog.

603
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,584
So cute.

604
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,800
But it is covered with xanthium.

605
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,639
Its full name is
XanthiumsibiricumPatrin ex Widder, okay?

606
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,639
Don't just call it xanthium.

607
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:37,423
But we would call it that in my hometown.

608
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,039
Why do I talk like him, and
be like an old pedant now?

609
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,064
I wonder when I can keep chasing...

610
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,239
You're broke, girl, what are you thinking?

611
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,339
Career first, boyfriend comes next.

612
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,032
Sir, stop!

613
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,919
What is it? It's too dangerous.

614
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,416
Thank you for your reminding.

615
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,248
It's not obvious.

616
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,780
Be careful next time.

617
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,719
What happened?

618
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,120
How did you drive the tractor?

619
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,258
- Didn't you see the car?
- Xiumei.

620
00:37:18,258 --> 00:37:20,161
[Wang Xiumei, the most gossiping woman]
Sorry, there are too many people.

621
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:21,120
This old tractor can't stop quickly.

622
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,399
Aunt Xiumei?

623
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:22,680
We need to go.

624
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,000
According to her fake relationship with my mom,

625
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,496
I'll be dead if she finds me out.

626
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,960
Where do those people come from?

627
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,000
Mei... Well, Miss Long-leg.

628
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,160
What's wrong? Crying?

629
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,568
I'm moved when I come back to my hometown.

630
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,072
It's okay, I understand you.

631
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,560
See?

632
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,072
Wang Xiumei posted
the picture of her grandson again.

633
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,559
I'll celebrate my grandson's
one-month birthday next month.

634
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,840
Why is she showing off this?

635
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,135
Wang Xiumei is proud.

636
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,719
Let's take it as an example.

637
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,919
When you have a grandson,
don't post it on Moments.

638
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:37,199
I just won't post it.

639
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,280
So you can talk now?

640
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,919
Why don't you persuade
your daughter to get married?

641
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:42,607
My daughter has a boyfriend now.

642
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,280
You can be proud, too.

643
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,480
That's right.

644
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,280
But Mei is strange.

645
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,464
She praised her boyfriend so
much, but she never posted a photo.

646
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,159
No photo?

647
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,487
See? See this profile photo.

648
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,727
My daughter is young and beautiful.

649
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,959
It must be her boyfriend
that took this photo for her.

650
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,495
How did you know that?

651
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,095
It's from a boyfriend's perspective.

652
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,560
Well... Why is it from
boyfriend's perspective?

653
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,160
Okay, enough.

654

00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:22,120
Is it taken by her boyfriend?

659
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,360
I think she took it herself.

660
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,399
Her hands are there, how could she take a photo?

661
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,639

00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:49,335
Is she your mom, Feng
Cuicui, or Sherlock Holmes?

671
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:51,824
It's Sherlock Feng.

672

692

who is particular about appearance,

she would also say he is handsome.

720

00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,760
Or with such a handsome
face, and an upright personality,

724
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,535
Mei will surely like him.

725
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,840
You said, he came at a bad timing.

726
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Look at you.

727
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,840
Do you still remember the view of his back?

728
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,880
Wide shoulders and a narrow waist.

729
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,311
Why do I feel familiar with it?

730
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,189
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

731
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:26,997
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

732
00:42:26,997 --> 00:42:30,649
♫ I'm sure you are ♫

733
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,940
♫ my future ♫

734
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,280
Professor Zhuang's class will be over at five.

735
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,896
According to his schedule,
he'll go to Canteen 2.

736
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:04,088
I'll just act like a normal college girl today.

737
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:11,099
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

738
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,380

744
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,948
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

745
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,260
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

746
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,700
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

747
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,700
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

748
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,388
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫
