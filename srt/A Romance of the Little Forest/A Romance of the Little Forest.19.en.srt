00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,399
You just have some cold symptoms.

187
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,879
The medicine is on the handle.

188
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,119
Don't forget to take it.

189
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,238
What's going on?

190
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,200
Am I dreaming?

191
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,440
Why are you here?

192
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:46,840
Feeling any better?

193
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,439
They're on the door handle.

194
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,799
Did you order them?

195
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:02,839
Oh my goodness.

196
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,640
This is surreal.

197
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,639
Let's take your temperature first.

198
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,359
Where's the thermometer?

199
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,118
How do you know I'm sick?

200
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,918
Meinan told me.

201
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,839
What happened?

202
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,558
You were fine a few days ago.

203
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,719
Why did you catch a cold?

204
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,159
I'm fine.

205
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,678
The prescription is to have warm water.

206
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,839
Sleep more.

207
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,238
What's your body temperature?

208
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,999
Is Zhuang Yu with you?

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,558
I've talked to him.

210
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,320
Feeling any better?

211
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,238
I'm fine! Kick and alive.

212
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,840
Don't tell mom.

213
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,238
Meiren, are you sick?

214
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,079
Is it serious?

215
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,959
Can you answer the phone?

216
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,999
Is Zhuang with you?

217
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,079
Did you go to the hospital?

218
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,880
Yu Meinan!

219
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,799
I hate you!

220
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,119
I'm fine.

221
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,319
I'll send Zhuang Hui back this morning.

222
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,039
Take the medicine. Call me when emergency.

223
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,760
It's about time.

224
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,358
I want to die!

225
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,439
Why is that?

226
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,159
The temperature has dropped.

227
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,879
Why is that?

228
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,119
Your face is burning.

229
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,199
You look numb.

230
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,999
Last night wasn't a dream.

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,119
What dream?

232
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,118
It's supposed to be a sweet dream.

233
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,280
Now, it's a bad one.

234
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,918
What's going on?

235
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,320
Why do I smell gossip?

236
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:01,599
Have you ever dragged
someone you like to yourself?

237
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,359
What's that reaction?

238
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,520
Never mind.

239
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,158
That's not a big deal.

240
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,239
Romantic dramas
often have plots like that.

241
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:24,280
That's to say,
the partner didn't pay much attention to it.

242
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:30,718
If you ask me,
I want him to take it seriously.

243
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,119
Why is that?

244
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,839
That way, you're one step closer.

245
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,718
Really?

246
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:43,959
I'm afraid we're one step
away from each other.

247
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,959
No way.

248
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,678
He took the initiative.

249
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,118
What if he did it
out of politeness?

250
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:54,158
Besides,
it was me who offered it.

251
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,760
You are the one I'm in love with.

252
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,118
Li Tiantian.

253
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,718
But he's confessed his love.

254
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:03,718
It's not out of politeness.

255
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,320
But he didn't confess!

256
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:10,918
I... I mean that he has dropped
by and taken care of you.

257
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,519
He's so protective.

258
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,039
All that's missing is

259
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,719
a kiss.

260
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,358
What a pity!

261
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,199
Li Tiantian.

262
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,239
You look different now.

263
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,679
What do you mean?

264
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,840
What's between you and the overbearing boss?

265
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,599
I will tell my parents about the breaking news.

266
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:38,159
That way, they could enjoy their lives.

267
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,798
Shall I tell them that you
keep playing games every day?

268
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,119
Come on.

269
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,640
There.

270
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,199
Quit playing.

271
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,520
It's bad for your eyes.

272
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,359
Time to go.

273
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,678
Yu, take care while driving.

274
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,919
I will.

275
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,440
Goodbye, Yu.

276
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,039
Hello, Mr. Chen.

277
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,559
How is Zhuang Hui's Chinese?

278
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,438
Good for you!

279
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,238
That's too fast.

280
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,438
You bet.

281
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
Only the VIP members can speed it up.

282
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,999
Don't worry about me.

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,999
You're nearly recovered now.

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,358
Still, you need rest.

285
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,040
What do you want to eat?

286
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,479
I'll cook it for you.

287
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,040
Oh my goodness.

288
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,719
The porridge is still warm.

289
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,359
When is it made?

290
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,719
Telling from the temperature,
its thickness, and

291
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,800
the smell,

292
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,959
I deduce that it was
made within an hour.

293
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,239
Our Professor stayed
up all night to guard you.

294
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,919
Really?

295
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,118
Crying for a bowl of warm porridge?

296
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,279
It's made by Professor.

297
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Full of knowledge.

298
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
[Passport]

299
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,719
Isn't it too much?

300
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,438
Zhuang Yu is good at cooking.

301
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,438
I admire you.

302
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,598
What for?

303
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,718
You've got a president.

304
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,920
You could eat anything you want.

305
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,399
I feel much better after
having the porridge.

306
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,680
Thank you very much.

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,519
By the way, you used to be fit.

308
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,439
Why are you sick?

309
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,839
Maybe I was too eager.

310
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,718
I failed at my homework.

311
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,000
Get scolded for it.

312
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,319
You've never failed before!

313
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,000
He's back already?

314
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,760
You should look in the mirror.

315
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,478
Handsome boy?

316
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:32,598
Hello, Meiren.

317
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,519
Are you feeling okay?

318
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,399
Would you like some ice cream?

319
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,598
How did you know?

320
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,198
Yu Meinan told me.

321
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,919
I don't know about your taste.

322
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,159
So I bought all the flavors.

323
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Come in.

324
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,159
Tiantian,
you don't need a speaker for the weather forecast.

325
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,318
Just bring Meinan with you.

326
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,680
He speaks louder than a stereo.

327
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,999
Better seize the chance by yourself.

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,358
An unreliable wingman
would do a disservice.

329
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,199
Meiren, try one.

330
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,999
Hold on.

331
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,920
Stop it.

332
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,118
She's sick. She can't have that.

333
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,478
It's bad for her. I'll eat for her.

334
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,438
Just one.

335
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,680
No way.

336
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,119
I'm shipping them. I must defend her.

337
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,479
Alright.

338
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,238
I've taken your gift.

339
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,599
You may leave.

340
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,199
Went for the visa?

341
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,839
Have you passed?

342
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,119
Good news!

343
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,759
You're doing credit to our school.

344
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,119
Have you got the ticket?

345
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,839
Hold on.

346
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,280
You don't look very happy.

347
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,520
It's expected.

348
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,760
Why would I be happy?

349
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,119
No way, it's strange.

350
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,040
It is because of the long-distance relationship?

351
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:09,279
I feel much better after
having the porridge.

352
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,439
Thank you very much.

353
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,519
Do you know the saying?

354
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,399
As long as you don't see your partner in person,

355
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,078
it's a long-distance relationship.

356
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,718
Besides, we have modern technology now.

357
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,999
Phone calls, messages, video calls.

358
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,679
Even if she's not by your side,

359
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,359
her voice is still vividly remembered.

360
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,999
You should learn Chinese again

361
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,839
with Zhuang Hui in elementary school.

362
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,478
Stop joking with me.

363
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,319
Looks like you've got a plan.

364
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,040
You should take Math classes
in the elementary school, too.

365
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,279
You've put the decimal in the wrong place.

366
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,719
Come on.

367
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,760
The magnitude is wrong.

368
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:57,439
Is Yu cheating on you?

369
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,560
What's wrong?

370
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,919
Never mind. They don't teach logic
in elementary school.

371
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,040
Sarcasm in a roundabout way, huh?

372
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,040
Besides,

373
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,880
I could satire even if I'm not in the mood.

374
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,718
Handsome boy.

375
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,958
You just reported for duty.

376
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,279
You must be busy recently.

377
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,400
I don't think so.

378
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:31,399
Shouldn't you be at school at this time?

379
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,598
The term hasn't begun yet.

380
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,479
It's fine.

381
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,118
It's not easy to get rid of him.

382
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,118
Meinan, it's all your fault.

383
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,118
[I get it, I will modify it as soon as possible.
Please help me out.]

384
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,119
Stop looking at your phone.

385
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,598
It's confiscated now.

386
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,879
I don't want to.

387
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,198
They're asking me for my homework.

388
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:51,118
By the way,
you just said you were scolded

389
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,039
for your homework.

390
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,679
What do you mean?

391
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,039
Did Meiren get punished?

392
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,839
I can't believe it.

393
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,399
Who did it to you?

394
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,958
It's about my work.

395
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,838
It happens now and then.

396
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,279
Besides, it is my fault.

397
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,879
I got their requirements wrong.

398
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,119
What kind of client it is?

399
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,400
Meiren.

400
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,160
You have my word.

401
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,478
I will take care of your tasks for you.

402
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,399
Just call me.

403
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,519
Don't!

404
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,119
I look fat on street snaps.

405
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,759
A famous rick guy keeps a web celebrity
as his mistress.

406
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,598
Then, you'll see my pictures in the tabloids.

407
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,199
No way.

408
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,999
I'm not prepared for that.

409
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,719
That's okay.

410
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,079
Tell me when you're ready.

411
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,358
Meiren.

412
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,239
Before you're mentally prepared,
what could I do for you?

413
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,199
Do some research.

414
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,799
Was there anyone from our rival companies?

415
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,640
Sure.

416
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,358
Who told you that they
want to target the young?

417
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,920
Can't you remember?

418
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,719
Even you are not sure of it.

419
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,000
Without either confirming it or telling me,

420
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,559
or reporting to anyone else,
do you think it is okay

421
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,719
to notify Yu Meiren?

422
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,999
I thought it could be a breakthrough.

423
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,799
A breakthrough?

424
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,078
We've cooperated with them for times.

425
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,438
They choose us, not for some breakthroughs,

426
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,438
but the stability.

427
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,680
Can't you see?

428
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,800
Your assistant.

429
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,999
My assistant told me about the information.

430
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
I was in a haste.

431
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,919
I should have checked it.

432
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,838
Did she get the information wrong?

433
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,198
Or, she was bribed.

434
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,078
How is that possible?

435
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,478
Xiaofang has been working with me for years.

436
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,279
Xiaofang?

437
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,799
We have a girl named Xiaofang in our company.

438
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,718
Really?

439
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,399
Did you tell your boss about it?

440
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,078
How could I tell him?

441
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:56,039
He is so strict with our work.

442
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,679
If he found out it was my assistant,

443
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,640
she would be in trouble.

444
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,520
You're suspended before everything gets clear.

445
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:07,999
President Jin,
I was doing it for her good.

446
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,399
I didn't mean her harm.

447
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,238
President Jin.

448
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,400
Alright, enough.

449
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,640
That's so scary.

450
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,318
It's about time.

451
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,958
I need to go.

452
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,279
But you didn't eat much.

453
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,319
I only took the morning off.

454
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,559
Where is Lv Jian?

455
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,318
I must take him away.

456
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,559
Excuse me, sir.

457
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,118
Our POS machine isn't functioning.

458
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,439
Do you mind if I come to you later?

459
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,880
Fine.

460
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:46,239
I must go.

461
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,159
I'm running out of time.

462
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,119
Remember.

463
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,318
Even if the supporting actor is an ideal choice,

464
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,159
the audience still ship the leading characters.

465
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,639
I'm leaving.

466
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,559
Alright.

467
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,078
You're only 30 minutes late for the date.

468
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,919
Someone's anxious.

469
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,718
It... is not a
date. It's my job.

470
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:06,639
Besides,
I only take half the day off.

471
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,519
My boss is nice to me.

472
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,999
I shouldn't take advantage of him.

473
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,039
Goodbye.

474
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,318
Speaking of that,
I would like to hear more.

475
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,238
You do? I'm leaving.

476
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,640
Bye-bye.

477
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,519
Black card, platinum card.

478
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,599
Neither of you is helpful.

479
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,078
What took you so long?

480
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,199
Did you fall into the pit?

481
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,000
What pit?

482
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,438
Meiren.

483
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,279
I didn't get it.

484
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,000
But I'll go where you go.

485
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:39,838
Don't bother.

486
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,078
I'm heading to the company.

487
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,679
Terrifying as my boss is,

488
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,880
I need to talk to him about the solution.

489
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,879
Bring me the bill, please.

490
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,279
Sir, the machine works now.

491
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,079
Okay.

492
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:54,879
I can't have a boy buy me meals.

493
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,639
Meiren,
stop thinking of me as a boy, please.

494
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,279
Maybe next time.

495
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,119
You kept saying that.

496
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,760
Since you said next time,
how about making it tonight?

497
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
Lv Jian.

498
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,679
Do you remember back in Qingshui Village?

499
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,040
I told you about the question I was pondering.

500
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,239
Now, I've figured it out.

501
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,920
I like Zhuang Yu.

502
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,560
That's straightforward.

503
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,958
I love him.

504
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,958
That's not something
I could hide.

505
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,119
Alright.

506
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:47,520
Enough talking.

507
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,719
Don't make it too hard for me.
We can still meet again.

508
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,438
You're a nice guy.

509
00:27:56,439 --> 00:28:00,839
Forget about me and meet
someone who likes you back.

510
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,680
Meiren.

511
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:11,879
I admire your courage.

512
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,199
Admire me?

513
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,639
It's nothing.

514
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,239
Actually,
I haven't made my love confession.

515
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,559
Professor Zhuang has finished his paper

516
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,679
and got the admission letter to study abroad.

517
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,199
This time...

518
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,599
Good for him!

519
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,400
I know he's great!

520
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,318
What will you...

521
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,159
We need to celebrate that, right?

522
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,279
Thanks for reminding me.

523
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,718
Celebration?

524
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,639
Hold on.

525
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,880
I need to get my work done.

526
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,718
Time to go.

527
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,280
Carry on eating.

528
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:47,160
Goodbye.

529
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:48,718
Hello, President.

530
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,639
I'm heading to the office.

531
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,760
Are you there?

532
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,559
By the way,
don't tell Meiren about Xiaofang's resignation.

533
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,919
She'd beg for her if she knows it.

534
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,680
No problem.

535
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,119
I will tell Xiaofang to keep her mouth shut.

536
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,479
I love the desserts today.

537
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,238
I'll carry on
working if that's all.

538
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,319
Sure, go ahead.

539
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,920
She should be here.

540
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,919
Hello, President.

541
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,958
I'm heading to the office.

542
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,119
Are you there?

543
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,680
Not again.

544
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,759
I'm not at my office. Got some work to do.

545
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,999
You can take the afternoon off.

546
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,919
Have you taken care of your private affair?

547
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,118
Just carry along.

548
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,959
Or take a rest.

549
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,159
Let's have dinner together.

550
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Miss you.

551
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:12,359
See you at night. My treat.

552
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:13,920
Excuse me.

553
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:15,438
Do you know the way to the subway station?

554
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,799
The subway station?

555
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,879
Go straight that way. Turn left.

556
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,718
Next to the noshery, right?

557
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,199
Exactly.

558
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,879
It's about 100 meters away.

559
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,400
100 meters.

560
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,880
That way.

561
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:25,000
Thank you.

562
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,400
Hello!

563
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,799
Since when we
have afternoon tea?

564
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,400
Leave it. It's not for you.

565
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,519
President, think about it.

566
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,999
You're about to be middle-aged.

567
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,238
You should keep on a diet.

568
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:46,639
I'm doing you a favor.

569
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,039
Shut up.

570
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,958
You are a patient.

571
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,800
Stingy as Tiantian.

572
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,679
By the way,
I'm here for the proposal.

573
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,760
That's what I want to talk about.

574
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,118
Do you think it is a plot?

575
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:03,999
We could be misled.

576
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,800
No.

577
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,238
Absolutely not.

578
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,639
It's all my fault.

579
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,239
It has nothing to do with others.

580
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,519
I'm not talking about your colleagues.

581
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,159
The wrong information you got,
could it be from our rivals?

582
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,039
Xia Zhi, for example?

583
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,039
No way.

584
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,799
I've warned her.

585
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,479
Warn? You?

586
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,478
Don't you look down upon me.

587
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,759
I'm a powerful girl.

588
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,319
Enlighten me.

589
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,679
What makes you powerful?

590
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,039
You have no idea.

591
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,160
Xia Zhi and I... actually,

592
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:38,039
it's not a big deal.

593
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,318
We've worked it out.

594
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,319
Are you sure?

595
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,039
I won't force you.

596
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,399
I've had Linda look into it.

597
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,039
Whoever did it,
I will make him pay.

598
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,598
That's so typical of you.

599
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,680
Decisive.

600
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,118
I'm here to discuss it with you.

601
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,078
Is there anyway to
make up for the loss?

602
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,999
The plan this time could work.

603
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,800
But it's not impressive enough.

604
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,718
What a surprise!

605
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:07,358
They fell for our traps easily.

606
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,358
President Zhao,
I've made a deal with Yu Meiren.

607
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,880
We'll fight, fair and square.

608
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,399
This is a war.

609
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,159
Deals do not apply to our careers.

610
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,760
But... I thought you
hate her the most.

611
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,118
Look at her.

612
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:27,438
She's got a boyfriend,
and a decent job.

613
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,159
She's working as a teacher in the university.

614
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,078
That's a secure job.

615
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,880
Couldn't you follow her example?

616
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,300
♫ The star is hiding away from the moon ♫

617
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,850
♫ We just let it go ♫

618
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:54,049
♫ I gave up my hope
so I wouldn't be disappointed ♫

619
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,100
♫ I thought about your eyes ♫

620
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,279
Maybe Professor Zhuang

621
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,959
is used to the house with orchids.
He couldn't smell the odor.

622
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,300
♫ I wish I could stand by your side ♫

623
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,920
Went for the visa?

624
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,400
Have you passed?

625
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,359
Good news. You're doing credit to our school.

626
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,199
There isn't anything that
will change my pursuit.

627
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,549
♫ I'd tell lies ♫

628
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:35,200
♫ and keep the sad moments to myself ♫

629
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:45,838
♫ I see the beam of starlight ♫

630
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,199
There you are!

631
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,520
What about the plant?

632
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,560
I'm afraid no one will take care of her

633
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,119
while I'm away.

634
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,398
Got an appointment?

635
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:08,959
Not at all.

636
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,198
I enjoy our conversation. Carry on if you like.

637
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,319
I don't want to.

638
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,520
At least,
I know I have an appointment.

639
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,438
Heal so fast after the cold.

640
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,958
That's the power of love.

641
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,398
You'll never know.

642
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:21,799
Anyway,
there is one thing I'm sure of.

643
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,198
We are tired of each other now.

644
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:24,719
Just get lost.

645
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,840
Stop sitting here.

646
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,678
Don't be like that.

647
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,438
In my opinion,
you will always be the most handsome...

648
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:32,438
Stop it. Enough.

649
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:33,159
Stop.

650
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:33,959
Spare me.

651
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,398
Save your praise
for your Professor.

652
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,159
You know what I mean.

653
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,438
I'm tired of praising you.

654
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:41,158
Modify the plan the
way we talked about it.

655
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,238
You may leave.

656
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,479
I get it, bye.

657
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,800
President.

658
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,359
What now?

659
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,639
See if my hairstyle is okay.

660
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,918
Okay, okay.

661
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:03,759
It's perfect.

662
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,799
Just get going.

663
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,678
Do me a favor.

664
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,120
Goodbye.

665
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,718
You're rude to a patient.

666
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,439
Clock out, just go.

667
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,559
I don't want to see you again today.

668
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,439
Bye-bye.

669
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,678
Tiantian, where are you?

670
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,919
I'll come for you.

671
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:40,519
Careful. You could get stumbled.

672
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,759
That restaurant is so popular.

673
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,958
Let's get going.

674
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,360
Sure, let's go.

675
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,958
Thanks.

676
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,360
Enjoy.

677
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,320
Mind the door!

678
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,000
Here we are.

679
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,040
Over there Sure.

680
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,119
Careful.

681
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,000
Alright.

682
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,599
Tell me when you're ready.

683
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,360
Thanks.

684
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,879
No problem.

685
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,079
Pick anything you like. My treat.

686
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,760
No, it's my treat.

687
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Boss Li gets rich!

688
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:41,559
Tell me about it.

689
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,520
What cheers my girlfriend up?

690
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,520
Repeat what you just said.

691
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,039
Boss Li gets rich!

692
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,559
The next line.

693
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,559
What cheers you up?

694
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,760
That's not how you said it.

695
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:00,478
I see!

696
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:03,799
What cheers my girlfriend up?

697
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,319
There! That one.

698
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,199
It makes me so happy.

699
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:10,360
By the way,

700
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,759
this one is for you.

701
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,398
I made it myself yesterday.

702
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,600
There are gingers, rice wine, and salt.

703
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,198
It's not for drinking.

704
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,040
Soak your feet in it.

705
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,438
I googled it yesterday.

706
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:31,559
You're sitting in a wheelchair.

707
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,079
It might cause Vein Drainage Disturbance.

708
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,079
Your legs might swell.

709
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,918
This liquid is good
for blood circulation.

710
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:39,039
It helps with your legs.

711
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,199
And this gadget.

712
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:46,359
Be sure to bring it with you.

713
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,279
Lay your legs on it
while in a wheelchair.

714
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,840
It could be helpful.

715
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,519
Let me take a look.

716
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,159
What does my boyfriend want?

717
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,000
I must stop lying to her.

718
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,800
Tiantian, I need to talk to you.

719
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,959
What's that?

720
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,839
Why are you so nervous?

721
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,638
I always want to tell you this.

722
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,040
I'm afraid that...

723
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,840
How about

724
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,760
hearing me out first?

725
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,439
Okay.

726
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,999
Actually,
I'm afraid you'd be mad after hearing my words.

727
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,198
I won't.

728
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,040
I promise.

729
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,599
To be honest,
I've seen many TV shows.

730
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,918
Even so, I still doubt myself

731
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,800
for having you as my boyfriend.

732
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,239
I'm just a random girl.

733
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:02,279
Why does President Jin like me?

734
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,159
Because you're Li Tiantian.

735
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:07,679
Because you're perfect.

736
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,360
I know you'd say that.

737
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,320
However,
it took me a long time to figure it out.

738
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,559
Then,
it came to me that you could need my help.

739
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,718
Maybe that simple
fact makes me feel that

740
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,639
what I'm doing is valuable.

741
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:27,719
It brings us closer.

742
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,199
However,
I don't think it's a good way of thinking.

743
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,639
Sounds like I like you
because you need me.

744
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,398
You are not mad, are you?

745
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:47,919
Not at all!

746
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,438
I will never be mad at you.

747
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:52,479
Glad to hear that.

748
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,638
Don't worry.

749
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:58,840
I will try my best
to figure it out.

750
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,280
Well, what were you trying to say?

751
00:40:27,879 --> 00:40:30,159
Guess who I am?

752
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,398
Your hands are cold.

753
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,800
You just get recovered.

754
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,360
You should have put on more clothes.

755
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:43,079
You should take a guess!

756
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,120
Who else could it be?

757
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:47,600
That's short.

758
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,800
Me, short?

759
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
It's windy outside.

760
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,239
Put it on.

761
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:05,958
You think I'm too short for you.

762
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,599
Then why are you following me?

763
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,159
My legs are long, that's all.

764
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,478
Don't be cocky.

765
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:13,760
My legs are long, too.

766
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,560
Here you are.

767
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,559
What's this?

768
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,759
Food.

769
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,679
Food?

770
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,399
Invite me in, hurry up.

771
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,560
They didn't come with a spoon!

772
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,520
Thanks.

773
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:10,958
Well.

774
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,559
If Lv Jian hasn't told me about that,

775
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,600
I didn't know you finished your essay.

776
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,149
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

777
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:43,449
