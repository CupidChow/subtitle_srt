[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,980
[Episode 14]
[A lie needs to be covered up with a thousand lies]

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,559
Hold on.

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,439
Act after five minutes.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,279
Copy that.

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,480
What's wrong, President Jin?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,319
Nothing.

29
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:50,599
How's the soap I gave you?

30
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,199
Not bad, it's fragrant.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,159
But the bubble is not much.

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,079
The clothes can't be well cleaned.

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,800
The clothes?

34
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,079
Yes.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,759
Since it's given by the brand,
I can't ask too much.

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,119
It's okay.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,839
Don't worry.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,439
I'll give you the report soon.

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,080
That soap... was
used to wash face.

40
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,478
You don't know that?

41
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,638
People use facial cleanser to wash face now.

42
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,320
No one will use soap to wash face now.

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,879
President Jin.

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,758
Are you still using soap to wash your face?

45
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,399
No.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,079
Time has changed.

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,239
Who will use soap to wash face now?

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,118
I use a facial cleanser.

49
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:25,839
Facial cleanser.

50
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,918
Three minutes left.

51
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,360
Okay.

52
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,719
What are you watching?

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,599
Classic romance a few years ago.

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,959
Reviewing the past to know the present.

55
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,320
You won't like it.

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,838
President Jin, thank you
for letting me watch TV series while waiting.

57
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,678
It's no big deal.

58
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,879
Can I watch it?

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,439
I've never seen a romance.

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Here.

61
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,279
Fireworks?

62
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,520
Romantic, right?

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm sorry to say so,
but this is out of fashion now.

64
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,639
Out of fashion?

65
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,799
Yes, it was romantic back then.

66
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,839
But it's out of date now.

67
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,039
President Jin, why hasn't the person
you're waiting for arrived yet?

68
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,520
It's okay.

69
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:34,399
Cancel it! Cancel it!

70
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,279
This...

71
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,118
Well, what happened?

72
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,239
Time has changed.

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,599
Someone is still lighting fireworks?

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,399
It's out of date now.

75
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,880
It's out of fashion.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,200
Failure is nothing.

77
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,320
Life is experiencing.

78
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:44,759
Soap bubbles, fireworks,
these are ephemeral.

79
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,839
It's okay if you don't like it.

80
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,119
This gift will accompany you
to the end of the world.

81
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,599
You want to give me lipsticks?

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,719
Yes, the company sent it to me yesterday,

83
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,958
and said it's essential for the company's image.

84
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,398
I'm just helping to push the wheelchair.

85
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,799
Why am I related to the image?

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,679
A single one or a box of lipsticks?

87
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,999
A box of them, about a dozen lipsticks.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,398
There are many colors.

89
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,599
I can't even recognize them.

90
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,320
How can I use it?

91
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:13,799
That should be expensive.

92
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,159
Is your boss interested in you?

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,719
Impossible.

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,078
Let me tell you,

95
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,879
the essence of a capitalist is exploitation.

96
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,518
He gave me a soap last time,

97
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,838
so I stayed up late to write a 1000-word report.

98
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,879
He gave me lipsticks this time.

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,039
Obviously, he wants to remind me
of making up before going to work.

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,678
Really? Tell me what brand it is.

101
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:39,160
I'll help you to judge what he wants to do.

102
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Let me have a look.

103
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,279
It's like a "Zheng" without a crossing.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,599
Have you heard of it?

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,719
"Zheng" without a crossing?

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,199
No.

107
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,039
I guess it's a small brand.

108
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,118
What company is it?

109
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,118
Why do they accept promotions from all brands?

110
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,719
I guess so.

111
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
If it's expensive,
the company won't give it to me.

112
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,118
But I don't know how to make up.

113
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,359
I thought you are a makeup blogger,
so you can use them.

114
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,440
Cheap lipsticks for me?

115
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,759
Well done, Boss Tian.

116
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,440
You're so generous.

117
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:24,160
Okay, tell me,

118
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,558
what do you want me to do?

119
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,199
How did you know that?

120
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,678
I didn't say anything yet.

121
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:33,079
Of course, or you won't get up so early.

122
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,599
And I just told you about the lipsticks.

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,838
But you called me directly.

124
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,000
I guess even a famous brand lipstick
is not so attractive.

125
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,118
Boss Tian, you're so smart.

126
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,759
Okay, enough.

127
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,999
Come on, or the capitalist
will force me to work later.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,269
Okay, to be brief.

129
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,449
Two things.

130
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,160
First, I think Zhuang Yu is not bad.

131
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,720
Not bad? He's perfect, right?

132
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,439
So my three-step verification method worked?

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,480
Kind of.

134
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,518
I'm magnanimous, right?

135
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,719
I've even forgiven him

136
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,919
for mocking me
and standing me up when I confessed my love.

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,159
It's not because you're magnanimous.

138
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,720
It's because Straight-A Zhuang
is like a leading actor in TV series.

139
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:25,518
Since he has fallen for you,

140
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,199
can you tell him you're his schoolmate?

141
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,358
Let me see the romance
of a Straight-A couple.

142
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,558
No, he stood me up back then.

143
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,558
I can also make a fool of him now.

144
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,320
I'll let him taste the same feeling.

145
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,319
Okay, about this,
find a good time to tell him about it.

146
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,879
Tell me what the second thing is.

147
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,760
I need to work now.

148
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,880
The second thing is complicated.

149
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,558
If someone can tell your mom about it,

150
00:07:55,559 --> 00:08:00,279
he must know you well,
and know people in Qingshui Village.

151
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,159
Which aunt sent this picture?

152
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,118
I didn't notice this.

153
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,440
I'll ask my mom about it.

154
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:12,398
Mei, I've prepared today's necessaries.

155
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,719
It's at the reception desk.

156
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,320
Bring it to Zhuang later.

157
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,958
Okay, where is Meinan?

158
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,319
He went out.

159
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,999
He won't tell me where he went.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,119
Just let him be.

161
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,238
Mom, you told me...

162
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:26,959
Hello, everyone.

163
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,518
I'm Mermaid With Long Legs.

164
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,880
What are you watching?

165
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,080
Isn't this you?

166
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,400
What is this?

167
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:34,678
Mermaid With Long Legs?

168
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,439
What is it?

169
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,718
I'm not good-looking, stop watching.

170
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,038
Why?

171
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,320
What is this?

172
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,759
I got bored recently,
so I recorded my life.

173
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,999
Record your life?

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,358
Why did you say "everyone"?

175
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:53,918
I'm saying hello
to the customers that will buy grapes.

176
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,000
What customers?

177
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,879
Tiantian's grapes are unsalable, right?

178
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,839
I want to make a video,

179
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,358
and introduce the grapes in Qingshui Village

180
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,159
to my colleagues in the school.

181
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,279
Tiantian's family did harvest many grapes.

182
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,759
Your colleagues can buy
all the grapes her family harvested?

183
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,158
There are not only my colleagues of course.

184
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,678
I'll ask them to send the video.

185
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,400
More people will know about it,
so more people will buy it.

186
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:26,079
So it's you that made the grapes
in Qingshui Village sell so well?

187
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,719
Yes.

188
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,478
Look at them.

189
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,439
How annoying they are!
Slandering you behind your back.

190
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,959
They said you became a blogger,
fooling around all day long,

191
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,319
and you also made Tiantian do that.

192
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,718
Why can't being a blogger be called a job?

193
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,639
I don't know about bloggers.

194
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,679
They told me,
it's an unstable job.

195
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,358
Mom, don't listen to what they said.

196
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:50,598
First, blogger is a serious job.

197
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:54,199
Second,
why is being a blogger unstable?

198
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,520
A blogger is paying
more effort than any of them, okay?

199
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,359
You really know this industry well.

200
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,319
Not exactly.

201
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,520
This is commonsense.

202
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,678
Give me that.

203
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,959
I want to watch it.

204
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,520
No need.

205
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:11,879
I'm not good-looking.

206
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,319
Why not?

207
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,519
You are the one with long legs.

208
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,359
I'll see how long your legs are. Give it to me.

209
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,919
Is there something I can't watch in it?

210
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,558
Just watch it.

211
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,239
There is nothing you can't watch.

212
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,399
Mom, where did Aunt Guilan get this video?

213
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,399
I was so furious in the group chat,

214
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,079
so they didn't dare to send it to the group.

215
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,319
Wang Xiumei sent it to her own group.

216
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,718
When Aunt Guilan saw it,

217
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,960
she sent it to me and asked me about it.

218
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,158
They're annoying, right?

219
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,759
Why do they make rumors about a teacher?

220
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,959
It's so evil.

221
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,558
Okay, don't be angry.

222
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,759
It's not worthwhile to be angry at it.

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,358
How could I not be angry?

224
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,598
They made rumors about you.

225
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:54,558
What do they want?

226
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,599
I really hate those dishonest people.

227
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,400
What a pity.

228
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,158
What is a pity?

229
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,479
Mom, what's your name
in Qingshui Village's chat group?

230
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,918
Half Boss in Qingshui Village.

231
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,799
What's wrong?

232
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,640
I guess you're
a Quarter Boss in Qingshui Village now.

233
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,678
Why?

234
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,639
Did half of your group members
add Aunt Xiumei's group?

235
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,679
Yes.

236
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,639
Well done, Wang Xiumei.

237
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,038
She created a small group secretly.

238
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,038
Yes.

239
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,919
She really didn't pay any respect to you.

240
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,679
Mom, tell me if you get any clue.

241
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,239
Don't forget about the necessaries.

242
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,500
[Zhuang Yu, Date of birth: 1993-09-16]

243
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,639
The fan club has investigated
his birthday and constellation for long.

244
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,879
And I got it so easily.

245
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,320
Luckily, Ms. Feng has a homestay hotel.

246
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,520
Thank you.

247
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,880
Is this okay?

248
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:24,039
Yes, yes.

249
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,320
Enjoy your lunch.

250
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:26,239
Call me after you finish it.

251
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,479
What's wrong?

252
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,880
Don't leave.

253
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,959
There will be a buffet later.

254
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,000
How about eating together?

255
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:39,759
Then I'll push you there.

256
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,599
- I'll leave after you finished.
- I didn't mean that.

257
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,199
Lunchtime is short.

258
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,839
How about you eating here as well?

259
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,640
Oh no.

260
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,039
What about my rice noodles?

261
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,960
Eating here?

262
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,280
Forget it.

263
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,520
I'll pick you up after I finished eating.
See you later.

264
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,679
Well...

265
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Housekeeping.

266
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,679
Housekeeping.

267
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,118
So tidy.

268
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,119
His constellation is indeed Virgo.

269
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,640
He even didn't take his bag.

270
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,799
He shouldn't be far away.

289

I don't want him to be with someone else.

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,789

See? The long queue.

301
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,759
An old saying goes,

302
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,279
there must be something good
if there is a queue.

303
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,879
I noticed this food stand the
first day I came to work here.

304
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,760
Because I eat here every day,
the boss saved me a seat.

305
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,080
Here, the rice noodles you always order.

306
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,080
Thank you.

307
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,199
Not bad.

308
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,798
The soup is clear.

309
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,038
It's delicious and not too salty.

310
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,879
The rice noodles are not sticky.

311
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,760
It's fresh, sour and delicious.

312
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,319
But it's not spicy enough.

313
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,079
Maybe it wants to cater to local tastes.

314
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,478
Boss, give me some chili oil.

315
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:47,640
Okay.

316
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,320
Come on, eat.

317
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,960
It's delicious when the rice noodles are hot.

318
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,320
Chili oil, add it yourself.

319
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,159
I didn't imagine you look like an ass...

320
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,198
you dress in a suit,

321
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,679
and don't match with this little food stand.

322
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,560
You seemed like an expert
when you were commenting on it.

323
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,479
I understand a little.

324
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,920
See? Much better now?

325
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,399
Yes.

326
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,238
I didn't imagine you're so nice, President Jin.

327
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,999
You came to this little food stand with me.

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,639
It's no big deal.

329
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,598
When I was starting my business,
I had no money to eat.

330
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,919
I ate two bowls of instant noodles every day.

331
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,958
Really?

332
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:34,959
You're such an ass...

333
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,999
You're such a person
who emphasizes the quality of life,

334
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,079
but you ate instant noodles?

335
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,438
The quality of life is just a habit.

336
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,198
I don't think what I eat matters.

337
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,318
If I'm rich, I can eat something good.

338
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,718
If I'm poor, I'll eat instant noodles.

339
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,438
Besides,
instant noodles have so many flavors.

340
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,239
I may taste something fresh if I eat more.

341
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,479
I didn't imagine you're not born rich
with a silver spoon, President Jin.

342
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,319
Silver spoon.

343
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,118
It's more reliable to use my spoon.

344
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,839
And others won't take it away from you.

345
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,919
He is pompous and competitive.

346
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,680
Interesting.

347
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,159
What are you talking about? Just eat.

348
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,478
I didn't imagine

349
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,318
you're so sincere and hardworking, President Jin.

350
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,639
According to your physical condition,

351
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,238
you must have suffered more than you said

352
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,039
to gain your achievements now.

353
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,079
I think my understanding
of you is a little too superficial.

354
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,879
Okay, this lunch is on me.

355
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,118
Boss.

356
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:42,959
Add a dish of stinky tofu.

357
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,040
Thank you, President Jin.

358
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,920
Do you need to make up after lunch?

359
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,280
Make up?

360
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,319
You mean the lipstick?

361
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,639
Silly me.

362
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,160
I left it in the company.

363
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,799
Sorry, President Jin.

364
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I'll care about my image,
and won't lose your face.

365
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,800
This is almost done, right?

366
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,559
Well, Professor Zhuang,

367
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,879
you're sunbathing with them together?

368
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,118
By getting along with them all the time,

369
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,919
I can sense every tiny change in them.

370
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,799
Getting along with? You mean with the plants?

371
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,719
I heard of this word for the first time.

372
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,880
Thank you for your water.

373
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,000
What water? I just came here.

374
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,000
Nothing.

375
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,119
He may feel comfortable with a little stool.

376
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,478
Why do people studying botany look like wood?

377
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,238
Aren't they afraid of rain or wind?

378
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,999
People don't need photosynthesis.

379
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,560
Too much sun exposure
will increase the risk of skin cancer.

380
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:02,319
Pay more attention
to sun protection during field investigation.

381
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,879
Why does this sound like a makeup blogger?

382
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,439
No, I need to be straightforward.

383
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:16,118
Hello, bro.

384
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,039
I haven't contacted you for long.

385
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,279
I wonder if everything goes well.

386
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,799
The sun is hot in summer.

387
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,040
Remember to have some sun protection.

388
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,160
Why do I feel it's strange?

389
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,160
Perfect.

390
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,718
I didn't imagine

391
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:14,399
you're so sincere and hardworking, President Jin.

392
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,838
According to your physical condition,

393
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,318
you must have suffered more than you said

394
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,800
to gain your achievements now.

395
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,920
I can't hide it anymore.

396
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,599
Come in.

397
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,479
President Jin.

398
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,358
It's Qin Ya's activity.

399
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,478
They want to give Meiren a chance
to interview their spokesperson alone,

400
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:39,400
and are asking about our opinion.

401
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,559
Qin Ya's spokesperson
is the new star in the TV series.

402
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,718
It seems Qin Ya values Yu Meiren.

403
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,999
Meiren's countryside VLOG matches well

404
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,199
with the concept
of organic healthy life Qin Ya advocated.

405
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,078
Well, say yes first,

406
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,879
and thank Qin Ya for the chance they offered us.

407
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,478
We'll draft an interview outline soon.

408
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,919
I'll contact Yu Meiren.

409
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,919
Ask about the preferences
of Qin Ya's spokesperson in China,

410
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,759
and arrange a meeting for us.

411
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,199
Okay.

412
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,239
Go ahead.

413
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,399
President Jin.

414
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,358
How's the coffee machine?

415
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,000
Not bad, thank you.

416
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,958
What's wrong, President Jin?

417
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,519
It's just a Qin Ya's activity.

418
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,559
Why do you urge me so many times?

419
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,358
Will I waste time saying craps?

420
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,040
No, you won't. Just say it.

421
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,598
The exclusive interview of a new star?

422
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,078
Well done, you can even find this chance for me.

423
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,279
Of course, I'm almighty.

424
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,639
But,
Qin Ya gave you this chance themselves.

425
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,039
The atmosphere you're creating

426
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,519
matches with the character
the new star wants to build.

427
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,000
Am I sincere?

428
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,279
Yes.

429
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,479
Right? I also think so.

430
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,679
Even if there is something I didn't tell you,

431
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,598
I did it out of good will.

432
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,159
You can understand, right?

433
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,598
Yes.

434
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,999
Compared with your hard work,
this is not worth mentioning.

435
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,679
You really think so?

436
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,279
Tell me more about it.

437
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,599
Okay.

438
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,639
I've been friends with you for so many years.

439
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,118
I know you well.

440
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,358
You're just a gentle sheep
covered in a wolf coat.

441
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,118
But I feel you're strange today.

442
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,879
Well, nothing.

443
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,159
Can you give me the interview outline tomorrow?

444
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,318
The interview will last for ten minutes.

445
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,118
The brand and the star will check it.

446
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,159
Tomorrow? That's too hurried.

447
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,999
Dear President Jin.

448
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,838
Considering that
I flattered you so much just now,

449
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,679
can you give me one more day?

450
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,759
No, I asked you to be sincere.

451
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,958
Who asked you to flatter me?

452
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:57,358
Okay, it's my fault.

453
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,399
Then can you feel my sincerity again?

454
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,520
There is only one day,
you're asking too much from me.

455
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,598
Okay, okay.

456
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,478
I can give you half a day more at most.

457
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,598
When do you want to come back?

458
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,399
I'll ask Xiaofang to order you a ticket.

459
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,039
It's okay, I can do it myself.

460
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,639
I'll tell you after I order it.

461
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,838
Okay, I'll hang up.

462
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,438
I need to prepare the interview outline.

463
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,438
After you went to the village,

464
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,279
you can take care of yourself well.

465
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,958
Well done, Yu Meiren.

466
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:23,719
Okay.

467
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
Bye-bye.

468
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,318
Oh no, I came in without knocking at the door.

469
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,920
He'll blame me.

470
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,639
How did you come in?

471
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,838
The door is open.

472
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,279
I knocked and there was no response,
so I came in directly.

473
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,759
Oh no, did I call Yu Meiren's name just now?

474
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,400
But don't worry.

475
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:52,319
I didn't hear a word
about the beauty you're talking with.

476
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,358
It's your privacy.

477
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,399
I won't ask,
or tell anyone about it.

478
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,759
I shall leave if you don't need me.

479
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,039
Call me if you need me.

480
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,959
Well...

481
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,958
It's not what you think.

482
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,718
What do you mean by it's not what I think?

483
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,239
I didn't say anything yet.

484
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,679
Then, what do you want to know?

485
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,959
Tell me, interviewing that new star,
what does that mean?

486
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:22,199
Let me explain it to you.

487
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,559
Mom, are you thirsty?

488
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,598
Do you want some water?

489
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,280
I'm not thirsty.

490
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,879
I'm thirsty, I'll get a cup of water.

491
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,118
Wait.

492
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,000
Drink this.

493
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,318
Mom, it feels like
you're interrogating a criminal.

494
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,880
Why are you nervous?

495
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,560
I'm not nervous.

496
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,759
Here's the thing.

497
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,639
The new term is going to begin.

498
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,679
There will be an evening party.

499
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,879
The school invited a new star,
and I'm the anchor.

500
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,598
So I need to prepare an interview outline.

501
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:59,839
You mean, the new star will go to your school?

502
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,759
Really?

503
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,239
Mom, why don't you trust me?

504
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,559
Professor Zhuang.

505
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,280
The evening party
in your school will invite stars?

506
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,040
Please, please.

507
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,759
Mom, look at you.

508
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,159
You don't trust me,
and you listened to the rumors about me.

509
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,760
Zhuang may laugh at us.

510
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:28,958
Of course I trust you.

511
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,078
I'm just caring about you.

512
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,519
Why are you so nervous?

513
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm not nervous.

514
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,159
Mom, you heard about it.

515
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,838
I'll leave soon.

516
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:41,559
Or, I'll be late for the party.

517
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,040
Zhuang's work is almost finished.

518
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,718
We'll leave together.

519
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:48,718
You'll leave so soon?

520
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:51,040
But there is one more thing.

521
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,040
You didn't forget about it, right?

522
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,120
[This animal was made by CG]

523
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,000
Have you heard of it?

524
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,710
People always feel that they
are higher than those creatures

525
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:28,880
only one step away from themselves
in the sense of zoology.

526
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,198
But people will look up at the birds.

527
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:34,000
Their world

528
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,880
is something beyond
those constrained human beings.

529
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,040
You also sometimes feel constrained,
Professor Zhuang?

530
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,599
It's getting dark, let's go.

531
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,279
It's still so bright.

532
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,680
Is your old watch reliable?

533
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,598
You've collected Artemisia annua.

534
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,799
I said you'll leave this week.

535
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,160
It's not too fake, right?

536
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,239
I bought the ticket on Friday.

537
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,399
What?

538
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,680
Why didn't you tell me?

539
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,760
You didn't ask me.

540
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,999
We're still in Qingshui Village,

541
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,598
so you're still my boyfriend.

542
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,598
If you didn't tell me,

543
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,519
what if people found out the truth about us?

544
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,358
Let me tell you,
if you leave without telling me,

545
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,559
I'll be angry.

546
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,919
I told you about it now.

547
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
But I asked about it first.

548
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,078
Take this.

549
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,718
Remember to apply it before going out.

550
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,358
Be careful of skin cancer.

551
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,119
This...

552
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,358
Reef Safe, you can even use it in the sea.

553
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,680
I've checked it for you.

554
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,399
Just take it as a reward

555
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,239
for helping me to keep this secret from my mom.

556
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,199
You told a lie,

557
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:52,239
then you need
to make it up with a thousand lies.

558
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,680
You think I don't want to tell the truth?

559
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,679
My parents' idea is conservative.

560
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,879
In their eyes,
what I'm doing now is not a serious job.

561
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,599
Not to mention my parents,
think of yourself.

562
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,399
The first time you saw me,
you didn't give me a good face.

563
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,279
I stayed in the mountain for two weeks.

564
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,919
I didn't eat or sleep well.

565
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,359
My face must be pretty bad.

566
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,839
You earn money with your ability.

567
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,119
There is nothing to be misunderstood.

568
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,119
Your rising constellation is Capricorn, right?

569
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,999
Seriously,
tell me your exact birth time.

570
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,079
I'll check it for you.

571
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,800
No, thanks.

572
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,238
Tell me about it.

573
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,198
Don't call this pseudoscience.

574
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:44,400
It has statistical support.

575
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,838
Okay, fine.

576
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,760
Even if there is no statistical support,

577
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,919
it's interesting to analyze it.

578
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,478
If you tell me,
you can know more about yourself.

579
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,399
And I can know more...

580
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,560
It's Capricorn.

581
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,800
My rising constellation is Capricorn.

582
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,719
You know it?

583
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,359
Someone told me about it.

584
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:11,519
You said you don't believe it,

585
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,040
but you remember it so clearly.

586
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,560
And I can see it even if you don't tell me.

587
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,199
It's not a total pseudoscience, right?

588
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,759
Mom, what are these?

589
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,039
It's too much.

590
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,238
It's not much.

591
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,800
Walnut, to make you smarter.

592
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,958
This is black sesame,
to make your hair darker.

593
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,479
And this is black wolfberry.

594
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,879
It's good for your eyes.

595
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,958
I can buy these on the Internet.

596
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:52,118
Those are not as good as mine.

597
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,879
These are natural and pollution-free.

598
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,640
Take it.

599
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:57,799
I can't eat them all myself.

600
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,159
Who said it's only for you?

601
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,400
It's also for Zhuang.

602
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:05,879
Zhuang has so much hair.

603
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,438
He doesn't need walnut or black sesame.

604
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:09,760
Just take it.

605
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,438
It's so heavy.

606
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,559
Let me help you, Miss Meiren.

607
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:13,920
Thank you.

608
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:15,880
Come on, give it to me.

609
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,639
It's okay, uncle. Have some rest.

610
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,598
I'll do it as exercise.

611
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,118
Okay, thank you, Lv.

612
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,039
It's okay.

613
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,198
You'll leave today?

614
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:24,799
Yes, I'll leave with you.

615
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,359
Didn't you arrange a luxury car for yourself?

616
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,559
Where is your car?

617
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,838
Here is it. I wonder if I can get a seat.

618
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,838
Of course.

619
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,478
But I can only send you to the town.

620
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,280
Get in.

621
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,718
Mei, listen to me,
you can work in the daytime.

622
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,078
Don't stay up late.

623
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,040
It's bad for your health.

624
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,280
Learn from Zhuang.

625
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,160
Catch up with his position soon.

626
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,838
Don't worry.

627
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,598
The leaders all like me.

628
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,559
Besides, I need time
to write essays and do analyses.

629
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,958
Yes, you're right.

630
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:02,479
Strange,
you barely mention your leader.

631
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,198
My leaders are the old professors in the school.

632
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:10,079
What? You want to call them, mom?

633
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,719
No need.

634
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:16,880
I have nothing in common
with those old scholars.

635
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,679
You're still interrogating and doubting me.

636
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,358
I'm not.

637
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,279
I found it out yesterday.

638
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,958
Wang Xiumei's relatives heard about it.

639
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,199
Actually, they are jealous of you.

640
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,559
I blocked them.

641
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,118
And I told Guilan,
don't tell me about these anymore.

642
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,159
Then why did you ask so much?

643
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,118
I'm worried about you
since you're working outside.

644
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,839
I want to call your leader
and ask him to care about you.

645
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,718
But I don't need to do that now.

646
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,160
You have Zhuang.

647
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:50,639
Zhuang, take care of her for me.

648
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,920
Okay, aunt.

649
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,958
He agreed so quickly?

650
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,800
But what's his face?

651
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,679
Zhuang, you're colleagues.

652
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,920
Take care of each other in work and life.

653
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Don't worry, uncle.

654
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,718
What does this mean?

655
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,878
Afraid that I'll stick to you?

656
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:16,918
Don't worry.

657
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,238
I've been living alone for all these years.

658
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,958
Okay, well,

659
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,799
put that black sesame
in the fridge when you arrived.

660
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,119
It can be kept for a year.

661
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,039
Remember to eat it.

662
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,800
- Okay.
- Okay,

663
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:28,399
you've said that black sesame so many times.

664
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:30,438
Time is limited.

665
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:31,959
Just go, or it will be late.

666
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,799
Just go.

667
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,158
Don't forget to call me when you arrive.

668
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,079
Mom, why did you cry suddenly?

669
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,760
It's okay.

670
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,319
I just can't bear to part with you.

671
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,158
Okay, time is limited.

672
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,718
Don't be sad, I'll be back soon, mom.

673
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,279
Just go.

674
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,159
Okay, okay.

675
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,159
Goodbye, uncle and aunt.

676
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,158
Be careful.

677
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,479
Take care of yourself.

678
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,360
They're leaving, don't be sad.

679
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,520
Thank you.

680
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,039
Sister, Shanghai is not far from our hometown.

681
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,320
Come back if you have time.

682
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,119
I haven't talked much with you this time.

683
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,678
Where have you been recently?

684
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,320
Why didn't I see you?

685
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,359
Nothing.

686
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,319
What? You like other girls in the village?

687
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,718
Nonsense, it's not like that.

688
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,040
Then why did you stammer?

689
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,678
I went to Li Tiantian's home.

690
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,878
Tiantian is not there,
why did you go there?

691
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,279
Because she is not there,

692
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,839
Grandma Li can't
take care of the grape yard herself,

693
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,158
so I went to help her.

694
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,199
Well done, boy.

695
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,719
Give it to me.

696
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,280
Thanks.

697
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,280
[Internship Report]

698
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,799
Don't thank me.

699
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,159
I won't sign on a specious internship report.

700
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:45,398
Miss Meiren.

701
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,839
I can help you to take it back home.

702
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,519
It's okay, Professor Zhuang is here.

703
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,159
I'm sure he would do this little favor for me.

704
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,879
Goodbye.

705
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,079
Then goodbye, Miss Meiren.

706
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,079
See you the day after tomorrow.

707
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,800
The day after tomorrow?

708
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,280
Professor Zhuang, wait for me.

709
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:27,399
He becomes an iceberg man again.

710
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,119
Zhuang, take care of her for me.

711
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,199
Okay, aunt.

712
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,638
Why is he like this?

713
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:57,599
Not to mention other things,
at least we are friends now.

714
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,039
Why does he feel so reluctant
to say something nice?

715
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,919
Afraid that I'll stick to you?

716
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:05,320
No.

717
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:12,438
I've been trying hard for so long,

718
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:17,320
how can I quit at the last moment?

719
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,678
What is wrong with him?

720
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,719
He didn't go to sleep late at night?

721
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,718
The alarm is over.

722
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:58,280
You don't need to act so hard in the future.

723
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,560
And thank you for posting our photo.

724
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,918
There is no group in your WeChat,

725
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:09,478

Hello, bro, besides watching birds,

734
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,958
I also know something about astronomy.

00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,238
I observed the sky at night,

736
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,999
and found your forehead is dark recently.

737
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,360
Only with sun lotion,
can you escape a disaster.

738
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,299
