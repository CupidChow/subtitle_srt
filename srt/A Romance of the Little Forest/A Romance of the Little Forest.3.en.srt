I know why.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,880
You must have no idea how to do garbage sorting.

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,440
I've done some research. It's a residual waste.

38

No, wait a second.

I'm good. It's not that heavy.

00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,600
Go. Fetch the medicine in case she gets a cold.

- Got it.
- Thank you so much.

170
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
we can collect Artemisia annua and soil samples there,

186
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,159
Yes, and you are?

187
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,880
I'm his friend.

188
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,159
Friend?

189
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,280
A female friend?

190
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,320
A girlfriend!

191
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
That's amazing.

192
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,479
Left anything?

193
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,080
Hello, Professor Zhuang, what a coincidence!

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,400
Who let you get in here?

195
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,799
Coincidence?

196
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,000
I feel like you're following me.

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,719
Professor, attending school is not following.

198
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,880
And...

199
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,320
you're not the owner of this lab.

200
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
[Zhuang Yu's Laboratory]
[Authorized Personnel Only]

201
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,239
Professor, you know our relationship,

202
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,960
it's nothing wrong

203
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,719
if I come to visit your workplace.

204
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Our relationship?

205
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,919
So you mean

206
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,840
we're close friends?

207
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,799
You're right.

208
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,479
We don't develop dry humor in this lab.

209
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,119
Professor, I come here

210
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,000
not to tell you dry-humor jokes.

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
I come for official business.

212
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,960
I come to assist your works.

213
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,320
Super clean bench, centrifuge, and water bath,

214
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,320
though I don't know how to use them,

215
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,039
Director Li told you last time,

216
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,880
brand endorsement is also a part of your work.

217
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Here are two classic products.

218
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,200
Please test them by yourself.

219
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,479
What do you look me in this way?

220
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,239
Listen,

221
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,719
I am professional,

222
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,280
so what you need to do is just to cooperate.

223
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,239
No way. It's out of the question.

224
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,159
Professor, you are a scientist.

225
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,320
I admire your pursuit of the truth.

226
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you. I should have said it to you.

227
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,159
What else can I do?

228
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,320
If I didn't put it on my face, you wouldn't do anything.

229
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,719
I did it for my job.

230
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:50,039
I don't care if it influences my image.

231
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,640
It has the aroma of jasmine.

232
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,000
The main element of jasmine smell

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
is methylindole.

234
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,280
It is also called skatole, the essence of poop.

235
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,919
I don't care how it smells

236
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,080
if it works well on my skin.

237
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,479
Do you want to have a try?

238
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,200
No.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,239
It's enough to have one subject.

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,679
Take note.

241
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,799
Do it now.

242
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,599
Is it the sequelae of once being a Ph. D?

243
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:38,200
My hand records the experiment
without my permission.

244
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,559
It's done.

245
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,039
I did the product test today with Zhuang Yu.

246
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,880
Next step, I should consider the marketing plan.

247
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,239
Show how skin looks after using it.

248
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,919
One-day experience of a shop staff.

249
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,640
Publicity stunt on Weibo.

250
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,119
Professor Zhuang.

251
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:35,919
Your skin looks so good recently.

252
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,719
Have you tried Yu's products?

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,960
You can try it yourself.

254
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
You really want to help her.

255
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,440
What do we have?

256
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,159
New journal has been released?

257
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,640
Professor from USC has just

258
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,840
published a paper about

259
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,679
how to cultivate Taxus chinensis of high Paclitaxel.

260
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,359
Maybe we can use the same technique

261
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:06,599
to cultivate Artemisia annua of high Artemisinin.

262
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,000
Only USC has this kind of technique?

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,080
Professor, don't waste time.

264
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,400
Apply for the autumn visit right now.

265
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,919
It's not late.

266
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,200
Don't worry. Our school

267
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,520
will do everything to support you.

268
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,280
Your strong will and determination

269
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,000
will always impress me.

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,039
Your compliment also impresses me.

271
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,440
If I have this kind of determination in my relationship,

272
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,239
I've found a girlfriend.

273
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,640
Director Li, you're here, too.

274
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,159
Yu.

275
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,559
Good to see you, professors.

276
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,520
Welcome, Yu.

277
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,080
You come to... to Zhuang Yu, right?

278
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,239
We went to test the elements of

279
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,960
Lami's facial mask and cream together.

280
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,080
Professor Zhuang told me to

281
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,119
get the test report from a third party.

282
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,640
And he has gone through every detail of the test.

283
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,039
He is so academically professional,

284
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,840
and responsible for the products he supports.

285
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,200
You were together yesterday?

286
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,159
Yes. Thanks to Director Li.

287
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,520
So he worked with me.

288
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,440
I can see you're the special one to him.

289
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,520
Really?

290
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,679
You should talk about me when I'm not here.

291
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,280
And one more thing,

292
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,799
Lami's release event will be held tomorrow,

293
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,000
so it's our honor if two of you can attend.

294
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,760
That's good. We'll take it.

295
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,239
Thanks, see you then.

296
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,080
Professor, ten min...

297
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,239
Five.

298
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,960
The font size is five.

299
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,799
But what your printing is four.

300
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,479
How did he notice it?

301
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:44,280
I bet your zodiac sign is the Virgo.

302
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,559
How careful you are.

303
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,960
Well, I have to go now.

304
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,559
See you.

305
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,799
Bye-bye, professors.

306
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,760
She knows all your schedule.

307
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,400
Yu treats you differently from others.

308
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,919
If you spend more time for yourself

309
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,080
instead of thinking of others,

310
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,960
you may have found the one you love.

311
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,200
It looks great.

312
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,200
It's all done. It's clean.

313
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,799
I have nothing to do. No, I have a lot of things to do.

314
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,359
But I don't know where I should start.

315
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,799
And I don't want to do.

316
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,280
Don't give up, and keep going.

317
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,560
Surprise!

318
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,280
You look so excited to see me.

319
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,839
The night is not coming yet,

320
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,880
but monsters like you have been released.

321
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,319
I know you're joking.

322
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,760
A monster won't be pretty as I am.

323
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,520
And I am here waiting for you

324
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,599
because I have something to ask.

325
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,359
The garbage sorting?

326
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:33,239
Tell me about it. You're the most dangerous garbage.

327
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:38,119
I know how to do garbage sorting.

328
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,800
I just want to ask what you will wear

329
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,199
at the event this evening.

330
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,760
We're going together,

331
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,319
so if we don't look like a perfect match,

332
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,000
it may have a bad influence.

333
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,520
Why do you think I'm going with you?

334
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,400
Of course, we're going together.

335
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Don't push me away, professor.

336
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Or just give me a hint.

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,319
What we wear is that important?

338
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,880
Of course. Isn't it important?

339
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,839
Dressing helps a lot to show our appearance.

340
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,319
As a botany professor,

341
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,400
you know appearance matters in nature, right?

342
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,839
The prettier the plant looks, the more poisonous it might be.

343
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,160
Pretty? You mean I'm pretty.

344
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,280
But you're not that kind of species.

345
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,239
So speaking of classifications,

346
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:39,199
somniferum and rhoeas are
from the same family and genus,

347
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:43,040
but are different in species.

348
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,839
Professor, you also have bad humor.

349
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,439
Zhuang Yu comes with Director Li.

350
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:53,880
It's fine. He leaves me alone,

351
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,959
but how could you stand me up?

352
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,880
I have an emergency. But you can handle it.

353
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,680
Don't embarrass our company.

354
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,800
Sure I can hold this grand event.

355
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,439
By the way, I've checked the list.

356
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,599
Xia Zhi, your troublemaker, is attending, too.

357
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,400
She has something to do with Saya.

358
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,280
You'd be more careful.

359
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680
She is no big deal.

360
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,599
I have to go.

361
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,640
This is today's lottery number.

362
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,280
Good luck.

363
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:21,280
Will Zhuang stand me up, too?

364
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,439
He's so hot.

365
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,479
Professor,

366
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,479
the way you dress today,

367
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,599
is perfect.

368
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,560
Yu helped you, right?

369
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,599
What is the texture?

370
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,920
I'll leave as soon as the interview is done.

371
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,319
Don't be so mean.

372
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,760
Give me a minute.

373
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,359
Excuse me.

374
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,560
You look great tonight.

375
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,640
Which company are you from?

376
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,359
I didn't see you before.

377
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,560
Hey, may I have your number?

378
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm sorry. Sorry.

379
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,040
Just leave him.

380
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,959
He has a girlfriend.

381
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,239
Meiren, is he your boyfriend?

382
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,479
He looks so cool.

383
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,239
I want to keep a low profile.

384
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,959
Don't worry. Now you are here,

385
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,160
I will take care of you.

386
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,119
You have your name sticker on your dress.

387
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:05,319
I came to help you, how could you make fun of me?

388
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,400
It may be my lucky number.

389
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:11,439
Professor Zhuang, do you have a minute?

390
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:17,839
Fancy meeting you, the famous cosmetic blogger.

391
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,199
After all, you can't join Saya's event,

392
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,040
so you are here.

393
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,640
Good to meet you, Miss Xia, the freshman.

394
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:26,359
It seems that you didn't read the latest news

395
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,160
that Saya has announced a new brand ambassador.

396
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,359
What a pity.

397
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,920
I feel so good about the photo I took.

398
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,839
Congratulations.

399
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,000
I have other business to do.

400
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,479
You can keep indulging in your success.

401
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,040
I need one.

402
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,599
I am sorry

403
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,680
that President Jin couldn't make it here today.

404
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,520
He asked me to extend his apologies for his absence.

405
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,760
He will visit you himself another day.

406
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,280
It's nice of you. It's great to have you here.

407
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Thank you so much

408
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,359
for introducing Director Li and Professor Zhuang.

409
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,079
Well, thank you.

410
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,319
So let me introduce.

411
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,280
President Wang, this is Miss Yu Meiren.

412
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,479
This is our CMO of the Great China Area,

413
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:17,160
President Wang, Charlie Wang.

414
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,760
I've heard a lot about you, President.

415
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,800
Good to meet you. You can call me Charlie.

416
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,160
Miss Yu. You're so beautiful as your name shows.

417
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,800
And even beyond that,

418
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,439
you have the gentle nature of a flower.

419
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:34,880
The skincare product of Lami,

420
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,839
is excellent for its pure herbal essence.

421
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,959
And thanks to the cooperation with the university,

422
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:40,239
we can make our products better.

423
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,640
It should be me to thank you

424
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
for your support of our labs.

425
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,000
Thank you.

426
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,959
But it's a pity

427
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,800
that you joined us a bit lately.

428
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
or you would have seen the aggressive battle

429
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,119
between Professor and journalists.

430
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,640
It's a pity for me.

431
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,439
Because it's rare to hear the speech

432
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,800
of youth Changjiang Scholar.

433
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,599
But Miss Yu is the most important key to us.

434
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,920
I can see you're old friends.

435
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,119
- Sure we are.
- No, we are not.

436
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,800
You're making fun of each other,

437
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,280
I know you're good friends.

438
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,880
President Wang. Thank you so much,

439
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,199
for giving m a chance to meet

440
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,959
so many distinguished figures in the industry.

441
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,160
It's nothing. Cheers.

442
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,800
So, Miss Yu, you don't drink wine?

443
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm not like the young people who can drink a lot.

444
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,640
President Wang.
It's time to announce the lottery winner on stage.

445
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,000
I am sorry.

446
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm leaving.

447
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,160
Wait. The ceremony is not over. Where are you going?

448
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,920
Fine. You're living like an old man.

449
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,160
Take care.

450
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,040
The lottery winner tonight goes to

451
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,839
250.

452
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,439
It's yours. No thanks.

453
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,319
Professor Zhuang. 250. You're the winner.

454
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,760
Welcome to get your prize on stage.

455
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,880
Why do you look at me like this?

456
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,560
So you want me to go to the stage with you?

457
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,359
Go.

458
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,719
Yu Meiren. You're doing calculations, right?

459
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,439
You're watching too many palace dramas.

460
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,439
I have no idea what you are talking about?

461
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,760
You're using this kind of money

462
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,920
to fawn on Professor, right?

463
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,119
I didn't need to do it.

464
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,599
I'm the type that Professor likes most.

465
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,000
What kind of show are you playing?

466
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,119
You're so out of fashion.

467
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,239
I know it's my fault to spray the wine on your dress.

468
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,920
But it's an accident.

469
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,640
But how did you do it to me on purpose?

470
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:12,199
Oh my god, you're really a drama queen.

471
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,359
If your hands shake unconsciously, check neurology.

472
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,119
If it is achromatopsia, test your vision.
You should go to the hospital.

473
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,160
Don's waste time here.

474
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
He is right. If everyone knows what you've done,

475
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,959
you'll lose many chances

476
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,520
that you have put all strings to get.

477
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,520
You...

478
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,040
It's wet and dirty. It's better to leave when it's dry.

479
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,359
Wait. Professor Zhuang.

480
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,959
Professor Zhuang. Wait. Wait a moment.

481
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:12,040
Professor, I didn't make it wrong, right?

482
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,800
The prince just saved the princess.

483
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,719
You're dreaming.

484
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,839
What about the gift box?

485
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,439
It should be yours.

486
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:26,880
Yes. I know you. Thanks for your brave behavior

487
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,079
getting me out of trouble.

488
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,239
If you keep making great shows,
no peaceful days in your industry.

489
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:35,959
But at that moment, it's not helpful to explain.

490
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,479
I can't make everyone trust me.

491
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,599
That new influencer

492
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,920
is getting popular recently.

493
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,199
So she kept challenging me for becoming complacent.

494
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:46,400
But I won't be defeated in this kind of situation.

495
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,800
I'm so touched that you care about me.

496
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,160
Don't worry about it.

497
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:53,040
Stupid is as stupid does.

498
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:59,119
Selfless giving is the art of living.

499
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,839
Could you lend me the suit jacket?

500
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,640
Look.

501
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:10,000
In return for the 250 gift I got for you. How is it?

502
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,520
Miss Yu.

503
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,359
President Wang, I thought you're leaving.

504
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,640
What happened?

505
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,040
It was just an accident

506
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
that my dress got dirty.

507
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,239
So I have to cover it.

508
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,800
It's for your dress. But are you okay?

509
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,359
No, it's nothing at all.

510
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,719
Thank you. President Wang.

511
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:43,239
I've told you that don't call me president.

512
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,599
It's Charlie.

513
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,760
Listen, as the host of this event,

514
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,079
we didn't provide proper service,

515
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,239
so your dress got dirty.

516
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,239
So I think

517
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,199
I should take you to buy a new dress,

518
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,640
as a gift of making friends.

519
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,079
A donor should get your reward,

520
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,599
but I did nothing at all.

521
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,280
Of course, you should be rewarded.

522
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,359
We wouldn't have had the chance

523
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:05,479
to work with the university without your help.

524
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,719
It's so late that I may miss the last subway.

525
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,119
Subway?

526
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,400
The subway stops so early.

527
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,319
It's not a problem.

528
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,079
My driver can take you home.

529
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,239
President, I don't think it's a good idea.

530
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,400
What is wrong?

531
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,839
I've told you before,

532
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,040
now we are a family.

533
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,719
Wait. I got a call.

534
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:34,239
Hi, what? Buy the cemetery?

535
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,520
Why do you ask me?

536
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,439
How could I know it?

537
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,920
Well, I see. I see.

538
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,880
Remove the make-up, no one won't know who I am.

you had feelings again for that pretender, right?

561
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,680

562

What about the temperature of the same period?

564
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,920
Filter the data by the temperature,

565
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,439
then we can make comparisons with last year.

566
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,959

733
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,560
Are you leaving? Are you off work now?

734
00:44:00,479 --> 00:44:02,879
Excuse me, I saw you have eaten so many.

735
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:04,520
So I'm sure you must love it.

736
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,199
Here is the truffle taste.

737
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:07,439
Buy it yourself.

738
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:09,120
You can eat as many as you want.

739
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,600
It's not her business.

740
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,800
Sure it's not.

741
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,560
There's something wrong with her head.

742
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,840
She's insane.

743
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,120
The toilet paper is cheap?

744
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:23,000
It's on sale. The last one.

745
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,760
Let me do the calculations.

746
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,800
28.8 yuan of 30 rolls. So one roll costs...

747
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,959
Excuse me.

748
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,719
Please step aside.

749
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:31,840
For what?

750
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,919
You're stepping on it.

751
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,399
It's none of your business.

752
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,080
Are you crazy?

753
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:53,370

754
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:58,770
