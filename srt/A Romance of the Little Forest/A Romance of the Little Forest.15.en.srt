[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,620
[Episode 15]
[Auntie, you're being too friendly.]

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,464
Is he still in bed?

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
Morning.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,968
Morning.

27
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,199
You were up so late last night.

28
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,657
I thought you weren't coming.

29
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:52,793
- You know what time I went to bed?
- I guessed.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
Go ahead. I'm leaving.

31
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,739
You were unhappy when my mom
asked you to look after me the other day.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,951
What did you say?

33
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,279
Nothing.

34
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,399
My mom brought you
some black sesame dessert.

35
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,991
Come with me and get it if you can.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,999
No. I don't deserve it.

37
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:28,360
No way. My mom said it was for you.

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,180
I can't take it for myself.
You have to take it.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,504
Okay, I'll go get it when I can.

40
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:48,783
Go on. I won't ruin your run.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,039
Oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,279
I got up too early.

43
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,200
I'm starving.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,152
Go and do your run.

45
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,600
I don't deserve it.

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,830
You're drawing a line between us.

47
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,039
Didn't you say you'd get it yourself?

48
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,800
Tens of minutes went by.

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,904
Where are you?

50
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,279
Trees will die when they move,
but people will rise when they change.

51
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:46,832
You don't come to take it. I'll bring it to you.

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,752
No. I'm being so forward.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,372
I don't have to do that.

54
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,960
You said you'd get it when you could.

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,960
You're the only one who's busy with work. Okay?

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
I don't care. Let me tell you.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,119
I just give you one more day.

58
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,136
Just be smart.

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,239
What's up? What are you saying all morning?

60
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:24,208
Tiantian, I'm glad I have you to help me fight.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,679
Look.

62
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,399
You're really my junior.

63
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,739
You know I'm late so you got it for me.

64
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:53,085
Fine. You see the new lover laughing,
but you don't hear the old one crying.

65
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:58,311
I can't compete with your girlfriend. Right?

66
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,079
Put it away.

67
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,679
It's not good if it gets cold.

68
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,279
Who says I was giving it to her?

69
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,720
No.

70
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:11,694
Did I say who it was for?
I said it's for your girlfriend.

71
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,114
Were you just thinking of Yu?

72
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:19,336
Not Yu but shrimp.
(Yu sounds like fish in Chinese)

73
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:30,971
Come on.

74
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,279
You posted a picture of
the two of you on Moments.

75
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,919
Why do you act like you fear others to know?

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,340
Nothing I fear if people find out.

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,040
That's right.

78
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,760
- We're not like what you said.
- Fine.

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,207
If you say so. Eat.

80
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,040
Don't be mad.

81
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,056
Okay. Come on.

82
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,008
Let me ask you.

83
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:57,399
There are no plans for our lab today.

84
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,679
You came over for breakfast alone so early.

85
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,000
That's not your style.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,971
And the weird part is the small steamed buns.

87
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,782
Who's it for?

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,880
For you, okay?

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,239
The small steamed buns of Huaguang Unversity
are the best among all colleges.

90
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,959
It's the difference
between fermented and unfermented.

91
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,079
It's not that good.

92
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,079
I think they all taste the same.
[Rising Capricorn]

93
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,358
So it's not the buns that
matter, but the love behind it.

94
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,799
Don't talk nonsense.

95
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,839
The love luck of the rising Capricorn.

96
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,096
Can't get and can't forget.

97
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,575
Just for fun.

98
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,679
Isn't your rising sign Sagittarius?

99
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,779
Why are you checking the Capricorn?

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,824
Is Professor Zhuang a rising Capricorn?

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,319
You're great. You even got his birth date.

102
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,519
Did your mom ask you
to get it for fortune telling?

103
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,391
You're moving fast.

104
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Not yet.

105
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,520
Plus, no one does
fortune telling in this century.

106
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,688
We're not superstitious. Okay?

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,839
Did he tell you himself?

108
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,799
Well, I guessed his sign first.

109
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:31,440
Did he tell you he was a rising Capricorn?

110
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,591
Yeah.

111
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,601
What's wrong?

112
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:37,760
No. That's OOC.

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,040
How could Professor Zhuang
be interested in signs?

114
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,760
Ordinary straight guys can't figure out

115
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,920
something detailed like the
rising, let alone a scientist like him.

116
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,541
- Unless...
- Unless some girl told him.

117
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,160
My obsession with him makes me confused.

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,000
With my judgment when my head is clear,

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,320
how could I not see this flaw sooner?

120
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,600
Well, not so absolutely.

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,880
That's definitely true.

122
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,320
No. I have to go to ask him face to face.

123
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,776
You... you... calm down. How to ask?

124
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,359
It's strange.

125
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,440
He's not at home, and the lab is not open.

126
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,257
Where could he have gone?

127
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:25,269
He's not going to meet his crush.

128
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,200
- You were looking for me?
- Yes, I'm looking for you.

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,679
I have something to tell you.

130
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,759
- Can't you tell me on WeChat?
- No, I have to tell you face to face.

131
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,719
Say it.

132
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,880
Which is it?

133
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,880
No. I'm not in a position to ask that.

134
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,760
We're not in a relationship
after we left Qingshui Village.

135
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,228
If he doesn't tell me, it'd make me embarrassed.

136
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:00,148
What do you mean, "which is it"?

137
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
Uh...

138
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:07,320
Didn't I tell you my mom brought you
black sesame dessert and walnuts?

139
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,719
She told me to tell you there were
many ways to eat them face to face.

140
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,752
So, so, I just... I...

141
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,343
Your phone is ringing.

142
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,975
Why are you calling me?

143
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:32,359
Judging by his tone,
it should be an acquaintance.

144
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,559
The Moments?

145
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
I posted that photo just for fun.

146
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,471
No need anymore.

147
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,685
That person cares about the photo of me.

148
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,885
It must be an ex-girlfriend or a crush.

149
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:46,679
It must be the one who studies the signs.

150
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,783
Well.

151
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,855
How have you been?

152
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,280
There's someone that Zhuang Yu cares about.

153
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,860
It must be his unforgettable ex-girlfriend.

154
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,168
Take care of yourself.

155
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,679
What does that smile mean?

156
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,760
He's so cold to me.

157
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,304
But he smiles at his ex-girlfriend.

158
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
What's up?

159
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,504
Who's it?

160
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,720
No one.

161
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,640
Nice cover.

162
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,231
He must hide something from me.

163
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,599
Never mind. Forget I even asked.

164
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,640
I'll go play with other friends.

165
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,080
The black sesame dessert
and walnuts you just said...

166
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,727
Nothing. I'll tell you when I'm happy.

167
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,280
You said you didn't
set message notifications on WeChat.

168
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,872
But you seem pretty happy texting back.

169
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm not looking at your phone.

170
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,752
Just go on.

171
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,983
He's hiding it. There must be something.

172
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:08,760
What's wrong with you?

173
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,171
Nothing.

174
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,458
It's either an ex-girlfriend or a crush.

175
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,482
Why are you here?

176
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:23,554
I thought I told you I was
busy today on the phone.

177
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:26,112
- Who's he?
- Who's she?

178
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,239
Their faces are a 70% match.

179
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:36,792
Does he have no girlfriend but a secret...

180
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,048
Brother.

181
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,671
Fine. I'm overthinking it.

182
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,719
Hello, boy.

183
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,080
What's your name?

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,880
This is your name card, right?

185
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,109
Zhuang Suiyu.

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,239
He's your little brother?

187
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,408
Your family's way of naming is unique.

188
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
My name is Zhuang Hui.

189
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,919
H-U-I, Hui.

190
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,359
Uneducated.

191
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,520
Rude.

192
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Say hello.

193
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,559
You don't have to do that, kid.

194
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,712
Hello, auntie.

195
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,280
Kid, I guess you're nearsighted.

196
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,760
Did you forget to wear glasses?

197
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
I'll come closer so you can see me clearly.

198
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,960
What do you call me?

199
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,628
Auntie.

200
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:22,119
You're shortsighted.

201
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,991
I got 20/20 vision.

202
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:28,520
You took the test two years ago.

203
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,719
Time to recheck.

204
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:32,479
Yeah. Let your brother take you to the hospital.

205
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,880
Go to see an eye specialist.

206
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,320
Or you're not professional.

207
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,000
Auntie, you're being too friendly.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,520
Are you a rising Sagittarius?

209
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,760
How do you know?

210
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,420
Why did you get the bad habit
of studying horoscopes from mom?

211
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,407
It's your mom that told
you about your rising sign.

212
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,600
Brother, let's go.

213
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,192
Brother, how did she know your rising sign?

214
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,559
Brother, open the door.

215
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,719
Do dad and mom know you run away?

216
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,871
Brother, let me tell you.

217
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,919
Secretive.

218
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,319
I'm not interested.

219
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,280
They both have stony faces.

220
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,320
I was thinking too much.

221
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,440
How could Zhuang Yu have an ex-girlfriend?

222
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,048
Brother, is there something
wrong with that auntie's...

223
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,104
Don't talk nonsense.

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,784
Auntie, why don't you leave?

225
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,608
Brother, you two are living together?

226
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,496
I'm leaving.

227
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,559
So, auntie also lives here.

228
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,288
Auntie? How can you put up with this?

229
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,832
Calm down! It's not a big deal.

230
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,640
The TV show was right.

231
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,359
Love makes people better.

232
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,559
Look at you.

233
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,839
Now you've got that glow of motherhood.

234
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,039
I'm still in a romance drama.

235
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,200
But you turned it into a family drama.

236
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,599
That's what I meant.

237
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,655
Feel it.

238
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,119
Brother, I missed your
cooking every day at home.

239
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:37,239
Then eat.

240
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,112
However...

241
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:46,717
I finally got here but I can't eat your food.

242
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,912
It's not easy for me to get here, too.

243
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Alright. I'll cook for you
when your eyesight is better.

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,152
Really?

245
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,279
Here, eat it.

246
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,799
Cute?

247
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,760
Serious. I've rented a space.

248
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,679
What nice place can you
rent with your low salary?

249
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,679
Look at this house.

250
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,359
It gets enough light
and it's close to the subway.

251
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,839
I rented it from the landlord,
which saves the agent's fee.

252
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Not bad.

253
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,376
But why do you have to spend that money?

254
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,960
I know myself well enough.

255
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,119
I'll never be a third wheel.

256
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,000
My presence here makes you inconvenient.

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,760
What are you talking about?

258
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,640
We're not in a relationship
when we left Qingshui Village.

259
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,760
I had to find a reason to see him.

260
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,744
Plus, there's another little third wheel.

261
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,159
You're wrong! You have no idea.

262
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,600
He's not a third wheel.

263
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,599
In romance, kids are at the top
of the supportive food chain.

264
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:09,560
If you have his support, the feelings
between you two will be sweeter.

265
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,840
Brother, the girl on your Moments
is that auntie, right?

266
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,040
Auntie?

267
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,760
You think she's old?

268
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,280
Yeah, she wears lipstick.

269
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,800
Women who put on lipstick are all aunties.

270
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,400
Dad and mom said she was your girlfriend.

271
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,880
I think they assumed too much.

272
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,039
She's old and uneducated.

273
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,039
She can't even pronounce my name.

274
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,911
You don't like her.

275
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,431
You're being rude.

276
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:45,934
The space between the two characters is wide.

277
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,057
Brother.

278
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:51,679
Did you finish your homework?

279
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,479
Of course.

280
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,459
I'm saying your Chinese homework.

281
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:00,647
I haven't used my game time today.

282
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,799
I'll give you 10 minutes.

283
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,720
10 minutes?

284
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,599
It's not enough for a round of the game.

285
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,281
Five minutes.

286
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:10,775
Why are you acting like Mr. Chen at home?

287
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,655
Three minutes.

288
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:23,879
Subservience and flattery.

289
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,470
That's not my style.

290
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,040
You got some backbone.

291
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,248
Don't move. It's crooked.

292
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:34,119
It wasn't the right time for me to move.

293
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,199
I missed the big scene of
the three of you returning home.

294
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:42,800
Or, an expert like me will know what he's like.

295
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
What could he be like?

296
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,719
He's like his brother.

297
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:49,119
I already have one
stony-face freak in my life.

298
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,200
I can't deal with another one.

299
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,588
Have a look. It's done.

300
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,895
Professional.

301
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,760
That's not professional.

302
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,700
I'll take you to do
a better one when you're free.

303
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,199
Drop it.

304
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:06,839
I'm on call 24 hours a day
after I signed the contract.

305
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,514
24 hours?

306
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:11,239
Even a phone needs to be charged.

307
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:13,719
What kind of person is your boss?

308
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,072
A capitalist, a vampire!

309
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:20,160
The most handsome man
in the world, President Jin.

310
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,000
I returned to Shanghai.
See you at the office tomorrow afternoon.

311
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:29,560
I'll explain it to Tiantian
before I told Yu Meiren what I did.

312
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,500
It's not the right time to let Yu Meiren know it.

313
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:52,914
You're off duty tomorrow afternoon.

314
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,409
You don't have to work.

315
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,439
I didn't expect the capitalist
to give me a day off.

316
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,359
Really?

317
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,316
I'll show you around tomorrow morning.

318
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:04,954
The capitalist gave me the afternoon off.

319
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,560
But I have to go to the office.

320
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,590
And I have an event tomorrow night.

321
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,839
It's okay. I can't repay my debt any time soon.

322
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,232
We have plenty of time.

323
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,520
After you showed up in my video last time,

324
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,359
many people asked when you'd appear again.

325
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,328
Wanna change your career?

326
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,079
I'm not like you.

327
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,160
You have a skill.

328
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,984
I can't do anything. So, no.

329
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,239
That's right.

330
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:36,742
If my parents and your grandma
know it, I'll have one more problem.

331
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,760
By the way, did you find out
what happened last time?

332
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,920
Who leaked it?

333
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,971
My mom said it might be
Wang Xiumei's in-laws, Gou Xiang's mom.

334
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:54,119
When did Aunt Gou become
a fashionable makeup lover?

335
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,520
When did I become so influential?

336
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,280
Don't flatter yourself!

337
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,319
Aunt Gou doesn't wear makeup.
Why did she follow you?

338
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,640
For my beauty.

339
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,376
I'm such a treat to look at.

340
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,544
It's just been a few days
and you're getting more confident.

341
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:17,560
But then again, I think probably it
was leaked by some young guys.

342
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,119
You've seen everyone on the One-Month-Old Feast.

343
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,136
Who do you think it is?

344
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,818
Mom, I got a thing. I'm leaving.

345
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,657
You don't eat?

346
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:31,525
You're used to the big city.
You can't even eat in the village.

347
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,959
I remember.

348
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:39,768
I did see someone who
shouldn't have been there.

349
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:49,678
Do you know who she is?

350
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,800
Probably not.

351
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,079
No. It's photoshopped.

352
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,711
Let me find another one.

353
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,551
Check again. Remember.

354
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,520
I got it.

355
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,640
Who?

356
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,719
I think I've seen her in the company.

357
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,016
Company?

358
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,959
Which firm do you work for?

359
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:29,559
Its name is Xing, something.

360
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,800
In fact, I don't really recognize it.

361
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,760
They don't tell me and I'm embarrassed to ask.

362
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,239
It's not going to be Xingfu.

363
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,679
Maybe it is.

364
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:41,704
I can't believe you're an enemy agent.

365
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,760
Xingfu is our rival.

366
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,640
When did its boss get himself disabled?

367
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Forget about that.

368
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,847
Why do you ask about her?

369
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,640
I saw her on the One-Month-Old Feast.

370
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,703
Who... who's her?

371
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,040
Xia Zhi, the newest beauty blogger.

372
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,160
She always goes against me.

373
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,599
Your One-Month-Old Feast was a very big deal.

374
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,480
Two bloggers came to it.

375
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,775
Unless... Unless...

376
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,687
Brother, what are you watching?

377
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,704
Flowers.

378
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,760
What flowers make you so happy?

379
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,400
Interesting flowers.

380
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,463
I'd like to watch them.

381
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:06,840
Time to bed.

382
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,289
No. I haven't finished this round.

383
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,580
Brother, you're also good at playing games?

384
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,479
Why am I dead?

385
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,352
Lie down if you die.

386
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,714
Lights out earlier than at school.

387
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:31,694
Go home if you're not used to it.

388
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,448
Mei.

389
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,199
Enough.

390
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:50,120
Don't move, Li Tiantian.

391
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,560
It's noisy.

392
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,199
Stop it.

393
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,000
Don't move.

394
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
Alright. Go to bed.

395
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
[Zhuang Yu]

396
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,042
Morning.

397
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,680
Tiantian, why are you still here?

398
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,040
I still have some work to do.

399
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,767
I'll leave when I'm done.

400
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,199
Tiantian.

401
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:39,119
No need. Get off work and go home.

402
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,000
It's okay, President Jin, you go ahead.

403
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,775
I'll water the flowers.

404
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:48,680
I let you be off... to...
to... to make up for

405
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,200
the weekend I asked you
to deliver the files for me.

406
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,640
Do you know?

407
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,808
I'm a man of my word.
I won't take more of your time.

408
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:01,599
But I did that at night.

409
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,680
How could I be off from noon?

410
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,039
Working on a legal day gets three days off.

411
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:11,920
Don't be so strict.

412
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,280
It's okay. I'll be done soon.

413
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,016
Not soon.

414
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,471
President Jin.

415
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,992
I find you've changed.

416
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,319
You've got some glow of humanity.

417
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:31,479
Well, maybe another time for the kind words.

418
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,920
Go home to get some rest.

419
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,120
Go.

420
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,680
Good afternoon. I just woke up.

421
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,607
Professor Zhuang, what are you up to today?

422
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,431
By the way, President Jin,

423
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,839
I have a friend who's also a blogger.

424
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,319
She seems to be being exploited by her boss.

425
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,959
Your company is doing this business.

426
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,280
Wanna get her to join you?

427
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,620
So that we can take care of each other.

428
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:05,719
Her Weibo ID is Mermaid With Long Legs.

429
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,304
Do you know?

430
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:11,319
I... I... I think I've heard of her.

431
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,960
President Jin, why are you sweating?

432
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,839
Are you too hot?

433
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,800
Or not feeling well?

434
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,719
No, I'm comfortable.

435
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,479
Seriously. You should rest.

436
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,520
Go home and rest.

437
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,560
I'll get the door.

438
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,615
No need.

439
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,544
It's you, Linda. Great.

440
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:44,479
I got it. I'll leave now.

441
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,120
Be careful, Tiantian.

442
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,360
President Jin, the wheelchair.

443
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,375
Hello, Meiren.

444
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,472
Hi, Meiren.

445
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,064
- Hello, Meiren.
- Meiren.

446
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,439
Nowhere to hide a
wheelchair in this shitty office.

447
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,072
No way.

448
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,575
Hello.

449
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,784
What's it?

450
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,863
Linda broke her leg the other day.

451
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,239
Linda, are you okay? You're in a wheelchair.

452
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:43,921
It's okay.

453
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:46,719
- Looks like you got hurt badly.
- No, it's fine.

454
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,920
- Let me help you.
- No need.

455
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,520
- Enough.
- I can do it myself.

456
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,628
She's fine.

457
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:54,743
It's just been a few weeks.
Why did you become so cold-blooded?

458
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,280
What makes you think so?

459
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,319
Her wheelchair is electric.

460
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,959
She can make it.

461
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,719
You haven't sat on it. How do you know?

462
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:03,880
I've sat on it.

463
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,119
I... I tried it out just now.

464
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,560
Alright. Forget that.

465
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,479
I've borrowed a dress
for you for tonight's event.

466
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:13,000
Makeup at the office.

467
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,319
Fang will get you straight to the event.

468
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,599
Okay.

469
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,904
That's so thoughtful of you.

470
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,119
How was your holiday?

471
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,371
Not bad.

472
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:25,239
You're not being exploited, are you?

473
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,913
Exploit? How could I use
such a word to describe you?

474
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:30,685
I'm glad you didn't.

475
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:34,945
By the way, did you ask someone
to take down the picture on the doorway?

476
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,714
Well, that picture, uh, that
picture on the doorway, right?

477
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:43,439
It's me. I didn't have time to tell you.

478
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,719
It was shot in the early days.

479
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,239
I've never been satisfied with it.

480
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:48,228
I've been trying to ask you to take it down.

481
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,830
But I can't say it directly.
I feared they may get it wrong.

482
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,971
I didn't expect you to know what I thought.

483
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:55,538
President Jin, it's very kind of you.

484
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,439
What are you talking about?

485
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:59,119
We're friends.

486
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,479
Check the schedule for tonight.

487
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,728
Let me see.

488
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,000
You're happy.

489
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,342
Did you get lucky in love?

490
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:17,800
It's developing steadily and progressively.

491
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,040
Thanks for your concerns.

492
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,255
Hope you can give us more personal space.

493
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:29,040
Did your friends know about it?

494
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,171
Friends?

495
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:33,520
We haven't gotten to the official announcement.

496
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,281
No.

497
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:38,079
I mean, your good friend who grew up with you.

498
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,439
Your childhood friend, your bestie.

499
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:43,160
What does she think of you being together?

500
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,936
We haven't been together yet.

501
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,167
You're not together.

502
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,975
Well, what's your bestie's type?

503
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,239
She?

504
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:57,880
She likes leading men of romance.

505
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,959
Leading men of romance?

506
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,319
President Jin, I've got your concern.

507
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,959
But it's not the time to think of love yet.

508
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,832
I got business to do.

509
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,119
You're right.

510
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,463
Go on.

511
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,741
Brother, that's too ugly.

512
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:26,914
How did you catch me?

513
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,494
I've memorized the sight chart for nothing.

514
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:33,319
I played that trick 20 years ago.

515
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,520
I'd like to wear contacts.

516
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
Not until you're 18.

517
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,736
Brother, don't you hate eggplant and cilantro?

518
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,968
Something's up.

519
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,199
Eggplant has anthocyanin.

520
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,303
So?

521
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,525
Good for the eyes.

522
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,752
What?

523
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:22,069
Give me your phone.

524
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm not playing on it.

525
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,783
Brother, what are you looking at?

526
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,000
You have eyes on your back.

527
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,248
It's scary.

528
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:41,428
That photo looks a bit
like that auntie yesterday.

529
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:45,428
And sort of like the girl on your Moments.

530
00:31:45,428 --> 00:31:49,748
Brother, you're not going
to fall for this internet celebrity.

531
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,599
I'm sorry. I should be polite.

532
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,419
Plus, you can't talk about my friend like that.

533
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:01,254
Your glasses are crooked.

534
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,696
No.

535
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:08,440
Brother, you've made a friend.

536
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,599
- Nice makeup.
- Yeah.

537
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,919
Look at the nice sets.

538
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,439
Grape juice as usual.

539
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,520
How's it?

540
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,050
Did you see my hand was shaking just now?

541
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:40,959
No.

542
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,239
Miss Meiren, you're still so glamorous.

543
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:44,479
Why are you here?

544
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,280
Since I said we'd see the day after tomorrow,

545
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,200
I wouldn't miss the appointment.

546
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:52,224
He's the son of the supplier
of Qin Ya Raw Materials.

547
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,240
I'm disrespectful.

548
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:01,079
You've suffered a lot on the mountain.

549
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,520
Were you scared?

550
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,800
No.

551
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,479
If the kindness that you've
shown me is a shadow,

552
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:09,239
I'd like to sleep in the sisal bush every day.

553
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:11,497
Oh, please.

554
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:13,760
All your favorites.

555
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,000
Here you go.

556
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,680
Don't mind if I do.

557
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:28,498
Excuse me. I'm going to do something big.

558
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:34,139
Miss Xia, this cooperation is not up to me.

559
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:37,520
Do you think what other ways
of cooperation there are?

560
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,815
Well...

561
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,160
Is there something I can help with?

562
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,743
Meiren, you're here.

563
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,280
Although Miss Xia doesn't work
in my company, we're old friends.

564
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,248
She's kind of my half-sister.

565
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:55,840
Take care of her if there are any jobs.

566
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,135
Sure. I'll let you talk.

567
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,520
By the way, Meiren,
I've talked about the copywriting with Fang.

568
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,160
Please check when you get back.

569
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,455
Thank you.

570
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,511
Don't go. Let's talk.

571
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,412
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yes, I did.

572
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,679
Good.

573
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,542
Brother, it's just a little spicy.

574
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,882
I thought you didn't like spicy dishes.

575
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:53,863
Brother, if you think it's spicy,
why not we get something to drink?

576
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,847
Cheers!

577
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,919
It's great.

578
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,600
Eat if it's not spicy.

579
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,488
Brother, you caught me.

580
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:34,887
Eat it.

581
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,159
I thought you said eggplant
had anthocyanin that was good for the eyes.

582
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,619
Eggplant without skin has no anthocyanin.

583
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:44,216
Then you...

584
00:35:57,828 --> 00:36:01,371
Why didn't I know Xingfu
was so short-handed now?

585
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:04,466
You had to talk about the business yourself.

586
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,879
I didn't know why you became the holy mother.

587
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,485
Half-sister.

588
00:36:09,485 --> 00:36:11,239
Did you disgust me on purpose?

589
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,648
Disgust? I don't think so.

590
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:21,056
We've been friends long enough to be sisters.

591
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,959
What do you think?

592
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,495
Gou Fei.

593
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,959
This test is difficult.

594
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:32,368
Only one student did rather well.

595
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,239
Yu Meiren.

596
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,519
She's the only one who got 100 points.

597
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,760
It's Yu Meiren again. That's not fun.

598
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,600
That's why ugly people should study hard.

599
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,840
I don't recognize you if I don't look closely.

600
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,047
How is this possible?

601
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,975
You sent my photo on Weibo to my mom, right?

602
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:07,239
What photo? I don't know what you're saying.

603
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,879
Gou Fei, you know what, you asked
your mom to send it to Aunt Xiumei,

604
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,542
it's too obvious.

605
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:16,000
Do you think I won't recognize you?

606
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,956
So what if you do?

607
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:20,630
You make money by trading on your look.

608
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,857
And you take our teacher's good reputation.

609
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:23,942
What?

610
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:28,514
You're the one who lied.
I just revealed the truth.

611
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:32,800
Seems like our primary school
gym teacher didn't teach your Chinese well.

612
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,248
Is that how you use "trade on the look"?

613
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,000
It just occurred to me.

614
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,840
What did you call yourself on Weibo?

615
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,120
ABC, right?

616
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,639
You've just come back from America.

617
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,919
No wonder your Chinese is so poor.

618
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:51,678
But why didn't I know
I got a homegirl from the U.S.?

619
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:53,024
What do you want?

620
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,239

I won't hold that as chips to threaten you.

628

you did behind my back.

This is the way you used to be and you are.

635

quota of a top high school in the city.

our school when you get there.

642
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:07,527
Did we ever fight for
something when we were kids?

643
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,120
It's nothing personal.

644
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,919
I was thinking, I was always the
top one before I was in high school.

645
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:18,440
I never fought with anyone
until Zhuang appeared.

647

to stay with you tomorrow.

♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

718
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,480
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

719
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,180
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

720
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,160
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

721
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,880
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

722
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,110
♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

723
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:45,530
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

724
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,510
♫ You make all the stars in the sky shine for me ♫

725
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:56,210
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

726
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:01,080
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

727
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,536
♫ Even the air is filled with the scent of flowers ♫
