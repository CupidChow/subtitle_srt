[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,359
[Episode 32]
[Panicking is a disaster strategically.]

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,319
If I could learn your skills in school,

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,639
I would be willing to study for a doctorate.

26
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,238
You can use your skills for chasing Yu on anyone.

27
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,879
But let me warn you, stay away from him.

28
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,440
Or I'll show him your true colors.

29
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,800
What did you mean?

30
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,878
Don't ask me.

31
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:00,120
Go ask your subject.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,199
Maybe he'll tell you.

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,719
Or maybe you want to tell me some big secrets?

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Not a cat-and-mouse play,

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,639
but to wait for windfalls.

36
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,199
Well, you got me.

37
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,720
I should have studied harder.

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,279
I'll go read the textbook now.

39
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,720
Tiantian, I'm so screwed.

40
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,360
Don't panic.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,000
Resorting to force after fair means.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,320
I think her warning you first

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,520
means she hasn't told Zhuang Yu yet.

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,118
Since when has she been fair?

45
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,320
That's not what I'm saying.

46
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,439
But you do have a point.

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,360
It sounds less of a warning than a...

48
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,199
Muscle flexing.

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,119
Anyway, don't panic.

50
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,119
Panicking is a disaster strategically.

51
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,320
Knowledgeable.

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,479
No, I can't find it.

53
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,759
I'm disorganized in an organized way.

54
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,960
I clearly remember the format
is buried in the manuscripts.

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,838
The manuscripts are here,
but the format is gone.

56
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:23,479
Deep breath...how about this?

57
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,199
I'm coming.

58
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,600
We'll figure it out together.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,160
Okay, see you later.

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,839
I have a visitor, bye-bye.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,880
Who is it?

62
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,960
Why are you sneaking?

63
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,600
I don't want to disturb your beautiful dance.

64
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,039
Here.

65
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,479
Wait.

66
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,678
Come here.

67
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,600
Go take it to Grandma Li.

68
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,119
Yes, Ma'am.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,758
And tell Tiantian to take care.

70
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,399
The temperature can drop sharply.

71
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,479
Tiantian is in town to deliver goods.

72
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,720
By herself?

73
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,440
With Jin Xi.

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,919
Well...

75
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,800
I'll go.

76
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,160
This way, I can play chess with Zhang.

77
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,760
I think this is actually a good thing.

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,239
Tiantian is in town with Jin Xi,
who can take care of her.

79
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,239
I have nothing to worry about.

80
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,559
Are you stupid?

81
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,719
Do you know...

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
Mom, I like Tiantian.

83
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,078
No matter whom she chooses to be with,

84
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,720
as long as it's her wish,

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,760
and she's happy,

86
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,559
I should support her.

87
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,119
Don't you think so?

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,320
On my way, mom.

89
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,040
You...

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,839
He got this from me.

91
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,320
What are you talking about?

92
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,399
Go back to the dance.

93
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,160
My stupid baby boy.

94
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,200
A penny for your thought.

95
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,959
Are you having a beverage without me?

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm thinking when I go to Alxa,

97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,399
it may be a luxury to have a sip of this.

98
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,239
Come on, you have rich parents.

99
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,519
Even if you want to build a palace in the desert,

100
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,719
they'll make it happen.

101
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,679
A sip of this is a piece of cake.

102
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,119
Building a palace in the desert is illegal.

103
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,720
Living off my parents is against my heart.

104
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,399
Therefore, I'll do neither.

105
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,480
Wow,
a year studying with me has a good influence on you.

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
You sounded all grown up.

107
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,559
But my ability to praise myself and others

108
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,920
is to be improved.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,399
Who'd have thought that

110
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,440
a kid who worked against his rich parents

111
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,440
is now single-minded about his study?

112
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,040
I know someone like this.

113
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,320
Who?

114
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,760
Tell me.

115
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,000
My treat. Enjoy it.

116
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,278
Feel free to use those tricks of yours on anybody.

117
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,519
But let me warn you, stay away from him.

118
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,679
What are you thinking about?

119
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,359
What did you say?

120
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:17,519
No... why are you here?

121
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,678
Are you alright?

122
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,959
Accusing tone...

123
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,440
furrowed brows...

124
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,039
a tight fist...

125
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,679
He must have known it already.

126
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,040
Meiren?

127
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,480
Yes, what?

128
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,720
I've answered this question three times.

129
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,040
These photos you gave me,

130
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,720
there are three shots of each bird.

131
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,719
Do you want me to pick one or draw them all?

132
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
What do I want?

133
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,838
I only want to turn back time.

134
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,879
I shouldn't have made the
stupid format in the first place.

135
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,720
And I shouldn't have
printed them out like an idiot.

136
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,479
It's eco-unfriendly and
brings me endless troubles.

137
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,519
Do you feel sick?

138
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,799
Okay, feel sick.

139
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,358
Yes, I feel a little dizzy.

140
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,399
Low blood sugar?

141
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,279
Could be.

142
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,720
Please leave the patient alone.

143
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,760
Lucky for you...

144
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,839
This is...

145
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:32,880
Besieging Wei to save Zhao.

146
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,598
A duck?

147
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,960
100 grams of banana contains about 91 kcal,

148
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
22 grams of carbohydrates,

149
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,359
and other nutrients such as protein,
dietary fiber and fat.

150
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,799
Perfect for your condition.

151
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,239
A skinned duck.

152
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:59,479
No, a peeled banana.

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,718
Skinned...peeled...

154
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,599
Is he threatening me?

155
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,559
She doesn't like
bananas... or... ducks?

156
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Your hand is shaking.

157
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:18,320
Eat it.

158
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,200
Okay.

159
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,719
Okay.

160
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,679
Besieging Wei to save Zhao...not working.

161
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,119
How about some syrup?

162
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,479
Syrup instead of hot water.

163
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,440
Smart and a quick learner.

164
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,640
Seems my plan is working too well.

165
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,799
No, thank you.

166
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,679
I've been having some stomach trouble.

167
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,199
Except for Li Tiantian,
I have to keep off any sweet stuff.

168
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Speaking of whom,
she's on her way here.

169
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,840
If you'll excuse me,
I need to make some preparation.

170
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,238
His eyes seem to say he knows about it.

171
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,119
Or is he just sounding me out?

172
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,799
Seems she doesn't like bananas.

173
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,599
He looks so serious.

174
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:25,280
Is he about to interrogate me?

175
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:27,960
Let me ask you...

176
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Finally, the interrogation.

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,239
Do you...

178
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
- The truth is...
- hate bananas?

179
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,919
Do you not like bananas?

180
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,919
What do you like?

181
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,520
Grapes?

182
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,919
What are you talking about?

183
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,159
The fruits are not the point.

184
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,919
Please...just leave.

185
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,119
I'm not ready.

186
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,400
I'll see you tomorrow.

187
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,719
A miss is as good as a mile.

188
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,520
Look, the tea bushes are so beautiful.

189
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,479
Look here.

190
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,679
A little puppy.

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,719
So adorable.

192
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,880
You guys see his fluffy paws?

193
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,559
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,039
Is filming not allowed here?

195
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Don't mind me... continue.

196
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,079
Hold on.

197
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,640
Mr. Stranger,
could you show me how to get to the town?

198
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,320
You have a winding road in the village.

199
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,159
The mobile navigation is of little help.

200
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,400
Well, go straight ahead.

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,280
Pass two junctions.

202
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,840
Turn right.

203
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,679
Turn left at the sight of
the village committee.

204
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,719
Then go straight.

205
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:55,599
Pass three junctions.

206
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,440
Turn right again.

207
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,520
Then you'll see a car...

208
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,718
Stop.

209
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,159
Thank you,
but I can't remember any of what you said.

210
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,280
Then try to remember some,
and ask others about the rest.

211
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,440
Or how about you taking me to the town?

212
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm all alone in a strange village.

213
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
And you scared the puppy I was filming.

214
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,479
Sorry, but I have someplace to go now.

215
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,719
Look, I'm a travel blogger.

216
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,320
How about this?

217
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,799
Help me,
and you can appear in my Vlog.

218
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,719
Not interested.

219
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:28,520
Hold on.

220
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,919
Are you a grape grower?

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,158
No.

222
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,159
You run a B&B?

223
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,239
I knew it.

224
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,118
If you take me to the town,

225
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,840
maybe I'll help promote your B&B.

226
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,719
For free.

227
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,520
No, thank you.

228
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
You know what?

229
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
I have over one hundred thousand followers.

230
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,080
One hundred thousand?

231
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,599
Yes, impressive?

232
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,960
Never seen one with so many fans?

233
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,799
Never seen one so cocky.

234
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,280
Also, you know what?

235
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,719
I charge really high for ads.

236
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,320
Several thousand each.

237
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,080
But if you'll help me, I'll...
where are you going?

238
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,760
Don't touch it.

239
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,599
It's for Tiantian's grandma.

240
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,520
Tiantian?

241
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,919
You know what?

242
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,559
I'm Hao Xian.

243
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,599
You can call me Xianxian.

244
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:17,000
This name suits you well.

245
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,400
The boys here are interesting.

246
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,960
Mr. Stranger, you change your mind?

247
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,359
Go to the village committee.

248
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:27,880
Don't follow strangers.

249
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,200
Watch out for bad guys.

250
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,000
Interesting.

251
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,559
He knows.

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,200
He doesn't know.

253
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,359
He knows.

254
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,320
He doesn't know.

255
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,200
He knows.

256
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,359
No...no.

257
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,520
He doesn't know... good.

258
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,440
What are you mumbling about?

259
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,679
You went into the washroom
the minute you came in.

260
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,598
I've waited a long time.

261
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,080
Did Jin Xi call you?

262
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,400
No, it wasn't him. It's something else.

263
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,919
Can you stay here for a few days?

264
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,039
Okay, I promise I won't go anywhere

265
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,840
until you tide over this.

266
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,280
So, anything new?

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,880
I think he must have found it out.

268
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,919
You asked him?

269
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,918
No.

270
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,960
Then how do you know?

271
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,200
His eyes were full of doubt,
action full of disdain,

272
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,439
and tone full of scorn.

273
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,799
Perfect for your condition.

274
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,880
That's abstract.

275
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,400
I think he did it on purpose.

276
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,159
He wanted to break me,
so that I would tell him the truth,

277
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,520
without him interrogating me.

278
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't read too much into it.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,840
What you just described could also be

280
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,919
explained his guilty for cheating on you.

281
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,960
Right, it could be.

282
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,479
How could it give me any comfort?

283
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,358
I'm just kidding.

284
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:12,159
It's impossible that Professor
Zhuang would cheat on you.

285
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,960
Right?

286
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,679
Who is she?

287
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,358
I don't know.

288
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,440
You don't know?

289
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,359
Her photo is in your notebook.

290
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,599
This is Li's notebook.

291
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,678
Li?

292
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,320
He hardly ever hangs out with Li,

293
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,559
unless there is something going on.

294
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
Miss Supervisor,

295
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,519
wanna see my paintings?

296
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,239
Supervisor? No no no.

297
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,159
I'm Miss Monitor.

298
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,039
To monitor your knowledge of the whole thing.

299
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,479
That's a good joke.

300
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,280
I don't need to supervise your work.

301
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,080
Why do you have Li's notebook?

302
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,880
Well, I just keep it for him for a while.

303
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,519
Keep a high profile and be mysterious...

304
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,640
am I doing it right?

305
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:19,039
So secretive... it must concern me.

306
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,359
Could it be...

307
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,200
Curiosity is what leads to interest.

308
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,520
Something wrong?

309
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,119
He's sneering.

310
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:41,880
Alas, Li must have known about it, too.

311
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,118
Nothing.

312
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,918
I'm glad you're happy.

313
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,200
She's smiling.

314
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
So I'm doing it right.

315
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,119
I'm happy so long as you're happy.

316
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,478
Why do I get the feeling that
you're happy because I'm not?

317
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,479
What?

318
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,280
Well... this is a nice painting.

319
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,520
Thank you.

320
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,000
A perk of the job.

321
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,119
This smile seems dangerously weird.

322
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:18,400
So hot... why don't you use the air conditioner?

323
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,280
Come with me.

324
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,438
They are... emberiza spodocephalas.

325
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,640
They're too little to
stand the cold air of an air-conditioner.

326
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,880
It's cool in the study room.

327
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,479
Well...

328
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:48,959
god...

329
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,199
Sorry.

330
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,920
The washing machine was fine yesterday.

331
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,040
I don't know why it...

332
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,319
It's not your fault.

333
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,400
I haven't used it for long.

334
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,160
The drainpipe must get loose.

335
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,359
So Professor Zhuang will have
to redecorate his study room?

336
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,599
Don't worry; he doesn't sleep in it.

337
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,760
Wait... because of the emberiza spodocephalas,

338
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,959
he can't use the AC
in the living room and bedroom.

339
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,839
He can only sleep in the study room.

340
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,199
Well, then it must be very inconvenient.

341
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,160
It's an opportunity.

342
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,199
What opportunity?

343
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,159
Opportunity for redemption.

344
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,598
You can invite him to stay for a while,
as a favor.

345
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,318
As the old saying goes,
hard to blame a smiling face.

346
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,680
He's living under your roof.

347
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,800
Even if you did something wrong,

348
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,239
he will have to hear your explanation.

349
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,599
What's more,
staying in a hotel will cost a lot of money.

350
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,800
You're gonna let him pay?

351
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,079
I'll pay for it.

352
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,760
Will he accept it?

353
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,520
Good point.

354
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,760
What are you doing?

355
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,838
Sorry, Professor Zhuang,
it's Tiantian.

356
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,399
Because of me,
you can't sleep in your study room now.

357
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,199
How about this?

358
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,760
These days,
you come here and use Meiren's study room.

359
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,959
It's convenient for you
to go to the university or back home.

360
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,920
Again, sorry for all the inconvenience.

361
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,160
I really feel sorry.

362
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,920
Will it work?

363
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,920
Just wait.

364
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,078
As long as it's okay with Meiren.

365
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,359
Okay, I'll leave now.

366
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,560
Are you seriously leaving me alone with this?

367
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,640
Remember what I told
you a few days ago?

368
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,599
Why cling to the past if you truly care?

369
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,640
After all, what is done can't be undone.

370
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,079
I think Professor Zhuang will agree.

371
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,760
So I'll leave you two to work it out.

372
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,719
Go help him move, bye.

373
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,760
I won't see you off.

374
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,920
Okay.

375
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,640
Move now?

376
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,800
Zhuang Yu...

377
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,479
I need to talk to you.

378
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,599
I...

379
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,560
You...

380
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,199
You gonna take it?

381
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,439
Let me help you.

382
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,239
Yu Meiren, seriously?

383
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:28,640
Too many trips in one day.

384
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:46,439
Hello, Tiantian has gone back.

385
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:46,920
Why call me?

386
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,239
You don't surf the Internet?

387
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,880
I mean, this is huge.

388
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,078
Do you still consider me a friend?

389
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,599
Go check Weibo.

390
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,160
Turns out the natural beauty is a fake.

391
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,439
Is she having plastic surgery now?

392
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,399
Seriously? Unbelievable.

393
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,839
It looks nothing like her.

394
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,800
See the lips and cheekbones.

395
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,839
There's some resemblance.

396
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,280
Her name is on the group photo too.

397
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,680
The uncle of the fiancee of my

398
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,079
sister-in-law's neighbor's aunt's son

399
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,359
once worked with Mermaid.

400
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,800
On the contract, her real name is Yu Meiren.

401
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,359
Unmistakable.

402
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,680
My world is upside down now.

403
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,719
Looking back on it now,
she always wears makeup in her Vlog.

404
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,239
She must have been lying.

405
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,079
She had the nerve to say
makeup makes us confident,

406
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,000
talking about ordinary people
can look beautiful.

407
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,160
All plastic surgery.

408
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,040
Can you explain what happened to your face

409
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,640
before making money off us?

410
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,160
She played us like a bunch of fools.

411
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,680
The ugly always make more troubles.

412
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,319
Hello?

413
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,279
Are you still there?

414
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,119
Hello?

415
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,400
Anything wrong?

416
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,160
No, it's nothing.

417
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,520
Get back to work.

418
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,199
This... This is nothing, really.

419
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,839
I mean this book about
microbiological experiment.

420
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,839
You can leave it here.

421
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,078
You are not taking it?

422
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,280
But I like it.

423
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:11,400
There's so much to learn about microbiology.

424
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,680
Wait... don't.

425
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,520
Too much screen time is bad for the eyes,

426
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,719
according to experts.

427
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,560
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

428
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,599
Deliberate avoidance.

429
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,400
Unconscious nail-biting.

430
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:34,800
I have none of those.

431
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:37,838
Give it to me.

432
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,599
No.

433
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,639
Do you know Kübler Ross?

434
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,839
What Ross?

435
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:49,920
You mean the Kübler Ross model?

436
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,959
Yes, why?

437
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,439
It has nothing to do with me.

438
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,119
The theory describing five stages of grief

439
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:10,800
is introduced by a Swiss-American,
Elisabeth Kübler Ross.

440
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,680
Her book "On Death and Dying" published in 1969

441
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:18,000
introduces the "Five stages" model,

442
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,039
which received widespread attention.

443
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,000
Many popular books on psychology,
even textbooks,

444
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,560
have included the model.

445
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,599
Apart from death,

446
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,719
it is also used to explain
other phenomena in daily life.

447
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,118
Why am I only carrying this plant?

448
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,280
You don't trust me with other stuff?

449
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,239
It's very important.

450
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,479
I only trust it with you.

451
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,199
Also, I worry that with too much stuff,

452
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,040
you won't be able to hang up the phone.

453
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,839
According to the model,
the first stage of grief is denial.

454
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,359
What phone?

455
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,680
No idea what you're saying.

456
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,839
I don't even have it with me.

457
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,959
It's true.

458
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,959
Well?

459
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:15,959
Her phone is turned off.

460
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,000
Did she write the Divine Comedy?

461
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,880
She's more dramatic than Dante.

462
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,399
The golden-eight-hour PR rule.

463
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,439
Going on like this,
the enemy will win.

464
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,238
I'll go see her.

465
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,040
No, don't go.

466
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:35,640
She must have read these comments.

467
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,199
I can't believe these people,

468
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,560
mocking about what she's most diffident of.

469
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,239
She must be very upset.

470
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,640
Just give her some time.

471
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,920
Now is not the time to be upset.

472
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,079
Really not.

473
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,000
Wait, what did you just say?

474
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,160
She's most diffident of her appearance?

475
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,800
It's not me.

476
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,160
Are you okay?

477
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,599
Zhuang Yu?

478
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,959
Yes, it's me.

479
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,040
Why are you...

480
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,800
Your hands feel cold.

481
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,359
Cold? No, quite the contrary.

482
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,040
I feel hot... come on.

483
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,239
Any more books to move?

484
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,920
I can move like another 500 boxes of them.

485
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,598
Puzzles.

486
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,399
White...

487
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,359
Denial is a defensive mechanism.

488
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,920
To bury feelings to
escape the cruel reality.

489
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,280
Let me iron it for you.

490
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,199
Okay...

491
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:40,000
And there's a backpack.

492
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Seems pretty.

493
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,160
No, it's another dress.

494
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,800
Are you hungry?

495
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,959
Wanna have some food?

496
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,680
Here, have more.

497
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,880
It's already past your bedtime now.

498
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,199
Professor Zhuang, you're strange today.

499
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,460
That's because I'm with you.

500
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,439
Here comes your beer.

501
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,520
Thank you.

502
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Enjoy.

503
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,880
Cool.

504
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,199
I didn't know you liked junk food.

505
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,199
I just thought you might like it.

506
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,800
What are you suggesting?

507
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:45,880
But it's okay.

508
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,719
I don't care.

509
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:48,439
It doesn't bother me at all.

510
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,239
I...

511
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,640
They say I'm ugly.

512
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,280
You're not ugly.

513
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,359
Liar.

514
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,199
I am ugly.

515
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:05,599
I'm so ugly that
everybody would avoid me.

516
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,839
Give it back.

517
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,560
Well?

518
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,040
Funny? Are you impressed by that?

519
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:31,199
I don't need your comfort.

520
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,959
If you really think I'm pretty,

521
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,680
why didn't you reply to my letter?

522
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,599
What letter?

523
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,680
Don't play dumb.

524
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,839
Seriously,
would you write back to Jin Taozi?

525
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,119
Jin Taozi?

526
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,040
Who's Jin Taozi?

527
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,239
The campus belle.

528
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:56,160
I thought the campus flower is Photinia.

529
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:00,599
I said... don't play dumb.

530
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,160
I'm so sorry.

531
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,520
There's a mistake.

532
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
This is what you ordered.

533
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,439
Beer?

534
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:12,118
Unfiltered beer.

535
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,279
My apology.

536
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,160
What?

537
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,680
You're unbelievable.

538
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,400
You made a mistake.

539
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,160
Why did you...

540
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,680
Did we say anything?

541
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,000
No... I didn't mean...

542
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,760
I...

543
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,560
It's okay.

544
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,119
I'm furious.

545
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,399
The second stage of the Ross model.

546
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,599
Anger.

547
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,000
Is there any problem wearing makeup in Vlogs?

548
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,199
I never said I didn't wear make-up.

549
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:40,839
Suddenly I'm a liar? Unbelievable.

550
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,719
When the pain is too much

551
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,079
that denial won't help,

552
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,839
only by taking it out on others or oneself,

553
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,959
can the pain be eased.

554
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,280
You did nothing wrong.

555
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,479
Why bother with the mistakes of others?

556
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,239
Well said... I like it.

557
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,040
Let's go.

558
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,479
Excuse me, that would be 126 yuan.

559
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,920
Don't pay for the unfiltered beer.

560
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,280
Don't worry, I didn't count it in.

561
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,760
Are you eavesdropping on us?

562
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,078
Calm down.

563
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,239
How dare you...

564
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,839
They don't pay you much.

565
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,760
And you're not rich.

566
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,438
So you have to be thrifty.

567
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,560
Understood?

568
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,479
But don't you worry, because...

569
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,560
Because what?

570
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,959
Because I'll work really hard,
and provide you with...

571
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,359
Food and shelter?

572
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,000
Everything.

573
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,319
After all, I'm ugly.

574
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,000
I have nothing to lose.

575
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,680
You're not ugly.

576
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,959
You're beautiful.

577
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,680
Let's go.

578
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,800
Okay.

579
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,800
Here.

580
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,119
Lean on it.

581
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,400
Cozy.

582
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,439
What's wrong?

583
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,319
I'm going to puke...

584
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,359
Please pull over.

585
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,079
Slow down...

586
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,958
Are you okay?

587
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,760
I can't...

588
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,400
Have some water.

589
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,359
Better?

590
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,719
Better...

591
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,239
How can I get better?

592
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:03,640
Can you feel better if people
keep saying you're ugly?

593
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,119
Billions of people on earth.

594
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,400
If we care about everybody's opinion of us,

595
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,199
that would be exhausting.

596
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,000
You don't get it.

597
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,040
You're so good-looking.

598
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,319
You'll never get it.

599
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,679
But you're right.

600
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,640
I don't care about how those people thought.

601
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,880
I'm glad you agree.

602
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,199
It's getting late.

603
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:43,640
Let's deal with whatever trouble tomorrow morning,
okay?

604
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,359
Right.

605
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,640
Time to go.

606
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,280
Come on, bro.

607
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,239
Where...

608
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,130
Enough?

609
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,260
Is Yu Meiren really your best friend?

610
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,939
Best friend is understating.

611
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,410
We're closer than sisters.

612
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,330
Closer than sisters...

613
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,370
Then why do you seem not worried at all?

614
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,610
Relax. Professor Zhuang is with her.

615
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,610
You're sisters or twins?

616
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,700
You have telepathy?

617
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,130
Dummy, Professor Zhuang WeChatted me.

618
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,700
Since when were you WeChat friends?

619
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,300
It's a secret.

620
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,409
Secret?

621
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,889
Tiantian, how's my sister doing?

622
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,850
Why is he texting you?

623
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,940
He's worried about Meiren.

624
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,779
So... former king of MCN,
how did the investigation go?

625
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,740
Leave former out.

626
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,260
I'm still the king.

627
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,370
Just start talking.

628
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,460
Here, Madam.

629
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,500
Check this account.

630
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,740
It's the source of the photo.

631
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,569
Check its followers.

632
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,300
Only thousands of fans.

633
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,180
Now check the time of the post.

634
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,890
3 pm.

635
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,330
However slow-paced one's work is,

636
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,650
one should start working at 2 pm.

637
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,570
However lenient one's boss is,

638
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,610
one can't get off work before 4 pm.

639
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,890
3 pm is an awkward time.

640
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,260
It's not a time people usually use Weibo.

641
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,460
More like the working hour of zombie fans.

642
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,540
Look at the comments.

643
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,780
All trying to mislead people.

644
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,700
It must have been long plotted.

645
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,890
After 5 pm,
most people get off work.

646
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,220
They'll check Weibo to see what's new.

647
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,330
So it's a premeditated slander.

648
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,650
There's no unprovoked hate,

649
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,330
not to mention the hate comes with a big price.

650
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,330
But Meiren is no longer an Internet celebrity.

651
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,220
She only shows up for charity campaigns now.

652
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,090
Why would someone do this to her?

653
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,259
This is a marketing account.

654
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,850
I haven't found out who hired it yet.

655
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,330
But this photo...

656
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,460
I don't think many people have it.

657
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,700
Congrats.

658
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,260
You'll soon get what you want.

659
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,570
Two brands Yu Meiren asked me to contact

660
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,220
made it very clear that
they'll back out of the program.

661
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,809
Get what I want...

662
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,260
What do you think I want?

663
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,500
To witness her downfall in the business,

664
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,130
and make sure she never rises again?

665
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,939
She can only compete with me with money.

666
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,780
True.

667
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,180
I want money.

668
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,180
However...

669
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,500
there's also something else.

670
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,499
I also want the truth.

671
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,410
I want everybody to see the true color

672
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,570
of someone they like so much.

673
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,570
Professor Zhuang, don't be upset.

674
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,460
I know Yu Meiren so well.

675
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,260
She's smart and capable.

676
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,740
Successful people who know her think highly of her.

677
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,980
Upset?

678
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,220
Why would I be upset?

679
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,810
She spent time and energy on me,

680
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,610
in such an earnest way.

681
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,940
It's a surprise.

682
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,980
But she didn't truly like you.

683
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,940
I truly like her.

684
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,980
All the trouble for a man?

685
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,260
If you'll pardon me for saying so,

686
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,650
you can do it, but you don't have to.

687
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,129
Do you pity me?

688
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,020
Let me ask you.

689
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,020
Do you have something in the world

690
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,569
that you would defend with your life

691
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,460
and would never let anyone else touch it?

692
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,220
I do.

693
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,499
Do you pity me or those who do not?

694
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,979
I pity whoever loses.

695
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,370
I'm impressed that
you can get this photo.

696
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,810
But there are not many people on it.

697
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,330
Who did you get it from?

698
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,850
Are you sure she won't find out?

699
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,220
Even if she finds out,
what could she do?

700
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,300
Not to mention she doesn't necessarily know it.

701
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,130
Good point.

702
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:20,849
You have a scapegoat,
and a ticket to a benefit reception.

703
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,460
A good deal.

704
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,570
Who said I'll take back the ticket?

705
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,090
She can show up if she has the nerve.

706
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,460
By then, the world will see

707
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,220
her true colors under her innocent cover.

708
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,500
Meiren?

709
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,130
Zhuang Yu? Why's he here?

710
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,220
Yes... a minute.

711
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,330
Oh, I see.

712
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,020
Wait.

713
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,849
The barbecue part, I remember it.

714
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,740
But what happened in the KTV?

715
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,500
So I was not singing.

716
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,859
What did I say?

717
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,190
I'm thinking

718
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,619
why does milk have to love bread?

719
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,030
I mean, we're not milk.

720
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,380
How do we know it loves bread?

721
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,230
Why can't it love cereals,

722
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,190
pancakes, deep-fried dough sticks,
or sticky rice?

723
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,059
Why are you laughing?

724
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,549
Stage three.

725
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,340
What? I can't hear you.

726
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,300
Bargaining.

727
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,470
I know.

728
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,510
Stage three.

729
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,950
Bargaining.

730
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,660
To achieve a compromise

731
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,660
by judging oneself and the outside world.

732
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,009
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

733
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,339
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

734
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,930
♫ I'm sure you are ♫

735
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,730
♫ my future ♫

736
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,470
Professor Zhuang.

737
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,860
- Professor Zhuang.
- Tiantian.

738
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,060
That's about it.

739
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,099
Thank you.

740
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,190
You're welcome.

741
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,749
It's all about proximity.

742
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,430
Go!

743
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:04,210
♫ You are shining for me like stars in the sky ♫

744
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:10,009
♫ Your image is engraved in my eyes ♫

745
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:15,089

750
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,090
♫ Dashing around without directions ♫

751
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,890
♫ Look at the starlight on shoulders ♫

752
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,329
♫ Even the clouds turn heart-shaped ♫

753
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,330
♫ Two long shadows at eight o'clock ♫

754
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,570
♫ I want to lean on your shoulder cozily ♫

755
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:47,409
