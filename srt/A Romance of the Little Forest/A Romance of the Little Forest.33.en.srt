[A Romance of the Little Forest]

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,159
[Episode 33]
[Freedom from ignoring anxiety and inspection.]

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,638
Phase 3: bargaining.

25
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:40,160
Compromise is achieved
through self and external judgment.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,719
You're not confused.

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,559
I'm a talented girl.
It's impossible that I'm confused.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,760
Turn off the music.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,278
Guess. If I turn on the phone,

30
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:06,160
how many rejections will I receive?

31
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,519
In fact...

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,080
Me first.

33
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,038
I contacted 14 brands in total.

34
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,278
Nine of them responded positively.

35
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,519
Five of them have no reply.

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,759
So I guess there are at least fifteen rejection messages.

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,638
You can dilute the alcohol concentration

38
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,160
in your body by drinking more water.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,039
I'm not drunk.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,720
The public welfare wine party also rejected me.

41
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,478
I made great efforts to get the ticket.

42
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,678
Many brands will participate,

43
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:59,118
including Shaye, Heshi, Lami and Jiantao.

44
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:01,999
But it's pitiful that the incident happened.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Even Fang has no way to take me there.

46
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,959
Bye-bye, brands!

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,959
Unexpectedly, just a junior high school photo

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,839
destroyed everything.

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,398
But that's not the point.

50
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,638
Most importantly,

51
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,719
they said I'm promoting social appearance anxiety.

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,918
What am I promoting?

53
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,360
Can't we make up? Is it wrong to be beautiful?

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,918
I know it's not right to promote

55
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,039
the importance of appearance.

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,439
But with all due respect,

57
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,359
people who think that appearance is not important

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,198
either have no appearance
problems or are so hopeless

59
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,519
that they deceive themselves.

60
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,879
I'm ugly.

61
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,398
So I have the floor.

62
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,959
You did nothing wrong.

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,839
But ugliness is a sin.

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,359
Because I'm ugly,

65
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,479
it is also a luxury for me to be an ordinary person.

66
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,639
But gradually I found that
everything can even become better

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,039
by mastering a little technology.

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,599
All this makes me believe that
makeup is so useful and fair.

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,518
It makes beauty an acquired ability for everyone,

70
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:39,480
rather than a privilege monopolized by a few people.

71
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,278
I never preach that makeup is to please others.

72
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,040
I just want more people to become confident.

73
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:54,518
Is it wrong that I am not confident
in my face without makeup?

74
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,200
No.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,999
Tell me why you think
makeup makes people beautiful.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,320
I... Others...

77
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,039
Women dress up for their beholders.

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,480
Makeup makes me happy.

79
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,040
Why does makeup make you happy?

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,279
Who defined beauty?

81
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,719
Roman nose, dashing eyebrows,
deep eyes and white skin.

82
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,319
How do they define beauty?

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,078
Why do makeups all want to present them?

84
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,640
Who made the rule?

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
Do you want to know my answer?

86
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,639
Do you remember once you robbed my bike

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,959
outside the meeting place?

88
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,639
You're deaf to all words.

89
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,199
That's a shared bike.

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,920
Since it's a shared bike,
it doesn't belong to you.

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,518
You're bold and straight, I like that.

92
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,160
It made me think you were vivid.

93
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:27,160
Wait, I didn't make up, right?

94
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,278
It doesn't matter. What surprises me is

95
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:38,519
you're not ashamed to rob others.

96
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,039
Because I didn't make up,
I was socially dead.

97
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,959
I couldn't do anything but run away.

98
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,160
So you can also be confident without makeup.

99
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,880
Strange logic.

100
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,040
Once in the park,

101
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,239
you stayed still for hours to shoot birds.

102
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,920
In class, you and your classmates
focused on discussion.

103
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,039
I find that when you are serious,

104
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,200
you become quite different and special.

105
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,640
And the time when you're active.

106
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,879
You are my prey.

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,838
You're very cute,
whether you imitate the secretary bird

108
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,920
or the witch who insists on realizing my wishes.

109
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,039
I figured it out.

110
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,839
Things don't seem to be going well.

111
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,199
When you're brave.

112
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,958
Who is going to pick up the goods with me?

113
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,880
I am responsible for our affairs. I'll go.

114
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,238
When you are down, you will be refreshed again.

115
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,199
Very optimistic.

116
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,159
Why do you think I'm optimistic?

117
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,039
Firm and indomitable,
follow up a victory with hot pursuit!

118
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,880
When you get into a huff.

119
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,279
Mei, I want to tell you.

120
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,239
Now you want to tell me?

121
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,639
Unfortunately,
if you don't say something when you should,

122
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,319
it will never be necessary to say it.

123
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,399
When you're confused.

124
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,359
Your morning call service is very special.

125
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:04,279
When you're naive and warm.

126
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,459
In my eyes,
you look beautiful in every way.

127
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,109
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

128
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,478
♫ I'm sure you are ♫

129
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,840
I see.

130
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,280
You have a crush on me.

131
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,039
Otherwise, how could you remember it so clearly?

132
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,280
I have a crush on you.

133
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,519
In fact, whether you wear makeup or not,

134
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,239
you are the most beautiful in my heart.

135
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,558
Secularity may have an established definition of beauty.

136
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,798
Secularity includes both male and female aesthetics.

137
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,598
We can temporarily submit to the secular world.

138
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,279
But we must not forget

139
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,760
that everyone has his or her own definition of beauty.

140
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,759
According to you,
women in the new era don't need makeup.

141
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,199
Of course, you can make up.

142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,358
But you have to be able to control it.

143
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,319
Makeup can really make people beautiful.

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,200
But you look beautiful without makeup.

145
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,478
But they don't think so.

146
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,399
They think I'm hypocritical.

147
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,479
They want to cancel the cooperation.

148
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,759
Phase 4.

149
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,119
Sadness.

150
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,279
After denial, anger and negotiation,

151
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,798
the status quo is still unchanged.

152
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,640
It is an unavoidable escape
to immerse oneself in sadness.

153
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,799
Your time-consuming paintings.

154
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,879
My sanctuary.

155
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,400
Birds in the sanctuary.

156
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,919
Wash your face.

157
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,280
Slow down.

158
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,919
Don't move. Don't slide.

159
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,640
Don't move.

160
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,798
Mei.

161
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,359
Your...

162
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,799
Let me.

163
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,279
Why are you crying again?

164
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,880
So ugly!

165
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,279
Terrible. Too tactless.

166
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,358
Terrible.

167
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,319
It's really terrible.

168
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,478
I forgot to remove my makeup.

169
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,519
My god. What brand of loose powder is this?

170
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,880
It can't settle in my makeup at all.

171
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,238
Mei, are you OK?

172
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:41,359
I'm fine.

173
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,519
I can explain.

174
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,080
What happened last night was an accident.

175
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,678
Dad, mom. Why are you here?

176
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,639
What happened?

177
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,959
It has nothing to do with me.

178
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,238
You're our daughter.

179
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,839
Do we need a reason to visit you?

180
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,358
Yes, do we need a reason?

181
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,919
No.

182
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,279
Don't misunderstand.

183
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,400
Zhuang Yu and I don't live together.

184
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,200
Why do you keep a distance? Go back.

185
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,319
Zhuang has told us.

186
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,799
I've known that.

187
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,839
That's good.

188
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,238
If you told me in advance before you came,

189
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,959
I could have made preparations.

190
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,319
It's a bit late.

191
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,199
We wanted to tell you in advance,
but we couldn't get through to you.

192
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,519
Is your phone on?

193
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,718
How to contact you?

194
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:44,519
I...

195
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,918
Let me tell him something inside.

196
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,000
Go.

197
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,839
Why not tell me when my parents came?

198
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,558
You were drunk yesterday.

199
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,359
I want you to have a good sleep.

200
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,520
Since your mom comes, turn on the phone.

201
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,199
Sorry, Meiren.

202
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,999
Recently, we suspended the promotion activities.

203
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,079
So the promise...

204
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,918
So we won't consider cooperation for the time being.

205
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,798
Meiren, are you OK?

206
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:20,158
I just saw the hot topic online. Are you OK?

207
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,479
Meiren, I'm very sorry.

208
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,119
Are you still sad?

209
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,479
Shall I tell you the truth?

210
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,158
A bit sad.

211
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,879
But I'm feeling better than yesterday.

212
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,399
Maybe I have accepted the reality.

213
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,679
Acceptance is the final stage of the Kubler-Ross model.

214
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,558
When will the wine party you mentioned be held?

215
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,399
Tomorrow. But I won't participate.

216
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,999
Why?

217
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,038
I don't want to.

218
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,519
There are other ways to raise money.

219
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,238
If I participate, I will bring shame on myself.

220
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,719
I will also throw dirty water
into the conservation area.

221
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,358
I'd better delete that post.

222
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,960
Why not explain?

223
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,718
Nobody cares.

224
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,479
Some people just like to see others in trouble.

225
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,759
Deleting means you admit.

226
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,280
It will throw more dirty water
into the conservation area.

227
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:18,280
This is not acceptance but escape.

228
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,479
It makes no difference to me.

229
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,038
Any news?

230
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,918
She hasn't replied. She turned off the phone.

231
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,118
Maybe she is down in the dumps.

232
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,719
Since you know her,

233
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,599
will she?

234
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,639
I hope so.

235
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,159
Or it will be boring.

236
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,558
Remember to send the dress to her by flash delivery.

237
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,880
Remind her that it's not time for a break.

238
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,360
[Sent]

239
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,719
What food?

240
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,118
It's all vegetarian.

241
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,078
It's good to eat vegetables.

242
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,000
Vegetables make you happy.

243
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Nice dishes!

244
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,999
Why is it so sweet?

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,159
These are frosted green vegetables.

246
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,438
When the temperature is below zero,

247
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:39,118
the water in plant cells will form ice crystals,

248
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,679
which will affect the cell function

249
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
and even destroy the cell structure.

250
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,238
In order to resist water freezing,

251
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,519
plants will produce a lot of

252
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,598
soluble sugars and amino acids
to lower the freezing point.

253
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,359
So frosted vegetables are especially sweet.

254
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,560
Make it clear.

255
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,119
The harsh external conditions will make you stronger,

256
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,920
as will radish and cabbage.

257
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,159
Even though they're strong, they're reduced to dishes.

258
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,639
And it depends on seasons to tell stories.

259
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,879
It's summer now.

260
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,118
Where can you get frosted vegetables?

261
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,640
Tomato, tomato.

262
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,439
Do you dare tell your parents the lie you told?

263
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,679
Hello.

264
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,519
I have a call.

265
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,680
Open the door.

266
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,919
Daddy, it's bad for the eyes to play with mobile phones
for a long time.

267
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,639
I'm coming!

268
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,400
Hello.

269
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,159
This is Ms. Yu's dress for tomorrow's reception.

270
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,719
Let her receive it in person.

271
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,479
In person? Reception?

272
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,358
It's... a reception at school.

273
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,519
Professor Zhuang, is that true?

274
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,838
Yu Meiren!

275
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,198
You're in big trouble on Weibo.

276
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,640
You can't shrink...

277
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,318
Why are you staring at me? I'm innocent.

278
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,399
If you had not come at this
time and shouted so loudly,

279
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,799
the situation would not be so awkward.

280
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,958
But I'm worried about your bestie.

281
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:48,119
And the dress is the last straw to crush the camel.

282
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,559
Three minutes.

283
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,119
Who's speaking?

284
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,520
Don't interrupt Professor Zhuang.

285
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,000
Nobody spoke in three minutes.

286
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,760
Professor Zhuang calculates the time accurately.

287
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:16,879
The longer the silence, the more embarrassed.

288
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,400
Just say something casually.

289
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,919
Me first.

290
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,520
Shut up. Mei.

291
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,959
Are you going to say anything?

292
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,199
I...

293
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,919
I...

294
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,719
I'll wear that dress
at the school public good wine party.

295
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,199
What? Yu Meiren.

296
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,159
It's too late.

297
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,598
Your struggle is in vain.

298
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,000
Have you forgotten that
your mother is Sherlock Feng?

299
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,958
None of you are outsiders.

300
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,999
So I'll come straight to the point.

301
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,799
Mei, I know you've grown up.

302
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,958
You know a lot.

303
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,559
Maybe you think your father and I are old-fashioned.

304
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,958
But you should not...

305
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:09,198
Mom, I'm wrong. I shouldn't...

306
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:12,479
You shouldn't conceal such a big accident.

307
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,198
I know you suffered a
lot when you were young

308
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,160
because of your appearance.

309
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,439
Give me!

310
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,599
Give me the umbrella!

311
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,279
But your father and I are very happy.

312
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,799
Because these setbacks have not knocked you down.

313
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,478
You found confidence elsewhere.

314
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:52,959
After Mei goes to school in town,

315
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,759
we will not see her for several months.

316
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,919
Come on.

317
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,639
Keep an open mind.

318
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,078
Choice is greater than effort.

319
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,039
It's great that she was admitted to a school in town.

320
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,439
Yes.

321
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,799
The cost of living in town is high.

322
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,478
We've saved enough money to open a homestay.

323
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,598
But since it costs a lot,
we must work harder to make money.

324
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,718
That's nothing.

325
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:16,999
In less than two years,
we can open a homestay.

326
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,800
Yes.

327
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:18,838
We can make it.

328
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,598
Happy graduation!

329
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,838
Later, you studied hard.

330
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,039
We were never worried about your study.

331
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,199
But you have less and less time at home.

332
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,760
Be quiet.

333
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,959
Mei.

334
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,958
Since you are about to graduate,
will you go home?

335
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,078
Our homestay has just been decorated.

336
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,760
You can live here.

337
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,880
You won't go home?

338
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,679
Really?

339
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,799
Great!

340
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,199
Mei becomes a teacher at school!

341
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,838
Really? That's great!

342
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,838
Let me say something.

343
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,318
Mei.

344
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,318
We can call you Madam Yu.

345
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,399
My sister is great!

346
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,799
But when we heard your good news,

347
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
your father and I were very happy.

348
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,159
Auntie. Uncle.

349
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,438
It's my fault.

350
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:25,519
I insisted that she started a business with me.

351
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,399
It has nothing to do with you.

352
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,718
Afraid that you may get angry,
I dare not tell you.

353
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:35,078
Though I'm well-educated,
I just don't know how to tell you.

354
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,679
Yes, we're angry.

355
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:41,039
We are angry that
you are unwilling to tell us anything.

356
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,760
Yes. Mei.

357
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,238
Having known that you became a blogger,

358
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:48,078
your mother and I were very happy.

359
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,880
You've already known it?

360
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:57,039
We knew that when you and Zhuang

361
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,000
came to Qingshui Village for the first time.

362
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,078
Mom, you're solving a case. You doubt me.

363
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,598
What case am I solving?

364
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,559
I figured it out yesterday.

365
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,358
These are rumors heard by Wang Xiumei's in-laws.

366
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,159
They are just jealous of you.

367
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,718
I blocked them all.

368
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,039
I also told Guilan

369
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,520
not to tell me about these things anymore.

370
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,958
Come on.

371
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:31,119
What are you thinking about?

372
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,520
Mermaid With Long Legs.

373
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,599
What do you mean?

374
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,078
We already have the Internet.

375
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,000
Search on Weibo.

376
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,680
Mermaid With Long Legs?

377
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,159
You did a good job!

378
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,040
You deserve to be Sherlock Feng.

379
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,318
It's easy to register a Weibo account.

380
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,438
It only took three hours to make it.

381
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:01,958
Yes. Quite easy.

382
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,598
Your mother asked a dozen people in the village.

383
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,279
She almost asked Uncle Li's grandson,

384
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,199
the gatekeeper at the village entrance.

385
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,639
Your father sometimes has tight skin.

386
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,880
Thank you for helping me relax.

387
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,958
We just want you to be happy.

388
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,679
We watched you work so hard.

389
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,718
You lied to us that you worked at school

390
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,679
and found a boyfriend.

391
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,040
You want us to rest assured.

392
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,078
In fact, we are also reflecting on

393
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:34,598
whether we are putting too
much pressure on you Aunt.

394
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,239
I'm really her boyfriend.

395
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,560
I already know it.

396
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,159
I know you're nice to her

397
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,759
and have given up the chance to work abroad.

398
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,879
I keep it in mind.

399
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,359
Mom, why do you even know this?

400
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,759
Don't look around.

401
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,879
I need no witness.

402
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,280
I'm Sherlock Feng.

403
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,920
Because you liked a post of G.

404
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,559
Green seeker. When I saw his posts,

405
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,879
they were all about plants.

406
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,759
So he must be Zhuang.

407
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,718
Zhuang.

408
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,438
I checked carefully.

409
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:23,598
But I have a suggestion.

410
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,438
The name is a bit...

411
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:28,199
Green means bad luck.

412
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,679
Mom.

413
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,159
Why did you spy on my likes on Weibo?

414
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,759
I didn't spy on them.

415
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
I followed your account.

416
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,318
Your mother used an English name.

417
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,478
It's...

418
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,799
Let her see.

419
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,160
Look.

420
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,438
Have you seen it?

421
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,680
How about it?

422
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,598
Tracy in NY.

423
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,999
Very fashionable.

424
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,640
Fashionable.

425
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:53,160
You seem to be the heroine on TV.

426
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,718
When did you go to New York?

427
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,118
New York?

428
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,520
NY. N-ong, Y-uan.

429
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,238
I'm on the farm every day.

430
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,319
It must be me.

431
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:09,039
When I registered,
Er Ya at Wang Xiumei's home

432
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,919
told me I can know big news on hot topics.

433
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,879
Mei.

434
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,279
You had three hot topics yesterday.

435
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,879
I knew you got in big trouble.

436
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,958
So I hurried here.

437
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,519
Since you're in big trouble,

438
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,799
I should stay with you
to tide you over the difficulties.

439
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,159
Many people on Weibo are immoral.

440
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,639
They don't know you at all.

441
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,159
Why do they scold you?

442
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,400
I explained to them, but they didn't care.

443
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,999
Mom.

444
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,318
There is everything online.

445
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,079
Don't worry.

446
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,838
I won't take it to heart.

447
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,640
Don't think too much.

448
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,040
Mei.

449
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,519
I just want you to know

450
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,839
that no matter whether you are a teacher
or a beauty blogger,

451
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,760
your father and I

452
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,520
will stay by your side and support you.

453
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,640
We're proud of you.

454
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,599
Silly girl.

455
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,400
Are you feeling better?

456
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,838
I didn't expect my parents did that.

457
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,799
But it's good to be protected
by my parents in my adulthood.

458
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,958
Hot topics, bad comments
and the wine party don't matter.

459
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,040
So you won't participate?

460
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,319
Of course. Go if you want.

461
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,880
If I go, will you come?

462
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:04,399
All brands have rejected me.

463
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,439
If I attend it, it will only be a shame.

464
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,399
What are you thinking about?

465
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,520
I wonder why it hasn't blossomed yet.

466
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:26,118
Is this camellia?

467
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:28,838
The flowering period is still several months away.

468
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:32,359
Since you study plants,
why don't you know that?

469
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,078
Interesting.

470
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,358
Although the camellia has not yet blossomed,

471
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,159
its posture is also beautiful.

472
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,198
Of course.

473
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,919
Good flowers do not fear late blooms.

474
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,079
Why do you...

475
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:19,000
Meiren.

476
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,198
You scared me.

477
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,438
You also scared me.

478
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,159
You didn't answer my call or reply to my Wechat.

479
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,879
If Tiantian didn't tell me you were fine,

480
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,279
I would have called the police.

481
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,438
No.

482
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:29,958
The police are quite busy.

483
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,399
Don't make a mess.

484
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,318
It's good that you're fine.

485
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,719
Shall we go out to relax?

486
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:40,078
You have been sleeping
in the laboratory for many days.

487
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,199
You'd better have a good rest.

488
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,559
I've already figured it out.

489
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,559
Now that it has happened,
it is meaningless to be upset.

490
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,919
I should accept it.

491
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,799
Meiren, I want you to know that

492
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,280
I will support you no matter what others say.

493
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,040
Thank you.

494
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,958
Ready.

495
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:23,559
You are always in my heart.

496
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,639
Wise, kind and beautiful.

497
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,118
Let the gossip go.

498
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,439
We will always support you.

499
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,679
Miss Yu.

500
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,520
We knew you before gossip.

501
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,478
Miss Yu.

502
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:46,199
We will always support you.

503
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,279
Since you were born after the year 2000,

504
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,519
why not choose a new song to fill in the lyrics?

505
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,599
Miss Yu, could you sing a new song?

506
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,478
Class begins. Sit down.

507
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,560
Let me see who is making trouble.

508
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,839
Sing a song.

509
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,560
The boy in the back, sit down.

510
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,199
Class is over.

511
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,958
Miss Yu.

512
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:16,759
Come on!

513
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,159
See you. Come on.

514
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,598
See you.

515
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,438
See you.

516
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,159
Take it to the dorm.

517
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,318
I'll be back soon.

518
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,079
Come on.

519
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:30,319
Miss Yu, come on.

520
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,999
Thank you.

521
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,719
I didn't expect...

522
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,958
I'm really moved.

523
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:44,438
We didn't expect that
you're a great person.

524
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:47,679
Your real name is too rare,

525
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,000
or we wouldn't know an Internet celebrity
was just around us.

526
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,958
It's...

527
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,838
This is what you gave me last time.

528
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,358
If it is true, it should be expensive.

529
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,560
I think I'd better return it to you.

530
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,079
Even a screenwriter can't make up this coincidence.

531
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,479
Let me see what he is doing.

532
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,000
Well, where is he?

533
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,239
This is...

534
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:16,679
This power seems negative,

535
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,840
but it actually guides you to complete your destiny.

536
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,000
It refines your spirit and strengthens your will.

537
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,320
Because it's the greatest truth on the planet.

538
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,599
Corn poppy, papaveraceae.

539
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,438
The flowers are big.

540
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,759
Never retain their beauty.

541
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,599
But it has the miraculous effects of
relieving cough, stopping diarrhea,

542
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,158
analgesia and sedation.

543
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,999
It's my favorite flower.

544
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,198
Is this the official declaration?

545
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,319
No way!

546
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,759
G is otherworldly.

547
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,599
It's just a popularization.

548
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,718
But it's unnecessary to repost her Weibo.

549
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,079
His account is probably stolen.

550
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,679
I don't think so.

551
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,238
I think he signed a marketing company.

552
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,799
He wants to prove her innocence.

553
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,678
My god!

554
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,878
I didn't expect that even G yields to her.

555
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:17,999
I'll unfollow him.

556
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,198
Guys, calm down.

557
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,678
It hasn't been confirmed.

558
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,999
Don't make internal strife.

559
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,600
Let's protect G.

560
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,760
Thank you.

561
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,239
You are too impulsive.

562
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,158
Kubler-Ross model is actually controversial.

563
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,438
The theory is not based on data,

564
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:08,319
but simply based on
the description of the interviewees.

565
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,839
In addition,
this theory was originally used to explain

566
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,279
the psychological state of dying patients,

567
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,559
which is not suitable
for the cognition of attack in daily life.

568
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,478
But he likes to use this unreliable theory.

569
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:22,320
This professor is too lax in his scholarship.

570
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:29,359
So in the last stage,

571
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,199
you can choose to change instead of accepting.

572
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,478
I've been following you for a long time.

573
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:58,718
I often browse your Weibo.

574
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,840
Thank you.

575
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,439
Hello, Xia Zhi.

576
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,279
Hello, Xia Zhi.

577
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,919
Your dress is really beautiful.

578
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,119
Have you read today's list?

579
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,958
What's the matter?

580
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:13,999
Yu Meiren is also in it.

581
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,759
Really?

582
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,958
How dare she come considering the big trouble?

583
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,599
Have you seen it?

584
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,039
G reposted Yu Meiren's Weibo.

585
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,559
He seems to show his love to her.

586
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,918
How can he show love
when he sees Yu Meiren's ugly face?

587
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:31,478
Maybe she wants to prove her innocence with G.

588
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:33,799
Anyway, G has no stain at all.

589
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,319
From now on,
Yu Meiren is his biggest stain.

590
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,678
Does Yu Meiren have any advantages?

591
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,438
Why does G fall in love with her?

592
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:44,799
She must have special abilities.

593
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,639
I really want to know it.

594
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,839
Xia Zhi.

595
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,439
An outdated blogger is not worth discussing.

596
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,198
Distinguished guests.

597
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,398
Dear friends.

598
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,760
Hello.

599
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,958
Welcome to today's public welfare banquet.

600
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,599
No new notification yet.

601
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,599
I think she won't come.

602
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,678
We gather the power of kindness here.

603
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,280
She's still a coward after so many years.

604
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,040
It's a waste of that dress.

605
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,238
We don't mention the process.

606
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:32,958
Anyone who wants to
introduce the charity sale shall

607
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:35,119
come to the stage first.

608
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,999
Who wants to be the first? Hands up.

609
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,199
Me first.

610
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,080
OK.

611
00:38:58,081 --> 00:38:59,958
Let's welcome her to the stage.

612
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,600
Welcome to show your charity sale.

613
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,718
Hello, everyone.

614
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,799
Thank you very much for giving me

615
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,878
such an opportunity to meet you frankly.

616
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:16,478
I must introduce myself first.

617
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,678
Otherwise, no one here may recognize me.

618
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,478
I'm Yu Meiren.

619
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:25,639
You can also call me Mermaid With Long Legs.

620
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,599
Luckily, I didn't name myself Mermaid With Big Eyes.

621
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,719
Or I'll be sorry when introducing myself.

622
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,119
First of all, I'd like to make a very serious clarification.

623
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,238
I really don't have plastic surgery.

624
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,438
If I look like this after cosmetic surgery,

625
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:49,039
I may have to go to the
hospital to claim compensation.

626
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,398
Not at all.

627
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,478
You're beautiful.

628
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:56,320
Some people say that
I am creating appearance anxiety.

629
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,320
To be honest,
I am the victim of appearance anxiety.

630
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,839
But when I found that
mastering makeup skills

631
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,439
can eliminate all these anxieties,

632
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,079
I chose to share it,

633
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,039
hoping that those who have the same problems as me

634
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,519
can be more confident.

635
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,600
That's what I thought at the time.

636
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,839
But I was wrong.

637
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,158
But the mistake is not the makeup.

638
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,878
The mistake is that I mistook the makeup

639
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:29,198
as a weapon against anxiety.

640
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,238
In fact, the real weapon should be

641
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:34,679
freedom from anxiety and examination.

642
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,958
I'm very happy.

643
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:39,439
Because I have it now.

644
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,198
It is known that
I've had some hot topics for free recently.

645
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,319
No matter who spent the money for me,

646
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,600
I need to thank her first.

647
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,198
It is because of this kind of person

648
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,638
that I suddenly attracted so much attention

649
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,319
after fading out of the blogger circle.

650
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,238
It gives me the opportunity to stand here

651
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,039
and let you have curiosity and patience

652
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,419
to listen to my next talk about the charity sale
of the conservation area.

653
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,669

00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,198
I can't sing.

660
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:36,879
Just sing.

661
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,439

Go.

[Funny expression]

666
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,199
Applause, cheer and whistle.

667
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:06,718
Applause.

668
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,110

Why are you back so soon?

674
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,320
