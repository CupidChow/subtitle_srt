[Episode 09]
[Iceberg? I'm a icebreaker.]

24
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,000
Is it too red?

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,360
This is more natural.

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,600
Your morning call service is very special.

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,199
You're awake.

28
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,478
I just think this cave is a little too dry.

29
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,440
So I want to rehydrate you.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,758
Have a cup of coffee.

31
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,320
- Coffee?
- Let's go back.

32
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,199
Professor Zhuang,
you can not only teach, but also cook.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,880
If you don't leave,

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,119
you'll have to go to the toilet.

35
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,039
I haven't finished drinking yet.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,119
These…

37
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,079
Let me do the heavy work.

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't bother you.

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,000
Let me do it.

40
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,479
Leave me alone. I'm okay.

41
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,639
I'm strong.

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,959
How did he suddenly treat me so well?

43
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,079
Lending me a sleeping bag and making coffee,

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,880
it's not what he can do.

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,880
What's wrong? Are you sick?

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,440
No, I'm fine.

47
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,240
Wait a minute.

48
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,799
What's up, Professor Zhuang?

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,319
Can't you walk anymore?

50
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,520
I can't carry you.

00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,000
Brain Eater.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,519
Are big tits your relatives too?

54
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,240
Of course.

55
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:07,559
I told you that I'm familiar with this mountain.

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,350
It seems that this relative is not familiar with you.

57
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,358
After all, I haven't come back for a long time.

58
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:28,160
I just need to get familiar with it.

59
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,398
The injury should be caused by heavy rain.

60
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,239
If we leave it alone,
it will die.

61
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,920
Because you are my relative,
let me save you.

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,678
Wild animals cannot be taken
care of by ordinary people.

63
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,640
Even it's your relative,

64
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,750
it's better to leave it to the professionals.

65
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,358
You doubt my professionalism.

66
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,519
Tell you, I'm good at

67
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:55,118
calling wildlife protection agencies.

68
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,040
Do I need to applaud?

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,040
No need.

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,479
Then let's take it home first,

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,400
and wait for someone from the wildlife
protection agency to pick it up.

72
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,640
Take a breath.

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
The little thing looks
weak and pitiful now,

74
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,159
but it is not the same face

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,480
when it opens the skull and eats brain.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,838
It is not unusual that natural creatures use

77
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,320
their appearance to confuse and disguise.

78
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,719
It seems that you also has the confidence

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,519
to see the essence through the disguise.

80
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,360
I'm flattered.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,160
I could only barely see through
the camouflage that failed.

82
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,200
I disguise more than makeup.

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,199
Look,
Wang Xiumei posted on her moments again.

84
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,880
Family reunion, beautiful life.

85
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,959
Just took a family photo,
she posted it for a month.

86
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:04,159
It's her freedom to post on her wechat moments.

87
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,479
If you don't want to see, you can block her.

88
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,079
Block her?

89
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,640
I don't want to take her too seriously.

90
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,678
Why can't I take a family photo?

91
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,040
Yes.

92
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,720
I decided to take a family photo.

93
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,999
It's not that our family can't get together,

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,200
and it's not that we are ugly,
who can't be shown to others.

95
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,319
Meiren, Meinan and Zhuang.

96
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,238
And me.

97
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:22,920
You.

98
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:23,759
Yes.

99
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,879
If we take a family photo,
it will blow up moments.

100
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,719
That's sure.

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,838
Let's take it.

102
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,959
- Yes.
- Meinan.

103
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,320
Meinan, take…

104
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,839
You're back.

105
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,919
What's on your face?

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,640
Aunt Yu, please give me a glass of water.

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,078
Let me do it.

108
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,238
Miss Meiren, you're back.

109
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,238
Are you okay?

110
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,079
I'm fine.

111
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,439
What happened to you?

112
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,839
I went up the mountain to investigate.

113
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,480
The view of Qingshui Mountain is good,

114
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,559
I think it may be quite scenic at night.

115
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,118
Set up a tent and enjoy the beautiful view,

116
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:04,920
wouldn't it be great?

117
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,599
Come on, drink some water first.

118
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,320
Drink some water.

119
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,359
When did you go up the mountain yesterday?

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,479
Night. What's wrong?

121
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,238
There was a storm last night.

122
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,239
Why not pick a good time for your expedition?

123
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Rainy day has its own beauty.

124
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,119
Take it.

125
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,839
Is this a sisal scratch?

126
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,199
Last night on the mountain, there was no stars

127
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,518
not even the moon.

128
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,159
Is this the essence of the sun and moon
you absorbed?

129
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
Wait.

130
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,079
Here.

131
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,279
Wipe it by yourself.

132
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm glad you're fine.

133
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,838
I was afraid you meet wild boars like me.

134
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,719
Wild boars?

135
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,159
Yes, its eyes were glowing red.

136
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,599
Are there wild boars on the mountain?

137
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,799
Did you also go to the mountain last night?

138
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,799
I…

139
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,399
Mom and Dad, I'll talk to you later.

140
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,798
The boar's eyes are brown in the night.

141
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,239
The red thing is the bird repellent.

142
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,319
Yes, to prevent the grapes from being pecked,

143
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,870
the farmers have installed some bird repellents.

144
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:38,149
Zhuang, you've had a hard night,

145
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,640
how about taking a break in the afternoon?

146
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,989
Zhuang,
you were hungry last night

147
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,119
and didn't eat anything, right?

148
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,759
Eat something.

149
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,000
No, thanks auntie.

150
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,358
I was a little tired last night.

151
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,320
So I want to go back and rest.

152
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,840
Is he so tired?

153
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,159
Tired.

154
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,159
Please Miss Yu take
care of it for a while.

155
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,678
I'll take care of it for a few days.

156
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,759
You can pick it up when the weather stabilizes.

157
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,918
Take good care of it.

158
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,879
See you later.

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Don't worry.

160
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,079
Please come in.

161
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,919
Zhuang,

162
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,238
this is hot noodle soup I just made.

163
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:33,840
Here you are.

164
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,440
Drink it.

165
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,039
Thank you, auntie.

166
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,079
I think you have a cold.

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Take care of yourself out there by yourself.

168
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
What happened to your arm?

169
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,639
It's inflamed.

170
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,759
So bad.

171
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,079
Aunt, it's just a little wound.

172
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,279
It doesn't matter.

173
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,319
What can I do?

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,798
It's okay. I have band-aids.

175
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,718
Band-aids don't work.

176
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:01,639
Your wound should be
put on some medicine.

177
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,158
And I have to get
you some gauze.

178
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,199
It is unavoidable to have

179
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,959
some minor injuries during field trips.

180
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,840
I can handle it myself.

181
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,798
Zhuang, you're too young to understand.

182
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,158
There are many poisonous plants in our mountain,

183
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,639
which you don't know.

184
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,799
They might kill you.

185
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,039
Auntie, don't worry,

186
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,839
I still know some of the plants.

187
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,358
Before I thought you guys
were doing research in the lab.

188
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,959
I didn't expect that you
have to come to the field.

189
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,359
It's really a hard job.

190
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,400
I'll get it for you now.

191
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,280
Auntie.

192
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
What's up?

193
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,080
Thank you.

194
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,678
You're welcome.

195
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,199
Sit there and wait for me.

196
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,159
I'll be back.

197
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,039
Gauze.

198
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,238
[The bird on the screen is made by CG]

199
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,719
You're lucky to be found by
me first instead of the wildcat.

200
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,158
What happened?

201
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,319
Is it possible that he is conquered

202
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,238
by my personality so quickly like you?

203
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,280
I'm so amazing.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,358
I know.

205
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,358
I'm going to heal your wounds.

206
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,200
Cotton pads, bandages,

207
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,919
sterilization tools and chlorhexidine acetate.

208
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,199
Mom.

209
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,598
Is there any chlorhexidine acetate?

210
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,439
There is no acid, but vinegar.

211
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,199
No. It's the one for sterilization.

212
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,479
I've got it all for you.

213
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,478
You finally know to take care of people.

214
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,839
From now on, you'll be the one to do it.

215
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,359
Not this one. It will burn it.

216
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,639
Will it?

217
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,158
We use it normally.

218
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,960
- I just…
- It's not the same as a person.

219
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,000
I have to go to the infirmary.

220
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,479
Where's Meinan?

221
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,440
Early in the morning,

222
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:33,039
he drove with Tiantain to deliver grapes.

223
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,440
What about my dad?

224
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,839
What else can he do?

225
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,599
He is playing chess with Zhang.

226
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,400
Hurry to take the medicine to him.

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,399
Miss Meiren, where are you going?

228
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,478
Let me give you a ride.

229
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,598
Nice boy.

230
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,239
You're energetic even though you're injured.

231
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,439
It doesn't matter.

232
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,079
Then what can I do for you?

233
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,719
I just need to go to the medical station.

234
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,999
Could you give me a ride?

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,839
Are you hurt? Is it serious?

236
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,038
Not me.

237
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,200
So is it Professor Zhuang?

238
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,798
Fine, for humanitarian reasons,
I can also do him a favor.

239
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,798
Not him either.

240
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,520
Thanks.

241
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
It's not for me,

242
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,479
but for the bird.

243
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,798
I was just about to find you.

244
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,639
Can you boil an egg?

245
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,679
Then feed the yolk to the bird.

246
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,719
I'll go with you.

247
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,598
Is his temper out of control?

248
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:48,559
Why is he so unpredictable?

249
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,519
No.

250
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,159
I'm going to ask my military advisor.

251
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,690
Professor Zhuang,

252
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,080
are you unhappy with Meiren recently?

253
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,959
Unexpectedly,
there are questions that you cannot answer.

254
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,720
Instead of caring about other people's business,

255
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,239
you should care more about yourself.

256
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,119
Professor Zhuang's road should only be academic

257
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,280
without love, right?

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I didn't have any students

259
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,679
like you on my way.

260
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,280
Suddenly passionate,
and suddenly indifferent.

261
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,679
What is the situation? Tell me specifically.

262
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,839
When we were on the mountain,

263
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,439
he gave me the sleeping bag and made me coffee.

264
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,239
But when we came back,
his cold face was back too.

265
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:51,959
Is there really some magic in this mountain?

266
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,399
Or am I more beautiful on the mountain?

267
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,519
Stop.

268
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,119
Nothing can be seen on the dark mountain.

269
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,798
Think about it.

270
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,238
Is there any incentive event?

271
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,519
Incentive event?

272
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,280
Yes.

273
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,640
The event that makes the behavior turn around.

274
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,559
Yes.

275
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,439
It seems to be the time
when we rescued the bird.

276
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,038
I couldn't help but show off
some knowledge about birds.

277
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,080
Then he turned to be angry with me.

278
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,399
Was you angry with him first?

279
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,280
No.

280
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,400
Maybe.

281
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,759
That's right.

282
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,079
I tell you that everyone
likes to hear compliments,

283
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,840
even someone as good as Professor Zhuang.

284
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:39,678
You should often ask
him for more advice.

285
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,279
Express your admiration for him more.

286
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,639
It will be over.

287
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,798
So simple?

288
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,118
Of course not.

289
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,959
According to my analysis,

290
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,798
Professor Zhuang's warm-hearted behavior to you

291
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,718
has actually shown that
you have a place in his heart.

292
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:59,759
But he should not have any experience in love,

293
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,158
he is a little resistant to this feeling.

294
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,640
So once he gets negative information,
he will back off.

295
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,399
You have to do more.

296
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,478
To do more?

297
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,558
How to do it?

298
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,400
It's easy. You…

299
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,879
That's a little bit too much.

300
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,118
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

301
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:25,238
It's the point to test
whether he loves you or not.

302
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,399
Who?

303
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,558
Who loves who?

304
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,919
Look ahead. Look at the road.

305
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,639
Okay, I'll stop talking to you.

306
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,678
I'm off to do something big.

307
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,319
Keep me updated on your battle reports.

308
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,679
Bye bye.

309
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,078
This wine is great, right?

310
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,078
Yes.

311
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,160
Let me drink it.

312
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,239
Mr. Jin, are you waiting for someone?

313
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,680
Not a person,

314
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,280
but a fairy.

315
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,959
Are you busy?

316
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,718
Yes.

317
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:51,160
Now is the time to tackle the tough task,
so I can't relax.

318
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,318
My daughter is still so competitive.

319
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,040
Open your mouth.

320
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,959
Work is work,
but you also should relax.

321
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,799
When Meinan comes back,
Let's go to the town photo studio

322
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,959
to take a family photo together with Zhuang,
okay?

323
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,999
I have a camera, I can shoot for you at home.

324
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,838
No need to go so far.

325
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,438
Can you compare with the photo studio?

326
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:18,478
They have makeup
and styling services.

327
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:20,478
It's just makeup, what's so hard about it?

328
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,880
I can do it for you too.

329
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,238
Your technology is not good.

330
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,719
My make-up skills are not good?

331
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,279
I mean that you're not as skilled as

332
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,039
a professional makeup artist, right?

333
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,399
Look at this.

334
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,159
Look at your Aunt Wang's photos.

335
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
So beautiful.

336
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,560
Zhuang Yu will not pose like this.

337
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,679
Wait.

338
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,199
This is a perfect chance
to get closer to him.

339
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,919
What's wrong with this pose?

340
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,478
I think it's fine, right?

341
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,000
So natural and beautiful.

342
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,238
Mom, I think you're truly right.

343
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,520
We must go to the town to be photographed.

344
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,400
That's settled.

345
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,159
Hello, these are all the grapes.

346
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,198
Check it out.

347
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,838
We delivered them all by ourselves.

348
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,198
There's nothing wrong with them.

349
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,839
And all the grapes must be sweet.

350
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,759
If there's nothing else, we'll leave now.

351
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,919
Wish you a prosperous business.

352
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,399
Miss Li, wait a minute.

353
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,159
Our boss would like to get acquainted with you

354
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,560
for our future cooperation.

355
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Me?

356
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,399
I don't think so.

357
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,799
The grape production in Qingshui Village

358
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,919
has plummeted this year.

359
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,198
These are all we borrowed from our folks.

360
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:36,718
So it's really not that we don't want to,

361
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,838
but with our limited ability,

362
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,478
it's really hard to cooperate with you this year.

363
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,799
Get to know each other,

364
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,639
there might be more chances for cooperation.

365
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,680
It seems that I can only
repay the fairy by myself.

366
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,609
The quality of the grapes in Qingshui Village

367
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,639
is really good.

368
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,439
Unfortunately,

369
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,319
some of them may have been crushed in transit.

370
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,040
It's okay, I'll pay for your loss.

371
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,438
But I'm afraid I can't do it today.

372
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,478
Thank you for your kindness.

373
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,879
President Jin.

374
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,279
This is our boss.

375
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,838
This is Miss Li.

376
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,039
Hello, boss.

377
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,999
- Thank you, boss.
- You can leave.

378
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,560
Then we'll leave.

379
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,520
You two can't leave.

380
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,439
Do you have any more orders, boss?

381
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,119
Check this, Miss Li.

382
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
What happened?

383
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,039
I'm really sorry.

384
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,838
Don't worry,
we will compensate you for the bad grapes.

385
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,039
I've just checked.

386
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,839
All the grapes were a little bit defective.

387
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,238
I'm really sorry.

388
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:49,039
I didn't expect such a mistake.

389
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,238
I'll check them now.

390
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,198
No hurry.

391
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:55,318
In fact,
I've already paid Chef Duan for you.

392
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,639
This is our fault.

393
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,639
How can you be responsible for it?

394
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,598
Boss,
please you directly tell me

395
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,639
the total amount of compensation.

396
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,399
50 boxes.

397
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,520
50 boxes?

398
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,519
What?

399
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,799
The loss of more than 10,000 yuan, right?

400
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,559
Tiantian,
did you transfer the money

401
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,119
to Aunt Li this morning?

402
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:18,279
I don't think you two need to worry too much.

403
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,119
Our company is just

404
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,599
looking for an administrative assistant.

405
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,198
What do you mean?

406
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,679
Miss Li, if you don't mind,
I think we…

407
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,800
What do you mean by that?

408
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,999
Tiantian, you don't know him well.

409
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,520
Who knows what he has in mind.

410
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,640
Be careful.

411
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,479
Are you okay?

412
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,199
Tell you the truth,

413
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:47,000
I have a problem with my legs.

414
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,319
I can't stand for too long.

415
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,160
When I was a child,

416
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,199
my spine was injured,

417
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,640
so my left leg often fails to work.

418
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,438
This is also the reason why I need an assistant.

419
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:04,160
I didn't want to say this, you know?

420
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,119
Okay, I promise you.

421
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,520
Tiantian, he…

422
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:20,880
Actually,
it's our fault in the first place.

423
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,478
Just finished selling grapes,

424
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,839
so I can stay in town for a while.

425
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,479
This plan is perfect.

426
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,439
Just wait for the victim,
no, the participant.

427
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,839
Puppy,

428
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,460
are you hot?

429
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,839
Let me help you to fan.

430
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,520
Miss Meiren.

431
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,439
Look.

432
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,599
Awesome.

433
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,078
It's not that I'm good, it's that you're pretty.

434
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,079
I mean this camera is awesome.

435
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,559
This camera is good at color.

436
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,359
Any light can be used.

437
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,198
Hanging out with it is the most worry-free.

438
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:13,598
Of course, but it costs a lot.

439
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,880
That's okay.

440
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,438
I also brought a lot of lenses.

441
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,718
Do you want to go out to
take photos in a good day?

442
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,479
Okay.

443
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,824
Didn't you go to buy medicine?

444
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,159
- Where is it?
- Here it is.

445
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Thank you.

446
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,599
Professor Zhuang,

447
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:30,519
Professor Zhuang,
why are you walking so fast?

448
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,438
Ignoring my greeting,

449
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:35,280
it's so bad to let outsiders see you behave this.

450
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,559
What else does Miss Yu want?

451
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,159
Tomorrow our family will go
to town to take a family photo.

452
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Please you go with us.

453
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,280
Not available.

454
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,078
But my mom booked for five people.

455
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,920
Can you bear not to go?

456
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,318
Iceberg?

457
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:02,239
I'll drive an icebreaker to break you up.

458
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,880
Please come in.

459
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,598
Zhuang.

460
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,519
Mom, we are a family,
just taking a picture,

461
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,959
you don't have to thank him specifically.

462
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,399
Zhuang, I still have to thank you.

463
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,478
I heard from Meiren that you
don't like to be photographed.

464
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:29,640
So I am really happy that you can agree.

465
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,198
You see,
you are usually busy at work,

466
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:36,118
and don't have time to come back frequently.

467
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,160
So it's actually good to take a photo.

468
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
I can have a photo to look at.

469
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,879
Mom, don't you just want to post on moments?

470
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,838
Do you need to be so provocative?

471
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,040
You bad girl.

472
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,159
You are not a mother now,

473
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,799
of course you do not understand me.

474
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,519
When you become a mother one day,
then you will understand.

475
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,679
You said I was naggy for the last few days.

476
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,358
How can I not nag?

477
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,919
I've been keeping these words
in my heart for a year,

478
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,199
if I don't tell you now,
when will I tell you?

479
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,560
I'm just talking nonsense.

480
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,358
Anyway, we'll take a family photo tomorrow.

481
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,159
After that, I'll put a big copy

482
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,760
in the lobby of our home-stay.

483
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,760
When I miss you,

484
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,839
I will look at it.

485
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:20,319
Yes, I do.

486
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,079
Good. You can infer other things from one fact.

487
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,559
Taking photos is a good chance.

488
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,799
Do a good job.

489
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,039
Don't worry.

490
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,958
I will be successful one day.

491
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:50,919
Are you in the house yet?

492
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,719
The house is a bit messy, don't mind.

493
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,800
It's okay. It's much cleaner than I thought.

494
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:02,759
But you are alone in the city,
I'm a bit worried.

495
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,238
And what kind of boss is this?

496
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,439
Why did he just start recruiting assistants?

497
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,239
The bossy trick.

498
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,800
Shouldn't he be plotting against you?

499
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,279
You've been really enlightened lately.

500
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,119
Finally, you've gotten the point of drama.

501
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,479
What a pity.

502
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,519
This routine is out of date.

503
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,478
Anyway, if something happens,
just tell me.

504
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,919
Even I can't get there myself,

505
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,559
I also have best friends in the city,

506
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,198
who can help you anytime.

507
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:25,719
Okay.

508
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,078
The wheelchair hasn't been used for a long time.

509
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,239
You're still using it with ease.

510
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,238
Sorry, Yu Meiren.

511
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,198
Although we are good friends,

512
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,679
if the fairy finds out about our relationship,

513
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,640
it will be bad.

514
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:56,838
I'll explain when I find the right opportunity.

515
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,119
Take it down.

516
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,039
How about my style?

517
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,920
Beautiful and professional.

518
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,958
Stop, don't pose.

519
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,438
We'll be late.

520
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,479
I'm afraid it's going to rain again.

521
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,000
Take it easy.

522
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:30,119
Just follow me to pose later.

523
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,958
I've forgotten again.

524
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,920
I should ask for his help frequently.

525
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,879
The way you peel the lychee is so special.

526
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,079
Why are you peeling from the middle?

527
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:52,239
It's really easy to peel in this way.

528
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,800
What is this seam in the middle?

529
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,598
Ovarian carpel suture.

530
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,318
You should express your admiration for him more.

531
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,438
Oh, you're awesome.

532
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:08,318
How come you know everything I don't know?

533
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,159
You just need to read more books.

534
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,920
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

535
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,479
It's almost time.

536
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,920
I'm going to drive.

537
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,880
I have plans for today too.

538
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,718
What's the plan?

539
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,479
Secret.

540
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,118
No need.

541
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,399
- I'll do it.
- You do it.

542
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,919
You two get ready.

543
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,280
Don't waste it.

544
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,318
How come Meiren's picture was taken down?

545
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,759
Yes, I don't understand either.

546
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,680
Isn't the amount of video view
of Meiren very high recently?

547
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,039
Is it true that she was fired by Jin

548
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,839
because of the previous incident?

549
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,958
Did you get Jin's email this morning?

550
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,598
It's the first mail which was sent to everyone

551
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,799
except Meiren.

552
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,680
Excuse me,
how to get to the president's office?

553
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Go straight there, turn right and then left.

554
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,078
Excuse me, can you say that again? Go straight…

555
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,718
Go straight, turn right, and then turn left.

556
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,118
The biggest one is the one.

557
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:28,760
Thank you.

558
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,479
Look at that girl just now,
doesn't she look familiar?

559
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,160
Yes.

560
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,400
Is she the one who appeared
in the Meiren's video log?

561
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,000
Good eyesight.

562
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,959
But why is President Jin in the wheelchair again?

563
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,639
What's wrong with this?

564
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,759
You should know our President Jin.

565
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,589
Don't ask.

566
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,598
Otherwise, you're lack of internal drive.

567
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,599
Good point.

568
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,920
Let me do this.

569
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:29,560
Your skin is white,
so this color suits you better.

570
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:34,039
Go out and turn right is
the ladies' dressing room.

571
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,559
The room where you are
staying is my dressing room.

572
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,760
I'm going to the bathroom now.

573
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Almost done with the warm up.

574
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,680
Photographer,

575
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:50,559
do you remember everything I just said?

576
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,280
Don't worry.

577
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,079
It's all set up.

578
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,079
This.

579
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,159
Are these two sleeves the same?

580
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,318
Are you dressed yet?

581
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,598
Yes, I'm done.

582
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,599
Is my dress a little too red?

583
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,598
Should I change it?

584
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,559
No need. It's okay.

585
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,318
I think you're beautiful in it.

586
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,838
You look as pretty as when you were young.

587
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,478
Really?

588
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,079
Yes.

589
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,880
Be serious.

590
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,479
Not right.

591
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,438
When I was young,
I never wore anything like this.

592
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,519
Who did you refer to?

593
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,160
No.

594
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:19,799
You're always the one in my eyes.

595
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,999
Meiren, right?

596
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,478
Don't do that.

597
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:25,639
Mom, Dad is right, you look great in it.

598
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,118
Really, I just believe my daughter.

599
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,478
Okay, are you ready?

600
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,839
Let's take a photo of a couple first.

601
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,639
Aren't we taking a group photo?

602
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,078
Why is it a couple photo?

603
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,520
Yes, do we need to pay extra for this?

604
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,559
It's our special activity.

605
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,520
A set of family photos plus a couple photo.

606
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,438
That's too great.

607
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,999
Yes, take two of you.

608
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,939
You take the couple photo.

609
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,438
We'll just take a family photo.

610
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,358
No.

611
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,439
You don't take pictures very often. You turn.

612
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,079
So embarrassing.

613
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,040
You think I paid off the
photographer for intimate poses,

614
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,479
that's too deliberate.

615
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:06,159
To be honest,
it's been years since I've been taking photos.

616
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,239
So this is a bit of a big deal today.

617
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,598
This…

618
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,639
I can't open my eyes for the flashing lights.

619
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,478
Relax, don't be nervous.

620
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:17,399
I remember that the
photos that Aunt Xiumei took

621
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,839
last time is super nice.

622
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,198
I can do it. Even she can do it,
I'm sure I can do it.

623
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:22,719
Yes, no problem.

624
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,358
Photographer,
Give me a 360 degree shot.

625
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,198
Okay, no problem.

626
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:31,318
Okay, stand up and watch the camera.

627
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,920
Mr. Yu seems to be a bit out of the photo.

628
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:34,680
This side?

629
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:35,879
Come here.

630
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,679
Come over here a little bit.

631
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,479
Look at each other.

632
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,839
Think back to the happy days of your youth.

633
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,599
A little bit closer.

634
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:47,880
We have already been clinging together,
how to be closer?

635
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,479
You can make a sample for them.

636
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,280
Right, great.

637
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,238
Learn to do it.

638
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,198
Put the hand on.

639
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:07,559
See it?

640
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,520
Yes.

641
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,239
You didn't expect it, right?

642
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,519
Where did Professor Zhuang put his hand?

643
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,119
His hand was on the waist.

644
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,079
Let me put it on your waist.

645
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,159
Where's your waist?

646
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,679
You had it when you were young.

647
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,879
Lifebuoy.

648
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,160
This is annual ring.

649
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,679
Trees grow in circles,
and one circle a year.

650
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,919
Then people must be the same.

651
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,239
Yes, the meat wheel is getting thicker.

652
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,838
You're not finished, are you?

653
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,679
I was wrong.

654
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,198
As if you're not thick.

655
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,198
Well, I'm wrong.

656
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,438
Yes.

657
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,479
That's better.

658
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,439
Great.

659
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,399
Is your company's welfare so good?

660
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,959
There are also dormitories for employees.

661
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,000
If you're not satisfied,
I'll show you another batch.

662
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,918
Do all your employees live in dormitories?

663
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,320
No.

664
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,319
This is for the convenience of you

665
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,839
to take care of Mr. Jin at all times.

666
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,399
For work reasons,
it's especially for you.

667
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,319
My grandmother always told me that

668
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,878
we should get what we give.

669
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,878
I'm only capable of pushing a wheelchair.

670
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,280
I can't afford this kind of accommodation.

671
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:50,520
If you need me to pay anything else,
I will give you an IOU.

672
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,119
Don't worry.

673
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,159
I will pay you all the money I owe you.

674
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,439
Great.

675
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,280
Miss Li is so great.

676
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,478
I have to say sorry to Miss Li.

677
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,079
I have no choice but to do this.

678
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,718
The most important thing of pushing a wheelchair

679
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,878
is the spirit of hard work.

680
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,559
A person with this spirit

681
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,279
must not be lost in materialistic desires.

682
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,039
So congratulations Miss Li, you passed the test.

683
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,239
Linda, take Miss Li to the onboarding process.

684
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,199
- Yes.
- Just go.

685
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:27,280
- Miss Li, this way please.
- Thank you.

686
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,079
Beautiful. This pose is great.

687
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,359
Great.

688
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,839
Okay, let's change the pose.

689
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,520
Pose a heart. One, two, three.

690
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,438
Why did you hold my hand?

691
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:46,079
Look at our son.

692
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,039
One, two, ready.

693
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,800
One, two, three.

694
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,669
Our son's pose is above the head.

695
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,478
I thought you just…

696
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:58,438
Your pig brain.

697
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:59,999
I told you to eat pig brains.

698
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,399
Right?

699
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,799
Yes, I ate less pig brains.

700
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,799
Now it's over.

701
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,238
How about?

702
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,079
How about learning from us,
mom and dad?

703
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,839
Okay, you make an example.

704
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,159
Professor Zhuang, can you?

705
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,718
In the future, before bribing a photographer,

706
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,120
remember to check his acting skills.

707
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,599
Right, follow them.

708
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,199
Follow them.

709
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,000
- Great.
- Look at them.

710
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,559
This is very good.

711
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,239
- Look how they pose it.
- One, two, three.

712
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,198
Did you learn it, mom and dad?

713
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,478
Yes, right?

714
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:52,239
Come on. One, two, three.

715
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,839
Nice.

716
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,159
This love fills me up.

717
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:07,158
Can you care about my feelings?

718
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,359
What's your feeling?

719
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,239
Don't care about him.

720
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:13,120
You can hold up with more exercise.

721
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,559
Let's take the family photo.

722
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,678
Together. Come on. Family photo.

723
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,600
Come on.

724
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,239
Here. Give it to me.

725
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,839
That's great.

726
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,800
What a gentleman.

727
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,438
Stand up and look at the camera.

728
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:25,559
Pay attention to smile.

729
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,918
Is the pig fat?

730
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:30,159

[Meiren Homestay]

732
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:43,559
He has cold eyes,
but his mouth corners are slightly raised.

733
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,439
His face is cool with a hint of a smile.

734
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,760
Looks like your plus
action is effective.

735
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,198
Really, how come I can't see it out?

736
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,958
Meiren, I have to say that

737
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,319
you've been reading for so many years,

738
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,600
why haven't you learned to read people's minds?

739
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,839
I'm not bragging.

740
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,119
I saw right through my boss today.

741
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,519
What happened?

742
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,599
I already told you that your
boss is not a good person.

743
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
[Valentine's Day]

744
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
[Dear fairy]

745
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,239
Miss Li, do you have plans for tomorrow?

746
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,678
No, the fairy is suspicious of me today,

747
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,080
I have to act like a boss.

748
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,560
Calm down.

749
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,279
It's not like what you think.

750
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,158
I mean that I saw right through

751
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:10,559
my boss trying to use luxury staff quarters

752
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,439
to trick me into paying extra.

753
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,958
Providing a staff dormitory.

754
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,878
Upon seeing the decoration,
I knew it can not be free.

755
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:19,958
Luckily I'm smart.

756
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:22,080
I pointed out the problem right away.

757
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,599
Mr. Jin, the blogging task
for the Chinese Valentine's Day

758
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,799
has been posted.

759
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,840
Should you remind Meiren again?

760
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,158
Then what did he say?

761
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:37,959
How could he say?

762
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,799
The capitalist's ugly face
immediately became embarrassed.

763
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,238
He's just getting by.

764
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,158
That's it.

765
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,359
You just live in my house.

766
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,399
Don't go anywhere else.

767
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:54,319
Okay, I'll live here to take care of your camera,
lenses,

768
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,559
hundreds of lipsticks,
and over 10,000 dresses.

769
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,279
And those countless bottles and jars.

770
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,678
- Can I?
- Yes.

771
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:03,438
Feel free to use whatever you want.

772
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:05,879
But I'll move out as soon as you get back.

773
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,918
After all, I'm such a third wheel,

774
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:10,159
which costs a lot of money in your house.

775
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,599
By the way,
tomorrow is Chinese Valentine's Day,

776
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,958
do you have any plans?

777
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:20,039
TV shows shouldn't miss
this important festival.

778
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,079
Li, I have a private schedule tomorrow,

779
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,158
please cooperate with me.

780
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,120
The working hours will be
counted separately, thank you.

781
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,840
When can I find a chance

782
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,199
to tell the fairy the truth?

783
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,559
What's up? Any breakthroughs?

784
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,079
I can't find anything out.

785
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,158
He likes the natural scenery.

786
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,279
The scenery is worth studying.

787
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,559
There are a lot of pictures of the starry sky.

788
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,500
Starry sky.

789
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:57,638
I saw a psychological test before that

790
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,999
people who like the starry sky

791
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,759
are explorers, have life pursuits,

792
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,958
and have a deep personality.

793
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,560
That's a good fit for Professor Zhuang.

794
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,360
I think it means he's arrogant.

795
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,478
What's going on?

796
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:15,599
Please set your attitude right.

797
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,279
Since he likes it,
you should make him feel good,

798
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,958
and take him down in
a romantic atmosphere.

799
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:27,119
I'm telling you, this is an easy task,
don't mess it up.

800
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,600
Okay.

801
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:30,000
Let me check the weather of tomorrow.

[The most handsome man in the world]

803
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,718
I have to stop talking with you.

804
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,958
My boss is calling me. Let's talk later.

805
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:39,560
Okay.

806
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,999
Hello, sorry.

807
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,479
It's my fault to miss the call
from the most handsome man.

808
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,840
