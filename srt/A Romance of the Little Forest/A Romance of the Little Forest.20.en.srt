24
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:34,621
[Falling down at the same place twice
could only be my own reason.]

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,732
They didn't come with a spoon!

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,160
Thanks.

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,000
If Lv Jian hasn't told me about that,

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,040
I didn't know you finished your essay.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,048
It's good news. We need to celebrate.

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,112
And he said it's admitted
by many top overseas labs.

31
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,552
By the way, which publication?

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,460
No, thanks.

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,080
Unfortunately, Zhuang Hui is not here.

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,480
If he were here, he would like the cake.

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,884
So sweet.

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,444
Have a seat.

37
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,256
I want to tell you something.

38
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,672
Just go ahead. It's fine.

39
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,440
Both my experiment and paper succeeded.

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,920
And I've been eager for the lab for long.

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,304
Maybe I could find a solution there.

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,679
Nice. It's good for you.

43
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,624
Let me drink a toast to you.

44
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:19,900
So I'm afraid I need
to go studying there for at least a year.

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,388
But actually,

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,952
I don't know when I can come back.

47
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,332
I won't come back until I find the solution.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,360
It's fine.

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,240
Then we can live in
a land of idyllic beauty together.

50
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,440
What are you doing? Give it to me.

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,039
It's sweet.

52
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,840
Just like you.

53
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,600
You're drunk. I'll send you back.

54
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,559
No. Here's my home.

55
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,119
I won't leave. My home is right here!

56
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,304
Where are we going?

57
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,496

Nothing.

67

Where's my wine?

68
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,560

Tiantian.

76
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,800
Bubble tea is ready. Come and have a try!

77
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,440
I'm sure you'll fall in love with it.

I'm here.

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,660
What's wrong with your leg?

81
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,768
Where's broken?

82
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,080
Where is it?

83
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,216
You were fine when we just came in.

84
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,600
What's going on?

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,872
Let me try.

86
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,940
Unbelievable.

87
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,320
I've become fatter
since I ate and played with you.

88
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,760
So less sugar next time.

89
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,120
You're still that slender.

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,400
Wait. Why are you in a wheelchair?

91
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,160
Still refuse to answer me.

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,584
Does she want to satirize me by it?

93
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,920
Calm down, Tiantian. Listen to me first.

94
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,288
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:40,848
I was too reckless yesterday.

96
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,720
I shouldn't mention your sadness.

97
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,980
It doesn't matter.

98
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,440
You can do whatever you want.

99
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,780
Stop. Listen to me first.

100
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,220
Okay.

101
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you know that?

102
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,536
I really feel relaxed since I'm with you.

103
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,320
Because I think I can be myself.

104
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,760
Just say or do whatever I want
without thinking of the results.

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,728
I know you'll tolerate me
no matter what I say and do.

106
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,060
Your love gives me power and confidence.

107
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,104
People always say others can't really
feel their own experiences.

108
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,136
But I really hope
I can try my best to get your feelings.

109
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,119
You see.

110
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,064
I'm as same as you now.

111
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,696
I can't forget your expression
of suffering a lot.

112
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,776
I treated your pain as a chip of our love.

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,512
I didn't mean that.

114
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:47,368
You've done nothing wrong
to me so there's no injury.

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,860
I don't deserve your apology.

116
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,119
Once again.

117
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,679
Why?

118
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,359
Don't indulge me anymore.

119
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,112
Do I?

120
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,764
Fine. Just take it as connivance this time.

121
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:06,020
Do you remember what I've told you before?

122
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,640
"Gifts of roses have a lingering fragrance."

123
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,544
I've indulged you today...

124
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,328
Well...

125
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,680
If I make something wrong in the
future, can you indulge me once?

126
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,880
Yes. Of course.

127
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,064
- Really?
- How can I deceive you?

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,456
Then you should sign me a note.

129
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,959
Okay. It's not a big deal.
Let me get a pen and a note.

130
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,480
Stay here and wait for me.

131
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,000
Stop there.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,280
If you go, how can I experience it?

133
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,504
Fine. This way, please.

134
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,280
How am I?

135
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Awesome.

136
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,128
Faster than I.

137
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,376
What to write?

138
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,960
Turn around.

139
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,184
Okay.

140
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,280
Just write "Li Tiantian will indulge

141
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,400
Jin Xi's fault once without preconditions."

142
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,296
Then sign your name.

143
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,119
So simple.

144
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:12,208
It's a solemn promise. Not simple.

145
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,440
Indulge... Jin Xi's fault...

146
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,208
once...

147
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,228
without preconditions.

148
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,100
It's done.

149
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,492
Let me see.

150
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,000
Why are you so happy?

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's like you've really
made a significant mistake.

152
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,040
What's the matter?

153
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,536
Keep it.

154
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,856
If you'd like to "indulge" me,

155
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,624
then let me see it.

156
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,472
If not,

157
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,480
you can cremate or throw it as you wish.

158
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,080
Then I won't tangle with you anymore.

159
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,316
I see.

160
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,296
Keep it well.

161
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,276
I'm done.

162
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,559
By the way, how did you make that bubble tea?

163
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,880
Tell me the recipe.

164
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,392
It's my secret recipe,

165
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,200
which is concluded
by drinking bubble tea for a month.

166
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
So how can I tell you so easily?

167
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:54,640
Oh, dear. I'm your girlfriend, okay?

168
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,280
So flexible. You still can kick me.

169
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,560
Come on. Try again.

170
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,200

You're really something.

180
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,480
You wouldn't need to leave in a hurry
if the forum wasn't held in advance.

181
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,520
Can you catch the plane?

182
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,239
You're not in good condition.

183
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,660
Are you too tired?

184
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,760
If so, we can be absent this time.

185
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,420
Anyway, you've delivered the paper.

186
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,700
It's the achievement of the whole group.

187
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,428
I'll let the world see it.

188
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,599
Ladies and gentlemen.

189
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:17,440
To ensure you a good rest,
now we'll dim the cab lights.

190
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,550
We advise you to keep your seat belt fastened,

191
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,200
as a precaution against sudden turbulence.

192
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,920
Sorry. I left in a hurry
because of sudden work.

193
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm now at... You can turn on
the reading light above your head.

194
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,604
[Low battery. Auto power off.]

195
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,600
♫ I want to stand beside you ♫

196
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,280
♫ adjoining your shoulder ♫

197
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,120
♫ I want to guard our memories ♫

198
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,080
♫ If I can pretend ♫

199
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,760
♫ In fact, my happiest moment ♫

200
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,599
It's quite like the one sold in the store.

201
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:01,039
Boss Tian, you really know a lot.

202
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,720
It's my secret recipe.

203
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,000
Have you contacted Professor Zhuang after that?

204
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,132
No.

205
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
It's been a long time.
Why aren't worried about it?

206
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:24,640
How can a girl express her mind first?

207
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,220
Besides, I've gained insight into his mind.

208
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,840
He can't escape from my control.

209
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,039
Fate has determined everything.

210
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,880
Maybe it's suitable for others.

211
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,840
But I think you need to be active with him.

212
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,799
Really?

213
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,000
You can choke when you're drinking
so what else can you do?

214
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,328
Just listen to me. Be proactive.

215
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,448
Fine. I'll have a try.

216
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,320
Do you remember the story of being stood up?

217
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,880
I've organized my words.

218
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,440
I'll tell you tomorrow.

219
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,200
Let's meet at the botanic garden at 10.

220
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,980
He doesn't like mosquito repellent.

221
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,160
If he waits for me here,
he must be bitten everywhere.

222
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,312
Lady.

223
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,760
It's in strong ultraviolet and
has many mosquitoes here.

224
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,472
Why don't you stay in the shadow?

225
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:13,896
Life needs to be gilded,

226
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,008
which means we need to bask.

227
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:19,528
Besides, I have an anti-mosquito bracelet.

228
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,119
Aunt.

229
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,479
Do you still work here?

230
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,896
Do you know me?

231
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,244
I've been here before.

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,760
I don't want to discourage you

233
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,424
but I've seen it so many times before.

234
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,840
The boys who let girls wait for them for so long

235
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,120
won't come to meet them.

236
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,160
Just see around.

237
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,784
Look at me, aunt.

238
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:59,832
I am pretty, right?

239
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,559
I have a good figure, right?

240
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,312
Just like a star.

241
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:09,239
So is he willing to stand me up?

242
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:14,784
No... He's unwilling to do so.

243
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,960
Uncle, how much is the bubble machine?

244
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,600
30 for one. 40 for two.

245
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,968
Too expensive.

246
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,160
Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off.

247
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,816
Please try again later.

248
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,092
Open the door.

249
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,464
Hello?

250
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,216
Is anyone here?

251
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,900
So weird.

252
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,232
Is he immersing himself in the experiments?

253
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,076
Lv Jian!

254
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,320
Miss Meiren.

255
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,120
Where's your Professor Zhuang?

256
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,500
Prof. Zhuang... He's left... Hasn't he told you?

257
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,700
Left?

258
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,304
He's not at home.

259
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,020
Did we miss each other?

260
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,560
He's gone abroad.

261
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,880
Abroad?

262
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,160
He's gone there for academic purposes.

263
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,620
He can't come back for a short time.

264
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,104
Ladies and gentlemen.

265
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:48,190
Excuse me, what would like to drink?

266
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,360
- Water.
- Okay.

267
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,190
Local time is 6:10 pm.

268
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,300
It's a sunny day.

269
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,500
Thank you.

270
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,912
Ladies and gentlemen.

271
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:00,576
We'll arrive at our destination in one hour.

272
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,040
Excuse me, sir. What would you like to drink?

273
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,160
Water, please.

274
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,480
Okay.

275
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,400
What's going on? I...
I must wash it today.

276
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,239
- I can't...
- Why?

277
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:23,079
- I refuse.
- You're disgusting!

278
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,680
Why do you walk in a hurry?

279
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,280
The shoes are hard to walk in.

280
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,848
Could you have tenderness toward me?

281
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,120
So are you a tender girl?

282
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,400
- Don't want to wash...
- Young lady!

283
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,400
You can't have a result with a man
who needs you to chase.

284
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,980
The range of girls chasing men
is thin like paper.

285
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,580
If he likes you, it's a paper.

286
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,180
If not, it's a stainless steel window screen!

287
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,479
He won't accept you! You should give up!

288
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,104
Well... What do you mean?

289
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:53,879
We're talking about who washes dishes today.

290
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,792
What do you mean?

291
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,180
Weren't you chasing him?

292
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,680
He washes every time.

293
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,900
Can't I wash once?

294
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,439
Because you can't make them clear.

295
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,560
- Hit me again?
- Bye.

296
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,720
- You can't catch me.
- If so, I'll keep it short!

297
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,208
If so, you still can't get the final happiness.

298
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,264
Watch out.

299
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,516
Are you okay?

300
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,244
Miss Meiren, are you fine?

301
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
Why are you here?

302
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,880
I... My friend asked me to
dance nearby... Fine. Move on.

303
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,190
Otherwise, it'll close. I have to leave now.

304
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,666
Let me send you back.

305
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,660
No thanks. I'll soon arrive.

306
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,744
Miss Meiren.

307
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,704
It seems your home is over there.

308
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,080
I want to buy something first.

309
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,636
Miss Meiren.

310
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,119
If you're unhappy, you can tell me.

311
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,592
Why am I unhappy? I'm so good.

312
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm really worried about you.

313
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,720
Why?

314
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,719
Is it because of Professor Zhuang?

315
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,840
No. Unfaithful lover Zhuang!

316
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,000
Be at ease.

317
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,920
I have many ways to ruin him.

318
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,960
Stop!

319
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,232
He and I...

320
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,680
Professor Zhuang Yu and I are not lovers.

321
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,239
Nothing unfaithful.

322
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:38,664
Don't treat me as a victim.

323
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,724
I'm not that fragile.

324
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,900
Forget it.

325
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,000
Are you hungry? Let's have something tasty.

326
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm losing weight.

327
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,920
Then we can go dancing.

328
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,880
Exercising is the best way to lose weight.

329
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,740
Wait a second. I'll arrange it.

330
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,536
Do you think I look sad?

331
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,000
Go to play yourself.

332
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,656
I want to stay alone.

333
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:12,632
I've seemly met this expression before.

334
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,176
I have to tell Miss Tiantian first.

335
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,959
Are you tired? I can move myself.

336
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,359
I'm fine. We haven't walked long.

337
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,560
Don't move. I can do it.

338
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,976
I see.

339
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,220
Thank you.

340
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,620
- Let's sit here.
- Okay.

341
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,460
It's fine.

342
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,760
The urban market is quite busy.

343
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,100
Just like our rural festivals.

344
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,348
That's it.

345
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,368
I really like our lovers' phone cases.

346
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,708
Thank you.

347
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,360
Thanks.

348
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,080
Please enjoy it.

349
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
So many toppings?

350
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,880
Just like a mixed congee. Can it be tasty?

351
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,959
Bubble tea should be drunk in this way.

352
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:05,350
People always say "all toppings, entire joys."

353
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,826
Let me have a try.

354
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,620
Hello?

355
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,868
Handsome boy?

356
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,680
What?

357
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,864
I see. Okay.

358
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,160
I have something urgent to do now.

359
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,640
Shall I go with you?

360
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,110
My bestie was fooled.

361
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,442
I have to console her.

362
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,959
What's going on?

363
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:36,160
In short, whoever
cheat others' feelings need to die.

364
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,936
Is that too serious?

365
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,860
Could it be a white lie?

366
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,599
How can you defend an unfaithful man?

367
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,744
No! I have no relations with an unfaithful man!

368
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,800
I have to leave now.
Uncle Fang will come to pick you up.

369
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,520
I don't know her alarm level now.

370
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,336
Hold on! Alarm level? Tell me about it.

371
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,912
According to the dramas and our experiment,

372
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,340
I find that there are levels
for sadness and anger.

373
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,548
Tell me some details.

374
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,288
A blue warning signal means she's out of wits.

375
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,780
So weird.

376
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,652
Why is there a pheasant?

377
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,160
It sounds quite serious.

378
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,199
Serious, right?

379
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:04,190
Anyway, it's the lowest level.

380
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,760
Severer?

381
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,624
A yellow warning signal means she's moody.

382
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,008
[Zhuang Yu]

383
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,484
[Delete contact "Zhuang Yu".]

384
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,144
Oh, please. Don't leave me alone...

385
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,336
Good-for-nothing!

386
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,028
Why are you crying for a trivial?

387
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,800
The kitchen knife is extremely sharp.

388
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,719
It can cut almost everything.

389
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,280
Let's demonstrate it to you.

390
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,180
It can cut both vegetables and meats.

391
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,524
Nice cut!

392
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,072
I've never thought she's so dramatic.

393
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,199
What did you say?

394
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,319
Nothing. Any color else?

395
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,480
Yes. Of course.

396
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,704
Close to me.

397
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,936
All in all, don't tease girls.

398
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,020
I have to go now. Tell you next time.

399
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,316
Wait a moment.

400
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,752
- Take care.
- I see.

401
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,312
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

402
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,000
Why don't they relapse?

403
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,420
If my legs relapse,
it doesn't mean I cheat on her, right?

404
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,180
Hello.

405
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,460
I'm leaving.

406
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,420
If you want to clean the room,

407
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,540
you can place an order on the mini apps.

408
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,239
We'll be here at once.

409
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:10,280
I see. Take care.

410
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,360
Goodbye.

411
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,056
Meiren, how are you?

412
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,680
So nice.

413
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,160
Close your eyes.

414
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,040
Why are you here? Aren't you dating?

415
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,272
Breathe naturally.

416
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,199
Slacken yourself.

417
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,380
Oh, my! So tidy!

418
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,836
It's messy so I asked her to clean it.

419
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,280
Orange warning signal.

420
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,020
What would you like to drink?

421
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,344
I've made some vegetable juice.

422
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,752
You can make juice.

423
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,860
As my knife is blunt, chunks are a little big.

424
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,260
But luckily, the juicer is awesome.

425
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,040
Your finger!

426
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,900
Where's Band-Aid?

427
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,320
Old place, right?

428
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,368
I don't need it. It's not painful.

429
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,040
I bought a new knife from TV shopping.

430
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,176
Let's try when it arrives.

431
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
There are three glasses here.

432
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,160
Broccoli, celery and coriander.

433
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,152
Which one do you want?

434
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,408
Until your whole body is comfortable.

435
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:32,824
Then move your head and neck

436
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,300
gently toward left and right.

437
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,548
How is it?

438
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,768
Is it fresh?

439
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,200
What happened to you two?

440
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,904
Zhuang Yu...

441
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,192
How can I think about this kind of man?

442
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,700
Professor Zhuang.

443
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,020
You've finally arrived.

444
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,310
Come in, please.

445
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,560
It's hard for you to travel for so long.

446
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,830
The signal here is poor.

447
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,460
I hope you haven't missed
any important messages.

448
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,360
How should I call you?

449
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,839
Forget to introduce ourselves.

450
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,900
Professor Giannandrea is our teacher.

451
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,460
We're asked to bring you some furniture.

452
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,300
- You can call me Li Lei.
- Nice to meet you.

453
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,660
Nice to meet you, Professor Zhuang. I'm Lucy.

454
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,388
Good to meet you both.

455
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,124
- Sorry.
- Fine.

456
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,199
Let's help him put things in his room.

457
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:34,719
Do you remember the story of being stood up?

458
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,319
I've organized my words.

459
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,920
I'll tell you tomorrow.

460
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,064
Let's meet at the botanic garden at 10.

461
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,180
Sorry.

462
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,460
I just got off the plane.

463
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,079
I thought to say goodbye to you face to face.

464
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,640
Anyhow, you were out.

465
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,520
Then I decide to tell you when I arrive.

466
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,464
Have you waited for a long time?

467
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,744
[You're not friends.]

468
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,352
Delete contact?

469
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,812
Deep breath.

470
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,180
Relax.

471
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,680
That's a resolute decision.

472
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,340
Don't you give him a chance to explain?

473
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,020
Explain?

474
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,392
Do I lack an explanation?

475
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,479
"My phone was robbed."

476
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,880
"The signal tower is down."

477
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,079
"My luggage was stolen."

478
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,160
"The plane crashed."

479
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,440
I can fabricate 100 different explanations.

480
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
But are they useful?

481
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,340
Is it his reason to leave without telling me?

482
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,319
Is there any misunderstanding?

483
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,224
Such as a white lie?

484
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,140
It's right.

485
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,304
Maybe it's a white lie

486
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,552
which makes me think
that I'm important to him.

487
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:56,304
Anyhow, it's just self-deception.

488
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,800
I don't think your love is a lie.

489
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,232
We all know how he treats you.

490
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,712
Does he have no idea how to tell you?

491
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,320
It doesn't matter. I don't mind anymore.

492
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,560
Falling down once may be
because of the shoes or the road.

493
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,432
Falling down at the same place twice
could only be my own reason.

494
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,720
Essentially, it's my own business.

495
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,260
Not a matter of someone else.

496
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,640
Don't worry.

497
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
I've reconciled myself.

498
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,960
I feel so good.

499
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,488
Are you sure?

500
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,560
Take a rest first.

501
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,984
I need to go out now.

502
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,008
Where are you going?

503
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,024
Collect bird droppings.

504
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,128
Oh, my goodness. Red warning signal.

505
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,468
Wait for me.

506
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,280
So many sparrows here.
We can always see their droppings.

507
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,552
Sparrow.

508
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,304
Parus major.

509
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,860
What?

510
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,716
It's a parus major.

511
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,760
Parus major is also your relative?

512
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,800
Yes.

513
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,500
I've told you I'm familiar with the mountain.

514
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,132
It seems it isn't familiar with you.

515
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:47,528
I haven't come back for a long time
so it needs time to know me again.

516
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:52,959
People always think they
outclass the creatures

517
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:55,384
close to them in zoology.

518
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,484
Anyhow, everyone will look up at birds.

519
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:14,752
You can recognize a fleeting bird?

520
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,248
If my memory serves me,

521
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:20,576
last time Professor Giannandrea told me that

522
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,580
he was a professor in botany.

523
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,612
Obviously, Professor Zhuang's
memory is retentive.

524
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,512
Some memories are just tough to be forgotten.

525
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,284
[The animal in this scene is made by CG.]

526
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,880
Don't you enjoy sleeping?

527
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,479
What's wrong with you?

528
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:56,979
Gathering them all night?

529
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,888
Energy of Universe
only can be absorbed in the morning.

530
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,439
Forget the energy.

531
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:11,140
You haven't had breakfast, right?

532
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,180
I've brought it for you. Try some.

533
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,900
I'm really hungry.

534
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,292
Thank you.

535
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,088
Not this.

536
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,488
Here you are.

537
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,100
Have some soya milk. Don't choke.

538
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,672
As an old saying goes, "Tomorrow is another day".

539
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,208
It's getting late.

540
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,304
Go to a date with your president.

541
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,919
Oh, come on.

542
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:02,728
Not date. It's my job.

543
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,012
Job is a good thing.

544
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,616
Better than the bullshit love.

545
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,640
Tiantian.

546
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,700
You need to get them both.

547
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,320
Your president sounds like a good man.

548
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,688
Cherish him.

549
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,944
The time is up. I have to go to work now.

550
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,084
Go ahead.

551
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,000
Don't forget to eat them all.

552
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,980
Have some soya milk if you choke.

553
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,960
Don't eat the wrong one.

554
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:38,832
Be at ease. I'm not a child.

555
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,888
Kids have few vexations.

556
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,980
Here are the work that BD team have got.

557
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,000
As Xiaofang is not
here... I'll check them.

558
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,040
Yu Meiren is in poor condition recently.

559
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,320
Don't forget to find
some alternates in advance.

560
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,460
Okay.

561
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,680
Come in.

562
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,624
Then I'll go out to work.

563
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,528
Here you are.

564
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,360
Thank you.

565
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,300
Sorry for being late.
I went to see my bestie first.

566
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,788
Don't say so.

567
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,900
How is she? Which level?

568
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,288
Red warning signal. A great calamity.

569
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,536
A great calamity? How great?

570
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,180
It's a long story.

571
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,760
Just tell me.

572
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,320
[A fish head]

573
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,024
Why don't answer it?

574
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,504
It's the fish head seller. Just ignore her.

575
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,520
She must have something
to talk to you. Answer it.

576
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,284
Then I'll answer it.

577
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,760
Aunt Wang!

578
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,239
The fish you sent was quite nice!

579
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,840
Two more fish just like that!

580
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,736
Money... Right...

581
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,780
What's wrong?

582
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,060
Water.

583
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,084
You... Water...

584
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,600
Go ahead.

585
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,600
President Jin, you're so unreasonable.

586
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,199
Aunt? Fish?

587
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,679
Are you drunk in the daytime?

588
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,080
No. I got it wrong.

589
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,264
By the way, how are you these days?

590
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,439
Why do you all ask that?

591
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,800
I'm so nice.

592
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,080
My zeal for work
is higher than your imagination.

593
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,880
You're quite right.

594
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,479
I have a great plan.

595
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,479
Move on.

596
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:58,360
Innocent or charming make-up
is popular, right?

597
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,439
They're all trying to please men.

598
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:02,639
I think they're all obsolete.

599
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,639
- Sounds reasonable.
- I know it's right.

600
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,470
Besides, many festivals are coming

601
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,660
so all relatives will take turns to ask girls

602
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,560
whether they have a boyfriend or not.

603
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,656
If not, they'll arrange blind dates for you.

604
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,560
It's possible.

605
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,600
It's a certainty.

606
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,660
Are you bothered and agitated by the blind dates?

607
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,600
I haven't had it before so I don't know.

608
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,950
It's not bad if the girl is pretty.

609
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,000
No.

610
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,820
In fact, many girls don't like it

611
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,840
but they have to cope with their families.

612
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,040
What do they want to get from the date?

613
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,800
Love? No!

614
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,320
They want to get out of it after it's finished.

615
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,600
What is love?

616
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,959
You know it best
for you have so many love affairs.

617
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,479
It lapses so fast.

618
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:45,800
Hold on.

619
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,390
How many love affairs do I have?

620
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,680
I've just had my first love.

621
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,420
Stop nonsense. Get to the point.

622
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,600
Forget it. You're not an independent lady
so you can't understand it.

623
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,160
Based on the new demand of independent women,

624
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,000
I invent an anti-blind-date make-up for them.

625
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,560
Forbid them to fall in love with you.

626
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,200
Staying away from men
will bring you a brilliant future!

627
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,768
Oh, yes. Exactly right.

628
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,879
Fine, I see.

629
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:19,200
Okay, then wait for it.

630
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay. Thank you, Sister Wang.

631
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,140
Sister or aunt?

632
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,600
Forget it. Sit down.

633
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,879
Hello, everyone.

634
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:37,800
I'm your favorite blogger,
Mermaid With Long Legs.

635
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,360
I'll bring you a special make-up today.

636
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,560
We all hate to have a blind-date at festivals.

637
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,239
Are you getting tired
of laughing hypocritically?

638
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,400
Have you had enough of
being remarked without dignity?

639
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,760
As long as you learn
this anti-blind-date make-up,

640
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,800
it's like you're armed.

641
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,199
Drive your dread of blind-date away.

642
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,040
Smoky eyes show your eagerness for freedom.

643
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,600
From now on, you don't need to be a mild wife.

644
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,439
Taupe and plum are obsolete.

645
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:14,120
Only puce can match your make-up.

646
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:18,919
Puce brings us a sense of never returning.

647
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:22,040
It should be the attitude of independent ladies.

648
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,744
Quite special.

649
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,608
Compared with men,

650
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:29,360
we should gain safety from the make-up.

651
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,460
Look at her.

652
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,580
She really knows
to grasp independent women's hearts.

653
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,196
Puce!

654
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,439
Puce brings us a sense of termination.

655
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:00,384
No update for three days?

656
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,920
Isn't she a daily-update blogger?

657
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,480
It shouldn't be like this.
