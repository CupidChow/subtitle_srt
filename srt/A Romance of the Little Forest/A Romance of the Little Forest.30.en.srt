[Episode 30]
[Love you with my heart and soul]

24
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,869
Are your hands and head okay?

25
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,950
If you're not okay, don't go too far.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,630
Never say a man is not okay.

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,830
Wait.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,030
Your cufflink.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
How did you put it on yourself?

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,470
I hurt my arm, not my hands.

31
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,669
Well, that's not what I'm going to say.

32
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,390
Tell me honestly,
did you sneak out of the hospital?

33
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,719
The doctor let me out.

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,799
Are you sure?

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,030
Can you take care of yourself with one hand?

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,550
No, I can't.

37
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,239
Why did you come out?

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,910
That's why I came to you. Are you hungry?

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,110
Grandma, I'm full.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,239
You do so much work every day,
but you eat so little.

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,519
You'd faint if you get low blood sugar.

42
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,359
Maybe the weather is too hot,
so I don't have an appetite.

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,319
Grandma, could you please

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,799
just put these dishes in the fridge?

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
I'll eat when I'm back, okay?

46
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,520
Let me do it.

47
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:17,830
Leave it here. I'll do it.

48
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,750
Then I'll go.

49
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,239
Come back early, okay?

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,030
Okay.

51
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,109
I'll make some delicious food tonight!

52
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,030
Good.

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,269
Have you made up your mind?

54
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,910
Well...

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,390
Yes, actually,
it doesn't need to think so long.

56
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,719
And you get injured for me.

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,669
I shouldn't push you away
when you need any help.

58
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,999
But what a coincidence.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,079
I made an appointment today.

60
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,270
Appointment?

61
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,469
Classmate?

62
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,799
Yes, classmate!

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,629
It's destiny to meet in the crowd.

64
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,909
It's not easy for us to get together

65
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,829
in one classroom in one school,

66
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,749
so we should eat together more often,

67
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,600
and make good communication, right?

68
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,029
How many fingers do you see?

69
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,750
One.

70
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:17,790
Can you say something starting with one?

71
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,880
One for the money,

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,950
two for the show,

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,949
I'll love you with my heart and soul.

74
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,879
And here is my version.

75
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,830
One step away.

76
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,510
I'll see you around.

77
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,159
Look who is here.

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,069
The sight of his back looks so familiar.

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,440
It's you, Professor Zhuang.

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,039
Okay, I admit.

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,510
I made an appointment with Lv.

82
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,919
Do you want to join us?

83
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,639
Professor Zhuang, you don't have to
be like this.

84
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,229
Miss Meiren, she is an adult.

85
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,269
It's her freedom to choose
who she wants to eat with.

86
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,669
Right?

87
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,639
I swear.

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,069
I really didn't know
you were out of the hospital so early.

89
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,069
I had an appointment with him a long time ago.

90
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,199
And that was to help you.

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,790
It's destiny to meet in the crowd.

92
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,600
It's not destiny at all.

93
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,319
Right?

94
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,549
Make good communication?

95
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,159
No, we don't need to.

96
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,390
We don't need to communicate at all.

97
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,760
Calm down. You can make it.

98
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,109
Okay, let's eat together.

99
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,480
No, thank you. I had an appointment.

100
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,110
What did you say?

101
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:55,829
Didn't you invite me for lunch just now?

102
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,389
He might have forgotten it.

103
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,319
Besides, Professor Zhuang is so popular.

104
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,789
It shouldn't be hard
to find someone to have lunch with.

105
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,919
At least, he has...

106
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,880
Mr. Li!

107
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,159
What are you doing? I've been waiting for you.

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,549
Didn't we agree to have lunch together?

109
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,829
- What do you want to eat?
- But you said you had an appointment.

110
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,829
With you! Let's go to the snack bar
at the front gate.

111
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,550
Go.

112
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,639
Can you eat with one hand?

113
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,269
And the snack bar
at the front gate... is...

115
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,319
Yeah.

116
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,269
It was closed when you were
in the hospital last week.

117
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,789
Why didn't you just say?

118
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,919
Did you give me a chance to talk?

119
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,479
You almost dislocated my arm.

120
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,790
Why should I take the blame?

121
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,439
Okay.

122
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,039
I know a new restaurant.

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
You'll like it.

124
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,270
Let's go. Go.

125
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,480
How did I get here?

126
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,879
I'm sorry, miss.

127
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,160
It's okay.

128
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,509
I didn't want to come.

129
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm just passing by.

130
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,480
Since I'm here, I need to drink some water.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,920
Tiantian.

132
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,070
Tiantian, are you there?

133
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,200
Tiantian!

134
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,320
Tiantian, I know you don't want to see me.

135
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,950
It's my fault.

136
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,760
I want to treat you right.

137
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
I want to make you happy.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,640
But it doesn't end well.

139
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,710
I make you sad again and again.

140
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,790
Maybe I'm just used to it.

141
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,789
I always do things in my own way,

142

like to arrange everything.

143
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,910
But I overlooked...

144
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,230
that may not be your cup of tea.

145
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,910
It's my fault.

when I see you again,

150
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,760
standing right in front of me,

151
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,520
which is what I can't even dream of
in the past year,

152
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,550
I'm satisfied.

153
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Maybe you got bored with it long ago.

154
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,320
This time I really have to go.

155
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,280
I'm just worried...

156

no one to take care of you after I'm gone.

157
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,520
Maybe you'll be happier if I'm not here.

158
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,230
Tiantian,

159
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,960
hope we will meet again in the future.

160
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,350
If there is no chance,

161
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,960
just forget me.

Okay, go!

165
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,959
I was wrong.

166
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,959
The last time you wanted to leave,

167
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,760
I should have gotten rid of you.

168
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,230
To be honest,
I never want to see you again in my life.

169
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,840
Go!

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,669
I screwed everything up.

185
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,079
[One year ago]
♫ It asked me if I was hurt ♫

186
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,229
I'll come back when Tiantian is better.

187
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,999
I'll go now.

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,599
♫ I want to stand beside you ♫

189
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,599
♫ Leaning on your shoulder ♫

190
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,039
♫ How much I want to guard the time
of you and me ♫

191
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,039
♫ If it can be disguised ♫

192
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,559
♫ Pretending that I am happy ♫

193
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,959
♫ Telling lies ♫

194
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,320
♫ Keeping the lost starlight ♫

195
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,600
♫ How long is the memory ♫

196
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,920
♫ It also disguises the fantasy ♫

197
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,079
♫ Refusing to leave is my stubbornness ♫

198
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,160
♫ Holding the hope ♫

199
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,759
♫ Smile again and let go ♫

200
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,300
♫ Some words will never be spoken ♫

201
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,279
♫ I want to stand beside you ♫

202
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,239
♫ Leaning on your shoulder ♫

203
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,959
♫ How much I want to guard the time
of you and me ♫

204
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,959
♫ And no longer want to pretend ♫

205
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,639
♫ Forgive me for being the happiest
I've ever been ♫

206
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:22,589
♫ It is the starlight that I saw with you ♫

207
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,469
Okay, I get it.

208
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,910
Just do as I said before.

209
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,670
Good.

210
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,440
I was in the hospital for months.

211
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,550
Another half year of rehabilitation.

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,590
Now I'm fine. I walk really fast.

213
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,230
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

214
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,400
It's not something worth talking about.

215
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,589
And you know me.

216
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,319
I'm a man of honor.

217
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,549
Everybody knows that.

218
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,550
I can't easily...

219
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,000
I can't use moral blackmail against you.

220
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,790
Yes.

221
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,550
I was thinking that we could
be good as we used to be.

222
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,760
But I want you to forgive me
from the bottom of your heart,

223
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,550
instead of sympathizing with me.

224
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,439
You lost your leg.

225
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,030
Why do you still work so hard?

226
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,839
It's nothing.

227
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,150
I was much more tired
when I was rehabilitating.

228
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,640
It must have been very painful.

229
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,399
No more pain.

230
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,199
No feelings at all.

231
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,029
Don't cry.

232
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,790
How cool is this?

233
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,280
Just like Iron Man.

234
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,149
I'm fully capable of taking care of myself.

235
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,079
I won't be your burden.

236
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,349
What are you talking about?

237
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,110
Is that what I mean?

238
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,470
That's why you missed your appointment
the other day.

239
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,759
The prosthesis was slightly displaced.

240
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,280
I went to fix it.

241
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,000
Now it's fine. Just like normal people.

242
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,000
You can't say it again.

243
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,199
I am with you.

244
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,960
It was never about sympathy.

245
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,960
Because I like you.

246
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,519
This new assistant you
recruited is good at photoshop.

247
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,109
Even Yu Meiren looks pretty.

248
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,520
It's easier to photoshop my pics.

249
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,960
You chose the right person.

250
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,790
But you're a long way from
the former status of Yu Meiren.

251
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,350
In the end,
the position you have now

252
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,280
is what she has given up.

253
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,590
She?

254
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,309
What for?

255
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,639
She has been the brand
ambassador of Lami and Qin Ya.

256
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,559
After Yu Meiren,

257
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,709
these two brands have never cooperated
with any KOL.

258
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,159
That's because she played some tricks,

259
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,229
destroyed the image of KOLs.

260
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,680
So no more cooperation.

261
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,679
Besides, it's just Lami.

262
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,760
What's the big deal?

263
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,949
If she can get Jian Tao settled,
she is something.

264
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,040
Enough.

265
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,950
Yu Meiren is gone.

266
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:38,520
What's the use of saying these words?

267
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,069
But there is an opportunity.

268
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,109
Great changes have taken place
in the top management of Lami Greater China.

269
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,760
I know the new public relations specialist.

270
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,949
He revealed, previously,
Lami had approached Zhuang Yu

271
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,070
to endorse the brand.

272
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,039
It has a good effect.

273
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,830
The top management is interested
in reconnecting.

274
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,920
If this time

275
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,469
you can get trusted by Zhuang Yu.

276
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,280
You'll have the chance
to be the brand ambassador.

277
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,470
Mr. Zhao.

278
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,470
I know I shouldn't say no.

279
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,310
- But...
- Xia Zhi.

280
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,830
What Yu Meiren can do,
I'm sure you can do it.

281
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,470
How is it? Not bad, right?

282
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,639
Very auspicious.

283
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,519
Isn't it?

284
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,039
Vegetables are good for health.

285
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,999
It also saves the lives of many animals.

286
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,710
We are studying botany.

287
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,919
Is your girlfriend a vegetarian?

288
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,039
How do you know?

289
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,399
Meat, date.

290
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,279
Two hobbies of your life.

291
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
No more meat.

292
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,279
So there is only one possibility.

293
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,920
You know me so well.

294
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,429
How's that? Though this is not a big meal,

295
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,039
it's fine cuisine, right?

296
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,400
It's better than eating in
the cafeteria with Yu and Lv.

297
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,560
This is good.

298
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,520
Is this too much trouble for you?

299
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,229
Since you have asked me,
not to mention this thing,

300
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,470
I'm ready to undergo the most severe trials
to do it for you.

301
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,590
Is it that hard?

302
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,760
Nah. It's actually not that hard.

303
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,040
I'll ask. Very simple.

304
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,399
What am I talking about?

305
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,070
Sorry. My bad.

306
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,920
You pay for this meal.

307
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:53,920
Why?

308
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,999
I'm saving money for your wedding red packet.

309
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,829
What's the hurry?

310
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,349
It's still early.

311
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,229
Have you ever heard of a poem?

312
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,430
Once upon a time, the day becomes slow.

313
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,350
This car, horse and mail are slow.

314
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,560
This life is only for loving one person.

315
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,559
You're trying to say...

316
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,070
Everything cannot be rushed.

317
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,799
I'm all ears.

318
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,589
In short, in a nutshell,
she likes that I'm patient.

319
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,469
She said I give her the
sense of security she needs.

320
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,159
Don't you afraid of the third person?

321
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,710
What are you talking about?
True love can stand any test.

322
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,349
By the way,
I also recorded some words.

323
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,399
I think it works very well.

324
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,640
Let me read it to you.

325
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,160
Here.

326
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,639
Dating Bible: communication skills.

327
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,949
Don't say whatever.

328
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,469
Say 'it's up to you'.

329
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,039
Don't say understand?

330
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,949
Say 'do I make myself clear'?

331
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,309
Don't say I'll try.

332
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,429
Say 'I'll try my best'.

333
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,470
And.

334
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,069
Don't say I can't.

335
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,830
Say 'I'm willing to learn'.

336
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,920
Trust me, it works.

337
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,679
So if she says, will you fall in love
with someone else,

338
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,519
how do you answer?

339
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,230
Nonsense, of course 'I won't'.

340
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,589
It's weird.

341
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,829
This worked well before.

342
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,949
Forget it.

343
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,709
In short, the devil lies in the details.

344
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,469
Talking is one aspect.

345
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,399
On the other hand,
You must figure out what's on her mind.

346
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,470
Always put yourself in others' shoes.

347
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,429
As for this notebook,
I'll lend you for a while.

348
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,710
Learn from it.

349
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,680
By the way.

350
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,759
One more thing.

351
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,429
You must figure out what's on her mind.

352
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,349
This is how you make the most
accurate judgments Let's say,

353
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,349
when she is alone,
you should care more.

354
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,590
If she gets annoyed,
just zip your mouth.

355
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,709
You must figure out what's on her mind.

356
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,880
Always put yourself in others' shoes.

357
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,679
Is there a way to achieve the
purpose of fundraising

358
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,680
and the awareness of the public
to wild birds' protection?

359
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,310
Don't say I can't.

360
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,000
Say 'I'm willing to learn'.

361
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,759
Don't say I don't want it.

362
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,800
Say...

363
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,230
'do you want it?'

364
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,559
Your skin is a pen.

365
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,679
Don't say I'll try.

366
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,830
Say 'I'll try my best'.

367
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,350
Just want the feeling of being alone?

368
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,879
Did you finish eating? Are your hands okay?

369
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,590
It's fine. How about you?

370
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,349
Chatting with Mr. Li?

371
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,760
Not really.

372
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,349
Never say a man is not okay.

373
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,559
But you said you had an appointment.

374
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,399
Let's go to the snack bar at the front gate.

375
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,160
Go!

376
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,040
Can you eat with one hand?

377
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,350
Oh no, his self-esteem got hurt in public.

378
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,429
Your left hand is injured, right?

379
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,679
Is he proving himself?

380
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,590
You don't have to.

381
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,699
He got strong self-esteem.

382
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,880
He is trying so hard.

383
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,949
Oh no, he must be angry.

384
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,070
Is your hand okay now?

385
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,710
You...

386
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,760
You also mopped the floor.

387
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,160
He is so angry, isn't he?

388
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,830
If nothing else,

389
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,190
I'm going to take out the trash first.

390
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,470
Don't.

391
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,400
Your hand.

392
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,309
I know you want to prove yourself.

393
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,679
But your hand is injured.

394
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,679
Take it easy, okay?

395
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,310
I'll help you.

396
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,309
Never get mad at a smiling girl.

397
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,639
Since I help you take out the garbage,

398
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,000
it's time for you to smile.

399
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,800
Prove myself?

400
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,160
Take it easy?

401
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,800
Did she find it out?

402
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,039
Zhuang Yu!

403
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,430
Are you all right, Zhuang Yu?

404
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,520
Help!

405
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,830
Canned tomato?

406
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,759
It's okay.

407
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,399
This canned tomato protected you.

408
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,679
So your arm is not badly injured.

409
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,109
Although the wound is not severe,
for safety reasons,

410
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,710
you need to be cautious.

411
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,399
I don't think I need to wear this.

412
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,999
It's a superficial injury.

413
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,679
But it shouldn't be ignored.

414
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,919
This wound is a little big and deep.

415
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,069
If it becomes infected,
the consequences are quite serious.

416
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,310
I'll prescribe you a tetanus shot.

417
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,799
Don't forget that before you leave.

418
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,109
Also, you have a slight dislocation,
so when you go back,

419
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,589
don't exercise strenuously.

420
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,639
Thank you.

421
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,159
And your head.

422
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,309
It's just a scratch on the ground.

423
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,350
It's not a big deal.

424
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,039
I have a suggestion for you.

425
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,799
Go back for a more thorough examination,

426
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,680
to exclude the concussion.

427
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,350
Yes.

428
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,830
Give him a wheelchair.

429
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,639
Zhuang Yu's family.

430
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,709
Doctor, how is he?

431
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,159
The condition of our county hospital is limited.

432
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,040
We can only do some simple
emergency treatment.

433
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,919
We recommend that you transfer him
to a major hospital

434
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,110
for a more thorough examination.

435
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,759
You are Zhuang Yu's wife?

436
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,310
We're not married.

437
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,430
No.

438
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,190
I see.

439
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,760
Let me tell you about the treatment
of the wound.

440
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,760
Remember to change the dressings
per three days.

441
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,680
Open the door.

442
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
Open the door.

443
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,710
Zhuang Yu?

444
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,429
I... I was trying to take...

445
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,000
I know.

446
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,679
But in this way.

447
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,520
It seems to prove yourself,

448
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,880
but you are the one to suffer.

449
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,679
It is useless to do such superficial work.

450
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,560
You can't fake the real thing.

451
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,430
How did you get in?

452
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,349
I heard a big sound at the door.

453
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,830
I was afraid that something happened
so I came in.

454
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,470
You didn't change your password.

455
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,640
Do you mind?

456
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm afraid you...

457
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,950
seeing what you shouldn't see.

458
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,229
This is?

459
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,999
I saw your wounded hand,

460
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,470
so I went to the drugstore to buy...

461
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,310
My hand is fine.

462
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,229
I know even if you don't tell me.

463
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,000
I just saw it all.

464
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,429
The bandage got loose
when you were eating, right?

465
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,590
Is it embarrassing to bother others?

466
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,069
You are usually used to independence.

467
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,109
Embarrassing may not be accurate.

468
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,190
I think you're not used to troubling others,
right?

469
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,070
Yes.

470
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,679
I knew it.

471
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,799
You can't even take a can.

472
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,679
It's okay, you don't have to force yourself.

473
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,709
You can ask for help.

474
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,349
I just went to the pharmacy
and bought what you need.

475
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,039
I want to get you re-bandaged.

476
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,400
The knot,
you tied it by yourself, right?

477
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,469
What's wrong?

478
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,830
It's not appropriate.

479
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,800
Sorry.

480
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,309
I got it.

481
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,230
Well,

482
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,950
that's not what I meant.

483
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,109
Oh my god, I forgot to wash my hands.

484
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,710
How can I bandage you without
washing my hands?

485
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,800
Don't move. Just sit. I know where it is.

486
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,950
What's on your mind?

487
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,109
Now you want to give it to me?

488
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,349
What are you talking about?

489
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,830
It was originally written for you.

490
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,280
So, you've forgiven me completely?

491
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,799
If you keep doing this,
I won't give it to you.

492
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,709
Of course not. I have proof now.

493
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,950
You can't get away.

494
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,950
Naive.

495
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,759
It's just a pity there's only one chance.

496
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,560
I swear I won't dare to do it again.

497
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,950
I'm okay with that.

498
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,829
What's wrong? Why are you still sullen?

499
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,590
How about this?

500
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:14,070
You can beat me up and scold me,
for you to get happy.

501
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,640
No, I'm not.

502
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,469
I just think it's a pity.

503
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,680
For what?

504
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,160
For the time we spent apart.

505
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,279
All we need is to talk,
to explain what happened.

506
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,680
But our relationship has drifted apart.

507
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,070
It's my fault.

508
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,429
You are even not trying to say no.

509
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,559
It is your fault.

510
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,190
You lied to me all the time.

511
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,920
Sometimes I have to lie.

512
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Okay.

513
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,679
It's almost time for me to go back to sleep.

514
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,189
In broad daylight?

515
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,189
Are you a child?

516
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,950
Could it be a fear of pain?

517
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,040
No.

518
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,520
What are you doing?

519
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,880
Don't be afraid.

520
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,229
I won't hurt you.

521
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,640
What are you talking about?

522
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,430
I didn't hurt you, did I?

523
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,949
You mean here?

524
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,520
What else do you think?

525
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,230
Let's change the dressings.

526
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,190
OK.

527
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,429
What are you doing?

528
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,470
Of course, I need to undress.

529
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,389
You don't know?

530
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,710
I know.

531
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,870
Or...

532
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,150
You want to help me with that?

533
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,630
Change it yourself.

534
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,189
Look at you.

535
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,999
I can't see any repentance.

536
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,150
How can you gloss over your lies?

537
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,630
I'm not glossing over anything.

538
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,389
It's just...

539
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,709
There is no good timing to tell the truth.

540
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,079
If I tell the truth,
it'll make people sad,

541
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,470
or make people brokenhearted.

542
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,149
I'm not afraid.

543
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,709
I used to watch TV series.

544
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,359
There is usually one plot that

545
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,519
the hero has a terminal illness
and doesn't want to tell the heroine,

546
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,599
so he can only break up with her.

547
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,119
When I saw it and I
thought it's not good at all.

548
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,229
Why?

549
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,229
Don't you think it's sad?

550
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,669
Don't you think it's silly?

551
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,039
The male lead is alone, sad, and vomiting blood.

552
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,320
I think it is completely bull...

553
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,150
Watch your language.

554
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,950
Anyway, he is asking for it.

555
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,909
Since it's true love,
why can't these two people

556
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,800
talk to each other honestly?

557
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,469
Even if she chooses to leave you,
there is no regret.

558
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,319
You vomit blood over there,
and she knows nothing about it.

559
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,039
Nobody is happy. Both of them get hurt.

560
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,800
Isn't it funny to see things like this?

561
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,429
It seems you have a lot of opinions
about TV series.

562
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,629
I have an opinion about you.

563
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,869
Why do you talk about TV series?

564
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,189
So...

565
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,759
Although you have an opinion about me,

566
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,189
you still...

567
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,119
Don't flatter yourself.

568
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,000
If you keep doing this...

569
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,520
I promise you.

570
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,760
I will change what you want me to change.

571
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,280
I will try my best to meet all your requests.

572
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,950
I promise not to lie in the future.

573
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,149
I won't hide anything from you.

574
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,320
And,

575
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,560
tell me everything you want to do.

576
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,230
Good.

577
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,600
I'm going to kiss you.

578
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,799
What?

579
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,519
Didn't you say I need to tell
you everything I want to do?

580
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,360
♫ I didn't even notice
the rain soaked half of me ♫

581
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,430
I'm going to kiss you.

582
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,799
♫ Time is also very slow ♫

583
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,240
♫ The sunlight shed a circle of light ♫

584
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,399
♫ I ran hard towards you ♫

585
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,079
♫ Lift my head and breathe hard ♫

586
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,839
♫ I won't hesitate even if it's a big storm ♫

587
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,799
♫ The wind quietly blows under the sky
after the rain ♫

588
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,559
♫ You stand in the wind
and look at the rainbow ♫

589
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,319
♫ The whole view in my eyes ♫

590
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,080
♫ How I wish the picture could be frozen ♫

591
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,600
Phonism.

592
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,839
What's on your mind?

593
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Nothing.

594
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,190
It's still not tied properly.

595
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,320
Unfortunately, it can't be tied
like the Fisherman's knot.

596
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,280
I don't know if you will like it.

597
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,430
Well...

598
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,470
I can learn.

599
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,360
As long as you like it.

600
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,840
So, I need to go.

601
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,909
What's wrong?

602
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,950
Well...

603
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,759
The table is a bit dirty.

604
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,519
Can you wipe it for me?

605
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,149
What is he doing? He pretended
he was fine just now.

606
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,279
Now he is ordering about me.

607
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,800
The table is very clean.

608
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,759
Well... a little dirty
under the table.

609
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,359
I see. He did it on purpose.

610
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,839
Retaliation for me saying he is not okay.

611
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,360
So petty.

612
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,429
Sorry.

613
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,119
I'm really busy today.

614
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,360
I'll come back tomorrow to help you clean it.

615
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,910
Where did the wind come from?

616
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,910
You also know how to draw birds.

617
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,710
Not many paintings.

618
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,759
Can you license these to me?

619
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,389
What do you need this for?

620
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,389
I've been thinking about it
since I got back from Baiyuan.

621
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,709
What is the best way to improve

622
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,469
both public awareness of and interest
in wild bird conservation,

623
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,080
and to raise some money for the conservancy？

624
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,909
These days I also contacted
some previous resources

625
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,039
to get cooperation to raise some money.

626
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,869
But no one paid attention to me.

627
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,150
I'm worried about it.

628
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,599
With this,
I'll be able to do some accessories.

629
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,429
I can make calendars, handbooks,

630
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,079
environmental bags, hats and hoodies.

631
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,599
Earnings in addition to costs

632
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,599
can be donated directly to the conservancy.

633
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,429
In fact, some people asked me before,

634
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,869
but I was concerned about licensing issues.

635
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,469
Lv Jian?

636
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,190
This is what you talked about
at lunch with Lv Jian?

637
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,229
Here you are. Don't get the sample dirty.

638
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,950
Thanks, but I'm wearing a mask.

639
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,229
Okay, just go back. You got a cold.

640
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,189
Don't push yourself.

641
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:54,840
No.

642
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:55,839
Why?

643
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Are you afraid that we will steal the fruits
of your labor?

644
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,799
We know that this lab project
is important to you.

645
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,119
That's why you need to take care of yourself.

646
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,119
It's been more than a year.
You still know nothing about it.

647
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,119
Yes, you know everything.

648
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,189
But when the gel electrophoresis goes wrong...

649
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,119
- What?
- Enough.

650
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,229
Ni Ke is right.

651
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,389
Alxa League is not like here.

652
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,999
You have to take good care of yourself.

653
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,079
I know you want to go to the northwest
to see the Elaeagnus Angustifolia.

654
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
That's to prove to your parents.

655
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,630
And I just want to stay in Shanghai,

656
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,800
to prove it to others.

657
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,710
It seems no one is asking you this question, right?

658
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,119
Young people shouldn't be too presumptuous.

659
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,229
If I go, you won't have a chance.

660
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,360
I don't think you can compete with me.

661
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,229
Qi, listen to that tone.

662
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,799
He brags about it all the time.

663
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,999
It's good for young people to have ambitions.

664
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,759
Whose side are you on?

665
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,670
Why do you fuss about a kid?

666
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,600
You've changed.

667
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,189
All right, cut the crap.

668
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,520
I've finished writing it all for you.

669
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,869
Fine.

670
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,000
You are forgiven.

671
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,910
It's done. You can have it.

672
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,799
Where are you going?

673
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,359
Bob-friendly zone.

674
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,520
What does it mean?

675
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,080
What does it mean?

676
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,669
No.

677
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,039
I had dinner with Lv for nothing.

678
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,870
It was just a casual lunch and chat.

679
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,600
We didn't talk about the conservation area.

680
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,999
Did you talk about other important things?

681
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,280
Maybe... I think so.

682
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,150
What was it?

683
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,519
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

684
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,879

A good choice for you.

688
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,279
Aluminum scissors(homophonic as Lv Jian),
solve all problems,

689
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,150
no limitations.
