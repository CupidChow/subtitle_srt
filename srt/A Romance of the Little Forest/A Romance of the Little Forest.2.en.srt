00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,640
but a yellow-footed silver gull.

377
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,290
- It's a Mongolian subspecies.
- Interesting.

378
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,920
If it were a silver gull, it would have

379
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,990
vertical stripes on the head now.

380
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,560
This one doesn't.

381
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,280
Awesome.

382
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,839
Natural science is so interesting.

383
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,000
He deserves the title of a God.

384
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,199
He's really amazing.

385
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:25,079
G, what's this? Please answer me.

386
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,479
G, please accept my knee.

387
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,119
Watching God answer questions online.

388
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,079
How could Lami find a pretender to endorse?

389
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,640
Good morning, Professor Zhuang.

390
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,760
God Zhuang, good morning.

391
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,160
Have you had breakfast?

392
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,560
This is the office,

393
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,239
not your place to mess around.

394
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,040
I'm not fooling around.

395
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,079
I really have something to tell you today.

396
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,640
You're affecting other people now.

397
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,599
It doesn't matter.

398
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,040
Miss Yu has already told us.

399
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,280
You two take your time.

400
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,439
Zhuang, it doesn't matter.

401
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,719
You guys take your time to talk.

402
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,760
It's okay.

403
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,119
Take your time.

404
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,160
Did you hear that?

405
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,439
Get out of the way.

406
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,599
Yu,

407
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,280
thank you.

408
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,920
I watch every issue of your makeup tips vlogs,

409
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,119
they are really useful.

410
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,359
Professor Zhuang keeps it so deeply hidden.

411
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,599
Professor Zhou,

412
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,359
your cousin

413
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,880
can be introduced to Director Li.

414
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
No.

415
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,239
They have a great age gap.

416
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,719
Ms. Wu,

417
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,479
Professor Zhuang and I

418
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:55,119
do not have the kind of relationship you think.

419
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:02,680
He doesn't seem to like me.

420
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,640
Young people, take your time.

421
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,239
Mr. Zhuang,

422
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,160
you shouldn't be so mean to the girl.

423
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,479
If you scare her away,

424
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:13,719
you're so stupid.

425
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,280
Mr. …

426
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,319
Professor Zhuang, wait for me.

427
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,880
Wait for me.

428
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,680
I really have something to say.

429
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:39,239
Lami is a first-line skin care product brand,

430
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:41,400
and its products are known for high-end quality.

431
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,760
Recently, they set

432
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,239
a plant extract skin care product line,

433
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:45,800
which needs an expert consultant.

434
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,239
Professor Zhuang, are you interested?

435
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,479
No.

436
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,319
Artemisinin biosynthesis is based on

437
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,880
the fifteen-carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate.

438
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,680
It is the linear precursor of sesquiterpenes,

439
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,800
including artemisinin,

440
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,560
and the conversion of farnesene pyrophosphate

441
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,199
to artemisinin requires four special enzymes.

442
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,000
Current artemisinin diene synthase…

443
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,359
This composition.

444
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,079
This way.

445
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,880
It looks better.

446
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,800
- It's true.
- These four key genes…

447
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,280
Thank you.

448
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,760
Are you also from Professor Zhuang's
Plant Exchange Group?

449
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Plant Exchange Group?

450
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,000
It's the WeChat group to discuss

451
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Professor Zhuang and his plants.

452
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
Do you want me to add you into the group?

453
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,000
Okay.

454
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,680
The initiation of the four key genes only needs…

455
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,920
Do you all have Prof. Zhuang's WeChat?

456
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,520
Not to mention WeChat,

457
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,839
even Professor Zhuang's birthday,

458
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,920
and his horoscope

459
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,160
all remain mysterious.

460
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,800
According to unofficial statistics,

461
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,920
there were 57 girls in the school

462
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,359
who asked him for WeChat.

463
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,719
But they were all rejected.

464
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,719
57?

465
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,000
I don't mind being the 58th.

466
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,599
Are you an academic fan of Professor Zhuang,

467
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,680
or his fan of his face?

468
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:33,280
I am his CP fan.

469
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,920
CP fan?

470
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,319
I'm a fan of our couple.

471
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,959
You and him…

472
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,359
I know.

473
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,760
Awesome.

474
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,359
Did anyone say that

475
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,599
you look like a blogger?

476
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,439
That Mermaid with long legs.

477
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,239
Yes.

478
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,079
She's more beautiful than me.

479
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,520
Really?

480
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,439
It doesn't matter.

481
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:03,000
I will invite you into the group first.

482
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,280
The group will update

483
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,959
Professor Zhuang's schedule regularly.

484
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,520
There are also irregular benefits.

485
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,079
Come in.

486
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,319
Thank you.

487
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,160
You're welcome.

488
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,479
CP fan.

489
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,760
Go!

490
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:17,760
Go!

491
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,839
I'll work on it.

492
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Professor Zhuang.

493
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,640
I have small steamed buns.

494
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,920
Come here.

495
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,160
Professor Zhuang, no more seat available.

496
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,880
There are only available seats in front of me.

497
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,839
Professor Zhuang, come over here.

498
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
♫ An impossible dream ♫

499
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,200
♫ Some people laugh at my sleepy eyes ♫

500
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
♫ There are countless possibilities to let go ♫

501
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,700
♫ I prefer to chase the wind ♫

502
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,700
♫ I have not stopped to look for it ♫

503
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,700
♫ In the vast forest ♫

504
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,800
♫ I buried all the fears in my heart ♫

505
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,800
♫ In the endless desert ♫

506
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,400
♫ Just let me find you ♫

507
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
♫ In the fog ♫

508
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,500
♫ we rush to open every door ♫

509
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,500
♫ Just to find you ♫

510
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,500
♫ Finally the light falls through the clouds ♫

511
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,500
♫ between you and me ♫

512
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
♫ Find you ♫

513
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,500
♫ My dream ♫

514
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,500
♫ Find you ♫

515
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,599
Okay, look,

516
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,280
isn't this way more chic?

517
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,319
It's really good.

518
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,880
You're really professional.

519
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,040
Yu,

520
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,400
as the saying goes,

521
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,800
it's hard for men to chase women,

522
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,000
but easy for women to chase men.

523
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,119
You're beautiful,

524
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,319
and have a successful career.

525
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:53,760
I believe in you.

526
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,079
I don't think so.

527
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,479
Impossible.

528
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,630
I have no interest in business activities.

529
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,679
Which of these words do you not understand?

530
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,879
It's okay.

531
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,679
Well, Zhuang,

532
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,719
agree to Miss Yu this time.

533
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,119
Thanks to her help,

534
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,879
Lami agreed to sponsor our lab.

535
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,959
Shall we talk about it at the dinner table?

536
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,280
Okay, that's it.

537
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,800
Go. Talk about it at the dinner table.

538
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,120
Get up.

539
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,280
Let's go, Miss Yu.

540
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,000
Go. Let's go.

541
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,399
Thank you.

542
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,080
Miss Yu,

543
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,719
thanks to your recommendation,

544
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,120
which led to the branded cooperation of our lab.

545
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,000
Now we'll get the equipment.

546
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,280
I toast you both.

547
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,439
Thank you Director Li, you are so kind.

548
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,520
Just call me Yu.

549
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,320
Yu.

550
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:15,399
Actually I didn't do much.

551
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,679
Mainly because Professor Zhuang is so amazing.

552
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,520
He just used a few minutes of the video

553
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,080
turned the shooting accident

554
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,639
into a stepping stone for brand cooperation.

555
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm just a matchmaker.

556
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,280
Please put a few good words

557
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,080
for me in front of him

558
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,000
to promote the follow-up cooperation.

559
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,159
I promise you for him.

560
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:34,760
Don't worry,

561
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,719
I'll take him to the brand launch.

562
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,679
Okay.

563
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,840
Speaking of it,

564
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,199
it's actually my fault

565
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,520
for not telling him in advance that the school

566
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,439
would be rent for the shooting,

567
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,280
which caused unnecessary trouble.

568
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,520
Has it had any bad influence on Miss Yu?

569
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,360
No influence.

570
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,399
I still think there are too many jobs to take.

571
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:08,120
Just lost a job opportunity.

572
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,800
I don't care about that.

573
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Besides,

574
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,679
I've already made it clear

575
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,639
in what Professor Zhuang and I

576
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,199
had to say that night, right?

577
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:26,879
That night?

578
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,159
I don't remember

579
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,360
Miss Yu saying that.

580
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,679
Professor Zhuang,

581
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,600
you have a really bad memory.

582
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,479
You are my prey.

583
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,280
I found it.

584
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,800
You are my prey now.

585
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:53,360
Don't remember this?

586
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,639
Is the snake venom in your brain

587
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,159
causing your memory loss?

588
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,239
You…

589
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,560
Well, Zhuang is free recently.

590
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,360
Don't worry,

591
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,520
we'll fully cooperate with the later activities.

592
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,120
Consider it as sacrifice for science.

593
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,080
Free?

594
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm just talking nonsense.

595
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,239
Not be free, but...

596
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,719
taking time out of his busy schedule.

597
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:27,439
Then it's settled.

598
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,320
OK, that's it.

599
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,159
Let's eat.

600
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,120
Here, Li,

601
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,120
eat more meat.

602
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,159
Yu, how do you leave?

603
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,199
I'll go with Professor Zhuang.

604
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,000
We live in the same neighborhood.

605
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,399
Me and her…

606
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,550
You live in the same neighborhood?

607
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,919
Yes.

608
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,439
Maybe it's a special destiny.

609
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,600
By the way, Director Li,

610
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,879
is it convenient to add your WeChat?

611
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,290
If I have any questions in the future,

612
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,120
I can ask you directly.

613
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
I just forgot it.

614
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,239
You have a good memory.

615
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,639
Professor Zhuang,

616
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,840
is it okay to add your Wechat?

617
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
It seems that adding his WeChat

618
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,120
is not that difficult.

619
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,399
OK. Then I'll go first.

620
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:46,320
You two be careful on your way.

621
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,199
Don't worry, Director Li,

622
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,360
I will definitely send him home safely.

623
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,800
Okay, bye.

624
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,000
Let's go.

625
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,159
Let's go.

626
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,000
Why are you walking so fast?

627
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,840
My shoes are hard to walk by.

628
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,280
Can you show some pity on a pretty girl?

629
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:09,479
Does a pretty girl have anything to do with you?

630
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:12,199
Tolerate for a moment to get peace.

631
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,439
After all,

632
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:15,199
we've been together for one night.

633
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,280
You know that

634
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,560
whether I'm pretty or not.

635
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,679
About the brand cooperation,

636
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,239
Li can't make decision for me.

637
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,639
What do you mean?

638
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,320
If you talk about other relationships,

639
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,800
then don't talk about work.

640
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,360
Okay, partnership.

641
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,199
Partnership.

642
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,919
Don't worry,

643
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,360
I won't mention that night anymore.

644
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,719
Then Professor Zhuang,

645
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,600
can you pass my friend request?

646
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,560
After all, we are partners from now on.

647
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,520
I do not distrust you, I'm afraid that

648
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,399
you're too busy to remember that.

649
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,239
After all, our country's development of science

650
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:50,040
still needs your contribution.

651
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,159
I won't bother you with this trivial matter.

652
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
How come you don't set message alerts on WeChat?

653
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:05,639
Save time and avoid ineffective communication.

654
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:09,639
You really cherish time.

655
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,439
If it were me,

656
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,600
it would be more time consuming.

657
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,479
Because I will keep checking

658
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,360
if you're sending messages to me.

659
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,080
Don't check. I won't send any message to you.

660
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,040
Adding his WeChat

661
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,199
is also the first step to success.

662
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,399
Wait for me.

663
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,080
[Zhuang Yu]

664
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,840
He's really a caveman.

665
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,600
No useful information at all.

666
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,080
My birds are delightful.

667
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,710
[GreenSeeker followed you]

668
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,630
It is indeed a yellow-footed silver gull.

669
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,639
Thanks for the correction.

670
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,760
Zhuang Yu, what's wrong with you?

671
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,080
It's so difficult to add your WeChat.

672
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,280
But you actively followed my Weibo.

673
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,520
He's really weird.

674
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,080
Only smart people can be your friends.

675
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,080
When you fall in love with me,

676
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,959
I will let you know that

677
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:34,919
how to write the word brain gutter.

the best in the art of face changing.

684
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,840
Under the feet of the snake vulture

685
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,959
is a black mamba.

686
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:22,959
At this moment,

687
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,639
it is constantly stepping

688
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,959
on the black mamba's body,

689
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,560

00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,040
