[Episode 22]
[Let the doomsday come as soon as possible]

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,878
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,400
To discuss the work with you.

26
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,319
Do you want to go out?

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,278
I... I don't. Come in.

28
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,760
Discuss. Let's discuss.

29
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,879
Why is that here?

30
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,559
The wheelchair. Isn't that Linda's?

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,040
Well,

32
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,399
Linda's recovered.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,799
And the self-driving wheelchair was kind of fun.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,880
So I kept it to play.

35
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,159
What did you just drop?

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,439
Nothing.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,000
Why are you here so early?

38
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,599
It's a nice day today.

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,918
So?

40
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,879
It's suitable for a fresh start.

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,638
See? Told you so.

42
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,239
You like the present I gave you, right?

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,440
Isn't it a good laminator?

44
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,759
I was wrong.

45
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,919
I was always muddling along at work.

46
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,839
You've realized that.

47
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,758
Keep going.

48
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,638
I've figured out that I need to start a new life.

49
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,359
I need to concentrate on my work.

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,679
In the future, I will devote myself to my work.

51
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,159
Living a new life is too exaggerated.

52
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,239
At least you're

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,519
the best fashion blogger on bird photography,

54
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,038
and the best makeup artist
among all the Doctors of Ornithology.

55
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,959
I've figured it out.

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,758
Those definitions are just my excuse to be lazy.

57
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,918
It would be meaningful if I were
the best makeup artist among all fashion bloggers,

58
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,879
and the best Doctor of Ornithology
on bird photography.

59
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,160
That makes sense.

60
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,320
No, don't...

61
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:11,398
So, if there's any work,

62
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,918
just throw at me as much as possible.

63
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,679
I have enough time.

64
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,880
Meiren, if you have time,

65
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,439
I suggest you go out and relax.

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,558
I don't have to.

67
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,398
You can't even handle yourself right now.

68
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,919
How could you do a good job?

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,439
What everybody likes
is your real charm.

70
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,919
Not you with a fake smile.

71
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:34,918
All right, I'm too embarrassed to keep saying that.

72
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,519
Anyway, listen to me.

73
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,879
You need to adjust yourself first.

74
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,160
I'll handle the work.

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,439
Go home and get some sleep.

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,838
Look at the dark circles under your eyes.

77
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,000
The concealer can't conceal them.

78
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,278
All right.

79
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,639
I'll listen to you.

80
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,678
I'm leaving.

81
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,440
It's raining. I'll ask Fang to drive you home.

82
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,159
Here's an umbrella.

83
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,478
No, that's... that's not an umbrella.

84
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,759
Not an umbrella?

85
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,198
It's an umbrella.

86
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,919
Well... remember to give it back after using it.

87
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,078
Finally I decided to start with the umbrella

88
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,759
and tell Tiantian everything.

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,399
Then it's interrupted again.

90
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,599
Jin Xi.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,760
You deserve to be loveless and die alone.

92
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,358
You numb yourself with white lies.

93
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,480
With the excuses of interruption, no chance,
and waiting longer,

94
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,078
I finally made myself a total coward.

95
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,040
It isn't love.

96
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,160
Your so-called love is just an endless deception.

97
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,759
This time, no matter how it turns out,

98
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,119
you have to make it clear.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,399
Why are you here so early?

100
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,320
What happened?

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,839
Well.

102
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,919
Let me explain to you about that.

103
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,479
I... I didn't mean to...

104
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,199
Wasn't it you who deleted the Moments?

105
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,199
If you didn't mean it, was that an accident?

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,479
The Moments?

107
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,920
What are you doing? Pretending amnesia?

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,640
You mean the photos in the Moments?

109
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,958
Why did you delete the photo secretly?

110
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,518
I didn't delete that.

111
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,440
I set them visible only to myself.

112
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,479
Listen to me.

113
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,519
I just thought that

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,719
since we'll make an official announcement,

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,678
don't do anything vague.

116
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,239
Let's announce it frankly.

117
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,880
What do you mean?

118
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,479
I want to take a clear front photo of us.

119
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,679
I want the whole world to
know my girlfriend is Li Tiantian.

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,040
Really?

121
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,239
Well, I forgive you.

122
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,838
Tiantian, there's something else I want to tell you.

123
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,040
Say it.

124
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,399
Please give me a cup of coffee first.

125
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,719
Isn't this Tiantian's umbrella?

126
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
Why is it in Jin Xi's office?

127
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,480
Then others won't take Tiantian's umbrella by mistake.

128
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,599
The characters you carved are not like Tian.

129
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,078
It seems bitter.

130
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,838
I was in town to get my hearing aid fixed.

131
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,439
But I didn't expect that while it remained unfixed,

132
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,958
my umbrella got broken.

133
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,959
Luckily I threw my umbrella to a man without one.

134
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,039
You've changed your mind.

135
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,719
Isn't the man who doesn't take an umbrella
the most handsome on a rainy day?

136
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,958
I don't quite recognize the name of the company.

137
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,118
The name contains Xing and something else.

138
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:48,599
It can't be the Xingfu.

139
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,558
Maybe.

140
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,398
Xingfu is our company's enemy.

141
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,238
But when did their boss become disabled?

142
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,278
The wheelchair.

143
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,639
Isn't that Linda's?

144
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,159
Linda's recovered.

145
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,558
And the self-driving wheelchair was kind of fun.

146
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,799
So I kept it to play.

147
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,880
Jin Xi, you bad man!

148
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,959
This... Isn't this my hearing aid?

149
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,919
Yes.

150
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,880
That's what I want to tell you.

151
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,359
It had been lost before I sold the grapes.

152
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,520
Why do you have it?

153
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
Actually, we met a long time ago.

154
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,400
Before I met you,

155
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,400
I always thought love at first sight was a joke.

156
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,200
Then I finally realized that

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,080
actually I was the joke.

158
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:04,840
Thank God.

159
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,159
I could see the videos of you selling grapes
after we had passed by.

160
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,080
When I placed the order,

161
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,478
I thought to myself

162
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:22,679
I must find a way to keep you by my side.

163
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,719
So you ordered the grapes on purpose.

164
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:35,439
I wanted to get familiar with you
through the cooperation.

165
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,678
But you told me your production wasn't enough.

166
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,038
And we might not be able to cooperate in the future.

167
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,959
I was afraid I'd never see you again, so...

168
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,159
You lied that
there were problems with the grapes' quality.

169
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,999
Slandered me and Qingshui Village.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,718
I definitely haven't slandered anyone.

171
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:53,199
I never underpaid a cent of the money I was due.

172
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,798
I never told others

173
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,598
anything bad about Qingshui Village's grapes.

174
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,640
Mr. Jin.

175
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,798
You've got so many tricks.

176
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,399
Lies come when you open your mouth.

177
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,559
Tiantian.

178
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,199
I just want to keep you by my side.

179
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,080
What else have you ever lied to me?

180
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,839
Jin Xi.

181
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,478
I want to keep you.

182
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,519
My legs were injured indeed.

183
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,599
But it hasn't relapsed for a long time.

184
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,200
I didn't mean...

185
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,359
I didn't mean to lie to you.

186
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,840
Right.

187
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
You didn't mean it.

188
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,080
I was mistaken.

189
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:24,799
I thought someone like
you would have real feelings.

190
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,799
I was self-indulgent.

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,558
It turns out I'm just a rich man's entertainment
against daily boredom.

192
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,839
Delicacies would make you tired.

193
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,158
And you need to taste country-style cuisine like me

194
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,478
as an adjustment.

195
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,679
Tiantian, you can't...

196
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,239
Jin Xi.

197
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,679
I don't want to see you.

198
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,280
It's disgusting.

199
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,660
♫ The stars hide from the moonlight ♫

200
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,299

205

Are you okay, Tiantian?

206
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,640
- Don't touch me!
- I'll take you to the hospital, Tiantian.

207
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,119
Come on, go with me.

208
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,440
I told you not to touch me!

209
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,679
Here I am, Tiantian.

210
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,319
Are you okay? Let's go.

211
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,039
Let me explain.

212
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,158
Get away.

213
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,478
Tiantian, listen to me.

214
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,479
Tiantian.

215
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,880
Do you remember that,
this umbrella, you give it to me here?

216
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,140
♫ Telling myself it doesn't matter if it hurts ♫

217
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,459

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,099

227
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,719
If the punishment of thunder is real,

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,519
through such heavy rain,

229
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,880
the population of the world could be reduced by half.

230
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,639
Don't be so pessimistic.

231
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,918
There are many good men in the world.

232
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,320
I think it'll be reduced
by a third at most.

233
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,959
Drink this now.

234
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,519
Do you dare to get wet
in such heavy rain in the future?

235
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,599
Be careful, it's hot.

236
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,119
I finally know that

237
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,519
watching TV is no use at all.

238
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,559
I watched so many years of TV dramas.

239
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Only to make myself a naive girl.

240
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,279
Why do you say that about yourself?

241
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,400
He's the ridiculous one.

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,599
But as I just saw him,

243
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,798
I think he should be sincere about you.

244
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,999
I know Jin Xi well.

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,798
He is always self-righteous.

246
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,678
But he's poor at acting.

247
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,400
His miserable appearance just now

248
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,679
was something he couldn't pretend.

249
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,399
I'm really sorry, Tiantian.

250
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,279
I didn't mean to lie to you.

251
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,520
My feelings for you are all real.

252
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,238
Is it convenient to answer my call when you get home?

253
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,759
Give me one more chance to explain.

254
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,079
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

255
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,479
I was wrong.

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,879
It's windy today and you got caught in the rain.

257
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,558
Be sure to keep warm when you got home.

258
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,280
Dry your hair and drink hot water.

259
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,359
Mr. Jin, let's go back.

260
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,399
Mr. Jin, the rain is too heavy.

261
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,239
Let's wait inside the car.

262
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
However heavy the rain is,

263
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,640
it will stop sometime.

264
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,020
[The most handsome guy in my heart]

265
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,439
Magic.

266
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,599
And even if there are other guys,
I'm not afraid.

267
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,180
[Put into the blacklist]

268
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,740
[The most handsome guy in the world]

269
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,478
[Put into the blacklist]

270
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:00,400
Sorry, the number you dialed is on the line.

271
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,920
Even if he really hurts, so what?

272
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,639
At the very beginning,

273
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
he built our love over deception and calculation.

274
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,680
How true can it be?

275
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,919
From the beginning,

276
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,238
he took advantage of my compassion and guilt.

277
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:32,640
It's not a white lie.

278
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,919
He just judged its purpose from his perspective.

279
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,880
While one side considers it a white lie,

280
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,520
the other side doesn't.

281
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,799
You'd better take him out of the blacklist tomorrow.

282
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,559
He's your boss, after all.

283
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,280
Just don't mention me in front of him.

284
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,238
How much is left unpaid

285
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,439
for the so-called debt you just mentioned?

286
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,318
He was the first to lie about the grapes.

287
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,239
I don't think you need to pay the rest.

288
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,800
It's more than ten thousand.

289
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,759
Though he lied about the grapes,

290
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,680
I don't want to owe him a cent for the debt I accepted.

291
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,199
Well, you don't owe him anything now.
[12,000 yuan transferred]

Resignation report. What are you doing?

293
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,639
The one Tiantian hates so much.

294
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,919
I don't want to work with him anymore.

295
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,279
Don't quit your job for me.

296
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,238
Rest assured, my saving is enough

297
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,160
for us to get through the winter.

298
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,760
You finally paid off the wedding dress debt.

299
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,279
You're already not well off.

300
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,800
Why did you do this?

301
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,719
Let the doomsday come as soon as possible.

302
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,279
A man can be destroyed
but not defeated.

303
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,519
So are the seeds.

304
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,039
Vernalization is a programmed
physiological process

305
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,679
in which the prolonged cold exposure

306
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,880
provides competence to flower in plants.

307
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,879
If we can take advantage of this period,

308
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,599
things could be different.

309
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,880

00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:21,160
Hopefully, Hemingway and you are both right.

I wanna ask you, do you have any plans
for the weekend?

They have this Corn Poppies Exhibition this week.

314
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,159
Be careful.

315
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,959
The rocks are slippery.

316
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,359
Professor Zhuang, guess what my English name is.

317

318
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:51,560
Well, you can't guess it.

319
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:57,119
My English name is Corn Poppy.

320
00:19:58,959 --> 00:19:59,959
How's that?

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,958
Pretty simple.

322
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,800
Don't you think it's a great name?

323
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,400
It sounds harmonious and charming.

324
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,198
How about it? It's just like me, right?

325
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,760
Or maybe,

326
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,079
you can call me Corn in the future.

327
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,920

For the convenience of the passenger behind you,

363
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,399
during the meal service.

364
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,799
please return your seat back...

365
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,799
Your water.

366
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,159
Thanks.

367
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,759
Ladies and gentlemen,

368
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,039
We will be serving you meals
with tea, coffee, and other soft drinks.

369
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,039
We'll help to make your choice.

370
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,719
please put down the table in front of you.

371
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,478
For the convenience of the passenger behind you,

372
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:15,920
please return your seat back to the upright position
during the meal service.

373
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,879
Who is it?

374
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,160
I don't know. Never mind.

375
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:45,438
What's happening? He's blacklisted.

376
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:48,718
It's either house selling or loan promoting.

377
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,639
We don't need to pick it up.

378
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,438
Pick up, it's the weekend.

379
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,680
Working overtime is not easy.

380
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,839
This is the chance to encourage overtime workers.

381
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:14,839
Hello?

382
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,599
All right, I... I'm coming right now.

383
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,519
How could that be?

384
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,238
I called grandma the other day.

385
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,078
She's fine then.

386
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,199
Why did she suddenly faint?

387
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:35,958
My fault. I shouldn't have sold the grapes online.

388
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:38,680
If I were by her side,
It wouldn't have happened.

389
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,999
How can you blame yourself?

390
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,198
You sold grapes to give
your grandma a better life.

391
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,958
And there are many reasons why senior people faint.

392
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,279
The examination result hasn't come out yet.

393
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,599
Don't scare yourself.

394
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,958
Let me know as soon as you have any news.

395
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,318
I'll tell Tiantian.

396
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,199
Okay.

397
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,519
The patient's fainting was caused by hypoglycemia.

398
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,879
We have done a thorough examination.

399
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,718
No organic disease has been found.

400
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:28,799
The faint was due to tiredness
and inadequate nutrition.

401
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,559
Basically, she has recovered.

402
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,680
She needs one day of observation before discharge

403
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,199
Does this patient usually live alone?

404
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,718
Yeah, grandma's been home alone lately.

405
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:46,159
Though hypoglycemia is not a serious illness,

406
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,919
if you can't get treatment in time,

407
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,718
the coma for more than six hours

408
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,438
would bring damage to the brain tissue.

409
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,639
The damage is irreversible.

410
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,879
The consequences would be very serious.

411
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,159
Fortunately, this guy sent her to the doctor in time.

412
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,959
Otherwise... I will always
stay by grandma's side.

413
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,959
She also needs to get more nutrition.

414
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,118
Don't let the patient get tired.

415
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,079
She's old, after all.

416
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,039
Thank you, doctor.

417
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,959
Thanks.

418
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,680
It's lucky she's alright.

419
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,839
Grandma, you're awake.

420
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:35,358
I'm woken up by your loud voice.

421
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,800
I'm scared.

422
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,160
Don't panic.

423
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,279
Grandma, I'm not going anywhere anymore.

424
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,598
I'll be by your side.

425
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,639
I cook for you every day.

426
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,799
I won't let you do any work.

427
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,439
What did I do?

428
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,079
When you're not around,

429
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,919
Meinan came every day.

430
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,319
All the chores and farm work,
he took them all.

431
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:07,718
And your Aunt Yu,
she made meals for me from time to time.

432
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,000
I didn't even need to cook.

433
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,880
I didn't do anything.

434
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,079
I just woke up a little early today.

435
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,478
When Meinan has not yet arrived,

436
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:24,958
I skipped breakfast to sweep the floor.

437
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:25,959
And then...

438
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,399
It's embarrassing.

439
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,800
Alright, don't do it next time.

440
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:34,959
Aunt Yu, Meinan.

441
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,718
Thank you very much for today.

442
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:39,879
You don't have to. We're a family.

443
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,880
If you want to thank someone,
just thank Meinan.

444
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,519
That's... That's what I should do.

445
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,959
That's what I should do.

446
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,958
Well, where's Meiren?

447
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,238
I heard her call me.

448
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,478
Meiren was here.

449
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:56,800
She went out to buy
your favorite brown sugar pancake.

450
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:00,119
You're all good kids.

451
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,039
Aunt Yu, Meinan, it's settled here.

452
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,958
I'll take care of grandma at night.

453
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:07,919
You can go back.

454
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,599
Uncle is still waiting for you at home.

455
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:13,958
Tiantian, I'll accompany you to take care of grandma.

456
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,280
Yes, let him stay with you.

457
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,999
Your sister hasn't been back for so long.

458
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,759
Uncle must want you to be together.

459
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,238
There's really nothing to do here.

460
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,079
I'll ask Meiren to leave when she comes back.

461
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,680
Is Tiantian having a new boyfriend?

462
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,880
Not at all.

463
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,838
Mom, don't worry about it.

464
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,438
I'm worrying because
of your dumb head.

465
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm overwhelmed.

466
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,919
Dad, we're home.

467
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,838
You're back.

468
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,199
Grandma Li met Tiantian, right?

469
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,478
Yu, you are getting knowledgeable.

470
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,559
You read English newspapers.

471
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,640
Of course I must keep pace with the times.

472
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,000
Come on, read it.

473
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:30,279
This is Lao Yu, right?

474
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,439
Just one sentence?

475
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,000
This newspaper is what I put
under the foot of the table.

476
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,719
You should have told me earlier.

477
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,838
Dad, you've already hung it on the wall.

478
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,958
Well, I have nothing else to do.

479
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,520
Nothing to do?

480
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,759
I've taken this picture back for months.

481
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,078
You've been busy all the time.

482
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,160
As Meiren comes back, you have nothing else to do.

483
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:57,279
Meiren, your dad hung the photo to welcome you.

484
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,239
Look.

485
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,478
Dad, you're good.

486
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:02,479
Look at sister.

487
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:05,079
She's too happy to say anything.

488
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,639
Meiren, how long will you stay?

489
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,400
Will Zhuang come here later?

490
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,439
He...

491
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,519
We're busy these days.

492
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,800
I left in a hurry and he won't come.

493
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:20,039
Alright.

494
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,718
He can come whenever he has free time.

495
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,999
I kept the room in which he lived.

496
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,718
He can come whenever he has time.

497
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,759
Yes, Shanghai is not far from here.

498
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,519
Bring Mr. Zhuang when you have time on weekends.

499
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,559
It's like a vacation.

500
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,358
Oh, I almost forgot about it.

501
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,318
Take it out.

502
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:35,198
My poor memory.

503
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:37,838
I made this black sesame ball with my own hands.

504
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,280
Take it back to Zhuang.

505
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:43,199
Your researchers need to take this.

506
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,679
Prevent hair loss and replenish some nutrition.

507
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,560
Mom, Mr. Zhuang's hairs are thick and dense.

508
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,519
It's shiny. He doesn't need this.

509
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,438
Who says?

510
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,838
Take it all back for prevention.

511
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,958
- Take it.
- Okay.

512
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:58,958
I'll take them all.

513
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,759
He also asked me to greet you.

514
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,040
What a good guy.

515
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,160
Alright, I'll go back to my room and rest.

516
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,598
What's going on with Meiren?

517
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,040
She's probably tired.

518
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,479
She's excited to see my picture.

519
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,520
This is... crape myrtle?

520
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:11,520
Happy Chinese Valentine's Day.

521
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,119
I knew you weren't sleeping.

522
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,799
Look at the studio now.

523
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,639
It's not as fast as it used to be.

524
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,718
Your father and I still shine in our prime.

525
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,599
They had our pores edited for a month.

526
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,279
What's wrong with that? Unhappy?

527
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,999
Having a fight with Zhuang?

528
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,718
No, the school has been busy recently.

529
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:36,839
There's cleaning stuff
and the evaluation of professional titles.

530
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,478
Your school evaluates titles

531
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:40,280
according to cleaning performances?

532
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,238
These pictures.

533
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,478
You left in a hurry last time
and didn't see them.

534
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,958
They said these were behind-the-scene photos.

535
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,079
Look, they're all about you and Zhuang.

536
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,759
I paid an extra fee to print it.

537
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,039
Look at this.

538
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,078
Zhuang's eyes are full of love.

539
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:57,919
Right?

540
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,159
You can take them back this time.

541
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,680
Let Zhuang have a look too.

542
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,359
Look at him.

543
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,599
He's careful.

544
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,159
It's because he cared about you.

545
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,679
Every detail has been noticed.

546
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,198
What's the matter with you?

547
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,398
Mom, I'm tired.

548
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,560
I want to sleep.

549
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,280
Well, new clothes are in the...

550
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,439
All right, sleep.

551
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,719
Something is wrong.

552
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,599
You noticed that, too.

553
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,398
I knew you could sense that.

554
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,600
Look at this woman.

555
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,958
She's not like a criminal.

556
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,438
He caught the wrong one.

557
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,279
I'm not talking about that.

558
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,359
I mean Meiren.

559
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,319
Don't you think she's a little different?

560
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,000
Meiren?

561
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,839
Meiren is a late sleeper, right?

562
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,559
Look at the sky.

563
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,638
It's not dark yet.

564
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,120
How could she possibly go to bed so early?

565
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,399
I know it. It must have something to do with Zhuang.

566
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,560
Zhuang...

567
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,120
sleeps early.

568
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:22,120
Meiren must have been influenced by Zhuang.

569
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,679
That's a good thing.

570
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,398
The brain is a good thing.

571
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,600
It's a pity you don't have it.

572
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,398
Right, my brain can't compete with yours.

573
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,678
Listen,
don't worry about that when you have time.

574
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,198
Just watch the TV.

575
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,198
There must have been mistakes in this case.

576
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,319
I'm not solving a case today.

577
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,198
I'm going to watch the school drama today.

578
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:46,959
No.

579
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,638
Well, you can't do that.

580
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,759
I haven't seen the end yet.

581
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,159
Look how sweet they are.

582
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,279
Look at the couple.

583
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,320
That's nice.

584
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
[Meiren Homestay]

585
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,839
Oh look, who is she?

586
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,439
A Chinese model?

587
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,079
Oh, that makeup.

588
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,519
That's rare on campus.

589
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,800
She's heading this way.

590
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,198
Hi, Miss.

591
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,039
How can I help you?

592
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,399
Are you looking for somebody?

593
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,760
Professor Zhuang.

594
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,840
Please wait.

595
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,359
Professor Zhuang.

596
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,199
It seems she's looking for you.

597
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,359
Who are you looking for?

598
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,239
Do you remember me?

599
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,238
My name is Xia Zhi.

600
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:57,959
We...

601
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,039
We've met before at the launch of Lami.

602
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,279
You were the guest expert and I was there.

603
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,120
Right, you wrote to me.

604
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:10,080
I received a grant from Huaiqing before.

605
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:13,760
Because of you,
I had the opportunity to go to university.

606
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:25,719
At that time,
I haven't used that name yet.

607
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,919
So, why are you here?

608
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,159
You got my resignation letter.

609
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,639
I respect your decision.

610
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,479
I'm here because I can't contact you.

611
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,360
I went to Tiantian's house.

612
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,120
The landlord said she had canceled the lease.

613
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,360
You're not home either.

614
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,639
I remembered that

615
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:03,120
you asked me to send something
to your home in Qingshui Village.

616
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,638
I came here to try my luck.

617
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,320
This boy

618
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,360
came all the way to find Meiren.

619
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,760
Their relationship is certainly not normal.

620
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:20,520
Wouldn't Meiren... cheat
on Zhuang behind him?

621
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,119
Well, Sherlock Feng,

622
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,359
haven't you solved enough cases in TV series?

623
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,000
All right.

624
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:28,239
Forget it. Let's go now.

625
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,559
Let me see it.

626
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,280
Let's go.

627
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,878
As soon as I entered the village,

628
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,360
I asked about Tiantian's address.

629
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,879
She's not home.

630
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,479
Luckily you're here.

631
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,479
I didn't ask you how you got here.

632
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:53,360
I'm asking you what's the
point of your being here?

633
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,239
I know Tiantian won't forgive me.

634
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,080
Neither will you.

635
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,199
But,

636
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,879
we've known each other for a long time.

637
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:08,599
You know I've never been as serious as now.

638
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,238
I don't want Tiantian to think I'm lying to her.

639
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,520
You're serious?

640
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,919
Do you need my applause for your seriousness?

641
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,039
If you're really serious,

642
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,359
you should be more sincere about this relationship.

643
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,519
I'm not insincere.

644
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,638
Do you think the sweet
words and living together

645
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,080
would be true love?

646
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,119
When she was caring and sympathetic to you

647
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,039
and showed her sincerity,

648
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,760
Have you been pleased and even found it funny?

649
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,079
What did you take her for?

650
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,760
A doll to play with as you wish.

651
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,220
♫ The forest shines with its radiance ♫

652
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,299
♫ Waiting for the birds to fly back ♫

653
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:55,740
♫ I'm sure you're my future ♫

654
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:03,919
Look, what's this?

655
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,719
Lily. Let me see.

656
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,999
Is this lily broken?

657
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,079
This represents a life-long marriage.

658
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,000
Right.

659
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,439
What does that mean?

660
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,638
And what is this?

661
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,120
Lotus seed.

662
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,120
I know.

663
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:23,438
You're going to cook

664
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,878
the soup with mung bean,
lily, and lotus seeds, right?

665
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,478
What a stupid brain you have.

666
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:31,079
This means having babies successively.

667
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,839
Who's having a baby?

668
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,399
Do we need to give red pockets again?

669
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,319
I find I can't communicate with you.

670
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,879
Of course, our Meiren and Zhuang.

671
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:42,158
I know.

672
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,800
Someone wants to be a grandmother.

673
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:46,599
Don't you want to be a grandfather?

674
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,399
Sure I do.

675
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,679
Listen,
I've thought about the name.

676
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,999
If it's a girl,
She's called Zhuang Aimei.

677
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,359
The boy would be called Zhuang Airen.

678
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,560
How's that?

679
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,919
Well, the names...

680
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,359
Aren't they a little too vulgar?

681
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,678
How can they be vulgar?

682
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,360
I tell you.

683
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:05,238
The extreme of vulgarity is elegance.

684
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,398
Look at the names of Meiren and Meinan.

685
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,438
What beautiful names that I made!

686
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,718
Right?

687
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,599
Well, your brain is just as hard as mung beans.

688
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,039
You're right, my brain...

689
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,639
I'm the mung bean,

690
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,360
But who's married with the mung bean?

691
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,360
Me!

692
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,718
Yu, you're good.

693
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:25,039
Are you expecting my sanction?

694
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,638
The question I just asked was hasty.

695
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,718
Let me.

696
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:30,499
Let me peel all of them.

♫ Your smile seems to announce every time ♫

724
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:27,219
♫ Heartbeat is the exclusive formula for love ♫

725
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,219
♫ You make all the stars in the sky shine for me ♫

726
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,899
♫ I can sail a boat in the starry river ♫

727
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,779
♫ Love is like sweet honey in our hearts ♫

728
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:48,180
♫ Even the air is filled with the scent of flowers ♫
