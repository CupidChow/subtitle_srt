1
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,221
Apparently an auctioneer
has taken Seol-ki,

2
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,348
the child we've been looking for.

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,935
The trading floor will open soon.
We must go there.

4
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,363
I don't believe this.

5
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,076
She can't expect to find the notice we've
been searching for all of these years

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,786
just because she desperately wants it now.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,788
We looked everywhere, didn't we?

8
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,415
Shut your mouth!

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,797
You know that neighborhood down there?

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,632
Apparently, a child's
gone missing from it.

11
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,218
- What?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,596
What if someone
really is eating those kids alive?

13
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,514
Why does this keep happening?

14
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,059
Which household's child was it?
When and how did they disappear?

15
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,518
A seven-year-old boy.

16
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,772
His maidservant says
she watched him as he fell asleep.

17
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,609
But in the morning,
he was gone without leaving a trace.

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,821
Another wealthy male child
disappears again

19
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,615
under the same circumstances.

20
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:17,035
Twelve years ago, Hongrang disappeared.
Sounds the same.

21
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,413
But you know what's so strange about it?

22
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,958
This maidservant supposedly said

23
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:29,047
that she'd seen a ghost that night
when she went back to her quarters.

24
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,633
A ghost?

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,552
She had to come up with some excuse
to save herself.

26
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,054
She didn't protect her young master.

27
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,140
But why would she say it was a ghost?

28
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,391
Who would believe that?

29
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,521
- What happened to that servant?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

30
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,898
- She was either beaten, or--
- Is she still alive?

31
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,817
- I don't know.
- Please find out.

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,693
I must meet with that maidservant.

33
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,696
All right, welcome, good sirs.

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,782
Feel free to look around.

35
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,327
Have a few drinks at the same time.

36
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,371
All right.

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,625
- I'd like to present the next boy to you.
- Not another boy!

38
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,711
Why are you giving us a boy again?

39
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,174
Stop fighting.

40
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,301
Hurry up, bring him.

41
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,430
This boy may not look like much,
but I must say that he is quite strong.

42
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,104
But didn't you search our home
thoroughly two days ago?

43
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:30,441
I am visiting on an urgent matter. There
was, uh, no time to give prior notice.

44
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,527
Urgent? What is it?

45
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,697
I am afraid
we are suspecting one of your own.

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,990
One of my own?

47
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,993
Are you suggesting
that someone in my household

48
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,829
orchestrated the kidnapping
of my beloved son?

49
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:47,041
I urge you to gather everyone
from your household out here.

50
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,837
We would also like to see the maidservant
who looked after your son

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,380
on the day he disappeared.

52
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,217
That wretch…

53
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,220
…has been punished thoroughly
and has taken to her bed.

54
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,889
I see.

55
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,558
We'll pay her a visit another day, then.

56
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,143
Attention, everyone!

57
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,479
I want every member of my household
out here. Right this minute!

58
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,647
Yes, my lord.

59
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,861
What is going on?

60
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,405
What do they want? What's going on?

61
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,831
Oh, look! This time
we have a girl for you all! A girl, look!

62
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,502
Now, now, now, hush now. Shh!

63
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,131
This is no ordinary girl because, look!

64
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,718
Right there. She is with child.

65
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,846
You get two for the price of one!

66
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,641
- Here, here! I bid 12 nyang!
- We have 12 nyang!

67
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,477
- Thirteen nyang!
- Thirteen nyang? Oh!

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,814
- Then, 15 nyang!
- Fifteen nyang! Any more offers?

69
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,274
Is that all?

70
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,568
Ah, but this is such a rarity!

71
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,445
Look at the round, full belly.

72
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,031
I am certain she is carrying a girl.

73
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,534
How can you be so sure?
We need to undress her to verify that!

74
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,162
- That's right, we must.
- Hear, hear!

75
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,664
Come on. Take that off.

76
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,708
If you do not want
to take that off, let us touch that belly!

77
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,586
It is a girl!

78
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,840
- This one sure is a girl.
- Fifteen nyang is a bargain.

79
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,887
DEAR HONGRANG

80
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,139
All right, make it quick. Hurry up!

81
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,849
What is it? What's the matter?

82
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,355
Quick, come along. Huh? Come on.

83
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,023
- Oh, yes.
- What's going on?

84
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,985
All right, stand there. Hurry up now.

85
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,283
Lift your heads, huh? Look up, everyone.

86
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,745
We have 15 nyang. Do we have another bid?

87
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,788
Eighteen nyang!

88
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,873
- Eighteen!
- Eighteen?

89
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,252
That's too much! You take her. Take her.

90
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:59,090
We can't end the bidding of this rarity
at a mere 18 nyang. Any more offers?

91
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,177
All right, if we have no more, 18 it is!

92
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,095
Come here, girl.

93
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,642
Sister!

94
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,187
Does that child come with her?

95
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,317
Since I'm feeling generous today,
you can have him for just five nyang!

96
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,739
Wait.

97
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,997
There's no one here.

98
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,918
Do you think
they may have already killed her?

99
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,712
Help me.

100
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,217
- Huh?
- Please help!

101
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,515
- Help me.
- Over there.

102
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,688
Help me.

103
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,028
This is insane.
How can they do this to someone?

104
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,031
Hey, can you see me?

105
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,659
Wake up now. Wake… wake up!

106
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,538
Wait! We can't possibly
dig her out of here.

107
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,998
I cannot just leave her here.

108
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,418
All right, then, but we have to be quick.

109
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,382
Fortunately, none of your servants
seem to be at fault.

110
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,634
Ah, I wish you good night, then.

111
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,593
Good night, sir.

112
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,355
The government office
will be paying us more visits,

113
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,524
so dig up that wench and get rid of her!

114
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,608
Yes, my lord.

115
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,113
- No.
- Goodness, what is this?

116
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,698
Oh my goodness.
What on earth? Where did she go?

117
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,826
- Wait, how is this possible?
- My lord!

118
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,411
Oh no.

119
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,052
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

120
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,871
Come, quickly!

121
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,248
Hurry!

122
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,461
Wait! What's going on?
I thought we were only gonna talk to her.

123
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,129
This was not part of the plan!

124
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,633
What do you hope to do? You can't
possibly save every poor soul in Joseon.

125
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,218
She was buried up to her neck.

126
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,679
If we left her there, she wouldn't
have survived through the night.

127
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,319
It's all right, children. You're safe now.

128
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,281
Do not look back. Just follow that man.

129
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,498
Look at this child!
He's as strong as an ox.

130
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,209
This one should last many years,
even if you ran him ragged.

131
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,837
He's like a purebred horse.
Look how lean and fit he is.

132
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,550
This one will work long and hard for you,
I can just tell.

133
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,510
Now, come, come, your bids.

134
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,346
Six nyang, it is.

135
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,890
Don't I have at least one bid?

136
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,185
One bid for this fine young buck.

137
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,647
Gentlemen! Attention, everyone!

138
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,983
Now we have a girl!

139
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,111
Oy.What is that?

140
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,988
Do you smell something?

141
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,659
Uh, have you been
passing gas or something?

142
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,495
- Sixteen nyang!
- Wait.

143
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,706
- Eighteen nyang!
- Is that smoke?

144
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,332
- Fire!
- Eighteen.

145
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,251
Go! Go, there's a fire!

146
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,961
The building's on fire!

147
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,846
Stop! Where are you going? Stop!

148
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,478
Let us out, please!

149
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,772
Let us out!

150
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,750
Damn it.

151
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,435
Heavens. Who… who are you?

152
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,333
Are you feeling a bit better?

153
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,298
Do not worry. You will never
have to go back there ever again.

154
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,802
May I ask you something?

155
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,139
You said you saw a ghost that night.

156
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,892
The night your young master disappeared.

157
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:32,608
Can you describe to me exactly
what it was that you saw that night?

158
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,869
This child was sold. Where did he go?

159
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,665
I have sold dozens of children.
How should I know?

160
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,544
Seol-ki

161
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,338
was the boy's name.

162
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,464
S-S-Seol-ki?

163
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,725
He was a fair, handsome-looking boy.

164
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,268
He…

165
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,984
he was stolen.

166
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,909
I swear! It's the truth.
A ghostly monster snatched him away!

167
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,246
What?

168
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,790
A monster?

169
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,419
The… the ghost was

170
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,923
around seven or eight feet tall.

171
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,220
A monster as tall and thin as a pole.

172
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,474
Its hair was long.

173
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,519
It came down to here.

174
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,607
It was white.
As white as an old woman's hair.

175
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,194
But it wasn't just its hair
that was white.

176
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,322
I looked at its arm,
and even its skin was white as snow.

177
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,034
The thing had a human face,
and it was devoid of color.

178
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,914
Lifeless and pale,
like a… a sheet of white parchment.

179
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,625
Even its eyes were white.

180
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,503
<i>I told you. Remember?</i>

181
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,421
I had a very strange dream back then

182
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,884
in which I saw someone with white hair,
white face, and even white eyes.

183
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,052
It wasn't a dream.

184
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,763
It was real.

185
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,183
<i>The ghostly monster</i>
<i>reminded me of something</i>

186
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,519
that I'd heard about in myths.

187
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,646
It looked just like

188
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,232
a Snow Man.

189
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,984
That's what it was!

190
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,545
A Snow Man.

191
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,966
Do you know where it came from
and where it went?

192
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,219
No, I do not.

193
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,605
Why on earth would you be searching
for a monster like that?

194
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,067
I do not understand.

195
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,539
<i>Because I must know</i>

196
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,125
<i>who did this to me.</i>

197
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,399
Something happened to Hongrang
before he disappeared.

198
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,864
<i>It was about three months previous.</i>

199
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,994
<i>There was an instance</i>
<i>where he disappeared for a short while.</i>

200
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:15,956
My lady!

201
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,709
<i>The child who was seen</i>
<i>sound asleep in his room last</i>

202
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,253
<i>was found outside by the back door</i>
<i>the following morning.</i>

203
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,504
Young master!

204
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,509
What are you waiting for?
Go and inform Her Ladyship!

205
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,179
- My lady!
- My lady, we found him!

206
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,847
- My lady!
- We found him!

207
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
<i>The physicians were called in</i>

208
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,310
<i>but could not come up with a sufficient</i>
<i>explanation for his symptoms.</i>

209
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:40,272
<i>In the end, they concluded that Hongrang</i>
<i>had secretly left the house late at night</i>

210
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,816
<i>and fell unconscious</i>
<i>under unknown circumstances.</i>

211
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,946
<i>But some started talking</i>
<i>and said it was noctambulism.</i>

212
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,283
<i>A ghost disease where one rises</i>
<i>and moves about while asleep.</i>

213
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,579
<i>They said those stricken by it would</i>
<i>end up walking straight into the fire,</i>

214
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,414
<i>thinking it was a dream and</i>

215
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,042
end up dying.

216
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:06,131
I had a dream. In it, I saw someone
with a white face and long white hair.

217
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,633
Even its eyes were white.

218
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,678
Every now and then,
Hongrang mentioned that dream to me.

219
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:18,185
The white person, the one in my dream,
took me someplace very dark. And there--

220
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,646
Try not to think about that dream anymore.

221
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,815
Hongrang was trying to tell me something.

222
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,651
But I did not listen.

223
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,071
It has taken me this long to realize that.

224
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,197
We should get going, then.

225
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,410
We need to find that ghost.
It must know something.

226
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,372
If what you're saying is true,
it must be the one who took Hongrang.

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,251
The Snow Man.

228
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,630
I may have heard something about it.

229
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,135
Apparently, this pallid
and slender monster

230
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,015
burns in the sun, which is the reason
it only comes out at night.

231
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,517
Oosh, that is horrifying.

232
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,063
A creature as white as snow that melts
in the sun, hence the name "Snow Man."

233
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,942
Let us search for it, then.

234
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,825
There, there. Come this way.

235
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,421
Child, come this way.
Yes, there you go. Yes.

236
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,558
I know Seol-ki. He was with me.

237
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,268
What?

238
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,188
When was that?

239
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:50,569
A big, scary white person took
Seol-ki and me somewhere dark.

240
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,737
Where was it?

241
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,741
It was a dark room,
a-and it smelled like ink sticks.

242
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,456
There was a person there.

243
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,710
They said to take me back
because they had no use for me.

244
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:13,008
That's why I'm here and Seol-ki
is still at that scary, dark place.

245
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,803
Do you

246
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,931
recall a painter being there?

247
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,849
I don't know.

248
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,020
They covered my eyes like that.

249
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:28,857
All right.

250
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,859
Thank you, child.

251
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,866
As was expected,
the Snow Man is on the move again.

252
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,494
In other words,

253
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,831
the painter has resumed his drawing.

254
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,211
I'm certain more children have vanished.

255
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,296
Let's look into that.

256
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,931
After you complete your rounds
at Seokjae Market,

257
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,142
I suggest visiting the stores
near Gwangtonggyo Bridge.

258
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,603
Recently, competition among
the store owners has intensified,

259
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,315
which has fortunately led to improvements
in quality and distribution.

260
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,154
Therefore, I believe it would be best
to encourage them rather than deter them.

261
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,446
I will do that.

262
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,241
We shall leave within the next hour.

263
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,706
Do you have anything more
you want to add to that?

264
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,626
I would ask you to please

265
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,545
look into Hongrang's past.

266
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,176
Sooner or later,
nuisances will come his way,

267
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,719
attempting to leech off of him.

268
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,180
We must know
what kind of life he has been leading,

269
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,307
who he has been associating with.

270
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,185
We need to know his faults
so that we can be prepared

271
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,897
and take appropriate measures should
anything unseemly be brought to light.

272
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,280
Her Ladyship is entering, my lord.

273
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,664
Do you know where my son is?

274
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,791
Were you expecting him to come here?

275
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,754
I cannot find him anywhere.
I would like to see him.

276
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,089
You know that he is not a child anymore.

277
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,799
But shouldn't he be here?

278
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,635
How is it that he is not,

279
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,388
but this deplorable thing is?

280
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,391
Why do you still discuss
the workings of the guild with it?

281
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,602
It is time you got rid of this.

282
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,521
Pluck this hateful stake out

283
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,901
and let my son take his rightful place
in this family's household.

284
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,069
But, as of now, my lady,

285
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:41,281
there is no one who can perform the duties
of chief merchant as well as he.

286
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,617
Everything from overseeing
and managing the guild

287
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,452
to helping Hongrang take over.

288
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,371
None of it
would be possible without Mu-jin.

289
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,914
Whyever would that be?

290
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,294
Most importantly,

291
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,923
the operations of the guild
and its personnel are my responsibility.

292
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,341
Remember one thing.

293
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,718
It was my father who allowed them

294
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,054
to be your responsibility.

295
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,516
And the Min Family's Guild,
where you perform your duties,

296
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,101
belongs to me.

297
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,271
If so, do you wish
to present the partition deed

298
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,273
and have both the grandmaster
and chief merchant

299
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,357
removed from their posts?

300
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,360
Do you really believe
this will not affect the guild?

301
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,489
What will you accomplish by having
your son inherit a guild in ruins?

302
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,583
Your son is nowhere to be found,
but you do not seem concerned, my lord.

303
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,838
Find where Hongrang is this instant.

304
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,048
Yes, my lord.

305
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,271
Her Ladyship wants to see you, my lord.

306
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,918
You wanted to see me, Mother?

307
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,422
Ah.

308
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,257
My son.

309
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,596
- Where are you coming from?
- I was at the library.

310
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,307
I had hoped
that seeing the books I read as a child

311
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,934
would help me remember something.

312
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,272
Is there something wrong?

313
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,357
Not at all, my son.

314
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,777
I just cannot bear losing sight of you,

315
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,240
now that you have returned to me at last.

316
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,000
You needn't be concerned, Mother.

317
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,960
I have returned.

318
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,753
I will not disappear again.

319
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,511
Our high priestess.

320
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,974
She is Madam Gwigokja.

321
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,644
She favored me
with the blessing to bear you.

322
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,084
As for this man…

323
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,507
do you perhaps recognize him?

324
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,951
Hongrang recognized my father.

325
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,829
An old memory came to him
after seeing a portrait of Father.

326
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,625
Really? Please tell us what it was.

327
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,919
Well, it's rather hazy.

328
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,381
But I remember him sitting me on his lap
and reading me something.

329
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,132
I remember the scent of pine.

330
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,301
Yes.

331
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,845
I remember it quite well.

332
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,767
Father always drank pine extract
to treat his bowel condition.

333
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,269
Do you remember that?

334
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,979
Oh yes.

335
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,273
Yes, you are right, Hongrang.

336
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,326
Everyone knows what Min Ban-yoo
looks like from the Min Family's Guild.

337
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,953
Even if they didn't know him,

338
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,373
they would certainly recognize him
from his distinctive features.

339
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,250
Anyone could. What else?

340
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,378
He sat him on his lap?
What grandfather doesn't do that?

341
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:33,425
How did he know about his bowel condition?
And how he treated it using pine extract?

342
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,386
That's true, uh…

343
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,264
Even I did not know of such things.

344
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,394
What I am saying is the illness he had
was kept secret from the public.

345
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:58,533
<i>You know what, Hongrang?</i>
<i>You have a birthmark on your scalp.</i>

346
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,540
You are right.

347
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,334
How did he do it?

348
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,338
How did he come across
such private information?

349
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,591
Just how well-prepared did he come?

350
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,428
What is he really seeking?
What are his true colors?

351
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,975
He baffles me so.

352
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,777
Start at the kisaeng house where that
bastard, Dok-gae, supposedly found him.

353
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,112
Search for everything
you can uncover about him.

354
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,323
And make sure
that nobody from the guild notices.

355
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,366
Yes, my lord.

356
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,706
Eat some more food.

357
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,711
Are you trying to force-feed her
until her stomach explodes?

358
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,547
An empty stomach
often leads to an empty heart.

359
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,092
I know it is hard, but you must wait.

360
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,511
We have found a way
for you to go to Naju City.

361
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,597
You only need to stay here
for a couple of days.

362
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,307
But we must be careful.

363
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,144
Her master has his men
looking for her all over the place.

364
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,437
Yeah, it's complete chaos.

365
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,982
He's intent on finding them both.
His son and this one.

366
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,405
Do not worry.
We will help you get away from here.

367
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,660
I thank you.

368
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,342
When that lord's son disappeared,

369
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,636
there was a maidservant
who was keeping his side.

370
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,973
<i>However, apparently imposters pretending</i>
<i>to be from the government appeared</i>

371
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,891
<i>and helped the maidservant escape.</i>

372
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,313
It seems that some intruders
helped the maidservant escape.

373
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,316
Why?

374
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,362
Were they simply trying to help her?

375
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,698
Or were they hoping
she would tell them something?

376
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,744
If not that,

377
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,997
maybe they already know something.

378
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,838
It is fine. I am all right.

379
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,048
I just grazed myself.

380
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,342
I will tend to it.

381
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,928
You try to find that maidservant.

382
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,103
Have you searched over there?

383
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,981
Yes. Let us wrap this up
and finish for the day.

384
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,172
I doubt you came here
simply to steal some medicinal herbs.

385
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,926
I have no idea what you are plotting,
but I warn you not to shame that name.

386
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,691
Do not engage in shameful deeds while
bearing the name of my little brother.

387
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,611
Nevertheless, you lost him.

388
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,075
Why could you not protect
the little brother you adored?

389
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,493
What did you do?

390
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,245
Did you do anything?

391
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,538
You could not find him.

392
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,497
What if I am him?

393
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,250
It would mean you are unable
to recognize your own brother.

394
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,252
You do not know anything.

395
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,545
All you can do is cry

396
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,840
with this pitiful old piece of clothing
wrapped in your arms.

397
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,301
Give that back.

398
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,887
Let's see if I'm your brother.
Let's see if it fits.

399
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,973
Give it back! I said give it back!

400
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,892
Give it back!

401
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,985
Well,

402
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,613
you could never be him.

403
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,117
Because he would never do this to me.

404
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,496
They all wanted me dead.

405
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,460
They all clawed at me, wanting me to die.
But not him.

406
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,712
He was not like that.

407
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,923
Never.

408
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,845
That child could even revive
a dying heart.

409
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,921
My word.

410
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,299
Even the snacks here are exceptional.

411
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,136
Of course they are.

412
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,722
It was I, your humble servant,
who made them.

413
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,027
You truly must be the young master!

414
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,116
Oh! You always had a sweet tooth
as a child.

415
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,160
But you hated getting your hands
all sticky from the snacks,

416
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,122
so you used to wrap something around them.

417
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,289
Like a napkin.

418
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,209
Or you had me
put them in your mouth for you.

419
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,171
Someone thinks otherwise.

420
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,214
Someone?

421
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,176
Oh, you mean mistress Jae-yi?

422
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,054
Oh, you mustn't call her that.
She's your sister.

423
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,556
Oh, she does not think so.

424
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,766
She would have me killed
if I called her that.

425
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,811
I wonder why she's acting like that.

426
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:46,607
Maybe she's been grieving for so long
that she can't believe it is really you.

427
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,694
Tell me. Has she always been so sour?

428
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,778
Huh?

429
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:59,037
Even a wee flower grows thorns on its stem

430
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,458
when bracing against
the cold, howling wind.

431
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,634
Young master…

432
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,806
do you happen to remember
what day it is today?

433
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,269
On this very day 12 years ago…

434
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,336
- How dare you make my son bow down!
- No.

435
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,589
How dare you force him
to bow to a lowly spirit like this! Huh?!

436
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,300
<i>It was disastrous.</i>

437
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,011
<i>- An ancestral rite table.</i>
<i>- </i>Get rid of everything!

438
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,181
<i>She did not care.</i>
<i>She destroyed everything.</i>

439
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,267
<i>The only keepsake mistress Jae-yi had</i>
<i>from Lady Ha.</i>

440
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,105
<i>She ripped those swaddling clothes</i>
<i>to shreds.</i>

441
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,398
Mother! Please!

442
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,235
Give it back! I said give it back!

443
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,843
Oh, Mother,

444
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,721
if by some chance,

445
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,099
you happen to see Hongrang

446
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,562
attempting to cross over to your side,

447
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,858
I beg you to encourage him
to come back here.

448
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,110
To find his way home.

449
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,240
You cannot let him die yet.

450
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,533
We need him.

451
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,370
He belongs with us here.

452
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,332
Oh, Mother,

453
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,127
if you feel any remorse at all
about leaving me here alone,

454
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,214
then send him back to me.

455
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,175
Even if you must force him.

456
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,344
I need him to come back.

457
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,848
Please.

458
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,614
Oh God!

459
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,497
Oh, my lord!

460
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:17,211
Those rotten bastards.
They could've gone easier on you.

461
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:24,302
So that damned wretch tricked me
and reported me to the government office.

462
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,762
Oh, my lord.

463
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,475
I am going to do everything in my power

464
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,936
to catch and end that scoundrel for good.

465
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,440
Wait a minute.

466
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,113
Ah, she looks familiar.

467
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,159
Where have I seen her?

468
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,129
Hurry. Go.

469
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,341
- Bring her.
- You. You, woman. Oy!

470
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,013
Uh, pardon me.

471
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,975
Uh, that woman there.
What is she doing here?

472
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,229
- May I ask what this is?
- Oh, I see.

473
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,864
She is the daughter.
It is her home, my lord.

474
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,368
What? That woman
is the chief merchant's daughter?

475
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,703
- Sim's daughter, Sim Jae-yi?
- Yes.

476
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,541
How do you wish to pay
for disgracing my woman?

477
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,170
What else could he have been doing

478
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,590
with his half-undressed sister
in a palanquin so late at night?

479
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:50,596
I am even certain
he may have referred to her as "my woman."

480
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,140
- Yes.
- You heard it too?

481
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,517
I certainly did, my lord.

482
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,940
If word spreads that the family's siblings
are smitten with each other…

483
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,403
All of Hanseong
will be turned upside down,

484
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,407
and Chief Merchant Sim
will be absolutely beside himself!

485
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,117
Now,

486
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,037
I want you to keep an eye on that wench.
Do not let her out of your sight.

487
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,249
See where the two lovebirds
carry out their trysts,

488
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,875
if they have some sort of token of love.

489
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,045
You must bring me hard evidence
of their affair.

490
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,463
Yes, my lord.

491
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,077
This is the place
your informant discovered?

492
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,080
Are you sure he saw the maidservant here?

493
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,585
Where have they disappeared to now?

494
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,812
<i>Of course they are. It was I,</i>
<i>your humble servant, who made them.</i>

495
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,939
This food

496
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,942
is from Min Family's Guild.

497
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,703
Sim Jae-yi.

498
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,469
- Welcome, how may I help you?
- Do you have a room?

499
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,013
You wish to stay the night?
Please come this way.

500
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,745
The peddlers will arrive around daybreak.
Follow them.

501
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,248
They will take you to Naju City.

502
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,584
Please be careful.

503
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,754
Excuse me.

504
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,966
It's just

505
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,678
I remembered other things.

506
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,560
Uh, there was something written

507
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,771
on that white ghost's neck.

508
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,068
Written? You mean
there were letters on its neck?

509
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,070
Yes.

510
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,324
Two characters, actually.

511
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,417
I cannot read, but the first character

512
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:53,547
was just a line drawn across like this.
I remember that.

513
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,592
But the second one, I don't know.

514
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,762
"Han." It means

515
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,097
"one."

516
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:08,437
I have been wanting to tell you,
but I was scared the ghost would return.

517
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,691
I thought it would come and kill me
if I said anything.

518
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,152
I'm sorry.

519
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,698
It is all right.
Thank you for telling me right now.

520
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,992
I should be the one thanking you.

521
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,914
I would surely be dead
if it were not for you.

522
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,085
Take care.

523
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,084
I have found someone
who might know something about him.

524
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,522
Excuse me.

525
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,899
Hello there.

526
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,944
May I ask you something?

527
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,276
Perhaps you know this man?

528
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,280
Did he order you to end me finally?

529
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,074
Or are you here
to collect the last of my limbs?

530
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,328
No. I am not here to harm you.

531
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,955
This man did not send me here either.

532
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,209
May I ask… how do you know him?

533
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,753
We worked together.

534
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,798
When he was a foot soldier? Is that it?

535
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,674
Or before that?

536
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,261
That man is no ordinary foot soldier.

537
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,722
Then what?

538
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,516
He's not human at all.

539
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,645
He is a Hwi-su. A Soul Reaper.

540
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,022
"Hwi" meaning "rip,"

541
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,525
and the meaning of "su" is "life."

542
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,362
He had killed more than a dozen others
before he sliced this arm off.

543
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,532
"Han," meaning

544
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:08,992
"one."

545
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:11,995
Written on its neck.

546
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,752
Common one.

547
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,631
<i>Avoid him.</i>

548
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,092
<i>Avoid him at all costs.</i>

549
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,094
One heart.

550
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,013
<i>One flesh.</i>

551
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:31,890
<i>Do not offend him.</i>

552
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,603
Whatever crosses his path
he will rip to shreds. I warn you!

553
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,900
<i>How could I let such a man go near her?</i>

554
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,110
One hour.

555
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,070
One o'clock.

556
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,155
One…

557
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,909
What could it be?

558
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,793
Jae-yi!

559
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,349
Brother, what is this? Why?

560
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,936
I have been informed
as to what you really are.

561
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,024
Soul Reaper.

562
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,657
And yet you raise your sword to me?

563
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:33,869
Well,

564
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,205
considering how you two
are not related by blood,

565
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,917
this is rather naive, but earnest.

566
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,837
I wonder what is really in your heart.

567
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,174
You could do it.

568
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,345
But Father is coming this way.

569
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,816
Do you think he would approve of this?

570
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,195
Lower your sword. Please, brother.

571
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,844
I asked Mu-jin when you would be
making your next rounds.

572
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,848
He thinks it would be a good idea…

573
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,560
if I joined you next time.

574
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,314
I could perhaps accompany you
around all the art supply stores.

575
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,608
He believes that if I see some paintings,

576
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,319
it would help me
develop a discerning eye for detail.

577
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:50,779
All right.

578
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,699
So you may come along, then.

579
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,211
Remember…

580
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,506
I saved you today.

581
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,684
You must not challenge him anymore.

582
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,687
I can take care of myself.

583
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,939
But, brother, why do you do this?

584
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,984
Tell me that you will not. Promise me.

585
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,405
Mm.

586
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,629
I could not ask her.

587
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,137
Honestly, I do not think
she would have answered me anyway.

588
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,474
However,

589
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,895
I am certain now that the maidservant
saw the Snow Man.

590
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:08,065
She was coming up with words
that began with the character "han."

591
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,025
The maidservant must have said something.

592
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,778
She has seen them.

593
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,614
The markings that are on its neck.

594
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,200
The characters.

595
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,624
What? Snow Man?

596
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,126
What you are saying
is Sim Jae-yi, that wench,

597
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,879
is searching for something
resembling a ghost.

598
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,090
And that this being
has markings on its neck

599
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,884
that begin with
the character "han," correct?

600
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,065
I was coming home yesterday
and my stomach started cramping.

601
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,025
I felt my bowels would burst
at any moment.

602
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,903
Goodness me!
And it was pouring with rain too.

603
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:58,698
But then the moment I squatted,
out it all came. Plop!

604
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,951
Oh, come on!

605
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,994
Then I felt something behind me! Swish!

606
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,788
So I cried out.

607
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:06,915
"Who is there?"

608
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,918
And there was this tall,
white-haired, slender-looking being

609
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,169
standing not far away.

610
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,089
The monster raised its claws like this

611
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:17,467
and began digging at the ground
in such a frenzy. I took a closer look.

612
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,971
That thing was looking at me
with its white, glowing eyes, and boo!

613
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:25,308
And blood was dripping from
its pale hands. It was right by a grave.

614
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:31,106
Ever since my father saw that thing,
he says he cannot look at anything white.

615
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,567
- He's even stopped eating white rice.
- Really?

616
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,736
- Is that true?
- That scares me.

617
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,239
It is so strange.

618
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,367
Many people seem to have seen it.

619
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,912
It was spotted here in the fields.

620
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,374
The womenfolk say they saw it here.
The meat market owner, here.

621
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,460
And the village school boy, here.
Which means…

622
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,089
it's right here.

623
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,007
Oh.

624
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,218
Children vanish when the Snow Man appears.

625
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,762
All the places where the creature
was witnessed points toward--

626
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,847
A child's grave.

627
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,765
It only appears
near the graves of children.

628
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,518
And every single day that someone saw it,
the weather seemed--

629
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,853
It was always raining.

630
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,814
Strange.

631
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,943
Not a single person
witnessed it during our investigation.

632
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,237
Yet rumors of it
are now spreading like wildfire.

633
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,742
What does that matter? I guess
it just drew more attention to itself now.

634
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,203
I suppose we should
just wait for it to rain.

635
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,038
The air is so humid.

636
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,624
I think it will rain soon.

637
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,543
If it rains,
then we go to a child's grave.

638
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,254
But how are we going to defend ourselves

639
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,174
against a creature
that's either a ghost or a monster?

640
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,093
I will have a word with my brother.

641
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,096
What use is having a damned scholar?

642
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,099
That damned scholar
is quite the swordsman.

643
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,277
This is a list of paintings
the guild bought and sold.

644
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,238
Try to familiarize yourself with it.

645
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,785
ONE DEATH

646
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,913
<i>I cannot read, but the first character</i>

647
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,292
was just a line drawn across like this.

648
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:43,965
I saw someone with a white face,
long white hair, and even white eyes.

649
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,308
A CHILD'S GRAVE

650
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,018
The character "Hong."

651
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,062
Hongrang.

652
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,606
Hongrang.

653
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,119
Let us go. She must have had a head start.

654
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,565
The Snow Man?

655
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,214
Jjo-kkan. Jjo-kkan!

656
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,262
Jjo-kkan! No. Jjo-kkan.

657
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,557
Who did this? Who did this to you?

658
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,059
Jjo-kkan! Please wake up

659
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,979
Jjo-kkan!

660
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,527
What is taking Jae-yi so long? Huh?

661
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,029
We should go.
She knows where it is. Come on.

662
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,369
Who did this?

663
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,790
Who did this to you, huh?

664
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,667
Jjo-kkan!

665
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,305
You.

666
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,933
You were the one who killed her.

667
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,728
But why? Why?!

668
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,813
Because she is useless to me now.

669
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,108
She told me what you lot
are plotting and looking for.

670
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,110
That was the only thing
that wench was good for.

671
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,279
However, it is my understanding

672
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,284
that you will remain quite useful
even as a corpse.

673
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,498
When your little brother went missing,

674
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,709
500 nyang was the reward
for finding his corpse.

675
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:28,588
So I shall kill you
and present you at the appropriate time.

676
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,673
I'll not only retrieve the reward,

677
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,218
I'll also take all the credit
for finding you.

678
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,012
Now, how shall I kill you?

679
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:41,893
I could carve out that face of yours that
could be taken for a woman's or a man's.

680
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:46,689
Oh, no. Then the chief merchant
wouldn't even recognize you.

681
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:50,193
Then how? Shall I peel your skin off
from your toes up?

682
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,613
Just try.

683
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,199
You bastard, just try it!

684
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,253
You crazy wench!

685
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,359
How dare you

686
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,695
lift a finger…

687
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,782
against my sister?
