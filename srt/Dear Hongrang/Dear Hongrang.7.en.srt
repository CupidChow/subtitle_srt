1
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,700
Now my father will be lonely without me.

2
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,705
I'm sure he'll understand.

3
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,208
He'll know that you left
your heart with him.

4
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,628
I hope you and I can be friends.

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,716
At least that way,
you won't be lonely too.

6
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,313
You have not uttered a word
since you were brought here.

7
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,150
The chief merchant has taught you well
when it comes to holding your tongue.

8
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,903
Oh yes.

9
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,238
Do you remember your father?

10
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,491
The one who sold you?

11
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,077
It seems he was quite the gambler.

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,912
He squandered not only
the money we gave him

13
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,289
but his health with his other pursuits.

14
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,126
He is now so ill as to lie waiting
for death to slowly claim him.

15
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,546
I found him pathetic and vile
when he pawned you off to my husband,

16
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,048
and my instincts were right.

17
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,220
However, if you do
what is expected of you,

18
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,430
I will grant him a funeral in exchange.

19
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,682
The one fate that I have been given is…

20
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,312
to choose death.

21
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:43,913
DEAR HONGRANG

22
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,551
Do you wish me to have you executed?

23
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,180
Or perhaps you wish to have me killed?

24
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,097
Your Highness,

25
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,392
such words should never be spoken.
I simply meant--

26
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,645
You wish to transfer ownership
of your fictitious guild here

27
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,231
so that you will receive
imperial protection.

28
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,735
Regarding the sulfur
that you were found to be smuggling,

29
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,906
you would like me to declare that it was
collected for the palace's needs.

30
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,204
Which would mean
a death sentence for both of us.

31
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,872
I swear that is not my intention.

32
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,124
Trading sulfur is prohibited by decree

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,418
of His Majesty himself.

34
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,254
You are

35
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,258
not here for favors,
but to implore me to commit treason.

36
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,470
Highness! I have offended you
with my actions.

37
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,014
I beg your mercy for my poor judgment.

38
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,225
It is due
to the grandmaster's life being at risk.

39
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,602
Deliverance is in your hands.

40
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,023
Relinquish what you have been
holding from me, Yeol-guk.

41
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:59,739
And have both of your hands clutch firmly
onto my most royal hand.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,202
That is the only way that you may avoid
a death sentence for your grave mistake.

43
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,500
Let me in.

44
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,877
Only for a little while.

45
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,504
No one will know if I make it fast.

46
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,422
Young mistress,
Her Ladyship always finds out.

47
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,175
It would also be a death sentence for us.

48
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,344
- No! You cannot!
- Mu-jin! I'm here!

49
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,097
- You cannot!
- Please! We cannot let you in.

50
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,100
Can you hear me?
Brother, answer me! Are you well?

51
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,687
Tell me that you hear me!
Please, just say something, brother!

52
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,188
We can't let you in!

53
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,191
This will be the death of us! Please go!

54
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,301
This was your doing!

55
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,679
I know that Mu-jin was
only being faithful. This was your idea.

56
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,722
What if it was?

57
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,059
You are sacrificing him!
How can you stand there being so cold?

58
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,894
Your grandmaster is
also your son, remember?

59
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,147
This was his decision.
I advised against this

60
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,982
and warned him of the consequences.

61
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,485
And he decided to ignore my counsel
and followed through with his deceit.

62
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,739
And now he is to pay for his offense.

63
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,867
Have you ever been a father

64
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,493
to either of us?

65
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,953
Is your family important to you?

66
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,873
Did you ever look at either of us
through a father's eyes?

67
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,378
I have trader's eyes, Jae-yi.

68
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,715
A merchant trader's virtue
lies in his ability to assess value.

69
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,550
To assign a worth to goods
as well as people,

70
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,052
including members of his own family.

71
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,053
I thought so.

72
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,057
As of now,
consider my worth to you as nothing.

73
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,560
I will do my utmost
to thwart your appraisal

74
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,896
as I refuse to be mere goods
at your disposal.

75
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,456
Our only chance to save my brother
is to have him acquitted of the offense.

76
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,834
And to do that, we will require evidence
that this was not his doing.

77
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,087
Can we find it?
I heard that there are papers

78
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,339
that show your brother
registered that guild in his name.

79
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,840
I must start examining the ledgers.

80
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,802
It will show in the records
how long the guild has been in place.

81
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,970
<i>There should be evidence</i>
<i>of financial transactions</i>

82
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,389
<i>to support my cause.</i>

83
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,614
I trust you have removed

84
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,658
all records pertaining
to the borrowed name guild.

85
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,951
Yes, my lady.

86
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,453
Now is not the time
to target the chief merchant.

87
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,998
He has made the difficult decision to
forfeit the stake he put in place himself,

88
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,169
so I shall be obliging and protect
his reputation despite my hatred for him.

89
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,148
Well done with the corrections.

90
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,698
Mun Gyu-ha?
What have you learned about him?

91
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,699
My lady,

92
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,160
he seems to have disappeared.

93
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,996
He is not at the inn
where I was informed he was staying.

94
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,956
He has not contacted
the minister of finance

95
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,541
or the chief merchant either.

96
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,253
He has gone into hiding
after causing me this headache?

97
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,130
Search everywhere
for that treacherous snake

98
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,466
as it is likely
he will soon contact my husband.

99
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,342
They are conspiring
to oust me from my reign.

100
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,635
I fear so.

101
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,055
But, mistress,
what of the grandmaster's fate?

102
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,516
Do we leave him as he is?

103
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,476
Of course.

104
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,853
He decides his own fate.

105
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,688
He may choose to starve to death.

106
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,940
Or take my poisoned offering.

107
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,889
Mother.

108
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,892
My son.

109
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,436
What brings you here so late at night?

110
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,649
I was awakened by a memory.
I wanted to ask you about it.

111
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,889
When is the last time you slept?
Or had any food?

112
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,900
- I told you not to do this.
- My arm is not what matters right now.

113
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,237
What does? What is more important
than your health?

114
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,365
My brother's future. How can you not be
aware of the danger Mu-jin is facing?

115
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,992
Those were his choices.

116
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,244
This is your brother's fate.

117
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,664
- Lives were lost in the accident.
- The explosion was not his doing.

118
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,874
Defending him with no proof
achieves nothing.

119
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,044
I agree. Which is why
I will prove his innocence.

120
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,172
With what evidence? And why?

121
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,841
He has no one else.

122
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,802
I am his only family.

123
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,846
I am all he has.

124
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,348
And I have been careless.

125
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,310
I have been so entangled
with my own troubles

126
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,769
that I was not aware of Mu-jin's.

127
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,733
I was too preoccupied with you to notice.

128
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,827
Do you

129
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,871
feel regret?

130
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,920
I betrayed him.

131
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,798
Mu-jin has put me first in his thoughts.

132
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,552
My brother has always been there
without being asked.

133
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,805
Whenever I have needed a friend,
he has held my hand.

134
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,433
He has been loyal when others have not.

135
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,814
Nothing you do will change his sentence.
You cannot risk trying to change it.

136
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,316
I will.

137
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,611
- I cannot rest until Mu-jin is free again.
- Sister!

138
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:57,823
I must protect my brother.
If you cannot help me, leave me alone.

139
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,254
During the previous royal tribute,
Her Ladyship was deprived

140
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,008
of her chance to offer tribute by a man
named Mun Gyu-ha, an interpreter.

141
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,343
Mun Gyu-ha.

142
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,930
And this interpreter,
he vanished after the tribute?

143
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,306
He did.

144
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,935
Young mistress, may I ask
why you want to find this person?

145
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,146
<i>It is likely</i>
<i>he will soon contact my husband.</i>

146
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,148
They are conspiring
to oust me from my reign.

147
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,318
- <i>What of the grandmaster's fate?</i>
- He decides his own fate.

148
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,278
He may choose to starve to death.

149
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,905
<i>Or take my poisoned offering.</i>

150
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,576
I fear for Mu-jin. We must do something.
Can we not help him get away from here?

151
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,913
He is heavily guarded
and under constant surveillance.

152
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,542
Her Ladyship has dedicated much energy
to keeping the grandmaster locked away.

153
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,045
Unless we can get the guards away from
their posts, there's nothing we can do.

154
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,920
"There is a way
to resolve this situation to our benefit."

155
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,466
"Come tonight. The third tile-roof house

156
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,469
in the Ya Division
of the Bansong District, Compound Two."

157
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,012
"Eleven o'clock."

158
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,772
You may deliver this

159
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,566
to the chief merchant
as you were sent here to do.

160
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,152
But

161
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,073
you will not utter a word
about what you heard here. To anyone.

162
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,867
If you do,

163
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,994
I shall have your family

164
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,830
killed in front of your very eyes.

165
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,165
Yes, my lady.

166
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,877
Have the servants gather
before eleven o'clock.

167
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,378
I will be going to Bansong.

168
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,929
We have plenty.

169
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,723
You certainly seem hungry.

170
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,058
Finish quickly!

171
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,226
Yes, sir!

172
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,520
Huh? The house servants?

173
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,730
Where are they all going?

174
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,357
What is happening around here?

175
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,694
Let me go find out what's going on.
You all stay here.

176
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,029
All right. Yes, sir.

177
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,324
- You should all have some more.
- Oh!

178
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,619
We can't have you standing guard all night
with your stomachs rumbling.

179
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,309
- Break it down!
- Yes, my lady.

180
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,528
Oh, these cramps are bad.

181
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,822
Where are they?

182
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,752
Look at you.

183
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,674
Back to the household. This instant.

184
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,592
My lady.

185
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,389
Someone addressed a letter
to Chief Merchant Sim

186
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,849
and signed it in your name?

187
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,938
But Lady Min
intercepted the messenger first?

188
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,567
Yes, sister. And she traveled
to the address in the letter

189
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,361
to catch us scheming against her.

190
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,158
Sim Jae-yi.

191
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,993
This must be her doing.

192
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,331
That child

193
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,544
has discovered your existence
and now uses it for her own gain, brother.

194
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,925
- Like father, like daughter.
- I will attempt to stop what she has done.

195
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,929
Ensure that you succeed.

196
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,349
Otherwise, your mother
will rectify the situation.

197
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,482
If that happens,
if you still wish to save that girl,

198
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,443
you will be forced
to strike me down first.

199
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,839
There is a horse waiting for you
just down the road.

200
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,173
Find a safe place to hide soon.

201
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,300
- I will try to get you out of this.
- Jae-yi, I--

202
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,761
- I am begging you, do as I say.
- This is dangerous for you.

203
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,930
Brother! You must go.

204
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,307
It is the only way
for you to live. Please!

205
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,059
Before it is too late. Go!

206
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,655
Move aside.

207
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,708
Brother. Lower your sword.

208
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,585
I beg of you.

209
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,672
You take him.

210
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,176
Don't do this!

211
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,682
Please lower your sword.

212
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,641
And then what?

213
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,561
What will happen to you then?

214
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,523
- What of your life if he leaves?
- I gladly trade my life.

215
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,822
I cannot allow that.

216
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,116
No! Get your hands off!

217
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,869
I told you once

218
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,663
to keep your hands off of her.

219
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,837
Leave us alone.

220
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,177
Jae-yi, I cannot leave here like this.

221
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,392
What?

222
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,310
Sister,

223
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,563
there is no other place for me
than the guild.

224
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,776
Everything that makes me who I am is here.

225
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,821
If I disappeared tonight,
so would my purpose.

226
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,072
I can save you.

227
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,032
I can.

228
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,910
Go. I cannot lose you!

229
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,006
- Unlock it.
- Yes, my lady.

230
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,781
Mu-jin, the former grandmaster
of the Sim household,

231
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,951
is hereby dispatched to the mine
at Gapsan Mountain until further notice

232
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,578
to oversee labor relations.

233
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,889
Gapsan Mountain?

234
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,849
Do you even know
what kind of place that is?

235
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,809
The journey alone is fraught with danger,

236
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,395
and the land is so barren
that no crops can grow.

237
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,941
Many of the laborers die from starvation
or the cold or landslides.

238
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,651
They must recruit new workers regularly.

239
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,071
And you are banishing my brother there?
This is just a death sentence in disguise.

240
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,031
Must you go that far?

241
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,741
You find my decision cruel?

242
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,124
He has inserted himself
in my rightful place,

243
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,503
indulged in what I should have received,
and doubted me at every turn.

244
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,340
He behaved with force, raised his sword
to me like a common thief.

245
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,549
Given his behavior,

246
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,177
should I be more lenient?

247
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,976
Removing him.

248
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,645
Was that always your intention?

249
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,897
I do respect him.

250
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,026
But he was only a substitute.
I did not need an intention.

251
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,281
Because I have returned, he has
lost his purpose here and must be removed.

252
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,785
Why are you so upset?

253
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,161
What is Mu-jin to you?

254
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,372
A brother?

255
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,250
Or a love interest?

256
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:34,918
What?

257
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,003
Do you see him…

258
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,632
as a lover?

259
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:50,851
I see us

260
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,812
as sharing a heart.

261
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,941
His knows what mine knows.
What I have suffered.

262
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,070
When I look at Mu-jin, I see myself.

263
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,739
The pain I felt when I lost you.

264
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,907
His suffering resembled mine
and he understood.

265
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,035
He could empathize with my agony.

266
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,662
His strength allowed me to survive
all of these years.

267
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,206
His comforting hand…

268
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,625
Can you even fathom such a bond?

269
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,128
What am I, then?

270
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,509
If he is that important to you,
then what am I?

271
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,262
The little boy who was lost in the woods?

272
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,681
And that you needed to find?

273
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,975
Now that the search is over…

274
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,687
is that all I am to you?

275
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:40,192
The dream you have referred to,
do you find it disdainful?

276
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,349
Young mistress!

277
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,646
You should not be so cold
to your little brother.

278
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,192
The young master has acted bravely.

279
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,695
Without his actions,
things would be much worse.

280
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,705
This situation is making me feel uneasy.

281
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,668
After all, if a stake cannot be uprooted,
then it must be cut down and buried.

282
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,297
This must be taken care of before dawn.

283
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,299
Yes, my lady.

284
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,635
I suggest you let him live, Mother.

285
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,682
Spare the grandmaster's life.

286
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,354
My son, I cannot leave
any loose ends untied for your sake.

287
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,564
It is rather

288
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,983
to avoid any loose ends.

289
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,028
The grandmaster committed a grave offense.

290
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,281
But in recognition of his loyal work,

291
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,451
the rightful heir has decided
to spare him the death sentence

292
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,494
and banish him to the mountains.

293
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,372
I will make an official announcement
for all to hear.

294
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:23,587
This should allow those who have supported
Mu-jin to look favorably on his successor.

295
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,923
In turn, I will eventually
gain their trust and loyalty as well.

296
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,510
I think it best to start my work
on the right footing

297
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,137
and a reputation for fairness.

298
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,496
Jae-yi.

299
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,292
How can you still smile like that?

300
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,877
How cruel of you.

301
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,547
Come closer. I have something to tell you.

302
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,352
I will be working in one of our stores.

303
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,772
You were assigned to a store instead
of being in charge of the workers?

304
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,358
I am to go to the mountains
for a few months,

305
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,485
after which Her Ladyship
will call for my return.

306
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,029
But she has wanted you gone
since he arrived, brother.

307
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,739
She has given me her word.

308
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,909
Father must have spoken to her
on my behalf.

309
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,038
It was Hongrang.

310
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,834
Only he would be able to convince her.

311
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,088
Of course.

312
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,090
He does have her ear.

313
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,930
You must save me.

314
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,307
I must protect the family.

315
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,017
Letting you live
will put us all in danger.

316
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,435
If you let me die here,

317
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,980
you would lose not only her respect,
but her love.

318
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,817
I know that the more she intervenes
for my sake,

319
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,444
the more my sister's life is in danger.

320
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,824
- That is why--
- I will let you live on one condition.

321
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,536
You leave her
with no concerns for your life

322
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,372
and with no lingering feelings either.

323
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,082
Or she will not survive.

324
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,003
I am relieved by this turn of events.
When are you leaving?

325
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,965
I need to prepare Hongrang to take over.
And finalize a few things.

326
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,217
I should leave in a fortnight or so.

327
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,929
I will be quite busy before I leave
without much time to visit.

328
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,598
Please do not be upset with me.

329
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,226
I promise to write to you
once I get to my new home.

330
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,355
Maybe you could come
and stay for a while once I am settled.

331
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,028
I would like that.

332
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,863
Good.

333
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,198
You smiled again.

334
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,447
- Everything seems to be in order, then?
- We are very grateful.

335
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,473
<i>Perhaps</i>

336
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,101
<i>I have hurt your feelings.</i>

337
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,778
Will you ever see…

338
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,407
what is truly in my heart?

339
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,313
What is that? Is that a ghost?

340
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,110
Mother…

341
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,363
- Su-nam!
- Mother…

342
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,073
Su-nam!

343
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,204
My son! My son!

344
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,289
My sweet boy!

345
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,999
The boy?

346
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,667
Returned from the dead in the night?

347
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,336
The son of Lord Song, my lord.

348
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,880
He died in a fire
and was given a funeral last year.

349
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,758
- He was found alive by his mother.
- This is very strange indeed.

350
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,970
He appeared with all the burns,
just like the ones on the day he died.

351
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,348
Nonsense!
They cleaned him up for his burial.

352
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:12,310
Well, what did he say? People must have
asked him where he was all this time.

353
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,561
He could die again soon.

354
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,855
They say
he has not even taken a sip of water

355
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,732
and mumbles gibberish
until he falls asleep.

356
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,318
And when he wakes,
he screams until he falls back asleep.

357
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,861
Maybe he didn't really die,

358
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,155
or is he visiting
before crossing over to the netherworld?

359
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,657
Poor child!

360
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,951
- There was a Snow Man.
- Yes?

361
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,412
There was a ghostly creature, cloaked in
white, soaring over the house that night.

362
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,457
Soaring over the house?
Their minds were playing tricks on them.

363
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,293
- No, the servants saw it!
- Nonsense.

364
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,527
The liquor never tasted sweeter.

365
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,989
No flower compares to your beauty.
Particularly when you laugh.

366
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,453
So the one who impersonates
the young master and his band of assassins

367
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,496
are on a search mission?

368
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,497
Yes, sir.

369
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,834
The return of Lord Song's dead son
does seem to have caught their attention.

370
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,463
The Snow Man.

371
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,300
The ghost in white
that flew over the household.

372
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,885
The sister was after it too.

373
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,555
She thought her brother's disappearance
was due to that ghost, didn't she?

374
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,932
I must know what those bastards
are looking for.

375
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,601
Why would assassins look for a ghost?

376
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,560
Ya!

377
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,937
Hyah!

378
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,581
Grandmaster!

379
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,594
Is this the sketch of the young Hongrang?

380
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,013
No, my lord.
That is another boy who was a servant.

381
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,516
It was drawn up in an attempt to capture
him after he left his master's household.

382
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,811
The sketch was posted in the vicinity
of Paju, where it turns out

383
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,856
several people have claimed to have seen
the Soul Reaper when he was a child.

384
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,276
What if the servant boy who ran away
and was never heard from again

385
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,445
is the man who became an assassin?

386
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,822
I knew it! This shows he is a fraud.

387
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,412
Does this boy look familiar?

388
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,336
Oh! I could never forget that traitor.

389
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,130
What was his name?

390
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,924
I think it was Dog Tail.

391
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,093
Or Horse Tail? Or Rodent…

392
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,344
Rodent something.

393
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,263
He was my living talisman
the second he came into the world.

394
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,556
Your talisman?

395
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,814
We implore the Great Jade Emperor,
Umasallyong of Baek,

396
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,817
three guardian gods of cattle,
the nine mountain gods,

397
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,945
the spirits of the three kingdoms,
hear us!

398
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,239
Rid us of this presence!

399
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,450
Disease of evil begone!

400
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,121
Begone! Begone at once!

401
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,124
Riddance! Evil!

402
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,335
Begone! Begone!

403
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,336
<i>But who knows?</i>

404
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,047
<i>Perhaps that actually led him</i>
<i>to become possessed by a demon.</i>

405
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,308
Did you break something? What was that?

406
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,685
<i>At one point,</i>

407
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,604
<i>it seemed that anything</i>
<i>that idiot boy touched would break.</i>

408
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,822
But we spared his life
because he was still only a child.

409
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,616
<i>We took pity on him.</i>
<i>We even gave him a great honor.</i>

410
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,326
<i>After my father passed,</i>

411
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,621
<i>we let that devil enter the three-year</i>
<i>mourning period beside his grave.</i>

412
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,166
<i>But he ran away</i>
<i>before the one-year anniversary.</i>

413
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,460
<i>Ungrateful bastard. We should have known.</i>

414
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,689
The white ghost,

415
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,900
it put me

416
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,611
in cold water,

417
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,987
then the fire.

418
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,074
My breath is burning.

419
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,534
It hurts so much.

420
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,328
You are safe now, my child.

421
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,704
M-Mother?

422
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,914
I am here, Su-nam.

423
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,791
- Mother!
- You are safe now.

424
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,626
I was buried.

425
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,712
I was inside that grave.

426
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:53,049
Rest. You are safe now, my son.

427
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,093
Drip, drip,

428
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,303
the rain is falling

429
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,846
nonstop.

430
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,390
- My baby, you are safe.
- The white ghost.

431
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,850
I am right here.

432
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,061
The white ghost.

433
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,938
My baby.

434
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,493
- Mother is here. You are safe.
- No! No!

435
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,037
- Ah, don't kill me!
- I am here!

436
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,331
Su-nam, you are safe here.

437
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,088
Please stop!

438
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,158
<i>Drip, drip,</i>

439
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,410
<i>the rain is falling.</i>

440
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,662
We were buried alive like that.

441
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,581
In a grave that was rained on.

442
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,472
It was the painter.

443
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,017
He did exactly what he did to us

444
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,227
to that poor child.

445
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,357
Master Du-ryeong!

446
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,820
- What is it?
- We are in grave trouble.

447
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,747
This will not do!

448
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,627
You will move the children
elsewhere this instant.

449
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,130
Why are you still standing there?!

450
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:27,513
If you were to see the talisman boy now,
do you think you would recognize him?

451
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,141
Who knows? Huh.

452
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,435
It was long ago. I do not think so.

453
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,854
But perhaps my mother would.

454
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,733
Is there a particular feature
or characteristic that you noticed?

455
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,860
I hardly noticed that rat at all.

456
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,405
He did have a close friend
who could not speak at all though.

457
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,823
He was mute?

458
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,949
That boy?

459
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,119
Do you know whatever happened to him?

460
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,122
Well, now that you ask,

461
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,001
<i>I remember a woman</i>
<i>appearing out of nowhere,</i>

462
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,171
<i>and she offered a handsome sum</i>
<i>to take both of them.</i>

463
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,886
Would you by any chance still have
the documents related to their purchase?

464
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,846
Of course. Our records are thorough.

465
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,768
This is good news. We have succeeded.

466
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,520
The proof we needed
to restore the rightful order is at hand.

467
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,774
I will present this document as evidence
at tomorrow's roll call.

468
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,610
Young master Yu and his mother
will confirm these findings.

469
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,820
Their testimonies and this record

470
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,865
are going to let us
show everyone that he is an imposter.

471
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,993
Although, I should first…

472
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,079
You should share your findings
with your sister.

473
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,001
<i>Once you discover</i>
<i>that he has tricked all of us,</i>

474
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,546
<i>that he is a fraud, I believe</i>
<i>that you will return to your usual self.</i>

475
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,507
<i>It may be painful and heart-wrenching</i>

476
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,093
<i>to accept that you have been deceived</i>
<i>all this time,</i>

477
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,135
<i>but do not worry.</i>

478
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,804
<i>I will be there for you</i>

479
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,931
<i>just as I always have been.</i>

480
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,025
Hyah! Ha!

481
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,283
Jae-yi!

482
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,327
Jae-yi!

483
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,358
The Snow Man.

484
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,111
That is the creature
you are searching for.

485
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,240
I recall that you told me

486
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,910
you would see a white ghost
in your dreams when you were little.

487
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,162
I think it is the reason
you followed me into the woods

488
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,663
on the day that Jjo-kkan died,

489
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,332
and why you were out late tonight.

490
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:48,297
You said you did not remember anything
about your younger days when I asked you.

491
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,090
But I suppose that is not true.

492
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,178
So tell me now.

493
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,555
Was it really the Snow Man who took you?

494
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,265
What happened to you that day?

495
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,644
And why did you lie? I think
I deserve the truth after all these years.

496
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,937
The truth is too dangerous.

497
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,273
- What?
- If I told you, what would that change?

498
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,733
What good would it do?

499
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,194
You should take care of yourself.

500
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,404
And stop worrying so much
about everyone else.

501
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,659
Let others watch out for you for once.

502
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,289
Others?

503
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,461
- Wait.
- I feel furious.

504
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,797
So furious that I feel
like my insides are on fire.

505
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,217
Why?

506
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,679
What is making you so furious?

507
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,765
It pains me that you see me as someone
who cannot face the truth.

508
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,267
You mistake my intentions.

509
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,437
And that my unwillingness to recognize you
caused you to suffer further alone.

510
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,065
You hide things from me
because I have not gained your trust.

511
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,149
That is not so.

512
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,156
But I do fear certain truths.

513
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,199
Why?

514
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,288
<i>There are aspects of me</i>
<i>that I would never want you to see.</i>

515
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,209
Why would you not want me to know
that you were the one who saved Mu-jin?

516
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,753
You never said anything
when I was so awful to you.

517
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,047
Why would you
keep something like that to yourself?

518
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,675
- I hated it.
- But why?

519
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,093
It hurt.

520
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,556
<i>Seeing you saddened for his sake</i>

521
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,433
<i>and knowing what he means to you.</i>

522
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:26,228
You were the one who took me to my room,
making sure I survived that wedding.

523
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,943
I feel

524
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,362
anxious whenever you leave my sight.

525
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,823
I miss you
the second we are no longer together.

526
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,826
It is frightening how I need you.
How you have turned into…

527
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,997
the man my heart yearns for.

528
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,216
This time is not a dream.

529
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,029
Jae-yi, I…

530
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,033
I have some news

531
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,910
that I fear will upset you.

532
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,245
Can it not wait?

533
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:07,955
It should not.

534
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,833
I must have gone mad, brother.

535
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,501
What?

536
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,211
I do not feel that I am in my right mind.

537
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,046
Hongrang…

538
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,717
I have started to feel…

539
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,388
an attraction.

540
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,100
I do not know what to do.

541
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,859
Your heart is confused.

542
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,070
He is your

543
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,823
little brother.

544
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,287
You cannot see him as a man.

545
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,582
All of these years
you have yearned for his return

546
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,751
have left you lost and confused.

547
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,837
Jae-yi, I…

548
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,340
You cannot stay here.

549
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,594
Get away from him.

550
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,804
Come away with me, far from him.

551
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,347
The distance

552
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,641
will allow you to remember who he is.

553
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,144
I beg you.

554
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,647
Come with me.

555
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,753
You cannot do this.

556
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,880
If you keep the truth
about his identity a secret,

557
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,673
you will lose
all that you have worked for.

558
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,759
You have discovered
the evidence that will save you.

559
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,345
How can you consider
destroying it? My lord!

560
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,722
My life will be nothing.

561
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,975
Nothing else matters
without her in my life.

562
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,436
If I lost Jae-yi,
I would not have the strength to…

563
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,814
to force air into my lungs.

564
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,151
I could not live a single day
without her love.

565
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,209
<i>I was glad to be reunited with you.</i>

566
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,461
<i>Thank you for coming back.</i>

567
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,505
<i>I wish you well.</i>

568
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,259
I have decided to leave.

569
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,221
What?

570
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,770
I will be going with Mu-jin.

571
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,064
It is for the best.

572
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,028
What you want…

573
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,365
is to leave

574
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,492
with your brother?

575
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,410
To be by his side…

576
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,373
instead of mine?
