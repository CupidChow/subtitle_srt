1
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,128
DEAR HONGRANG

2
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,181
Who sent you here?

3
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,892
Who is the mastermind pulling your strings

4
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,936
and instructing the black-robed swordsmen?

5
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,437
Father--

6
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,778
That is all you want?

7
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,491
You have seen this hideous thing
on your son's body.

8
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,495
Are you not curious to know what it is
and how it even got there?

9
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,959
How dare you call me your father?

10
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,881
Do you actually believe you can still
keep up with this insane act of yours?

11
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,844
Why do you not think I am your son?

12
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,846
Is it really so hard to believe

13
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,141
Hongrang could have this on his back?

14
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,768
What makes you so certain I am not him?

15
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,396
I know.

16
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,356
While everyone else recoiled,

17
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,984
you were the only one
who was unfazed by it.

18
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,694
It was as though…

19
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,239
you recognized it.

20
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,033
The painter.

21
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,326
Where is he?

22
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,871
Who is he?
Who did this? I want to know <i>now</i>!

23
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,879
Chief Merchant Sim,

24
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,840
where are you going?

25
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,426
The painter. Tell me who he is!

26
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,638
Tell me.

27
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,223
I need to know!

28
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,251
Yes. He is definitely
the slave we had in our household.

29
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,878
The mole on his knee
was there since he was born,

30
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,630
and that disfigured toe,

31
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,174
I believe he injured it
when he was three or four years old.

32
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,133
Huh.

33
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,722
In other words,
the mole and disfigured toe

34
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,767
that Hongrang may have sustained
after his disappearance

35
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,353
are an exact match
to those of your household slave?

36
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,312
Correct.

37
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,233
Very well. Might I ask
what happened to that slave?

38
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,568
He was caught after attempting an escape.

39
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,029
Then a woman came
and offered to buy the both of them.

40
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,406
Both? There were two?

41
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,826
He was not alone
when you caught him after his escape?

42
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,537
He was with another child who was a mute.

43
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,706
Then a woman came
and offered to buy the both of them.

44
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,749
I recall his name being In-hoe.

45
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,712
They are telling lies!

46
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,339
They are committing perjury!

47
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,591
How dare you come in here
and defame my son?!

48
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,594
Perjury is what you have
been committing until now.

49
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,098
- What did you say?
- Tell me honestly.

50
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,225
Were you truly unaware

51
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,227
that he was an imposter?

52
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,535
This is the sales document
regarding the slave named Rodent Scrap.

53
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,538
It not only confirms the man
who has been impersonating Hongrang

54
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,874
is nothing but a slave with a broken body,

55
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,376
but that he is undoubtedly an imposter.

56
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,838
- Grandmaster.
- Yes, Father?

57
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,591
I order your reinstatement as grandmaster.

58
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,594
This will restore the guild
from the disarray it is in.

59
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,846
I want the mute called In-hoe captured.

60
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,182
- He has been working with the imposter.
- How could you?

61
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,143
Furthermore, I order Lady Min
confined to her quarters

62
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,854
for appointing an imposter
to the position of grandmaster

63
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,398
in order to assert her authority
in the guild.

64
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,777
How could you do this?

65
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,113
How could you lead your own son to ruin?

66
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,992
What kind of father are you?
You are not a father!

67
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:14,165
But was Hongrang ever truly my son, madam?

68
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,607
My brother was the one
who brought proof, you say?

69
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,488
My lady,

70
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,615
say it is not so.

71
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,201
There must be some kind of mistake.

72
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,787
Our young master Hongrang,

73
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
he is your brother, is he not?

74
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,632
Where is Mother?
Where is she? What is she doing?

75
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,354
Yuk-son.

76
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,897
Yes, my lady?

77
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,899
I know he is my son.

78
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,653
Undoubtedly,

79
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,572
I know that boy is mine.

80
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,509
Is this the reason

81
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,387
you did not tell me
that Hongrang was an imposter?

82
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,348
Yes.

83
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,769
That is how desperately
I wanted you to stay with me.

84
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,357
Were you the one

85
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,652
who had that old man deliver me
that drugged drink in the mountains?

86
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,988
I was willing to do whatever it took
to have you back with me.

87
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,077
Let me go!

88
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,496
You… you must marry me, Jae-yi.

89
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,334
I… am already married.

90
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,506
That bastard will disappear.

91
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,508
Mother's influence is waning.

92
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,553
I will regain my position soon enough.

93
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:18,474
Then you will marry me, and the two of us
shall lead the guild together.

94
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,937
That is the only way you shall live,
and the path you will take.

95
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,570
I do not need your consent.

96
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,197
I am not here to ask for your permission.

97
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,796
I wish you to set
the wedding date, Father.

98
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,173
The disownment should come
before marriage, should it not?

99
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,550
We will marry first.

100
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,011
You can use consanguineous marriage
as reason for disownment.

101
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596
Do you really have no regard

102
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,266
for how your actions will affect
public opinion and the guild's standing?

103
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,728
Everyone knows the truth.
Jae-yi and I are not related by blood.

104
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:08,274
Furthermore, you almost became
the previous chief merchant's stepson,

105
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,276
but ended up as his son-in-law instead.

106
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,612
This should not be considered
that unusual either.

107
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,615
Jae-yi has agreed
to give you her hand, has she?

108
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
Why would you ask such a thing?

109
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,542
You have never taken her will
into account about anything, Father.

110
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,669
My reasons are my own.

111
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,339
I presented proof
that he is an imposter, did I not?

112
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,636
Yes, but you failed to keep your word
on bringing them back here, I recall.

113
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,637
In the end,

114
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,848
you needed my assistance, did you not?

115
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,477
We must find the mastermind behind this
to prevent future issues,

116
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,146
and obtain the partition deed
from my wife.

117
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,731
It is of utmost importance.

118
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,652
Chief Merchant Sim.

119
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,657
His Royal Highness has ordered
the imposter be brought to him, my lord.

120
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,203
Why is that? Because of that drawing
that we all saw on his back?

121
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,788
You told me not to harm it.

122
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,790
You strictly cautioned me about it.

123
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,793
Even the most sought-after horse
is regarded

124
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,171
as nothing more than a useless
and harmful creature

125
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,673
when it is left untamed.

126
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,680
You may sharpen your sword.

127
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,850
However, I will not tolerate
you swinging it before me.

128
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,489
Have Bang Ji-ryeon watched,
and never let him out of your sight.

129
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,907
Yes, my lord.

130
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,662
It has been a long time
since I sent word to you.

131
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,205
Forgive me, Your Highness.

132
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,501
I nearly considered going there myself.
I had to… try to be patient.

133
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,795
Forgive me, Your Highness.

134
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,422
And yet…

135
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,300
here you are, empty-handed.

136
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,219
Forgive me, Your Highness.

137
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,972
Is that all you can utter,
Chief Merchant?!

138
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,099
With all due respect, Your Highness,

139
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:09,311
the man who was impersonating Hongrang
is being questioned at this very moment.

140
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,312
What?

141
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,691
The drawing on his back
that you are so curious to see

142
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,985
is shockingly vulgar and promiscuous.

143
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,154
So explicit and lewd

144
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,408
that it is simply unsuitable
for Your Grace's eyes to behold.

145
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,373
Your Highness,

146
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,126
I once witnessed something.

147
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,671
I saw two feral dogs locked in a struggle,

148
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,007
literally at each other's throats.

149
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,178
Can you hazard a guess
as to which of the two dogs

150
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,264
ultimately triumphed in the battle?

151
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,893
It was not the one
that stubbornly clung to the end.

152
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,686
It was the one that let go.

153
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,773
That released its hold
at just the right moment.

154
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,191
It ultimately triumphed.

155
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,069
You see, it had been observing
the other dog bleed through its wound

156
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,030
and chose the right moment to let go.

157
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,865
Now, that is truly

158
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,203
the wisest way
to beat an opponent stronger than you are.

159
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,038
Do you not think so, Your Highness?

160
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,500
What nonsense you speak!

161
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,754
I see.

162
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,299
You wish to speak in metaphors.

163
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,176
I wish you would, uh,

164
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,261
speak your mind.

165
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,182
What is it that you need?

166
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,478
I am deeply honored, Your Highness.

167
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,022
I would like to inform you that

168
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,150
I will be making a request shortly.

169
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,403
Go now.

170
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,086
Oh, that man.

171
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,843
What remarkable audacity he possesses.

172
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,180
Now that you have dared test your god…

173
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,061
I shall shower you with heavenly thunder.

174
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,233
His Royal Highness will make a move soon.

175
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,654
We must be ready
to move the imposter at a moment's notice.

176
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,114
Yes, my lord.

177
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,800
<i>I am</i>

178
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,011
<i>right here</i>

179
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,805
<i>with you.</i>

180
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,761
What brings you here at this hour?

181
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,263
I am here to arrest
the one who has been posing as your son.

182
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,182
But I never filed a report, sir.
How could--

183
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,017
These are orders from above.

184
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,769
Where is he?

185
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,314
I recommend you act quickly
and hand him over immediately.

186
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,859
Stop them! We must not lose him!

187
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,370
Get it!

188
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,373
This way!

189
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,282
Go now.

190
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,095
What will happen if you ever get caught?

191
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,263
Then

192
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,059
I suggest you take the opportunity
and use me as a simple pawn.

193
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,353
The chief merchant will announce
that I am an imposter

194
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,230
and implicate Lady Min as my accomplice.

195
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,442
Then the partition deed
will be handed over to the chief merchant,

196
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,444
and the tables will be turned
in his favor.

197
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,280
Lady Min, sensing the impending ruin
of her family name,

198
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,324
will try to hand the deed over to me.

199
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,785
Not only does the deed represent
the guild's wealth,

200
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,370
it details decades
of the guild's corrupt practices.

201
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,040
It also has the power
to keep wealthy families and patrons

202
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:03,999
under its control.

203
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,377
So, to save me and protect herself,
she will have to give it to me.

204
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,048
Before that happens, the chief merchant
would try to get rid of you, would he not?

205
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,885
He would seek to strike a deal
for himself, using me as leverage.

206
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,220
That is when we should be able

207
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,806
to uncover the mastermind
pulling the strings behind him.

208
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,682
With the drawing on my back now exposed,

209
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,103
it is only a matter of time
until we find out their identity.

210
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,964
<i>The one who seeks</i>

211
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,717
<i>to obtain my body,</i>
<i>which has now lost its use and purpose…</i>

212
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,720
…<i>is</i>

213
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,056
<i>the painter.</i>

214
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,811
Is it truly you?

215
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,188
Is it?

216
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,857
Yes, and here you are.

217
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,986
You belong to me. You always have.

218
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,395
I am so sorry. I…

219
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,648
I did not recognize you sooner.
I should have.

220
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,132
So… His Highness
took him by force, did he?

221
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,593
He had the government army, my lord.

222
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,595
They were stationed on every street.

223
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,807
He purposely

224
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:30,187
sent them our way
to force us into moving him,

225
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,690
which is when he intended to intercept us.

226
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,194
How could you have fallen
for such a predictable plan?

227
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,320
How could you?!

228
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,635
I have asked you a question.

229
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,846
What was your reason
for handing the imposter over?

230
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,267
Fine, then.

231
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,228
You do not have to say anything.

232
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,313
I could just ask Father myself.

233
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,986
Once Father learns about this,
what do you think will happen to you?

234
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,614
Everything you have amassed
from betraying your master over the years

235
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,949
will all be for naught.

236
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,953
You will not be able
to save either yourself or your family

237
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,247
from the consequences of this.

238
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,498
Young master.

239
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,126
It has been a while

240
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,461
since you called me by that name.

241
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,171
What is it you would have me do, my lord?

242
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,966
Well,

243
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,095
I would like you
to take me to your real master.

244
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,223
My son has disappeared?

245
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,895
Move aside!

246
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,027
I said, move aside!

247
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,362
Please! Come inside with me, my lady.

248
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,990
Let go of me! Now!

249
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,950
No! No!

250
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,456
Yuk-son,

251
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,001
please find my son for me.

252
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,464
You must do it.

253
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,090
Find him.

254
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,643
Grand Prince Hanpyeong is the painter?

255
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,480
Of all people… This is most troubling.

256
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,275
Approaching Hongrang will be a challenge.
Retrieving him will be impossible.

257
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,028
Yes. Some of our men are stationed
around the grand prince's manor

258
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,404
to observe suspicious activity.

259
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,989
Surveillance is challenging,

260
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,992
as the grand prince has his men
stationed around the manor.

261
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,953
He is guarding against Chief Merchant Sim
and Min Yeon-ui's forces.

262
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,707
Even if there were an opening, he is not
an opponent we can easily confront.

263
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,252
We would need a justifiable reason
or hard proof.

264
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,296
- My lady.
- Why did he do it?

265
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,632
What motivated the grand prince?

266
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,509
He has marked Hongrang
and the other children

267
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,428
with drawings on their bodies
for years now.

268
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:13,016
He has made an enemy of Chief Merchant Sim
for stealing Hongrang away from him.

269
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,353
This was a close relationship
that has endured for many years.

270
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,939
He must have
a compelling reason for his actions.

271
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,359
Yet we do not know
what his intentions are.

272
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,043
The painting of fertility
is in poor condition,

273
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,753
so we must act quickly.

274
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:28,550
Expedite the repairs on the bell tower
and start preparing for the grand event.

275
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,093
Yes, Your Highness.

276
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,555
However, Your Grace,
you have a guest waiting for you.

277
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,724
It will be Chief Merchant Sim.

278
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,392
It is not, Your Highness.

279
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,608
I urge you to cast aside what you had

280
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,819
and take me under your wing
instead, Your Highness.

281
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,759
- Who are you people? What do you want?!
- These are my brothers.

282
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,636
<i>I grew up with these men.</i>

283
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:16,139
<i>This is the life that I led.</i>
<i>This is the kind of life I led.</i>

284
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,741
- Pardon me.
- Yes, my lord.

285
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,549
What are you doing here?
Do you wish to die? Is that it?

286
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,803
Is he in there?

287
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,681
What if he is? What will you do?

288
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,974
Why are you here, then?

289
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,019
Are you here on Father's orders
to bring him back?

290
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,815
Have you seen him?

291
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,067
Is he all right? Tell me, please.

292
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,861
It was Father.

293
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,364
What?

294
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,909
The one who destroyed and ruined
that bastard was your father,

295
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,452
Chief Merchant Sim.

296
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,829
You are nothing to that imposter

297
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,665
but the daughter of an enemy
he intends to exact his revenge upon.

298
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,041
Can you not see that?

299
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,296
Even if he showed a mere semblance
of sincerity toward you,

300
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,840
he would never be able
to overcome the truth.

301
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,841
Every time he sees you,

302
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,969
it will reignite the deep pain and anger
he has suppressed for so long.

303
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,597
He will resent the very blood
that runs through your veins.

304
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,556
Therefore,

305
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,641
you must be the first to walk away.

306
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,601
I will not.

307
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,646
If what you say is true,
that gives me even more reason to stay.

308
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,897
What?

309
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,401
If Father cannot ask for forgiveness,
then I will atone for his sins.

310
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,528
He has bewitched you!
Has it not crossed your mind

311
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,406
that this could all be
part of his grand scheme of revenge?

312
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,908
If it means he can have his revenge,
find some comfort,

313
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,369
and heal his wounded heart, then so be it.

314
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,707
I sincerely hope he gets his way.

315
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,543
Why?!

316
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,670
Why is it that you only have eyes
for that bastard

317
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,506
who has been nothing but deceitful to us?

318
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,509
Why is it that you are blind to see

319
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,095
the love I have always had for you?

320
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,477
It does not matter.

321
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,812
I do not care if you see it or not.

322
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,732
I shall embrace
that sullied body and heart of yours.

323
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,525
I will. I promise you that.

324
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,655
Is this what you call affection?

325
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,531
Is that what you think this is?

326
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,869
If that is what you truly feel for me,
then stop fooling yourself.

327
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,997
It is but an obsession
for what you cannot have!

328
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,042
That is what this is.

329
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,973
<i>The ceremony shall be held</i>
<i>on the day of the water pig.</i>

330
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,478
<i>Prepare 75,000 nyang of copper,</i>
<i>27,000 nyang of tin,</i>

331
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,439
<i>and 5,500 nyang of gold.</i>

332
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,568
<i>If you manage this successfully,</i>
<i>you shall not have complete redemption,</i>

333
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,612
<i>but I shall spare your life.</i>

334
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,825
So you say
His Grace gave you this letter himself?

335
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,243
Yes.

336
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,789
His Highness also orders that you use me
to execute the orders written there.

337
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,336
What is this? You dare try to replace me?

338
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,587
As I should.

339
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,507
What is it that has you so vexed?

340
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,009
I am simply following in your footsteps

341
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,721
and living up to your expectations.

342
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,597
You once said

343
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,268
that I should aim to embody your essence,
did you not?

344
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,065
Please obey His Grace's order, Father.
I will follow your lead.

345
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,568
I have always done that,

346
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,487
to your advantage.

347
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,087
Hmm?

348
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,894
Master, we have detected unusual movements

349
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,522
by the chief merchant's forces
and the grand prince's.

350
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,815
What do you mean?

351
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,789
<i>Hundreds of newborn animals</i>

352
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,334
<i>are being continually brought</i>
<i>to the grand prince's country manor.</i>

353
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,213
<i>Also, large quantities</i>
<i>of various types of grain, silk,</i>

354
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,632
<i>and unidentified items</i>
<i>are arriving at the estate.</i>

355
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,468
<i>There are even locks of virgins' hair.</i>

356
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,929
We are unsure why, but Chief Merchant Sim

357
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,141
is transporting large amounts of copper
and tin across dangerous terrains.

358
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,690
Please… please spare us!

359
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,313
They are preparing for a ritual.

360
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:48,489
Cleansing oneself with the blood
of recently born creatures.

361
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,826
<i>Burning locks of virgin hair as incense</i>

362
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,953
<i>and preparing grain and liquor.</i>

363
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,338
These are Spiritual Ascension
ritual procedures.

364
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,297
Spiritual Ascension?

365
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,593
A forbidden ritual that has been
passed down in the shadows.

366
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,221
<i>It is practiced by those arrogant enough</i>
<i>to abandon their humanity</i>

367
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,433
<i>in pursuit of transcending</i>
<i>into a higher being.</i>

368
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,518
<i>It stems from the depth of greed.</i>

369
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,605
<i>One elevates oneself and becomes a god.</i>

370
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,200
<i>The ritual starts</i>
<i>by activating six talismans,</i>

371
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,661
each symbolizing a different aspect.

372
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,703
Fortune,

373
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,996
<i>fertility,</i>

374
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,999
<i>wealth, and longevity,</i>

375
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,168
the ability to control nature,

376
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,504
and the balance of yin and yang.

377
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:49,509
The ritual concludes with dissolving
these talismans in liquid bronze

378
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,095
to create a sound-producing object

379
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,013
designed to resonate
throughout the country.

380
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,640
So the talisman is…

381
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,185
the drawings on their backs.

382
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,144
Correct.

383
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,441
They are living talismans.

384
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,736
- That way! We must catch him!
- Yes, sir!

385
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,175
What is this?

386
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,555
After him.

387
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,424
What are…

388
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,051
what are you trying to do?

389
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:18,264
Mm, do not be afraid,
for you have been laced with my spirit.

390
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,641
You all

391
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,438
shall become the sound that will encompass

392
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,067
the energy of the world.

393
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,571
- We must hurry and rescue Hongrang!
- Abandon him.

394
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,073
What?

395
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,369
He no longer wields the wealth,
power, and influence

396
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,205
over the Min Family's Guild.

397
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,666
It is not worth the risk to save him.

398
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,294
Min Ban-hyo, Min Yeon-ui's father,

399
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,004
brutally massacred

400
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,092
my priestess mother and sisters overnight.

401
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,305
His reasoning was this.

402
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,682
We had refused to put a curse

403
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,936
on a certain individual
that he found repulsive.

404
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,854
That was why they were killed.

405
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,025
The sacrifices that were made that day

406
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,529
are what have formed the basis
of our resolve, have they not?

407
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,907
We should then consider

408
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,870
that child a foundation
for the fulfillment of our cause.

409
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,957
Our failure to eliminate
all wickedness will now

410
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,044
require many more sacrifices
in the future.

411
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,594
Master, Chief Merchant Sim's daughter
is here.

412
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,962
My orders were that no one is to enter.

413
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,058
How dare you enter these grounds?
This is all your fault!

414
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,853
If you had not seduced my son
into running away with you…

415
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,815
No, no. It was not only you.
It was also your father and that stake.

416
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:37,278
You all worked together to have my son
labeled as an imposter, did you not?!

417
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,738
Hongrang is

418
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,698
not an imposter.

419
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,616
What?

420
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,374
He truly is my little brother.

421
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,378
He carried this with him.

422
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,382
When I was young,
I pulled Hongrang's tooth out.

423
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,343
I put it in here for him.

424
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,908
Yes.

425
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,244
My son.

426
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,079
Yes.

427
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,581
He is my son.

428
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,380
I need your help.

429
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,131
I want to rescue him.

430
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,010
My sweet little brother.

431
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,576
It is I, Jae-yi.

432
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,954
I am here.

433
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,878
Please be strong

434
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,922
just a while longer.

435
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,256
I will get you out of there.

436
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,592
How did you get in?

437
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,928
You must leave before they--

438
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,137
I met with the master.

439
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,932
She said she needed to be sure

440
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,893
that you could provide her
with the partition deed.

441
00:39:56,477 --> 00:40:00,439
And Mother told me to tell you this,
which should lead you right to the deed.

442
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,360
"Stroke the shoulders of Mong-jun."

443
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,905
"The shoulders of Mong-jun."

444
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,243
Tell the master
that I have secured the partition deed.

445
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,496
Then tell her, in three days at midnight,

446
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,874
beneath the gorge in the saddle,
Inwang Mountain,

447
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,793
she will find all the proof she needs.

448
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,131
Will you be all right until then?

449
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,637
I am all right.

450
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,265
Jae-yi, I…

451
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,226
Have you checked over there?

452
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,645
I checked everything
and found nothing unusual, sir.

453
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,729
Go.

454
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,440
Hurry.

455
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,692
You must go.

456
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,047
Go.

457
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,883
Please.

458
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:33,032
Oh, mighty mountain deities,
listen to the pleas of this soul.

459
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,035
We call upon you now,
asking you to shower us

460
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,954
with your mysterious light
for protection and guidance.

461
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,249
Let this soul intertwine with yours
and unite as one.

462
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,003
Oh, mountain deities,
the highest of the high, may you grant…

463
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,468
Do not stand idle! Catch him!

464
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,922
Stop! Do not harm him.

465
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,134
You must not damage my talisman.

466
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,734
Catch them! I order you
to secure all of my talismans!

467
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,705
I heard it was my father.

468
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,251
The person who did this to you.

469
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,088
It was my father.

470
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,173
But why…

471
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,551
What… Why do you…

472
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,181
Why do you love me so?

473
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,934
I deserve to die.

474
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:42,938
I am sorry.

475
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,774
I have caused you so much pain.

476
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,528
I am so sorry.

477
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,081
I love you.

478
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,649
Hand over the partition deed
and then leave.

479
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,444
You have fulfilled your purpose.

480
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,404
We have identified the painter,

481
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,448
and I have proof of his actions
in my hands.

482
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,033
I no longer have use for you.

483
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,577
Where is In-hoe?

484
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,829
I have not seen him here.

485
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,751
He, too, is none of your concern now.
He will remain with me.

486
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,462
He is mine.

487
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,422
I shall be the one to use him.

488
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,717
So you… are abandoning me, then?

489
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,761
You were the one who first betrayed me.

490
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,513
You no longer need to be involved
to seek revenge.

491
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,848
So leave.

492
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,103
I will bring you the partition deed, but…

493
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,109
I have one favor to ask.

494
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,403
Jae-yi's younger brother.

495
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,907
Please tell me where he is.

496
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,703
You raised me to become Hongrang
from the moment we met.

497
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,791
But you never considered for a moment

498
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,251
that the real Hongrang
could return someday.

499
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,089
That means that you were
entirely convinced that he never would.

500
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,846
If you knew,
what difference would it make now?

501
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,099
I need to know.

502
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,937
I want her to stop dwelling upon it.

503
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,190
I do not want her to live like this.

504
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,150
Her life consists of waiting.

505
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:58,323
A life of endless longing and not knowing
whether he's alive or dead.

506
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,200
She deserves the chance to see him again.

507
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,954
She could give him a heartfelt embrace or…

508
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,415
or say her final goodbye.

509
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,923
I wish for that child, for Jae-yi,

510
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,136
to lead the life she deserves to have.

511
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,358
Goodness me.

512
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,987
Pull that up, quick. Hurry now.

513
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,446
Sure.

514
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,533
We're almost done. Hurry!

515
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,910
- There was a lot of water.
- Who would have known?

516
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,497
Wait, what is that? Young mistress.

517
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,916
Oh, my lady!

518
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,326
I never imagined

519
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,662
you would be this close by.

520
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,000
You were always by my side, yes.

521
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,879
Forgive me for not knowing and

522
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,006
for being so late.

523
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,093
Here you are,

524
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,095
Hongrang.

525
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,602
Hongrang!

526
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:53,980
Hongrang!
