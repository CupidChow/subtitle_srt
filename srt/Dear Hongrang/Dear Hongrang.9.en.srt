1
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,514
Once he realized we were closing in,

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,226
he decided to make Jae-yi his prisoner,
hold her captive to force my hand.

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,645
Which indicates he acts under orders.

4
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,815
And a specific objective that will ensure
the young mistress's safety.

5
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,775
We must capture him and get answers.

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,111
Someone is pulling the strings
and we need to know who.

7
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,237
But more importantly--

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,865
He must be exposed
for the imposter that he is!

9
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,785
It is the only way
to repair your tarnished reputation

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,288
and regain your authority in the guild.

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,081
And by claiming that he is a fraud,

12
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,126
you also wish to be reinstated
as grandmaster of this household?

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,253
I only wish to expose the truth.

14
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,923
For I am in possession of proof
that he is not Hongrang.

15
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,054
Show it, then,

16
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,847
this proof you have.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,766
Whatever it is, I demand you present it.

18
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,142
And I demand

19
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,269
to be rewarded for finding it.

20
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,729
What?

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,357
You were quick to turn on me once already,
were you not?

22
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,530
I will reinstate you, then.

23
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,658
That is not nearly enough.

24
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,997
I ask for proper compensation.

25
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,920
State your conditions.

26
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,342
Disown me.

27
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,470
Because I love your daughter.

28
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,181
Disown me…

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,018
so that I can marry Jae-yi.

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,041
DEAR HONGRANG

31
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,389
There is written proof
that Hongrang is not who he says?

32
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,560
That cannot be.

33
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,021
He has been caught in a web of lies.

34
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,731
Woven by

35
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,775
my husband,

36
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,069
his lowly stake, and his filthy daughter.

37
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,821
They have conspired against my son

38
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,282
to drive out the true heir
and take over the guild.

39
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,160
I suggest we make haste
to thwart your husband.

40
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,412
He has assembled a force
to kill your son, my lady.

41
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,538
He cannot die.

42
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,290
You are to retrieve my son safely.

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,959
You cannot allow those assassins
to lay a hand on him.

44
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,919
Assemble your men this instant.

45
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,880
You must save Hongrang,
no matter the cost.

46
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,590
As for the wench he is with,

47
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,217
kill her.

48
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,970
How could you let this happen?!

49
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,056
Such a disappointing lack of duty.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,060
You were supposed to protect him,
but also watch for transgressions.

51
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,855
This would be an unfortunate moment
for us to lose him.

52
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,690
Without the partition deed

53
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,735
we are no longer in position
to remove Sim from his stronghold,

54
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,237
even with proof of his wrongdoing
and who supports them.

55
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,948
Without that deed, we are no match
for the Min Guild's resources.

56
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,284
We cannot battle on all fronts.

57
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,248
Do we have any word from our leader?

58
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,963
The orders are for us to find Hongrang
and to bring him back at all costs.

59
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,592
We are also to consider this
as an opportunity

60
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,720
to discover who is pulling
Chief Merchant Sim's strings.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,766
You keep close watch
of the chief merchant, brother.

62
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,519
As for you, Deputy Leader,
you cannot allow

63
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,898
Chief Merchant Sim or Min Yeon-ui's forces
to find Hongrang before you.

64
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,025
You must pit them against each other.

65
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,818
Fuel their mutual hatred and rivalry.

66
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,280
Create false leads and bring them
to clash to delay their progress.

67
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,908
Understood. Do you believe
Hongrang will return of his own accord?

68
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,953
What matters is his return,
not the manner in which he does.

69
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,915
But Sim Jae-yi shall not return.

70
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,584
Get rid of her
and disguise it as Min Yeon-ui's doing.

71
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,106
- That way.
- Come!

72
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,905
Hyah!

73
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,281
Ha! Ha!

74
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,168
So much hardship.

75
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,213
And hopelessness.

76
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,759
I disagree.

77
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,970
Because now I understand…

78
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,683
…just how much
I was holding back all this time.

79
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,226
And how deeply…

80
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,605
I desire you.

81
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,610
I would accept any fate
that allowed me to be close to you.

82
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,821
All I need is to be by your side.

83
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,199
You are my home.

84
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,618
But you are far from yours.

85
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,413
Perhaps you regret this.

86
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,250
Which is why it is hard.

87
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,044
Perhaps it is too hard.

88
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,047
Is that why you feel hopeless?

89
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:59,729
Not at all. Now that I have ridden
far enough from those walls,

90
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,607
I can see certain things
so much more clearly.

91
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,487
What bothered me was not the harsh words
and cold treatment

92
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,239
that I endured from Mother
or my father's indifference to it.

93
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,450
Or his exploitative actions,

94
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,951
his judging my value.

95
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,664
I endured all of it…

96
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,668
because I had never known otherwise.

97
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,253
Then you came,

98
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,672
and what was truly too much
for me to endure…

99
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,220
was that I could not show you

100
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,764
how much I loved you in that household.

101
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,103
So even if things become more difficult
and feel hopeless at times,

102
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,981
and I find myself
regretting this decision…

103
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,069
my heart will endure each instant.

104
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,081
I will survive with you,

105
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,668
side by side, exactly as we are tonight.

106
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,442
Shh!

107
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,915
- After them!
- Yes, sir!

108
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
We must be
the first to find them!

109
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,303
Take their weapons and clothes
and catch up to us.

110
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,097
Forward.

111
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,578
- Spread out on the flanks!
- Yes, sir!

112
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,501
- Scour every inch!
- Yes, sir!

113
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,388
- See anything?
- No traces.

114
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,140
- Over there?
- Nothing, sir.

115
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,393
The grandmaster's forces
are approaching.

116
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,353
We must go back down.

117
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,175
<i>I know that you wanted me</i>
<i>to leave with you for my own good.</i>

118
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,510
<i>You have always watched over me.</i>

119
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,972
<i>I also believed</i>
<i>that it was the best choice</i>

120
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,141
<i>for myself and everyone else.</i>

121
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,852
<i>But I was wrong</i>…

122
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,940
<i>…because now I finally know</i>
<i>where my heart is.</i>

123
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,942
Hmm.

124
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,654
<i>If I could control one moment in my life,</i>
<i>this would be it.</i>

125
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,365
<i>Because what I want most right now</i>

126
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,160
<i>is to be with Hongrang.</i>

127
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,119
The woods?

128
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,539
<i>I know</i>
<i>that it is heartless of me to ask,</i>

129
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,627
<i>but I hope that you can live</i>
<i>not for me or Father,</i>

130
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,712
<i>but for yourself.</i>

131
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,965
<i>Once Hongrang and I disappear,</i>

132
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,468
<i>Father will have no choice</i>
<i>but to hold on to you.</i>

133
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,261
<i>But please,</i>

134
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,139
<i>do not put all of your trust</i>
<i>in him any longer.</i>

135
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,934
How wrong you are.

136
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,896
What I most strongly desire

137
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,857
is not to inherit the guild.

138
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,068
And the person I always trusted

139
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,279
was you above all others.

140
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,034
My heart belongs to you.

141
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,870
But you do not see how.

142
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,121
Or choose not to.

143
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,626
Because you prefer not to see this truth.

144
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,550
Grandmaster, sir.

145
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,176
We have suffered many casualties.

146
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,775
The Soul Reaper,
he is responsible for these deaths.

147
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,860
No, my lord.

148
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,115
This seems to be the work
of Yuk-son's men.

149
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,118
This confirms they will stop at nothing.
We need to find Jae-yi quickly.

150
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,204
Yuk-son has no interest
in bringing her back alive.

151
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,832
Find a way to distract his men
from their mission immediately.

152
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,126
If I may, sir.

153
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,213
I say this with much respect.
Our mission is to capture the assassin.

154
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,465
Finding young mistress
cannot override that.

155
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,509
I do not only want to find her.

156
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,804
I intend to reclaim her.

157
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,240
Here you are, miss. Thank you.

158
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,454
Get rid of Jae-yi
before Hongrang comes back.

159
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,708
Mm!

160
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,429
Jae-yi!

161
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,259
Hyah!

162
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
Hyah!

163
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,128
This girl…

164
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,255
I suppose I see a resemblance.

165
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,006
Did she say where she was going?

166
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,551
No, but she asked
if there was an inn near here,

167
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,679
so I sent her over that way
to the inn outside the village.

168
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,806
I thank you. Move out.

169
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,187
You did well.

170
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,398
Should anyone else ask about her,

171
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,317
please tell them the same thing.

172
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,030
Of course, my lord.

173
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,122
You said you could live

174
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,751
and that you would be fine
with me by your side.

175
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,426
I will hold you, and you must endure.

176
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,678
Fight through this for me.

177
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,557
- Find them!
- Yes, sir!

178
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,573
The foot of the mountain?

179
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,117
We found no traces
of them there, sir.

180
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,267
You found traces of blood there?

181
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,020
Yes. And a poison arrow, also,
with a trace of blood.

182
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,483
Which means we have to assume
one of them is suffering its effects now.

183
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,986
Look for plants with antidotal properties,
search from there.

184
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,738
- We should be able to find a trail.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,586
- Go!
- Hyah!

186
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,482
Seize him!

187
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,498
The target is hit!

188
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,674
Hyah!

189
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,016
Over there!

190
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,927
Search up here.

191
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,268
I ask you

192
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,562
to stop the hunt.

193
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,023
My orders are
to ensure your return with us.

194
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,234
I will. I promise to return
when I'm ready.

195
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,402
You've betrayed our trust.

196
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,196
- Why would we accept your word?
- Her life is in grave danger.

197
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,449
If she dies, I will take my own life
the instant she takes her last breath.

198
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,451
I only want to get her somewhere safe.

199
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,747
I will make my way back after that.
All I can give is my word.

200
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,833
Please take it and leave.

201
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,420
I beg you.

202
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,173
Go, then.

203
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,439
Jae-yi!

204
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,255
I provided you with dozens
of the best mercenaries in the region

205
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,215
and you still let them both get away!

206
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,175
My apologies for this failure,

207
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,637
but Yuk-son and his soldiers
are causing us trouble at every turn.

208
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,140
Do not blame this on others!

209
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,142
We knew that Her Ladyship
would try to interfere.

210
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,561
She has made us look like fools
and lowly amateurs.

211
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,981
- We should be three steps ahead!
- We are closing in on the target.

212
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,692
- Your patience will be rewarded.
- I must take action.

213
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,612
I cannot stand around waiting
like a child.

214
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:55,947
Get the horses.

215
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,828
So Hongrang

216
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,914
is not your son but an imposter?

217
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,708
He is.

218
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,343
Huh.

219
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,263
For the long years since he went missing,

220
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,516
I have encouraged your search
with men, resources, and riches.

221
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,228
And you arrive here uninvited

222
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,607
to ask for us to find your daughter
this fraud has taken?

223
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,028
I beg you
for your benevolent assistance, Highness.

224
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,119
Of course.

225
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,331
Benevolence for your impertinence.

226
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,460
I have shown you favor

227
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:54,422
due to your willingness
and ability to consider the higher values.

228
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,175
Yet you dare to forget
your place as a lowly merchant

229
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,135
and display such insolent demands?

230
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,348
The nation's resources have been
at your disposal for 12 years!

231
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,642
Do you think you deserve more?

232
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,520
Your Highness, I beg you for mercy.

233
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,730
If you recognize your offense,

234
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,981
leave this instant.

235
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,945
I would like to make amends
and offer you a unique apology.

236
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,701
Allow me to be the one to reunite you

237
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,830
with the yin and yang artwork you lost.

238
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,094
Careful now.

239
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,102
Can you manage?

240
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,771
Yes.

241
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,230
There is an unoccupied house
on the mountaintop.

242
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:40,779
It appears that you had no choice but
to journey this far into the mountains.

243
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,906
I trust that you have your reasons.

244
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,248
Hmm.

245
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,749
Come here, beloved spouse.

246
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,588
Why would you call me that
when we are not married yet?

247
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,259
Because I think a beloved spouse
is someone you always want close.

248
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,976
Will you… be that for me?

249
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,857
Beloved spouse, please come lie down.

250
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,693
I want to see you up close.

251
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,673
For years

252
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,967
and years.

253
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,178
Eternal.

254
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,535
I promise…

255
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,581
I will not do that to you.

256
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,960
I will not make you feel lonely.

257
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,672
I will not keep you waiting.

258
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,383
I will always return home.

259
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,012
Home is at your side now.

260
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,222
Where you are.

261
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,725
You will always return?

262
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,191
Eternally.

263
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,838
How is it?

264
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,215
Do you like the taste?

265
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,716
Mm.

266
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,930
You need your strength. Eat all of it.

267
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,683
- You must be thirsty.
- Mm.

268
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,310
Oh! It's floating away!

269
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,327
- Catch!
- You rat!

270
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,373
Wait! I think I twisted my ankle!

271
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,209
Ah! Enough!

272
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,296
Stop! Here.

273
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,484
I have never looked at the stars

274
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,696
with such peace and wonder as this.

275
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,034
I would look at the sky
for countless hours

276
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,744
sitting on that roof at night,

277
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,496
but I have never seen the stars
as beautiful as they are now.

278
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,360
May I ask you,

279
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,196
what is the first thing you would say

280
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,532
if you saw your little brother again?

281
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:05,992
Mm…

282
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,913
"There you are."

283
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:15,918
Really?

284
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,213
"There you are"?

285
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,340
As if things were still the same

286
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,468
and I had not cried for him

287
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,013
all of these years.

288
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,309
How thoughtful.

289
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:35,521
And welcoming, as if he were simply home
where he belongs.

290
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,901
I… hope he feels that.

291
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,328
Hold out your arm.

292
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,422
How beautiful.

293
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,507
Just like you.

294
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,633
You like it?

295
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,179
Then please think of me when you see it.

296
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,723
I am right on your sleeve now.

297
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,600
So if you ever find yourself

298
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,310
feeling afraid

299
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,145
or anxious,

300
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,731
and you do not even realize
that you are in pain,

301
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,025
but your wound is bleeding again,

302
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,735
look at this.

303
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:32,036
Look at this flower
and remember that I am by your side.

304
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,100
Excuse me.

305
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,310
Do you

306
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,562
perhaps sell hairpins?

307
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,546
There you are.

308
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,630
What is wrong?

309
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,760
I swallowed a fly.

310
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,803
One moment.

311
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,924
- What brings you to visit, sir?
- I have a gift for you.

312
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,592
Sweet punch with ginger.

313
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,095
You are very kind.

314
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,723
- We do not have a gift to offer in return.
- Please do not worry, and enjoy.

315
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,061
You bastard. What have you done?

316
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,565
Hmm?

317
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,945
Are you all right?

318
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,281
Do not worry. I am right here.

319
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,886
Young mistress, what have they done?

320
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,346
Is she still alive?!

321
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,483
Hongrang!

322
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,238
My son!

323
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,283
How dare you?
Get out of my way this instant!

324
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,784
- Away with him.
- Hongrang!

325
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,376
What are you doing?
I want to see him! My son!

326
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,130
How dare you do this to him?
Give me my son!

327
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,312
Why are you
treating my son like a prisoner?

328
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,188
Give me my son!

329
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,523
Hold your tongue!

330
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,657
Tell all those assembled here

331
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,743
what you really are.

332
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,455
You will obey my order.

333
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,881
No!

334
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,427
<i>Whether you tear</i>
<i>or break his limbs off,</i>

335
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,262
<i>it does not matter.</i>

336
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,724
<i>But as for his torso,</i>

337
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,477
<i>you must leave his back unharmed.</i>

338
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,770
What is on his back?

339
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,300
<i>I could not tell you.</i>
<i>I was too ashamed.</i>

340
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,178
<i>Even for myself,</i>

341
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,763
<i>I was hideous.</i>

342
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,020
<i>Contemptible.</i>
