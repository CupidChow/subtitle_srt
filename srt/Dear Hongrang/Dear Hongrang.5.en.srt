1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,304
I beg you to let me live.

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,436
You must know
that I carry the chief merchant's child.

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,189
Your punishment will be swift
if you harm me.

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,275
I beg you to spare my child.

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,127
The chief merchant has spoken.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,047
<i>It was fate</i>

7
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,882
<i>that brought us together.</i>

8
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,552
I had lost a child, and you were orphaned.

9
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,930
Individually, we neither had the reason
nor strength to live on.

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,517
However, when brought together,
we found the will to forge a new path.

11
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,312
A shared purpose
in fulfilling the task given to us.

12
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,855
My son,

13
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:08,568
do you truly wish to disobey the orders
of those who gave you that purpose?

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,906
I was told to get rid of Sim Jae-yi.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,700
Did my orders
come directly from that person?

16
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,245
I have been loyal to their commands.

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,666
Yet I do not know their true purpose.
And their identity is a mystery.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,878
And I have always said
that when the time comes, you will know.

19
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,589
You are to complete your task.

20
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,675
Get rid of Chief Merchant Sim's daughter
and adopted son,

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,260
and take over as grandmaster.

22
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,346
Then you must take control
of the Min Family Guild.

23
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,514
That is our future.

24
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,017
Our future depends on the daughter.
His weakness.

25
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,521
Sim Jae-yi is more valuable to us alive.

26
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,147
She will prove useful against her father

27
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,775
once she believes
that I really am her long-lost brother.

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,699
Very well. Make her believe it.

29
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,203
Soon.

30
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,125
However, the instant we suspect
she's a hindrance to our mission,

31
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,584
you are to end her life.

32
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,044
Yes, my lady!

33
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,772
DEAR HONGRANG

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,959
I have been informed
as to what you really are…

35
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,087
Soul Reaper.

36
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,505
Soul Reaper.

37
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,095
What?

38
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,014
He killed all of them.
The assassins are dead.

39
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,765
Did he do something to my sister?

40
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,602
If the assassins engaged in battle,
she must have been in danger.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,897
That is not the reason.

42
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,027
Did you… send the assassins to kill him?

43
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,028
I did, my lord.

44
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,988
What would you have done
if things had gone badly

45
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,781
and my sister's life had been endangered?

46
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,038
You will die if you disobey me again.

47
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,258
Soul Reaper.

48
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,470
You said that is
what people called him before.

49
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,390
I was wondering if the legend is true
or just a rumor.

50
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,228
Ah. That is why you came.

51
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,355
It puzzles you
and keeps you from sleeping?

52
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,274
Is there… a reason you are so curious?

53
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,195
Returning from our visit
to our great-uncle,

54
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,947
I noticed that he was wounded.

55
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,616
It looked like an injury
from an attack or battle.

56
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,161
Was there a fight during your travels?
Perhaps thieves?

57
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,123
- Did he mention anything specific?
- Were we in danger?

58
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,502
Did something happen
that you two are hiding?

59
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,547
Tell me. Whatever it is
seems to be causing you concern.

60
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,889
"Hwi" meaning to rip,

61
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,058
"su" meaning life.

62
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,979
He was an assassin.

63
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,607
Particularly feared
for his ruthless brutality.

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,155
- With a sword…
- He is formidably dangerous. A killer.

65
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,491
So he would have enemies seeking justice.

66
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,661
And they could be trying to use
his former life to their advantage

67
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,205
and pressure or threaten him
as some sort of revenge.

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,957
And this upsets you?

69
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,543
Do you worry
that others would try to hurt him?

70
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,132
Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,925
I think they already are.

72
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,513
How else would he have
gotten that injury on his leg?

73
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,017
Why is he constantly on alert,
as if someone were after him?

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,269
Or like someone with something to hide?

75
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,271
Why does he appear wary and lonely?

76
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,982
I find myself
thinking about him constantly,

77
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,650
and it worries me a great deal.

78
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,278
I find it confusing.

79
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,156
Are you afraid, then?

80
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,615
Good question.

81
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,409
I…

82
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,495
have no reason to be afraid of him.

83
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,291
But… I suppose he does scare me.

84
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,251
Somehow.

85
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,588
I wonder why he is not familiar
to my eyes…

86
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,218
yet my heart
seems to have known him always.

87
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,490
There was an object

88
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,534
he wore every day.

89
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,661
I feel as though

90
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,289
I might have seen it when I was young.

91
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,760
Huh?

92
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,395
You?

93
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,068
How did you know to come here?

94
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,907
I just followed
where my feet decided to guide me.

95
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,621
Or… your feet followed me here
for some reason?

96
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,042
Is there something
that makes you think that I am not him?

97
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,629
Or is that you hope I am not?

98
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,257
Because I only disappoint you.

99
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,098
My actions confuse you.

100
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,767
When I noticed
that you were trailing behind,

101
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,769
I admit I was relieved.

102
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,775
I was hoping you would be surprised
to see I knew the way.

103
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,112
For a moment, I thought
you could see me as you once did.

104
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,074
And that I had
broken through your defenses.

105
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,827
What did you do before?

106
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,414
What were your days like
before you were thrown into our lives?

107
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,125
If you truly are Hongrang,

108
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,462
then help me to understand why all traces
of the boy I knew have disappeared.

109
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,172
- If you could explain--
- Then what?

110
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,510
Those lost years

111
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,930
cannot reconcile you with our childhood.

112
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,728
Tell me
how you injured your leg on our travels.

113
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,273
My instincts know
we were in danger that night.

114
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,067
And my eyes see you hide your arm.

115
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,864
There is no need to be ashamed.

116
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,326
Your situation in this household
has always been precarious.

117
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,286
You should allow yourself some kindness.

118
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,602
Excuse me.

119
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,439
I want to know about
the sachet I carried everywhere.

120
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,526
Young master!

121
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
You… you remember it?

122
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
I think I wore it at my waist.

123
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,785
My goodness, that sachet!

124
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,621
I was there
when your sister gave it to you.

125
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,583
And it was
your most cherished possession by far.

126
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,917
I understand.

127
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,633
But was she the one who had sewn it?

128
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,468
No, she wasn't.

129
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,013
It was her own amulet.

130
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,015
A tradition her father continued.

131
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,891
To protect the child
in the mother's belly.

132
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,727
It is a family custom, you see?

133
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,273
Your father did the same thing for you,
but you lost yours playing.

134
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,191
She was afraid
you would lose your protection,

135
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,236
and as soon as she saw,
she took hers off and gave it to you.

136
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,615
So it is given when a woman is with child.

137
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,351
This object,

138
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,771
I think it will make all the difference.

139
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,492
The patrons have severed their ties
with the guild?

140
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,535
They've not severed all ties with us.

141
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,621
They have expressed
that a breach of trust occurred

142
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,123
and that the incident
has left them unsettled.

143
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,209
But they promise to remain loyal clients

144
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,294
if they can deal directly
with Her Ladyship, master.

145
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,259
Lord Chief Merchant! Merchant Bak is dead!

146
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,605
<i>Driven by greed and selfish interests,</i>

147
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,566
he had been producing
and selling imitation pieces,

148
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,405
which, as you know,
led to a most unfortunate chain of events.

149
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,865
However,

150
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,910
his guilt was stronger
than his taste for riches.

151
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,247
The chief merchant taking responsibility
for this man's own stupidity

152
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,915
was a burden for his conscience.

153
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,460
He then chose to admit
what he had done in a letter

154
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,962
and take his own life.

155
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,132
His admission will make
your patrons realize

156
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,426
that their accusations
stem from a misunderstanding.

157
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,303
Your faithful clients will offer
increased business to the guild,

158
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,724
as that will be their way
of apologizing and seeking redemption.

159
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,269
You see? Your wife
has kept her end of the bargain.

160
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,688
And now you will do the same,
as we had agreed.

161
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,585
Oh dear. Perhaps I have
grown attached to her after all.

162
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,797
When I saw her ride out of the gates,
I felt my heart pinch with motherly love.

163
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,177
Since then, I now think we should
spare no expense for her wedding.

164
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,219
You dare!

165
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,723
She will not be used as a tool
in your wicked dealings.

166
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,641
Consider yourself lucky, my lord,

167
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,728
that I asked for a wedding dress

168
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,147
and not an expensive casket.

169
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,870
I win again!

170
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,206
You are aware it's your turn?

171
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,668
- It's my lucky night!
- You're playing so well!

172
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,463
All right, take this!

173
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,633
Here, I bet two for now!

174
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,011
My luck is turning. I can feel it.

175
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,807
I'm thirsty. First I drink, then we play.

176
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,934
Oh!

177
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,064
What do you want? Are you lost? Huh?

178
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,733
Have you come to collect
on a loan you'll never get repaid,

179
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,028
or do you need someone to punish
your cheating partner?

180
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,452
Your wish can be my command.

181
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,373
Tell me how much you want me
to make them suffer.

182
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,752
Shh! If you don't want anything messy,
use my services. He is no good.

183
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,630
You idiot.
Be quiet when your elders are speaking.

184
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,383
- You shut your mouth, old man!
- You lowly snake!

185
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,717
What are you trying to say?

186
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,219
What's that?

187
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,306
Who… can tell me about the Soul Reaper?

188
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,559
Did he say "Soul Reaper"?

189
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,229
Uh, I need a drink.

190
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,188
I did not hear that.

191
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,361
Why are you all silent all of a sudden?

192
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,196
One of you must have heard of him.

193
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,531
Um…

194
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,867
You should go now.
Your money's no good here.

195
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,412
If we tell you anything, we risk
having our limbs and tongues cut off.

196
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,082
This nobleman
has no idea what he's getting into.

197
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,753
What are you waiting for?
Let's get back to the game.

198
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,881
- Place your bets.
- Deal me good cards.

199
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,300
- Shut your mouth and bet.
- I need good cards.

200
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,261
My first winning streak, and it's ruined!

201
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,211
She's not here.

202
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,394
I did as you asked in Jungchon, my lord.

203
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,480
- Is what he said true?
- Yes.

204
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,401
It is. Mun Gyu-ha has spent
the last years in Qing, as he told you.

205
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,403
He went there
to work for his uncle's guild.

206
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,906
I was able to confirm these facts
with several of my sources.

207
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,658
And why has he returned to Hanseong?

208
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,078
He is also an interpreter.
I am told he is here on trading business.

209
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:54,995
<i>Oh.</i>

210
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,415
There is… a task that I must do.

211
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,669
No.

212
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,296
That is a cover for his true motives.

213
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,967
We must know the real reason he has
come back here. I want this man followed.

214
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,720
We must be watchful. We cannot afford
to be caught with our guard down.

215
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,056
My lord.

216
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,164
I think it may be somewhere in here.

217
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,847
This will save us.

218
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,641
Both you…

219
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,644
and me.

220
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:28,857
You're alive?

221
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,622
What is it?

222
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,297
She went to the village.

223
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,135
To ask if anyone knew the Soul Reaper.

224
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,721
What?

225
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,349
She's missing?

226
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,285
Where did you go dressed as such?

227
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,747
I went for a walk in the woods.
I needed to leave these walls.

228
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,042
Did you meet anyone on this walk of yours?

229
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,588
Not at all.

230
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,469
<i>He is an imposter.</i>

231
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,889
<i>That murderous bastard</i>
<i>cannot be your brother.</i>

232
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,099
You feel the bloody aura in his nature.

233
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,351
And you know as well as I do

234
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,271
that a man's true nature
will always be revealed.

235
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,607
Because no matter how harsh
a storm a man must weather,

236
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,066
his character will not change.

237
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,905
Your brother was a gentle boy.
This man has the soul of a killer.

238
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,327
But you don't need me to tell you
that flesh and blood don't lie

239
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,620
because you feel it.

240
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,496
You do not recognize him as your family.

241
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,041
Your bones feel it,
and your blood feels it.

242
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,584
Your instinct knows it.

243
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,753
Your insides do not recognize each other.

244
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:17,174
You knew immediately
that he is not related to you, didn't you?

245
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,013
You tried to kill us.

246
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,766
Why would I ever listen to a word you say?

247
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,268
Because you'll have no choice.

248
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,031
I found the real one.

249
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,825
He has been in Yanjing all this time.

250
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,413
Thieving scoundrels found him that night
wandering alone in the woods.

251
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,124
They brought him straight to Qing
and sold him for a handsome price.

252
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,877
And not only did he lose
all memory of his childhood,

253
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,630
but he also learned a new language
and lost his mother tongue.

254
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,090
However,

255
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,051
there is one name that he does remember.

256
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:02,970
Jae-yi.

257
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,015
His one and only sister.

258
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,316
How unprincipled
for a daughter of the Min Family's Guild.

259
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,526
Mm-mm.

260
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,781
You lie. I do not believe
a single word of your far-fetched tale.

261
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,157
You would have gone to the guild.

262
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,619
If you are so sure that you found him, why
did you not rush to my father's household?

263
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,246
You know very well why!

264
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,623
Do you know how ruthless
the Soul Reaper's vengeance can be?

265
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,418
He would tear me to shreds
before I got past the gates of the guild!

266
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,129
Enough talk! What do you want?

267
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,260
Mm.

268
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,889
All I want from you is two things.

269
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,101
The reward money
for finding young master Hongrang

270
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,228
and to make that imposter feel…

271
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,984
the pain he inflicted tenfold.

272
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,154
Turn him over to me

273
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,907
and I will reveal him
as the bloodthirsty fraud that he is

274
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,159
before your very eyes.

275
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,952
And I shall also give you the information

276
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,705
that will allow you
to reunite with your brother at last.

277
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,743
I found someone who knows
about the Soul Reaper's childhood.

278
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,704
- They say he was raised in Gangneung.
- Where in Gangneung?

279
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,166
Who taught him how to use a sword?
And how did he become an assassin?

280
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,131
I sent someone there
to find out more about all that.

281
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,049
Ah.

282
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,968
You can share your burdens, you know.

283
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,722
Whatever is weighing on your mind,
you do not have to bear it alone.

284
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:12,933
Mm-hmm.

285
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,398
Your worries are
making you unkempt, sister.

286
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,213
Do you think this appropriate?

287
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:50,178
You give yourself over so easily.
Were you not taught to be more discerning?

288
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,849
I am very discerning. I trust my brother.

289
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,104
Though it does happen easily,

290
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,356
because his aura
is reassuring and familiar.

291
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,442
As only a brother's can be.

292
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,520
If I were her real brother,

293
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,607
she would have felt it.

294
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,775
The reassuring…

295
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,987
…and familiar bond that they shared.

296
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,367
Hmm.

297
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,620
I think I have the secret to that, Goldie.

298
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,955
To gaining her trust.

299
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,918
And get her to see me as him.

300
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,340
But I would prefer to put it off.

301
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,158
It is I.

302
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,413
What are you doing here?

303
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,917
I would like to know
if you could come walk with me.

304
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,337
- Right now?
- You aren't scared of the dark, are you?

305
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,548
Come. I want to share something with you.

306
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,016
I am weary

307
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,894
of always living in two worlds.

308
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,566
I feel that my mind is restless. At odds.

309
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,360
With the battle
growing stronger each hour.

310
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,114
Am I right to worry incessantly
that we have an imposter among us?

311
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,535
Or have I refused to acknowledge
my own brother who has returned at last?

312
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,956
In a way,
I did hope you were not an imposter.

313
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,333
I wished many times for your presence

314
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,003
to provide me
with some sort of reassurance.

315
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,214
Only I could never feel
that truth in my heart.

316
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,967
You did not erase the doubt.

317
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:39,055
My heart has never felt more lost.
And the loss of hope is exhausting.

318
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,603
What will you do?

319
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,773
I will start…

320
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,488
by attempting to find my place.

321
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,041
He's ours!

322
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,761
Now I will watch this bastard suffer.

323
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,679
The box first.

324
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,139
I want proof that what you said is true.

325
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,516
Ah.

326
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,325
It was

327
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,619
nothing but lies?

328
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,788
You're a cold-hearted wench, aren't you?

329
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,541
He rescued you
from a sure death at my hands,

330
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,459
yet you deliver him to me so easily.

331
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,169
You have the saw?

332
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,632
He will be angry once he comes to.

333
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,635
I want both of his arms cut off
so that he cannot wield his sword.

334
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,095
That is a good start.

335
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,892
No! Let me go!

336
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,793
You again?

337
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,548
You have gotten prettier
since I saw you last.

338
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,302
He insults me!

339
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,179
Punish him!

340
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,638
Kill him!

341
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,991
<i>Did you share those thoughts</i>
<i>because you trust me?</i>

342
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,410
Because if he is speaking the truth,
then you were right.

343
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,870
I am not Hongrang.

344
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,623
What would you do if I confirmed it?

345
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,916
I told you once

346
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,669
that I did not want you to be hurt.

347
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,714
<i>Whether or not you are my brother,</i>

348
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,175
<i>I would be very sad to lose you.</i>

349
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,708
Quick! The bow!

350
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,631
Kill him!

351
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,757
Damn you!

352
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,138
Excellent!

353
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,729
<i>Poison?</i>

354
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,621
What is happening?

355
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,541
Who are they?

356
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,722
We need to get you out of here.

357
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,624
Who are those men?
I will not let you face them alone.

358
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:06,925
Stay where you are.

359
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,735
- I ask you to leave her be.
- But the girl has seen our faces.

360
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,509
I said to leave her!

361
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,905
Who are you people?
What do you want with us?

362
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,866
We fought together.

363
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,789
These are my brothers.

364
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,125
I grew up with these men.

365
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,253
This is the life that I led.

366
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,049
The Soul Reaper was trained
with these warriors…

367
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,137
as a killer.

368
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,310
Enough of that.
We need to tend to this wound.

369
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,478
This is my life.

370
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,733
I regret that you do not see
your little brother in me.

371
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,776
- Do not talk!
- But for both our sakes…

372
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,445
I need you to stop doubting.

373
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,908
Do not push me away any longer.

374
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,161
Let me try

375
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,455
to protect you as a brother would.

376
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,341
You dare lift a finger…

377
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,054
against my sister?

378
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,819
Give it back! I want it!

379
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,447
Here.

380
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,867
My tooth is precious.

381
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,753
Hon… Hongrang.

382
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,903
My future husband!

383
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,824
- Hongrang!
- Hey! Where are your manners?

384
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,409
- You're choking me! Let me go, idiot!
- That's enough!

385
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,830
We have waited for this day.
No need to be shy. Come here.

386
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,832
Please come in.

387
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,417
- You wanna lose your fingers? Huh?
- No, no, no!

388
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,170
Hey! No biting!

389
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,631
You are acting like a silly girl!

390
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,133
- Welcome.
- Stop!

391
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,011
Behave or he might never
come visit us again.

392
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,305
- He's like royalty.
- So tall. And handsome too.

393
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,306
Shh!

394
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,509
Prepare everything as I showed you.

395
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,012
- The young mistress is here.
- What is this?

396
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,346
I don't know.

397
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,303
Oh.

398
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,097
The paste stings.

399
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,062
Leave it.

400
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,772
The pain will subside.

401
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,376
You're certain about this?

402
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,089
Mm-hmm.

403
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,800
Well then,

404
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,177
I do not need more than that.

405
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,763
I will respect your decision.

406
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,601
I regret that I may have
caused you confusion.

407
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,313
There is no need for regrets.
This was difficult.

408
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,691
I have seen how you longed
to find him again and how you suffered.

409
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,360
You have been brave,
and I am happy for you.

410
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,695
You deserve joy.

411
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,074
As do you.

412
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,786
But nothing has to change between us.

413
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,497
I'll always see Hongrang
as my favorite little brother.

414
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,001
And I will always see you
as my favorite older one.

415
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,002
Of course.

416
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,299
Sister?

417
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:06,927
Time to walk.

418
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,012
Hmm.

419
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,352
The woods?

420
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,156
Lord Grandmaster, what should we do now?

421
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,285
That is the question.

422
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,954
What shall I do now?

423
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,792
My sister truly thinks
that he is the young master.

424
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,046
Therefore, I will relinquish
the guild to Hongrang.

425
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,173
But I still believe
he is hiding something.

426
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,020
He was struck by a poison arrow?

427
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,231
Yes. But his wound was treated,

428
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,733
and our men are trained
to withstand such toxins.

429
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,693
His life is not in danger, I assure you--

430
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,823
You should have killed her.
You had the perfect opportunity at hand.

431
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,122
You see what is happening.

432
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,582
You must know
why Hongrang is acting like a child.

433
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,002
Why he has lost sight of his purpose
and is protecting this girl.

434
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,005
He's put himself at risk against his own
for the chief merchant's daughter.

435
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,424
You will get rid of her.

436
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,760
Without my son's knowledge.

437
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,762
You do not answer to him.

438
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,306
Respectfully, mistress,

439
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,643
this matter is likely being settled
on our behalf by Lady Min.

440
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,084
Here we are.

441
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,712
Did we hide here when we were children?

442
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,466
Yes, we did.

443
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,885
See this?

444
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,263
There is a loose rock that covers a hole.

445
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,726
We would write each other secret messages
and hide them here.

446
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,311
We thought we were so clever.

447
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,522
Such innocence.

448
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,196
We would also sneak food from
the kitchens and bring it to eat here.

449
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,337
I have never liked having sticky hands.
You know that.

450
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,260
I thought that would have changed.

451
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,516
Ah.

452
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,125
Jae-yi…

453
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,798
have you put color on?

454
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,592
Your lips look different.

455
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,178
You want to impress someone?

456
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,932
In a way.

457
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,310
I have always thought
that if I ever saw my brother again,

458
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,020
I would try to look nice.

459
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,941
I would not want you to worry
about how I suffered in your absence

460
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,527
if I am looking tired and plain.

461
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,039
Perhaps you do not need so much color.

462
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,053
Do you like it?

463
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,354
You have grown into a man,
but you are still a young boy at heart.

464
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,939
I think we should go.

465
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,908
Let us stay a while.

466
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,162
In our hiding place.

467
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,683
Jae-yi!

468
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,984
Where are you two coming from?

469
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,987
And on such a chilly day.

470
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,700
And you have dirt on your clothes.

471
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,369
Such a clumsy girl.

472
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,875
And now

473
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,087
pay your respects to Lord Choi.

474
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,471
You will soon marry into his family.

475
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,482
You cannot approve of this.
Are you not suspicious of the motives?

476
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,651
Jae-yi is considered
a spinster and a commoner.

477
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,820
Why would a nobleman
such as Choi choose her?

478
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,780
Why are you not voicing your objection?

479
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,870
Why do you object so strongly
to this union?

480
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,913
For her.

481
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,958
Why does the news of your sister's
marriage cause you suspicion and concern

482
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,753
when she is past the age of finding
a husband, let alone a noble's son?

483
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,131
Perhaps you have a match
that better suits your interests?

484
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,383
- I only wanted--
- Your sister will marry Ju-yeol.

485
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,678
This does not concern you.
Therefore you have no say in my decision.

486
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,305
I am Jae-yi's older brother.
It is my concern.

487
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,890
If you are worried…

488
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,311
these will ease your mind.

489
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,941
These are the marriage papers
and partition deeds.

490
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,777
With this union,
nearly half of Lord Choi's fertile land

491
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,821
will become property of the guild.

492
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,282
Should any clauses
of those agreements be violated,

493
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,994
the offending party must compensate
with an amount 12 times greater.

494
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,913
This will protect Jae-yi
and ensure she is treated with respect.

495
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:54,042
Discard your concerns and your suspicions.
This marriage is good for your sister.

496
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,919
Do you understand?

497
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,301
Lately, I've become deeply captivated

498
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,386
by the works of the painter Seok.

499
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,847
The red he uses
is striking in its intensity,

500
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,975
evoking a warmth that fills the air
with just a glance.

501
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:14,146
The painter Du-ryeong has a penchant
for using scarlet red ink sticks, I hear.

502
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,694
I studied before coming here
to learn about your household.

503
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,573
Since you have grown up
surrounded by offerings from the guild,

504
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,034
I presume that you have
an eye for fine things.

505
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,371
I do not know much about trading.

506
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,167
I have not taken an interest
in my family's work.

507
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,628
I see.

508
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,048
You developed your interests
in the leisurely pursuits?

509
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,176
Unfortunately not.

510
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:49,306
I had been searching for my little brother
who went missing.

511
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,391
Ah.

512
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,311
I cannot presume
to understand your suffering.

513
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,523
But my heart does sympathize with yours.

514
00:46:59,066 --> 00:46:59,942
For I

515
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,778
once lost someone I held dear as well.

516
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,962
My lady, this may be
the first time you are seeing me,

517
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,714
but I have had the good fortune
of observing you often

518
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,800
when I have accompanied my father here.

519
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,219
Forgive me.

520
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,183
Those two seem to get along rather well.

521
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,186
An excellent pairing, it seems, Lord Choi?

522
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,314
An advantageous union. I suggest
we set the date for the wedding quickly.

523
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,066
I'd be delighted.

524
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,403
We could arrange the ceremony
before the first snow.

525
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,323
A fine suggestion, my lady.

526
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,708
Put everything aside
and look into this man Jae-yi is to marry.

527
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,625
My lord.

528
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,448
<i>It is unusual for the son of a nobleman</i>

529
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,117
<i>to have calluses</i>
<i>on hands that do not know labor.</i>

530
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,412
<i>And why there, of all places?</i>

531
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,957
You are looking for a family
to marry Jae-yi into?

532
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,627
Tell me about the son
of Lord Choi Myeong-seok.

533
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,170
Lord Choi?

534
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,255
When so many other households exist?

535
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,215
What do you know of Lord Choi?

536
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,508
The son is cursed.

537
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,970
His first three wives
have had great misfortune.

538
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,443
<i>His first wife</i>
<i>suffered from a severe illness and died.</i>

539
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,571
<i>The second lost her footing</i>
<i>on her way to the temple</i>

540
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,948
<i>and fell to her death.</i>

541
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:16,787
And, not long after,
Ju-yeol insisted on taking a third wife.

542
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,247
And she disappeared into thin air.

543
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,376
- No one has seen her since?
- No. Lady Ko simply disappeared.

544
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,252
Over ten months ago, they say.

545
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,591
I think there are bad things
that go on there.

546
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,343
That man invites evil forces.

547
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,596
Lady Ko is probably dead.
She was fragile to begin with.

548
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,431
If she did not take the medicine
made for her,

549
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,141
she'd cough violently until she fainted.

550
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,019
The medicine? What was it?

551
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,440
I tried to find her.

552
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,193
Or what might be left of my poor daughter.

553
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,823
Is there a distant family member
who might have given Lady Ko refuge?

554
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,283
Or a close confidante?

555
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,953
You rub salt into the wounded hearts
of grieving parents?

556
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,497
Forgive me, sir. I apologize.

557
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,292
My daughter left this world.

558
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,503
You know not that she's dead,
only that she disappeared.

559
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,005
If she were still breathing,

560
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,882
then she would have written
to let us know.

561
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,760
Or she could be afraid
to reveal her whereabouts.

562
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,053
Enough!

563
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,725
I demand that you leave us.
We want to grieve our daughter in silence.

564
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,076
Excuse me What do you recommend
for shortness of breath?

565
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,412
Usually powder of bitter orange
and licorice.

566
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:44,875
However, white mulberry root bark,
almonds, and ginseng are a better choice.

567
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:49,504
Tell me, who has
such a cruel illness this time?

568
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,298
Do you mean
you have other patients with it?

569
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,301
I do not know the patient,
only that a boy about this size

570
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,012
has been sent to pick up the medicine
for months now.

571
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:58,764
Which household?

572
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,600
I do not know.
That boy is either mute or rude.

573
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,186
He does not answer
when I ask who he works for.

574
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,526
Ah, the quiet messenger!

575
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,528
Let me take that.

576
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,531
Wait here as usual.

577
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,999
And you be careful with those.

578
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,430
There you are! Well done. Good boy.

579
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,599
You may go now.

580
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,922
Try to sit up.
The boy has brought the medicine. Here.

581
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,176
Take it. You must take it to live.

582
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,637
Here it is.

583
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,974
Just a little. Yes!

584
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,145
No!

585
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,741
Ye-yeoung, you must get away! Leave here!

586
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,493
You!

587
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,126
First the medicine, then we talk.

588
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,650
The sound of painful moans,

589
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,236
the sight of oozing blood…

590
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,660
…and skin freshly torn off the body.

591
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,706
He would often say that there was
no more delectable sight to behold.

592
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,711
You cannot let that marriage take place!

593
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,338
Stop it all costs

594
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,714
if you care for her.

595
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,717
If you don't,
that beast will kill her for pleasure.

596
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,810
It's so beautiful!

597
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,562
It's so wonderful.

598
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,319
So good to see you on this occasion.

599
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,738
- Indeed it is.
- Oh my! Lord Choi!

600
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,575
Congratulations, my lord.

601
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,119
There is Lord Choi.

602
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:30,141
Let us commence!

603
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,694
The groom shall stand facing east.

604
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,095
Bring the bride out.
