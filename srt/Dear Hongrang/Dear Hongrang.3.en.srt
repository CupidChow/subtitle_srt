1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,304
You dare

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,391
lift a finger…

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,438
against my sister?

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,824
You fool. Only an idiot
would come out here alone.

5
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,161
On your feet.

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,420
Stay behind me.

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,385
Kill him! Cut him to pieces!

8
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,618
- Let go! No!
- Come here.

9
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,162
Let go!

10
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,665
Shut your mouth, woman!

11
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,212
- Know how much trouble you've caused?
- Let go!

12
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,632
Quiet! This is what happens
to those who defy me!

13
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,095
You're worthless to me now,
wench! You will die.

14
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,806
Die. Die. Die!

15
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,560
Be damned!

16
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,357
Stop or she goes over,
do you hear me? Get back!

17
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,819
I mean it.

18
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,487
Stop or she dies.

19
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,657
I'll throw your sister down there.

20
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,665
We will trade.

21
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,543
What?

22
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,174
I will trade places with my sister.

23
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,677
I think my life
is worth a much bigger reward.

24
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,262
Not if you're dead, it isn't.

25
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,768
Let her go and hold me for ransom instead.

26
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,103
What? Why?!

27
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,440
I also need money for my survival.

28
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,859
I have not benefitted
from the family wealth yet.

29
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,295
No. You do not want to do that.
I am worth more with no new scars.

30
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,432
Greedy fool.

31
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:02,075
DEAR HONGRANG

32
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,584
My ankle is hurt.

33
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,090
Your weakness. The ankle you sprain once,
you'll likely sprain twice.

34
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,967
And deeper wounds usually fester.

35
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,012
It is rare for wounds to heal completely.

36
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,402
If you will not take my hand,
use my sleeve to help you up.

37
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,573
Hm. You refuse my help.

38
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,617
All right. Sit there, then.

39
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,622
What are you doing?

40
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,791
Not fair! Put me down this instant!

41
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,711
Stop struggling!
Or I might toss you over myself.

42
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,838
You…

43
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,762
Put me down!

44
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,930
I can walk!

45
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,682
Stop!

46
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,652
Jae-yi!

47
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,324
- We found her!
- There she is!

48
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,660
You too?

49
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,454
What's going on?

50
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,182
- Sorry, brother.
- You are safe now. That is what counts.

51
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,059
<i>Sister,</i>

52
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,520
when I'm old enough
to tell people what to do,

53
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,480
I'll make sure they're nice to you.

54
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,399
<i>I promise I'll make them respect you.</i>

55
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,531
What are you doing?
Not fair! Put me down this instant!

56
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,534
Stop struggling!
Or I might toss you over myself.

57
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,873
It is as I expected.

58
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,461
Jo Bang-suk had been spreading rumors
to set a trap for Jae-yi.

59
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,130
Now the truth about
the Snow Man sightings is threatened

60
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,049
because the only solid lead we had
is dead now.

61
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,304
That poor maidservant was the only one
to see it. We are back to square one.

62
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,644
If we can capture the Snow Man,
that should lead us right to the painter.

63
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,946
The painter is probably
painting right now.

64
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,912
While draining the life out of someone,
just like he did to us.

65
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,251
So if we are going back to square one,
we need to confirm one of our theories.

66
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,464
If he is a member of the guild,
then my father has dealings with him.

67
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,384
We need to look into all of them.

68
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,273
Judging by the traces left behind,
they all likely sustained injuries.

69
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,440
They're alive?

70
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,694
The Soul Reaper let those assassins live
and now they run free?

71
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,988
He has his standing
in the guild to protect.

72
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,447
He has to show a little mercy.

73
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,408
So he held back for a reason.

74
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,119
Which is to gain an advantage.

75
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,527
That commotion,
it sounds a lot like an art auction.

76
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,031
You are correct, Highness.
They are arguing about a new painting.

77
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,491
The artist is known as Du-ryeong.

78
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,748
- Let us go inside.
- I'm not leaving without that painting.

79
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,546
Young wretch! Apologize!

80
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,891
Child, are your parents
here with you today?

81
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,437
Are they home?

82
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,108
Have you always been alone?

83
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,990
No family.

84
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,453
Would you like to come with us?

85
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,521
Lord Chief Merchant,
His Royal Highness the Grand Prince

86
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,272
has returned from his retreat.

87
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,732
Why was I not told sooner?

88
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,152
The prince arrived a few days ago,
but he insisted on keeping it quiet.

89
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,988
I understand, only I must
pay my respect to the prince.

90
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,743
- Tell Hongrang he's coming with us.
- Yes, my lord.

91
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,298
Grand Prince Hanpyeong
has fully supported the search for you

92
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,425
since the beginning.

93
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,177
Although he avoids
any sort of political involvement,

94
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,930
he did order the royal military
to assist our case.

95
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,724
We owe him a debt of gratitude.

96
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,727
Our household,
and the long-lost son in particular.

97
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,853
I know.

98
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,982
I shall express my deepest thanks.
I owe him nothing less.

99
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,400
Excellent.

100
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,360
As you should.

101
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,823
Father, why does His Highness
live in such a remote place?

102
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,077
His Royal Highness finds
that the quieter surroundings

103
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,496
are more conducive
to his artistic pursuits.

104
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,208
<i>Although I have never seen</i>
<i>the painter's face,</i>

105
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,252
I will never forget his work.

106
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,005
His unique interpretations,

107
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,550
I can recognize them at first glance.

108
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,417
Hongrang,

109
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,378
is that you?

110
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,391
You grew tall.

111
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,810
But I see your same spirit.

112
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,440
You look just as you did before.

113
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,527
The spitting image of your grandfather
who I respected so much.

114
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,366
And so much like your father
in the way you carry yourself.

115
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,121
May His Royal Highness receive

116
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,832
my undying gratitude and respect.

117
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,138
My dear Yeol-guk.

118
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,517
I understand how distressing
losing a dear son must have been.

119
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,728
I'm relieved

120
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,230
that he is found at last.

121
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,609
It is all thanks to your most generous
blessings, Your Highness.

122
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,011
Correct.

123
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,472
That's good. Now try "in."

124
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,989
That rules out His Highness.

125
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,075
He paints with his right hand.

126
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,953
In a gentle, calm style.

127
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,581
And the child he took from the village
that day is well taken care of.

128
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,502
I admit that I am discouraged,

129
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,004
but also rather relieved.

130
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,049
It would complicate things to no end
if the painter were royalty.

131
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,388
I know what you are seeing.
You should go ahead.

132
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,590
How was your retreat
in the Dongnae district?

133
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,801
I trust Your Highness found it restful?

134
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,219
If only so.

135
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,058
I fear that I have become
a rather useless creature.

136
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,768
You cannot truly believe that.

137
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,770
On my way here,

138
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,858
I witnessed a heated auction
for a painting in one of the villages.

139
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,780
Du-ryeong. I had never heard of him.

140
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,324
He must be quite reputable
to cause such a frenzy.

141
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,246
Reputable is not the word I would use.
The man is a farce.

142
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,001
Why do you say that? You know his work?

143
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,432
<i>Word has it</i>
<i>that he's always drunk on opium, liquor,</i>

144
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,725
<i>and carnal pleasures.</i>

145
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,437
<i>He has a fondness</i>
<i>for using dead beasts in his paintings.</i>

146
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,856
<i>But for his more prized works,</i>

147
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,109
<i>he is known to prefer human corpses.</i>

148
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,202
<i>Some believe that the souls of his models</i>
<i>dwell in the paintings,</i>

149
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,703
<i>allowing them to have</i>

150
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,164
<i>the mysterious ability</i>
<i>to revive the dying,</i>

151
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,209
<i>or immediately take the breath</i>
<i>out of the living.</i>

152
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,617
I will capture the moment your soul
starts to rise into the infinite.

153
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,415
<i>Due to such unfounded rumors,</i>

154
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,752
<i>his paintings do attract bidding wars</i>
<i>of grandiose sums.</i>

155
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,713
<i>The last one sold for the price</i>
<i>of several tile-roofed houses.</i>

156
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,173
Such arrogance!

157
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,092
Only a fool would do such a thing.

158
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,928
Insult the virtue of the fine arts
with such perversion.

159
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,013
Do you wish to act?

160
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,807
Act on what?

161
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,642
A buffoon?

162
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,186
We shall leave him be.

163
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,940
We are each in charge of our own fate.

164
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,778
He may attempt to emulate greatness
to make a name for himself.

165
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,865
And soon he will discover

166
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,868
that he can never duplicate
a single stroke of mine. No.

167
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,455
Seeing life's essence and capturing spirit
is a rare ability.

168
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,000
You may leave now.

169
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,220
If I walk any slower, I will take root.

170
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,019
Sister, why are you testing your ankle?

171
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,230
I am not your sister.

172
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,943
The Min Guild's only daughter, Sim Jae-yi.
Tell me why you are following me.

173
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,655
You and I do not trust each other. Which
is why you followed me into the woods.

174
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,616
And which is why
you are still alive to argue.

175
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,451
So you are seen as the hero.

176
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,913
But I think that is all part of the ruse.
The little brother coming to the rescue?

177
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,331
Hmm.

178
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,626
I guess it was all for nothing.

179
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,963
I have a present.

180
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,427
A present? For me?

181
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:21,929
Mm-hmm.

182
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,728
Here.

183
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,439
Oops. Wrong hand.

184
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,982
- What are you doing?
- It is this one.

185
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,737
Sorry. I found it.

186
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,114
This one?

187
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,449
Or this one?

188
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,789
What? Are you scared? The animal lover?

189
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,334
You cut people to bits with your sword,
yet you are scared of a few insects?

190
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,754
Perhaps…

191
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,300
take this mantis as a thank you.

192
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,136
Their bites hurt!

193
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,434
But why are you so afraid of a little bug?

194
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,853
"Agh! It's a monster!"

195
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,772
"Don't come near me!"

196
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,817
Ah.

197
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,698
You don't mind if I keep this? I'm going
to feed it honey and see if it likes it.

198
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,300
Mother!

199
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,844
Mother!

200
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,224
Agh!

201
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,001
What are you doing out here? Come inside.

202
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,352
My apologies
for not paying a visit earlier.

203
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,021
I am told that your guild business
requires much travel.

204
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,190
My days are occupied with humble pursuits,
as you see.

205
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,276
I assume you're not just here for tea?

206
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,655
I hear that you and Hongrang
were very close when you were younger?

207
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,698
You could say that.

208
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,620
As you know, we are second cousins.
He and I were born a month apart.

209
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,081
We were swaddled
and fed and cleaned together.

210
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,124
I found it wearisome as an infant.

211
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,668
I was tired of him
before I learned to roll over, I think.

212
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,254
I was not jealous of him.

213
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,716
But it was annoying.
The way he was treated.

214
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,178
It was obvious even back then
that he was doted on.

215
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,472
Told he was special. Treated as precious.

216
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,726
Can you tell me more about that?
What was so special about your cousin,

217
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,894
aside from his station?

218
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,812
Nothing.

219
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,482
Except that he was sort of

220
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,569
too nice to everyone?
And scared of his own shadow.

221
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,948
But… why are you asking about Hongrang?

222
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:28,865
To ensure

223
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,453
he really is the one we have searched for
and our wait is over.

224
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:37,165
Do you mean that the man who everyone
is saying is my long-lost cousin

225
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,291
could be an imposter?

226
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,503
The physicians performed the blood
conglomeration test, and it was a match.

227
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,674
This is all, uh, confusing.
Though I have been thinking.

228
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,634
It is strange that he remembers nothing.

229
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,054
Ooh, I also heard
that Jae-yi doesn't think it is him,

230
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,015
and she would not have failed
to recognize her own little brother.

231
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,101
Any chance they had,
those two were together.

232
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,769
She practically raised him.

233
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,522
Wait.

234
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:10,574
Oh my goodness!
How could I have forgotten about that day?

235
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,243
It was the worst day of our lives!

236
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,787
Perhaps… you could share that?

237
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:20,208
His Lordship has invited the guild
to gather at your household for a feast.

238
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,669
Everyone is invited
to celebrate Hongrang's name day.

239
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,674
My revelation will be
a way to show all of the guests

240
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,427
if my cousin is truly back or not.

241
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,315
Hongrang.

242
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,590
Can you… see me?

243
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,262
Sister, can you see me?

244
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,348
I can.

245
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,428
Jae-yi!

246
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,120
I feel you are avoiding our talks.
I must have offended you.

247
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,497
I have not been avoiding you.
It is just that,

248
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,835
these last few days,
I have started to feel

249
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,254
confused.

250
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,467
You will not feel confused
much longer. Be strong.

251
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,012
Very soon, everyone will know

252
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,140
that he is a greater fraud
than all the others.

253
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:41,975
What?

254
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,289
We need more water.

255
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,046
Start boiling this now.
Make sure it is cooked through.

256
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,523
Our household wishes you
health and prosperity.

257
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,110
Cousin! Look who's here!

258
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,572
I remember you!

259
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,157
But do you remember me?

260
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,242
Hong-sik!

261
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,954
We were inseparable
when we were little. Huh?

262
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,166
I do not yet recognize
those I grew up with. I apologize.

263
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,837
But your energy is unique.

264
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,548
Yes! So is yours, cousin.

265
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,676
Uh, but listen, uh,
you and I, it was such a connection.

266
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,471
Almost like twins. We always
understood each other.

267
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,142
Oh! Hello, Jae-yi!

268
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,688
What a pleasure!

269
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,399
Oh, Jae-yi!

270
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,402
You're here?

271
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,906
Look at you.
You sure have grown up, haven't you?

272
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,160
Such a beautiful woman now. Huh?

273
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,912
Ah, let me see.

274
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,583
You certainly <i>look </i>like a young lady.

275
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,585
You certainly haven't sharpened your wit.

276
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,546
Uh…Uh, don't go!

277
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,006
Jae-yi.

278
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,341
Your tongue's as sharp as ever, huh?

279
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,093
And, as strange as it sounds,

280
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,890
I will admit I enjoy a lady
who's a little feisty.

281
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,351
Let me think now. We are… second cousins.

282
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,395
So if I ever wanted to…

283
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,275
No, I can't.
That pesky law we have to follow.

284
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,234
I tell you.

285
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,238
Too bad we can't marry. Huh?

286
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,618
- You have said enough.
- Still…

287
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,703
I have?

288
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,214
You are excitable.

289
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,381
Please go inside.

290
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:09,891
You… you have obviously
become very different over the years.

291
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,310
You have become serious,

292
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,063
and there is something
a little rougher around the edges.

293
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,732
It's quite fascinating, really.

294
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,653
I do not understand how anyone's
temperament can change so much.

295
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,535
Who knows what you went through?

296
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,411
Auntie! Uncle!

297
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,716
And then he fell over.

298
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,481
Deepest respect to you, my lord.

299
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,610
Congratulations, my lord.

300
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,577
To your good health. And your household's.

301
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,707
Much prosperity, my lord.

302
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,928
Such a joyous celebration. It makes
my heart glad to see you all here today.

303
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,056
You come bearing such valuable gifts
and generous blessings.

304
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,435
Bringing the merchants of our guild
together is a wonderful sight.

305
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,270
Indeed.

306
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,106
Although,

307
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,317
it appears that the grandmaster

308
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,528
has failed to see the significance
of your generous offerings.

309
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,705
Such an offense
would be unacceptable, my lady.

310
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,770
Such a weapon!

311
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,867
I thought this gift
would represent your interests better

312
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,287
than fancy brushes and shiny ornaments.

313
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,917
It is a fine piece.

314
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,128
I have never seen one
made with this type of horn.

315
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,046
A very rare example
from black-horned cattle.

316
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,381
Of course.

317
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,675
You have spent a generous sum.

318
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,220
Now let us see the workmanship.

319
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,132
- Cousin!
- My lord!

320
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,473
I will need to practice
with such a fine weapon.

321
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,391
I would not want an arrow to go astray.

322
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,727
We shall have to see
if you are able to manage it,

323
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,230
as black horn is unusually strong
and quite challenging to master.

324
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,941
Have you forgotten
why we are gathered here?

325
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,239
Let our guests enjoy the feast.

326
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,883
Now, may we raise our cups in unison.

327
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,199
Pomegranate! You all taste it as I have?

328
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,119
Hongrang!

329
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,663
You cannot have a sip of this wine!

330
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,207
- Why are you so excited?
- Uncle, call a physician!

331
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,252
We need a physician!
Call one quickly. Please, Uncle!

332
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,462
I asked you a question.
Now calm down and answer.

333
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,133
When we were little,
Hongrang and I were playing

334
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,843
and we snuck into the kitchens.

335
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,470
Uh, we stole some pomegranate wine
and drank it.

336
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,432
But as soon as my cousin had a sip,

337
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,434
his face and neck broke out in hives,

338
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,436
and then he started
having trouble breathing.

339
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,813
He nearly died from the reaction.

340
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,398
It was terrible!

341
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,942
He then fell ill
and took to his bed for half a day.

342
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,737
But we were so worried
that we would get in trouble for stealing

343
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,032
that we lied and made up the story
about playing with a beehive.

344
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,158
Do you remember, Auntie?

345
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,411
You suspected we were lying
because the physicians had their doubts.

346
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:49,582
And they asked if we had anything unusual
to eat or drink that morning.

347
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,376
I do recall that.

348
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,339
Have you ever seen him eat pomegranates?

349
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,341
Any of you?

350
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,718
Jae-yi, have you ever seen it?

351
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,345
I bet you have not!

352
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,764
He is deathly allergic to them.

353
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,559
Ever since then, he nearly
broke into hives just looking at one.

354
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,146
What are you all waiting for?
Call the physician!

355
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:15,983
He does not look ill.

356
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,944
- This is very strange.
- Huh?

357
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,032
You are… You're… n-not…

358
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,284
You do not have any hives on you.

359
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,955
I saw you drink the wine.
More than one cup, I think.

360
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,374
Yet you are completely fine.

361
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:37,380
If he really were my cousin, he would be
gasping for breath this very instant.

362
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,579
My lord! He's breaking out in hives!

363
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,854
You witch!

364
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,316
I have always known
that you were a demon child.

365
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,067
But to try killing my son?

366
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,946
Bring me the peach wood switches!

367
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,409
The time has come to chase the evil forces
from this sorceress for good!

368
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,411
Jae-yi, was this truly your doing?

369
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,211
- Yes.
- No!

370
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,755
Why, daughter?

371
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,301
I wanted… to show everyone

372
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,429
that he's just another fraud.

373
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,306
He is my son!

374
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,025
My lady!

375
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,903
Out of my way!

376
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,196
Step away!

377
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,448
- Move!
- It was not her doing!

378
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,999
I did it, my lady!

379
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,091
What?

380
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,969
By accident.

381
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,516
The drink that was originally supposed
to be served was Chinese quince wine,

382
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,142
but some had gone bad.

383
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,979
As we no longer had enough, I had it
changed to pomegranate wine instead.

384
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,356
No, Eul-bun!

385
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,734
It is my fault. It was my decision.

386
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,069
Is that so?

387
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:07,905
Well, that choice

388
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,408
has hurt him.

389
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,079
I will have to show you not only
the repercussions of your decision,

390
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,207
but also those of being loyal
to that evil wench you serve.

391
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,537
My son?

392
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,707
This is wrong.

393
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,377
- What?
- This is not how I imagined you.

394
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,423
So violent and full of anger.

395
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,676
I envisioned someone kind and regal.

396
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,073
You are feeling well, Hongrang?

397
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,412
Yes.

398
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,998
You may rest assured.

399
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,751
I was just a young boy
when it happened the first time.

400
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,253
A man recovers faster.

401
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,092
Please,

402
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,387
forgive my sister and her maidservant.

403
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,767
I think she only meant it as a silly joke
to entertain us on my name day.

404
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,227
As you wish.

405
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,233
Leave us, everyone.

406
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:12,965
He tricked us.

407
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,342
He surely knew beforehand.

408
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,512
Someone told him what we intended to do.

409
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,389
You are the one

410
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,183
who is pulling tricks, Mu-jin.

411
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,184
What?

412
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,232
I would have known
if Hongrang was allergic to something.

413
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,817
Especially if it was fruit.

414
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,778
Maybe I am starting to forget things,

415
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,699
but I do recall us eating pomegranates
in the courtyard when they were in season.

416
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,245
This means this man is an imposter,
since Hongrang was not allergic.

417
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,622
On the other hand,

418
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,374
if Hong-sik was telling the truth,

419
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,877
and Hongrang nearly died that day…

420
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,797
then that would mean

421
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,467
you were trying to kill my brother.

422
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,128
Due to this incident,

423
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:37,424
many of the lead merchants have shifted
their support to young master Hongrang.

424
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,051
If this situation persists,

425
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,971
Mu-jin's standing in the guild
will continue to weaken over time.

426
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,696
I want the object to be ready.

427
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,490
Advise the Jin Arts merchant of my wishes.

428
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,617
Yes, my lord.

429
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,261
A chestnut!

430
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,516
I'll share it with you.
You bite it in the middle. Just half.

431
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,404
Finally!

432
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,367
My tooth! Why did you do that?!

433
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,495
The quicker we put your old tooth on the
roof, the quicker you get your new one.

434
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,415
It's mine! I don't wanna throw it away!

435
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,543
Give it back! I want it!

436
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,007
My tooth is precious.

437
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,176
Your baby teeth are supposed to fall out.

438
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,306
Don't you know the story
about the twin rat?

439
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,141
Once upon a time,

440
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,935
there was a man
who was cutting his fingernails

441
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,604
and threw the pieces in the dirt.

442
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,690
Then a rat came along and ate the nails.

443
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,694
The next full moon, the rat
turned into the man who cut his nails.

444
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,239
He looked so much like him,
his wife couldn't tell which was which.

445
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,617
I would like two Hongrangs.

446
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,662
The new one could stay at your mother's
house and I'd get the real you.

447
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,789
What if

448
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,333
you didn't know which one was which?

449
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:39,296
If you ever forgot
how to recognize your real brother,

450
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,634
then… I would be lost.

451
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,551
Hongrang!

452
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,227
I can breathe.

453
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,771
My heart is not racing.

454
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,289
I had food and drinks brought for you.

455
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,001
I will stay out here
while you stay in there,

456
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,211
and we will drink.

457
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,429
You cannot be serious.
After what happened earlier?

458
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,851
I guess you were concerned after all. Huh.

459
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,285
My name day was rather disappointing.

460
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,454
It hurts me to know that you would
allow me to drink that wine,

461
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,040
even if you had your doubts
that I am not Hongrang.

462
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,917
And I will never be him.

463
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,378
Not to you.

464
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,715
I understand.

465
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,425
You are his sister.

466
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,929
But I have not tried
to be a little brother to you, have I?

467
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,350
You were the person I was closest to.

468
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,728
Proving myself to you
is quite a challenge.

469
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,356
But I will not give up.

470
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,650
I know this feeling

471
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,445
of trying to become something.

472
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,452
So you have done this before?

473
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,079
Tried to become something?

474
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,042
A name is something you take for granted
until you do not have one.

475
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,003
You are someone's son. Little brother.

476
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,631
Or second cousin or their friend.

477
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,675
Even a neighbor.

478
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,762
But no one claimed me as theirs.

479
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,182
I was always alone.

480
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,436
As if I had dropped from the sky.

481
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,522
So I took to the sword.

482
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,442
Because I knew that
that was how I would change my life.

483
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,028
I could make a name for myself
as a warrior.

484
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,905
And I succeeded.

485
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,534
To the point I became someone's nemesis.

486
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,745
That was the life I had been living

487
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,665
until my world was turned upside down.

488
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:24,878
I suddenly became the son of Sim Yeol-guk,
lord and master of the Min Family Guild.

489
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:31,385
It was so easy that I assumed
it would be just as simple with you

490
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,136
to become your brother.

491
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:34,930
But you are different.

492
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,353
I will try to earn the title.

493
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,440
Did the wine

494
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,734
cause much pain?

495
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,696
It did.

496
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:53,699
But it is gone.

497
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,994
You told me that some of our wounds
never heal completely.

498
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,001
I hope that wound of yours
is not one that begins to fester.

499
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,255
Whether you are an imposter

500
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,173
or not,

501
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,968
I hope that you are no longer in pain.

502
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,755
The master was quite concerned for you.

503
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,259
So, tell me…

504
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,806
how did he find out that Hongrang
is allergic to pomegranate?

505
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,811
Your only concern
is to avoid the risk of being discovered.

506
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,939
You must be careful
until the work is complete.

507
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,151
No one can know
your true identity until then.

508
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,980
<i>It is poison ivy extract.</i>
<i>Do not use it in excess.</i>
