1
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,730
Sister…

2
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,525
Sister?

3
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,112
Sister?

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:20,663
DEAR HONGRANG

5
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,877
MIN FAMILY'S GUILD

6
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,755
- Young master!
- Young master!

7
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,966
- Young master, come home!
- Young master!

8
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,802
- Where are you?
- Young master!

9
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,846
- Young mistress!
- Young master!

10
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,557
Something has happened to him.

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,518
Y-Y-Your brother is gone.

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,241
Holy master, save my son.

13
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,045
Are you here?

14
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,092
Hongrang! Hongrang!

15
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,974
Please have mercy on Hongrang.

16
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:25,228
My boy, my only son, Hongrang.
I beg you to let him live.

17
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,773
Hongrang, my darling boy.

18
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,278
Brother! Hongrang!

19
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,822
Answer!

20
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,544
Oh, please!

21
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,549
I ask only to see my son again. Please.

22
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,684
<i>Brother!</i>

23
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,024
Hongrang? Are you here?

24
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,486
Hongrang!

25
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,431
Hongrang!

26
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,098
Sister, can you see me?

27
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,439
Yes, I can.

28
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,859
And you, brother?

29
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,363
Can you see

30
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,365
me

31
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,159
as I always see you?

32
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,259
12 YEARS LATER

33
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,429
So the boy who went missing
is supposed to look like that now?

34
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,557
- He can't because he's dead.
- How do you know?

35
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,309
This guy disappeared 12 years ago.

36
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,644
If he's still alive,
why hasn't he found his way home yet?

37
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,230
I'll bet you that kid was gobbled up.

38
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,524
- Gobbled by what? A wolf?
- By what? A tiger?

39
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,817
His sister.

40
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,112
She's not really his sister.
She's some kind of demon child eater.

41
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:25,241
And they say that demon still lurks
in the shadows of the Min Family's Guild.

42
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,160
It's always hunting for kids to eat

43
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,163
because it never forgets
the taste of its little brother.

44
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,290
Is that why
Deuk-gil disappeared last year?

45
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,418
Yeah. I heard
he was gobbled up into that demon's belly.

46
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,553
Yuk-son.

47
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,096
Yes?

48
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,431
Did you find him?

49
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,100
Is my son alive?

50
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,770
I think he is on his way to us.

51
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,356
That is good.

52
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:14,707
And the scar on my foot
is from a, uh… Well, a silly accident.

53
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,336
I was playing at my grandfather's one day,

54
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,172
and I snuck into the kitchen…

55
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,217
…where I stepped
onto burning coals.

56
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,681
Oh, I have grown up. I have changed.

57
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,226
But do you not recognize Hongrang,
your only son?

58
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,977
I've come home at last.

59
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,167
I would like to hear
the story of this scar also.

60
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,464
My apologies, but I have
forgotten some things these last 12 years.

61
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,385
Of course. But this is one story
you would remember to the grave, son.

62
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,647
Things tend to disappear from the grounds
of the guild once in a while.

63
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,025
There are petty thieves and charlatans
throughout our realm.

64
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,114
But we overlook their deeds
and let their crimes go unpunished.

65
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,540
Some things can be left to be stolen
and become another's treasure.

66
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,177
But my son's name is not one of them.

67
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,569
My lord, we must
go appease the grand prince immediately.

68
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,102
Do you like it, Yeol-guk?

69
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,189
I find the effect very calming. Dreamlike.

70
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,318
Who could have engraved such a

71
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,489
mysterious pattern
on those delicate, wafer-thin wings?

72
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,992
Watching those small creatures
flutter tirelessly

73
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,578
brings me instant peace and good cheer.

74
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,291
I can no longer recall
the incident that summoned you here

75
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,044
as my cares have floated away
on these wings.

76
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,424
I apologize, Your Highness.

77
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,218
I assure you
that all of the items you order

78
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,303
will be more thoroughly inspected

79
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,306
and of the utmost quality,
befitting your station.

80
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,808
I said I was no longer angry.

81
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,149
Perfection exists
only in nature's own creations.

82
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,902
Man's are full of defects.

83
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,657
Come over here.

84
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,957
I hear my uncle has grown very weak
and suffers nightmares.

85
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,501
I wish him peace and harmonious thoughts.

86
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,921
So I have created
a tiger and bamboo painting for him.

87
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,256
I'd like your honest opinion.

88
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,341
Is it worthy of my uncle?

89
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,312
It is like a landscape painting.
Full of particular detail.

90
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,147
My apologies, Your Highness.

91
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,817
My opinion is not worthy
of something so profound.

92
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,111
- You think he will like it?
- Yes, Your Highness.

93
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,029
Aha.

94
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,865
Then I must finish it quickly.

95
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,744
I will need drawing paper.

96
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,042
And I expect your sheets
to be uniform and perfectly smooth.

97
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,585
Diluted a good six times.

98
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,879
I will guarantee they are perfect.

99
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,809
Hm.

100
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,074
Whoa!

101
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,035
- What about that way?
- We blocked it, sir.

102
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,746
We will not let that rat
find his way out.

103
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,748
I am Cho Bang-suk.
I will not be made a fool!

104
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,376
- Yes, sir!
- There's a light over there.

105
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,586
- After him!
- Yes, sir.

106
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,838
Bring him back alive!

107
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,069
- You will search every inch!
- Yes, sir!

108
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,638
Surrender!

109
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,936
- Over there! Seize him!
- Hurry!

110
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
Wait! Stop!

111
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,777
Stop right there!

112
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,840
Get him!

113
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,506
And who might you be?

114
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,930
I asked you a question.

115
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,642
I am Mu-jin.

116
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,478
Of the Sim family.

117
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,899
Ah, Min Guild, then?

118
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,112
You must be the one they adopted
to replace their long-lost son.

119
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:46,242
But tell me, what are you doing
in the woods at this hour?

120
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,536
Returning from a round of visits
to our merchants.

121
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,955
Not that it should concern you.

122
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:55,417
And given your actions and rude manner,
I take offense at your disrespect.

123
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,963
The offense is intended.

124
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,050
You're still a lowly merchant,
no matter how rich you've become.

125
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,307
Now, let's see what you have in here.

126
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:24,071
Well, I take it there's something
in here you don't want us to see?

127
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,616
It would be a grave error on your part
to search a member of the Min Guild.

128
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,661
Especially as you have no reason to.

129
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,080
Why would I need a reason

130
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,833
when I have power?

131
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,639
And how do you wish to pay
for disgracing my woman?

132
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,393
I… meant no disgrace, sir.

133
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,521
I'm only trying to find a lowly renegade.

134
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,775
There is no good reason to hold
a member of the guild at sword point.

135
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,153
How are you going to pay for that?

136
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,782
Before I let you decide,
I think I will go ask around

137
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,995
and find out what you are doing with
armed rogues in the woods at this hour.

138
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,916
I owe you an apology, sir.

139
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,209
You… you see, I've had too much to drink.

140
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,671
I only wanted to impress my friends.
That's all.

141
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,635
We really must be going now.

142
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,969
Search is over. Move out!

143
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,389
- Move out!
- Yes, sir!

144
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,824
How could you be so reckless
and nearly get caught by that scum?

145
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,327
You are not safe out here.

146
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,579
It is pure luck
that I found you before he did.

147
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,581
Imagine what would have happened to you.

148
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,292
I did panic, thinking he could use
the shin-twisting torture.

149
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,879
But considering that he is
nothing more than a filthy dog,

150
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,715
I think he probably
would have just ripped my limbs off.

151
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,635
And I am grateful that you were out here.

152
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,600
What a great way to greet your brother
who has been on the road for three months.

153
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,394
Ninety-five days.

154
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,492
You did well.

155
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,621
You sold all of the excess inventory
in our shops in record time.

156
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,540
You have done impressive work.

157
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,085
I only follow the lessons
you have taught me, Father.

158
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,714
We have a ceremony in three days,
signing with the Man Merchant Guild.

159
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,882
I congratulate you.

160
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,884
You will be the one to represent us.

161
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,263
- Sir?
- You will sign for your household.

162
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,349
- And put our stamp on the agreement.
- Father…

163
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,478
Our Ladyship stamps silver transactions.
I cannot take her place.

164
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,355
Only you can do so.

165
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:04,982
And I am doing so.

166
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,526
Do you know why I adopted you
against my wife's wishes?

167
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,863
Why I took you in and taught you
everything about our business dealings?

168
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,199
Your son is gone.
You needed someone to replace Hongrang.

169
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,202
I needed someone to replace his father.

170
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,456
To take my place
and ensure our legacy lives on.

171
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,250
Since Hongrang's mother
is currently unwell,

172
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,628
and in no position to oversee anything,

173
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,505
this is the time to show everyone

174
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,383
who is the new heir.

175
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,636
I want it!

176
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,598
I want it now!

177
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,310
I have strict orders
and limited access to your medicine.

178
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,561
You're under my orders.

179
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,229
And I order more medicine.

180
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,525
Now get me some more of it this second!

181
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,362
- I beg you, my lady, please calm down.
- Bring it to me!

182
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,533
- Please, mistress, I can't.
- Do not touch me! Get it! That's an order.

183
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,912
- Bring it this instant!
- Please, you must calm down.

184
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,250
What a weak, undutiful mother.

185
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,962
Let us leave.

186
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,674
I should not have come here.
I doubt she can think straight.

187
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,804
She probably would not recognize her son
if he stood right in front of her.

188
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,933
Madam Gwigokja? High Priestess!

189
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,727
M-M-Madam Gwigokja, wait!

190
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,854
Wait, I beg you!

191
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,653
Ah! Ah, don't go! Have you seen my son?

192
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,196
Is he coming home at last?

193
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,616
Do you truly care what has happened
to your son anymore, Yeon-ui?

194
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,787
A true mother would not have become
a spectacle such as you.

195
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,624
The longer your son is gone, the stronger
the household he comes back to.

196
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,543
Maintaining your composure is essential.

197
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,921
You cannot continue to lose yourself
in clouds of smoke and delusion.

198
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,341
I just wanted my son by my side,

199
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,301
to see him again.

200
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,846
And when I take enough, I can do that.

201
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,390
I can see my little boy's face again.

202
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:06,395
When I see Hongrang's face,
it makes the sadness disappear.

203
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,610
I swear to you,
I can be strong for my son again.

204
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,241
With your mercy,
I will rise to my duties once again.

205
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,034
Please help me.

206
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,704
Bring Hongrang home to us.

207
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,582
I can't go on without my son any longer.

208
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,093
I came here

209
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,929
to tell you to be ready

210
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:46,059
for the long-awaited arrival
of a very distinguished guest.

211
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,313
You saw it?

212
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,581
<i>You cover yourself,</i>

213
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,086
<i>but still my eyes see all of you.</i>

214
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,929
Step aside!

215
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,960
She was young and strong and healthy.

216
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,880
The woman they chose to be your mother.

217
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,509
They would not have selected just anyone
to bear the guild master's heirs.

218
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,052
And yet,

219
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,890
your evilness ended her life
the minute you came into the world.

220
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,809
But that's not all, is it?

221
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,354
That same year, the illness in my father's
bowels mysteriously came back.

222
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:58,191
And later, your maid was found dead
with her head bashed in.

223
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,068
When you asked for chickens
in your quarters,

224
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,070
they were found
with legs and wings torn off.

225
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,032
The evil oozes out of you.

226
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,743
No, it doesn't.

227
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,746
I allowed you to stay here
as you are the master's spawn,

228
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,539
but I told you to stay away from Hongrang.

229
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,375
That your sinister powers
would bring darkness upon him!

230
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,800
It has been so long since I attended
such an important ceremony

231
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,511
that I felt the need
to prepare with extra care.

232
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,814
- Oh, my lady!
- My lady!

233
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,192
My lady is ill!

234
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,390
Today is for us.

235
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,353
Now show your place…

236
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,856
and kneel.

237
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,923
Step into your carriage, my lady.

238
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,836
Why did you not resist?

239
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,463
That was humiliating!

240
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,048
People saw you bow down to her
like a servant!

241
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,843
You were supposed
to represent the Sim household.

242
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:33,346
But you allowed that woman to reassert
the Min household's dominance.

243
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,807
You do not kneel to anyone.

244
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,517
What do you intend to do now?

245
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,109
I shall make amends

246
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,779
by respecting my filial duties
to Her Ladyship.

247
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,325
What?

248
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,037
There will be complications, Father.

249
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,372
The mistress
will not finalize the transaction.

250
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,294
I intend to take full responsibility
for what happened out there today.

251
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,713
And for what is to come.

252
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,216
I will be loyal to Her Ladyship,

253
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,969
who is obviously not in her right mind
for important decisions.

254
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,514
And who is gonna pay
when her transaction fails?

255
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,729
That will be for you to take care of.

256
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,774
But what you spend now

257
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,109
will earn you much more in the future.

258
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,468
What happened to you?
Your face is swollen.

259
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,970
It is nothing. How is your ankle?

260
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,495
I think you have a light sprain.
It should heal quickly.

261
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,623
I hope I can at least
walk on it by morning.

262
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,251
Why? Do you have somewhere to be tomorrow?

263
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,299
I wish you would stop now.

264
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,053
What? Searching for Hongrang?

265
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,056
No. Trying to leave.

266
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,775
I have known what you have been up to
with those strays for a while.

267
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,736
And that you earn money through deceit.

268
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,321
I also know that you use your profit

269
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,531
to continue searching
for your little brother.

270
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,868
You have gotten bolder, too, which is
why you were in the woods that night.

271
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,288
- It is just that I cannot stop looking.
- Your dedication is honorable.

272
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,624
And you must
expand your search beyond Joseon

273
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,792
as you have turned over every stone here.

274
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,920
You need more money to travel to Yanjing,
do you not?

275
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,548
You know all my secrets.

276
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,305
You need not do that, Jae-yi.

277
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,265
I can do it.

278
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,269
If you can manage to wait
a little while longer,

279
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,812
we will search together.

280
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,524
When I take over from our father,
I will have you open a shop in Yanjing.

281
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,110
You can go then,
and I will meet you there.

282
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,988
I could never ask that of you.

283
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,949
Your chances of finding a wife
would be ruined if you left here.

284
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,120
What family would want their daughter

285
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,873
to marry a man
who followed his deranged sister around?

286
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,751
Imagine if they found out
we are not related by blood.

287
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,253
One little slip or misunderstanding

288
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,631
and you could lose
your hard-earned reputation.

289
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,136
You are sweet.
But I truly do want a sister-in-law.

290
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,055
And a little niece.

291
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,228
You were bold enough

292
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,356
to ask three times the reward
for finding the child alive

293
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,441
and twice the price for a body,

294
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,404
and you were paid that princely sum
of earnest money 12 years ago.

295
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,615
It has been reported to me
that you have been using

296
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,535
the grand prince's royal decree
as a means to feather your nest.

297
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,329
I find it suspicious
that you are here before me today

298
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,499
as I consider how to administer
your punishment and early death.

299
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,876
Your words are like a knife
to my soul, master.

300
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,003
You know not
of all the hardships I have endured.

301
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,880
And it brings me great sadness and worry.

302
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,590
I have searched all eight provinces.

303
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,760
I scoured the country like a madman,
barely sleeping or eating for days.

304
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,846
People thought I must be searching
for my own son.

305
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,600
Why are you back here, then?

306
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:49,853
Because I found him.

307
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,941
Do you know how many others
have tried to pretend they were my son,

308
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,568
and what fate they suffered?

309
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,611
You were right to show what happens.

310
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,198
I hear some were burned alive, or had
their bones crushed from the feet up,

311
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,284
or some had their fingers
chopped off one by one.

312
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,328
But you were right to punish them.
They showed you great disrespect.

313
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,000
Are you certain you will not suffer
any of their fates, Dok-gae?

314
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,334
I'm telling the truth.

315
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,592
Where is he,
and what do you know of his life?

316
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,135
It would seem that…

317
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,096
that the unfortunate circumstances

318
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,600
led him to grow up
in a kisaeng house in Gangneung.

319
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,561
And later on,
he became a wandering soldier.

320
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,314
It seems that your precious young master

321
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,567
had to become a swordsman
to earn his keep.

322
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,153
Why did he never find his way back to us
on his own?

323
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,946
I asked myself that same question.

324
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,616
He must have
either been struck by a severe fever

325
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,076
or experienced a very serious head injury.

326
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,621
He says he has no recollection
of his younger years.

327
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,833
The only thing he does remember is being
told that he was an orphan with no family.

328
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,297
You can tell no one about this.

329
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,592
I need to send someone
to confirm this story at once.

330
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,429
That is
most unthinkable, my lord.

331
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,059
Such a task

332
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:16,231
would certainly be too great of a burden
for you to shoulder.

333
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,567
If you were to keep this search secret,

334
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,487
you could also refuse
to bring my son home.

335
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,864
Your perverse delusions
have unleashed your tongue.

336
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,243
I want to ensure that your condition does
not worsen if this man is another imposter

337
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,744
and not our long-lost son.

338
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,288
I will not be made a fool
on the words of a lowly bounty hunter.

339
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,123
How dare you say such words?

340
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,848
This man

341
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,600
is our distinguished guest.

342
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:26,968
Sister!

343
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,428
Sister!

344
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,982
Jae-yi!

345
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,609
Are you all right?

346
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,529
I am here. You are safe.

347
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,657
I did not want to sleep

348
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,953
because I knew this would happen.

349
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,998
Young mistress!

350
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,420
He's coming!

351
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,177
Hongrang has entered the gates.
Your brother's come back to us!

352
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,519
- My son!
- My lady! Mistress!

353
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,409
Shoulders…

354
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,287
26 inches.

355
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,039
Left arm,

356
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,667
27 inches.

357
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,751
Right arm,

358
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,462
also 27.

359
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,717
Ah. There's scaring on his left foot.

360
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,263
So this one's not another fake?

361
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,473
I don't think so.

362
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,683
An impersonator would be
chopped to bits by now.

363
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,436
What if it really is Hongrang?
What becomes of Master Mu-jin?

364
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,772
Obviously he has to give up
his position, you idiot.

365
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,690
Think they'll make him
work in one of the shops?

366
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,984
No, they must confirm who he is first.

367
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,619
The chief master doted on him so.

368
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,705
But nothing competes
with a blood heir. Come on, let's go.

369
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,712
In every case,

370
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,883
when a new charlatan has arrived
acting like Jae-yi's little brother,

371
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,635
<i>she has reacted the same way.</i>

372
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,637
<i>Running desperately to meet him</i>

373
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,932
the second she heard
that he might be found at last.

374
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,976
And things go back as they were.

375
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,938
It never made me nervous.

376
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,108
But this feels different.

377
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,017
He is not my brother.

378
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,653
Another imposter.

379
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,864
A fake.

380
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,408
Young mistress, we have confirmation.

381
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,160
His scars and features match the ones--

382
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,037
Every candidate before him
had the matching scars as well.

383
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,207
But that is not all. The shape of
his features and other factors are true.

384
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,210
We performed the blood conglomeration test

385
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,671
and his combined
with His Lordship's blood.

386
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,549
He has a weak respiratory system
and the Soyang body type.

387
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,467
This young man is young master Hongrang.

388
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,431
You do not actually believe this?
That does not prove anything!

389
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,057
- Jae-yi.
- He is a fraud.

390
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,017
Take another look.

391
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,228
How about you take a closer look?
And maybe ask a few questions.

392
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,356
I am asking you to set aside
your skepticism and observe.

393
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,234
You know these men are experts
and their tests are thorough.

394
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,111
You can't simply refuse
to believe the results.

395
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,905
But others have had those results.

396
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,115
I can tell

397
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,409
that this man is not my brother.

398
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,998
You must remember
something of your life here?

399
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,960
Unfortunately, it is all a blank.

400
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,880
That is very convenient.

401
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,884
I had a sister.
We used to play together in the hills.

402
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,344
Which is very common.

403
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,763
All siblings in Joseon
have memories like that one.

404
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,184
Yet I am sure you have no idea
where our favorite place to hide was.

405
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,105
Or any other place.

406
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,403
What about the puppy you were given?
What name did you choose?

407
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,488
I have no idea.

408
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,324
You do not remember the name
of the only dog you ever had?

409
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,952
Tell me
what you were most afraid of, then.

410
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,371
The number one thing
you hated getting teased for.

411
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,665
What was in the sachet I gave you?

412
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,542
Can you name one thing that was
in the thing you slept with every night?

413
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,295
What about the friends you played with?

414
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,423
I do not need a name.
Just describe even how one of them looked.

415
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,885
You have never lived with us.

416
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,054
That is why you remember nothing.

417
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,391
How can you have forgotten
a life that you never lived?

418
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,395
You are not Hongrang.

419
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,231
He would not forget.

420
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,861
No.

421
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,739
But this is what I suspected.

422
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,204
I wondered about this very thing
on the long journey.

423
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,915
I expected that upon seeing
the places I grew up

424
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,377
and all the people who are supposed
to be my family, I would remember them.

425
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,213
Unfortunately, nothing
about your household feels familiar.

426
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,925
But hearing what your daughter said

427
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,177
truly confirmed my doubts.

428
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,810
My aide and I will be going now.

429
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,687
With your blessing, master.

430
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,401
This is very strange, but he was just
a boy of eight when he was last with us.

431
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,447
It's not surprising that his memories
were washed away with his need to survive.

432
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,909
I disagree. The memories of his childhood
should be what helped him survive.

433
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,870
I did not ask for your opinion.

434
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,164
Now leave us.

435
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,126
Her Ladyship is here, my lord.

436
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,651
It is you.

437
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,530
I have failed

438
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,867
to do my motherly duties.

439
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,787
I am ashamed. I failed to stay strong.

440
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,456
I am asking for forgiveness.

441
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,128
He is not your son.

442
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,175
Huh?

443
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,551
He is not my brother.

444
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,930
He is not Hongrang.

445
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,773
Of course he is.

446
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,109
My son.

447
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:09,740
Your sister's reaction only confirms to me
that my son has finally come back to us.

448
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,703
She knows that your return
threatens her position,

449
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,208
rendering her useless to this household,
speechless with fear.

450
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,253
So…

451
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,131
hold your tongue,

452
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,134
and keep your mouth closed
in our presence.

453
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,928
Swallow that putrid breath of yours

454
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:36,058
so that my son is never again exposed
to your demonic air and evil presence!

455
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:49,113
You should observe him a little longer.
Your emotions are clouding your thoughts.

456
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,823
He's been gone so many years.

457
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,160
How could you recognize him
12 years later?

458
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,161
Because

459
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,204
not for one second

460
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,332
has our connection ever disappeared.

461
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,585
- You can't catch me!
- Little rascal!

462
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,920
Young master! You need a bath!

463
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,132
<i>I wondered how much</i>
<i>he would grow and change each day.</i>

464
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,842
<i>Every single day,</i>

465
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,927
<i>I have pictured him in my mind.</i>

466
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,387
Come here!

467
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,514
<i>His image has never faded.</i>

468
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,854
When I close my eyes to go to sleep,
I see his face. When I wake, I see him.

469
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,399
I have never gone a day
without seeing Hongrang.

470
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,072
And you're sure you don't see him
in the eyes of that visitor?

471
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,915
Not at all.

472
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:06,834
<i>Hongrang,</i>

473
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,753
<i>I wish you could come back</i>

474
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,172
<i>right now.</i>

475
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,136
Then we could send the imposter
back where he came from.

476
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,850
And return to how things were
when we were inseparable.

477
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,550
Sister.

478
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,688
That idiot cannot be my brother.

479
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,715
That snake. How dare he do such a thing?

480
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,928
Who would <i>not </i>want to forget
having an older sister like that?

481
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,704
My son.

482
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,415
So good to see you. Please, sit.

483
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,176
Perhaps your aide
cares to introduce himself?

484
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,055
You show us great respect,
but In-hoe is mute,

485
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,515
and I always speak for both of us.

486
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:32,604
That is quite an unfortunate defect. Does
it not impede his ability to protect you?

487
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,483
The blind inherit a heightened awareness
of their other senses.

488
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,193
In-hoe's case is similar.

489
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,612
He can read the atmosphere of any room,

490
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,115
and his instinct registers things
my ears do not.

491
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,784
Such as bloodthirst.

492
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,122
And well-disguised hatred.

493
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,375
Forgive my mentioning this,
but as you know,

494
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,502
I have spent many years as a soldier.

495
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,090
So I am capable
of defending myself quite well.

496
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,509
Your worry is unfounded, sir.

497
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,555
Can you tell us
what household he was raised in?

498
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,600
If we are to share the same roof,
I would prefer to know his ancestry.

499
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,393
In-hoe's ancestry

500
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,855
is an even greater mystery than my own,
and I cannot answer.

501
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,399
But if it remains a concern
for the mistress of the household

502
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,943
that we do not know his heritage,
I will send him away

503
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,987
and follow in his footsteps.

504
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,580
My curiosity was misunderstood.

505
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,998
My apologies.

506
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,125
He is welcome
to our finest hospitality, of course.

507
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,503
Now let us enjoy our family meal.

508
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,861
How dare that worm come here?
I refuse to have him eat with us.

509
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,781
I invited him, of course.
Mu-jin, sit here.

510
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,499
I think a greeting is in order.

511
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,878
Mu-jin is your older brother

512
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,548
and a respected member
of our merchant guild.

513
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,803
He is not your brother.

514
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,766
He is a mere stake, set to mark your place
awaiting your return home.

515
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,143
Meant to be pulled up and thrown aside.

516
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,062
You may ignore him as you choose.

517
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:41,233
You may not. Mu-jin is
responsible for managing the guild

518
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,277
and overseeing operations.

519
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,445
He has a distinct understanding
of our trade routes,

520
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,156
which has reinforced our partnerships.
His insight is invaluable.

521
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,619
Ignore my wife's
ill-conceived notions and learn.

522
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,498
He is to learn

523
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,168
so he can be the head of household?

524
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,546
That is possible, yes.

525
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,667
Do you think he believes it?

526
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,004
That he lost all of his childhood memories

527
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,507
and that he really could be
our long-lost little brother?

528
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,095
Or is it possible
that this man is willing to risk his life

529
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,722
just like all the other pretenders?

530
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,640
Which

531
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,850
I never understood.

532
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,938
Becoming the heir could be worth it when
you know everything that comes with it.

533
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,857
It seemed to be worth the risk
for all the other imposters.

534
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,777
Yes, but this time seems different.

535
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,446
The others were here,
prepared with their lies,

536
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,823
acting like they'd rehearsed
their lines for years,

537
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,034
telling us everything we wanted to hear.

538
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,828
And this one does the opposite
and claims he remembers nothing.

539
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,374
He has no recollection of us,
but everyone here believes he is back.

540
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,335
And now my search will suffer.

541
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,296
The news of Hongrang's return
will spread like wildfire.

542
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,216
The government offices,
the peddlers, the sailors,

543
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,301
and everyone who's been searching
will stop looking.

544
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,679
I will be alone on my search.

545
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,723
I have to keep it going.

546
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,564
I will find him, brother.

547
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,777
I will bring the real Hongrang back to us
and expose that fake one for what he is.

548
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,280
I will find my little brother.
And I will protect my older one.

549
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,855
I was always told
dogs never forget a smell.

550
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,690
Is that true, Goldie?

551
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,068
So you would never bark
at someone who loved you.

552
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,402
That is Goldie?

553
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,614
Why? Are you starting
to remember something?

554
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,866
- Why is it named that?
- You are the one who chose it.

555
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,826
I suppose it was because of its color.

556
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,912
It must have been more golden
when it was young.

557
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,999
Or maybe the sparkle in its eyes.

558
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,543
- Clearly that has faded with age.
- The color may have faded.

559
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,462
- The spirit never has.
- Good for him.

560
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,341
But you've changed, sister.

561
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,759
Do not dare use those words.

562
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,512
If you do not remember me,
how can you know I've changed?

563
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,723
I still remember nothing about this place.

564
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,100
But I get the feeling

565
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,102
that you were not like this.

566
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,561
Like what?

567
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,604
Hm.

568
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,023
So despicably rude and unlikable.

569
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,653
Do you think
I will let you get away with this?

570
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,072
You… are nothing.

571
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,573
You have no power here.

572
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,576
You have been living inside these walls
for your entire life.

573
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,538
And you have no idea what your status is.

574
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,207
After five minutes,
I knew where you stood here.

575
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,671
There you are.

576
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,063
Hello, Mother. I was on my way.

577
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,649
I was wondering
why you were taking so long.

578
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,068
May I ask what you were doing just now?

579
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,946
I was… talking to the dog.

580
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,866
It was an interesting conversation.

581
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,333
Goldie doesn't understand words,

582
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,879
so I thought making dog noises would work,
only he still doesn't answer.

583
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,138
I remember.
You talked to that dog all the time.

584
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,348
Goldie was your very best friend.

585
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:09,060
You were so happy when you got him.
Your memories must be coming back.

586
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,980
He looked familiar.
And I have always been good with animals.

587
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,565
I think he recognized you.

588
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:17,903
He's getting on in years, so we have gone
to a great deal of effort to keep him.

589
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:21,448
We wanted Goldie to be waiting for you
when you came home again.

590
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,909
You should go now.

591
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,328
- You have a busy day with your father.
- Yes.

592
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,759
I do not like him either.

593
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,553
We both know that is not Hongrang.

594
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,057
And as much as you want
to bite him, you cannot,

595
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,643
or you will be killed.

596
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,855
So… I will do the biting

597
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,815
for the both of us.

598
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,969
This street also belongs
to the Min Family's Guild.

599
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,096
I suggest you take a look around
on a regular basis.

600
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,347
Yes, Father.

601
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,644
Incredible.

602
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,313
The more you look around,
the more impressive it is.

603
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,108
Can you imagine
if I had actually grown up in this place?

604
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,194
I would have had
a completely different life.

605
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,031
Which also means…

606
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,453
we would never have crossed paths.

607
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,649
What is this place?

608
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,301
How fitting.

609
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,564
But clearly this was not left to rot here
without being consumed.

610
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:31,971
Wait.

611
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:39,521
Your neck

612
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,314
has a birthmark.

613
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,150
Did your brother have one there?

614
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,570
- You have to let me see it.
- It is a scar.

615
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,366
When you have no family or household
to protect you,

616
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,785
it is likely you'll earn a few scars.

617
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,203
That is an unusual one.

618
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,163
As to how I got that unusual scar,

619
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,499
I would be more than happy to tell you.

620
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,418
Or I could just show you
all of the hardships

621
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,878
that I was made to endure
these last 12 years.

622
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,632
You choose.

623
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,218
Let go. Now!

624
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,429
Let go!

625
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,434
Take your hands off my sister.

626
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,399
I think I am meant to say that.

627
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,445
Respect Jae-yi.
I do not intend to repeat that order.

628
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,409
Save your breath.

629
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,996
I do not take orders from you,

630
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,498
brother.

631
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,337
Enjoy this.

632
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,381
Because I will not call you that for long.

633
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,802
I have no reason to challenge your status
as I will regain my rightful position.

634
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,637
In good time.

635
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,475
For now, I want to thank you
for your dedication, brother,

636
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,603
to ensuring my seat stayed warm.

637
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:05,356
I will remember that
when the time comes to pull up stakes.

638
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,567
There is no need to confront me.

639
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,074
You think I will bow down?

640
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,918
But after 12 years,
a stake can grow very strong roots.

641
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,545
I see.

642
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,965
Understood. My right is challenged.

643
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:32,759
In a way.

644
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,346
A stake is put into place
to mark something important.

645
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,516
I will put it aside
for the real Hongrang myself.

646
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,392
Not for a filthy imposter.

647
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,062
Are you certain

648
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,482
that I am an imposter, sir?

649
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,539
Are you all right?
