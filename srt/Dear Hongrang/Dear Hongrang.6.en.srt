1
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,855
I hear she is to be married.

2
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,650
Do not get yourself involved this time.
Just let things happen.

3
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,447
Even if Lady Min
had not intervened in this,

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,781
Master would have taken action.

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,535
She believes the chief merchant's daughter
will make things complicated for you.

6
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,288
I am simply saying that her leaving
the guild by way of marriage

7
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,331
is exactly what you wanted.

8
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,125
It will ensure her safety.

9
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,634
<i>Your sister will not survive.</i>

10
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,470
There is no rhyme or reason.

11
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,681
He slaughters for the sake of doing it.

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,892
It gives him pleasure.

13
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,019
His pastime.

14
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:21,498
DEAR HONGRANG

15
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,471
<i>I am sorry</i>
<i>for leaving without saying goodbye.</i>

16
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,349
<i>I was afraid that if I saw you,</i>

17
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,684
<i>it would make me want more from you.</i>

18
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,021
<i>I know that I have been useless to you</i>
<i>as a sister.</i>

19
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,148
<i>But still,</i>

20
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,945
<i>I am so very glad I was able to see you</i>
<i>one last time before leaving.</i>

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,533
<i>Thank you for coming back.</i>

22
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,128
Hurry now! Come on!

23
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,631
- Am I too late?
- No.

24
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,384
Here. The travel papers you'll need
to cross the border into Qing.

25
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,010
This is food for your journey.

26
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,931
Here. I exchanged your money
for silver coins.

27
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,683
Head straight down this path.

28
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,311
The authorities will sometimes come here
to stop ships from leaving, so careful.

29
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,231
We'll keep an eye on you
and deter them if they appear.

30
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,738
Safe travels.

31
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,323
You must write to us.

32
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,410
- I should go.
- Yes, you do not wanna miss it.

33
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,289
Goodbye.

34
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,665
Goodbye!

35
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes.

36
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,326
Jae-yi!

37
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,044
Oh no.

38
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,503
Stop.

39
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,547
- Stop!
- Go!

40
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,886
Go!

41
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,597
- Jae-yi!
- Go! Hurry!

42
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,807
- We'll be fine!
- Jae-yi, please!

43
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,601
- Go on!
- Leave!

44
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,645
Oh no.

45
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,314
- Go! Hurry!
- Don't stop!

46
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,825
Stop it!

47
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,132
- Jae-yi!
- I'm here.

48
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,342
Hold on tight!

49
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,511
Come on!

50
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,012
Pull!

51
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,103
She made it! She's up!

52
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,777
Are you all right?

53
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,408
At your service, my lady.

54
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,919
Touch my people again

55
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,839
and I will bite your entire head off.

56
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,759
You are nothing but a dog who cannot bite
without your master's orders.

57
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,222
I am not like you.

58
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
I have no collar or master.

59
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,561
If you attempt anything like this
ever again, you will be sorry.

60
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,733
I will show you how far a wench
who is fiercer than a dog can go.

61
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,530
Come on.

62
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,782
Let us go.

63
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,756
There are less than five days left
until the wedding.

64
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,717
I will have to either get Jae-yi
to a safe location

65
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,302
or stow her away on a boat.

66
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,720
What if she is discovered?

67
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,264
Then it could get dangerous
for you as well.

68
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,101
That does not matter.
I cannot let her marry him.

69
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,144
The peddlers are arriving tomorrow.

70
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,064
They may have news
on the whereabouts of Lady Ko.

71
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,525
Wait one more day
before doing anything, please.

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,825
Why have I received so many letters?

73
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,577
The ones at the top
are reports from the chain stores.

74
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,745
The ones beneath

75
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,541
are mostly letters congratulating
the young mistress on her marriage.

76
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,885
What is it, my lord?

77
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,346
It is from Lady Ko.

78
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,099
Why would she send me this letter?

79
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,228
Jae-yi.

80
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,648
- Yes, brother?
- I have good news.

81
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,608
I have found a way to annul the marriage.

82
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,777
Is that true?

83
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,072
Tell me how. What do I have to do?

84
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,824
All you do

85
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,452
is perform the nuptials as arranged.

86
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,036
What?

87
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,374
Your wedding holds the key
to solving everything.

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,877
<i>It must go as planned.</i>

89
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,416
<i>It is a marriage</i>
<i>that will solidify the bond</i>

90
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,002
<i>between the Min Family Guild</i>
<i>and a family of nobility.</i>

91
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,921
<i>All key personnel will be attending.</i>

92
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,840
<i>I plan on exposing the wrongdoings</i>
<i>of both Lord Choi and his son</i>

93
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,509
<i>in front of everyone present.</i>

94
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,720
<i>This will demonstrate the violation</i>
<i>of a clause in the marriage contract.</i>

95
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,348
<i>It will leave our father no choice</i>
<i>but to take immediate action.</i>

96
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,434
<i>This will compel both the guild's forces</i>
<i>and Lord Choi's associates</i>

97
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,144
<i>to consider our proposal,</i>

98
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,523
<i>providing sufficient grounds</i>
<i>for both parties to support the annulment.</i>

99
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>This plan will succeed, I assure you.</i>

100
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,401
<i>Without fail.</i>

101
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,821
The marriage ceremony shall begin.

102
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,951
The groom shall stand
east of the wedding table and face east.

103
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,677
Bring the bride out.

104
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,153
Heavens, what a beautiful bride.

105
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,364
She is certainly
the fairest maiden I've seen.

106
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,908
Yes, I quite agree.
She's beautiful.

107
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,342
<i>But how?</i>

108
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,803
<i>How will you expose their sins?</i>

109
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,392
<i>During the ceremony,</i>
<i>when everyone's attention is focused,</i>

110
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,436
<i>that is when</i>
<i>Lady Ko will make her appearance.</i>

111
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,481
The bride
shall bow twice first.

112
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,904
The groom
shall bow in acknowledgement.

113
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,956
The acolytes shall fill their cups again.

114
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,759
What? Lady Ko has disappeared?

115
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,843
Yes, my lord.

116
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637
Why now?

117
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,860
It appears…

118
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,906
there has been an oversight.

119
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,033
<i>I have a favor to ask.</i>

120
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,872
If you agree to grant my favor,
you will live.

121
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,336
And another will be free
to live the life she wants.

122
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,964
Now then, shall we relocate to my house
and continue with the festivities?

123
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,257
Of course.

124
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,387
A murder was planned?

125
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,185
So the idea was to blame everything
on Choi Ju-yeol,

126
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,645
a man who has a track record.

127
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,357
Now what do we do?

128
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,152
Are we just going to let her go
to that murdering lunatic's home?

129
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,197
Where is Lady Ko? I'm certain Lord Choi
smelled something fishy and got to her.

130
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,742
If that is indeed what happened,

131
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,785
she must be dead by now.

132
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,788
Does that mean Jae-yi could die too?

133
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,666
Jae-yi will be rescued.

134
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,587
There will be no turning back
if we let her spend her first night there.

135
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,090
Whatever happens,
I will take full responsibility.

136
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,926
I need your help though.

137
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,843
All right.

138
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,262
What do we do?

139
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,774
It is such a happy day.

140
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,372
Congratulations.
I wish you much happiness.

141
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,291
Look who's here. Congratulations,
it was a beautiful ceremony.

142
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,715
My congratulations
on your wedding!

143
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,970
Here is the groom!
Congratulations.

144
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,680
Congratulations to you!

145
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,433
May you have a son
who will take after you.

146
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,904
Might I ask, my lady,

147
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,991
why Chief Merchant Sim
is nowhere to be seen?

148
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,912
He has many guests to attend to, sir.
He will be back shortly.

149
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,873
All right, then.
Let us raise our cups.

150
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,383
- Congratulations, my lord.
- Congratulations.

151
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,884
Quite handsome today.

152
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,916
Jae-yi! Sim Jae-yi!

153
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,901
- <i>Why have you brought a dagger?</i>
- Do you remember what I taught you before?

154
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,363
<i>I give you it so you can protect yourself.</i>

155
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,074
What?

156
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,660
What do you mean she's disappeared?

157
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,041
Where is Hongrang?

158
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,628
- Why do you want to know that?
- I asked you a question, my lady!

159
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,048
Pardon me, my lord.
Young master Hongrang has taken to his bed

160
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,800
after having too many drinks.

161
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,851
What do you think you are doing?

162
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,991
What have you done to Jae-yi?
Tell me what you did right now!

163
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,536
Speak up! Where is she? Where is she?!

164
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,538
I don't know
what you're talking about.

165
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,374
What have I done?
I have done nothing at all.

166
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,043
But you have lost your mind.

167
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,629
I know that you took the lives
of your former wives.

168
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,173
I assume you are the one
who dealt with Lady Ko as well.

169
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,009
Is this your plan?
What have you done with Jae-yi?

170
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,637
What have you done with her? Tell me now!

171
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,936
It seems that we've walked
into some sort of sinister trap here.

172
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,315
These heathen have caused a commotion
in my own home on purpose.

173
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,152
Their devious plan
is to have me blamed for everything

174
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,197
so that they can steal
our family's fortune for themselves.

175
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,243
Tell me now.

176
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,994
Where is Jae-yi?

177
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,539
I will cut you down if you do not answer.

178
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,298
Lord Choi!

179
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,304
Make way.

180
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:12,104
Ah, Chief Merchant Sim, so there you are.

181
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,855
The grandmaster
speaks the truth.

182
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,781
She's alive!

183
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,869
I am Ye-yeong of the Ko household.

184
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,206
I'm that man's third wife.
I had been reported missing.

185
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,796
Both father and son inflicted violence
on me repeatedly,

186
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,506
leading me to have a miscarriage.

187
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:43,135
They then used that as a reason
to strip my household of its wealth.

188
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,471
Their intent was to kill me,
so I've been in hiding ever since.

189
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,307
You venomous wench.
What lies are you spewing?

190
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,517
It is over!

191
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,146
Both you and your father stand laid bare
for the misdeeds you have committed.

192
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,564
So put an end to this now.

193
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,567
You will answer for the insult you have
inflicted on the Min Family's Guild

194
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,110
and my daughter.

195
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,820
Chief Merchant Sim,

196
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,699
you are going to pay dearly
for this transgression.

197
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,995
Do you not fear my men that surround you?

198
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,081
These men you talk about.

199
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,586
Could you be referring to those men

200
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,881
who have been covering
for your maliciousness all these years?

201
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,816
Is that you?

202
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,237
You mean, you are not the one
who took Jae-yi away from here?

203
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,999
It appears that

204
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,043
things did not go as planned
for her either.

205
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,261
Mercy.

206
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,604
I had too much wine.

207
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,647
I vomited it all out.

208
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,526
What was all the commotion about?

209
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,452
I knew it would not work.

210
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,370
Not on you.

211
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,128
I know.

212
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,465
There are no excuses.

213
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,844
I don't pity her.
That was merely another excuse.

214
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,014
I just want to protect her.

215
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,310
If anything happened to her,
I do not think I could bear it.

216
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,250
Jae-yi.

217
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,838
Brother.

218
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,340
Yes. It is I.

219
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,510
You are not hurt? Are you all right?

220
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,349
What happened to you?
How did you end up here?

221
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,351
I… I do not

222
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,770
recall anything.

223
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,855
While you were alone
in the bridal chamber,

224
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,607
there must have been an intruder.

225
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,902
It matters not. You are safe now.

226
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,362
Hongrang! Uh…

227
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,822
What about him?

228
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,449
What was he doing then?

229
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,871
It appears that he had
been drunk all night.

230
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,714
I feel tired.

231
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,134
Very well.

232
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:35,719
You should rest.

233
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,793
<i>What did you just say?</i>

234
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,713
I asked you

235
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,091
to please not harm Jae-yi.

236
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,552
Has your heart been captured
by the chief merchant's daughter?

237
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:18,970
Yes.

238
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,097
I believe it has.

239
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,850
- You know how that ended for me?
- Then you know how I feel.

240
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,436
If I lose her, I will lose myself.

241
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,023
Do not expect to me to act on your behalf
if you put her in harm's way.

242
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,359
- You're threatening me now?
- I'm pleading with you, Mother.

243
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,489
Sim Yeol-guk.

244
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,575
I gave him my heart and soul

245
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,787
and lost the child in my womb,
and my mother.

246
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,665
Even my name.

247
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,792
I have lost everything because of him.

248
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,170
Do you think she will be different?
She will betray you in the end.

249
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,547
I do not want anything from her.

250
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,174
There will be no betrayal.

251
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,884
I want her to live.

252
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,261
I simply want to keep her alive.

253
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,180
She will ruin you as well, trust me.

254
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,474
Just like her father did to me.

255
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,813
I cannot do it.

256
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,274
I cannot let you
suffer the same fate I did.

257
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,448
I am not like you, Mother.

258
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,367
I promise you.

259
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,246
- I will do my part.
- Should I trust you?

260
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,166
You are wavering and challenging me
in what I ask you to do.

261
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,504
I will get you the partition deed.
I only ask that you remove the substitute.

262
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,599
You had agreed

263
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,477
to grant me this favor, had you not?

264
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,855
You asked that Jae-yi be married,

265
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,189
and I agreed to it.

266
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,860
And then what did you do?
You went out of your way to ruin it.

267
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,403
Thank heavens that I did.

268
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,614
It is fortuitous and a relief
to learn that Lady Ko is still alive.

269
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,575
It would have been against the law

270
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:07,203
to have one's daughter take the hand
of a man who is still married.

271
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,539
So why is it, then,

272
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,125
that you seem so upset?

273
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,258
Very well.

274
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,553
You shall have what you want.

275
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,139
Fortune smiles upon you once again.

276
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,559
But just know I will remember this.

277
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,324
Expect to receive
imminent punitive action.

278
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,619
Have the chain stores checked
and thoroughly prepared.

279
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,620
Yes, my lord.

280
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,205
May I add,

281
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,708
Mun Gyu-ha has discreetly sent word
through one of his men.

282
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,710
He wishes to meet with you, my lord.

283
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,255
What?

284
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,758
Why would he want that?

285
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,773
Do you think
I still harbor resentment toward you?

286
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,776
I did.

287
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,323
When you abandoned my sister
to become the Min family's son-in-law,

288
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,828
you refused to loosen the grip you had
on her, as if she still belonged to you.

289
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,581
Then the way
you indifferently turned your back on her

290
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,625
when she mysteriously disappeared.

291
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,339
I resented you
with every ounce of my being.

292
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,507
And so?

293
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,010
Do you intend to retaliate
after all these years?

294
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,221
I do. I have to.

295
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,602
But you are not my intended target.

296
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,024
I know

297
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,279
you would never have let any harm
come to my sister.

298
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,990
I watched with my own eyes for many years

299
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,033
how absolutely devoted you were to her.

300
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,539
When she fell ill, you labored
until your feet and hands were numb

301
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,833
to earn extra coins
to buy her quince syrup.

302
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,794
You were born out of wedlock and orphaned.

303
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,338
The only thing you had was your own body

304
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,049
when you joined the Min Family's Guild.

305
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,345
There, you gritted your teeth through
all sorts of dangerous, dirty tasks.

306
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,015
You were hoping
to catch Chief Merchant Min's attention.

307
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,143
All your efforts were so that one day,
you could marry Kkot-nim.

308
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,896
I do not wish to talk of the past anymore.

309
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,857
The one who tore you
away from my sister

310
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,401
and erased her
from the face of this earth?

311
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,653
I know very well who that person is.

312
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,947
Do you?

313
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,073
I do.

314
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,412
And I would like to align myself with you.

315
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,640
There you are.

316
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,100
I was wondering where you were.

317
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:19,979
Are you all right?

318
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,607
Yes.

319
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,902
How are you feeling?

320
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,198
I hear you had too much to drink that day.

321
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,410
Well, my insides did not enjoy it,
but I am better now.

322
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,579
Sister.

323
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,751
Yes?

324
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,752
What is it?

325
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:44,963
Did something happen?

326
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:48,967
Yes.

327
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,302
I believe something did.

328
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,887
What do you mean by that?

329
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,724
I am not sure

330
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,269
if it really happened or not.

331
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,148
It was quite hazy.

332
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,402
But I might have dreamt it.

333
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,451
If I did, then I will simply forget it.

334
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,913
But if it really happened…

335
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,966
I am at a loss for what to do.

336
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,927
Which would you prefer it to be?

337
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,974
Which of the two

338
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,976
would put your mind at ease?

339
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,231
Whatever it is…

340
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,818
is it making you upset?

341
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,530
Are you in pain because of it?

342
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,160
Yes.

343
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,468
All right, then.

344
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,221
It was just a dream.

345
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,835
The grandmaster is meticulous and remains
without fault in all his duties.

346
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,588
He's earned the trust of the store owners
and they would protect him.

347
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,466
I am sure
they would overlook any fault he made.

348
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,761
He is nothing but a stake.

349
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,430
A stake who is desperately
trying to secure his place.

350
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,265
Squeeze the store owners dry.

351
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,352
They will naturally come looking for help.

352
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,813
I shall be the one to provide that.

353
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,527
My son.

354
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,571
Are you on your way to your residence?

355
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,951
Yes. I am returning from examining
the goods destined for the palace.

356
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,371
What about you?
How are you getting on at the guild?

357
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,876
Well, next month, I am going
to look into the production side.

358
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,045
Mother.

359
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,100
Oh.I thought
I smelled a familiar scent.

360
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,434
A scent?

361
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,813
Yes, before, when I saw Father,
I picked up an unfamiliar scent.

362
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,274
I assumed you had changed your powder.

363
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,570
The scent likely came
from one of his visitors.

364
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,991
Good night.

365
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,877
He only saw two lords today.

366
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,755
Those were the only visitors
he was expecting.

367
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,341
He cannot possibly
be seeing another woman.

368
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,306
Look into what the chief merchant
has been up to.

369
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,765
Yes, my lady.

370
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,523
Do you remember what I told you
the very first day you were here?

371
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,276
What did I tell you that you must become?

372
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,569
You told me I must

373
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,363
seek to embody your essence.

374
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,533
And what was your reply to that?

375
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,036
That I would indeed do so.

376
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,829
So will you do it, then?

377
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,082
Or will you choose to receive
a moderate reward for your services

378
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,000
and step down?

379
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,170
I am…

380
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,383
and always will be your son.

381
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,510
I'm at your disposal.

382
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,399
Then come here
and write your name on this.

383
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,109
What is this, Father?

384
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,529
These papers represent the guild
I have created under another name.

385
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,450
I shall have everything on here
put in your name.

386
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,410
The remaining funds
that I have diversified

387
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,788
will be collected
and moved to this account shortly.

388
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,122
This means…

389
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,252
It is time.

390
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,089
Time to stand up for our family name.

391
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,191
The markets have improved.

392
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,210
We have many goods
going into the palace this day.

393
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,380
I ask that you go over everything
carefully to prevent any omissions.

394
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,339
Yes, my lord.

395
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,049
Now, if I call your name out,

396
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,802
come and sign or stamp your seal
on this document.

397
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,347
Deer antlers shall be provided
by the Bak household.

398
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,265
Yes, my lord.

399
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,439
- Agarwood, the Baek household.
- Yes, my lord.

400
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,695
- Cowhide, the Jang household.
- Yes, my lord.

401
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,572
Tortoiseshell,
the Byeon household.

402
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,614
Yes, my lord.

403
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,951
Leopard fur,

404
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,204
the Mun household.

405
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,122
Yes, sir.

406
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,839
Ginseng, the Lee household.

407
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,604
I paid
an exorbitant amount for these.

408
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,314
What do I do with them now?

409
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,531
I heard it did not go well.

410
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,116
It is troubling,

411
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,744
considering how the order
went to an utter nobody.

412
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,914
This is not the first time
we have dealt with the minister's whims.

413
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,124
Do not distress yourself, my lady.

414
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,378
I will negotiate a deal
with the Mun Family Guild

415
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,754
regarding these goods.

416
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,632
Do you think that could be possible?

417
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,384
Fortunately, my lady,

418
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,303
a merchant I granted a favor to
has joined them recently,

419
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,514
so things might work out for us,

420
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:55,059
meaning we should be able
to minimize our losses.

421
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,506
I hear the chief merchant
visited a kisaeng house recently.

422
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,590
However…

423
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,386
the person he met that day

424
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,596
was not a woman.

425
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,992
Jae-yi, are you there?

426
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,500
Over here!

427
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,502
Yes, yes.

428
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,712
Lift it up. Yes.

429
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,682
- Thank you for rectifying this for me.
- It was my pleasure.

430
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,309
Offering my help
was the right thing to do.

431
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,042
Now then,
we must peel all of these off.

432
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,127
Yes, sir.

433
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,153
Well, that should be easy.

434
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,946
Is it that man?

435
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,989
Yes, my lady.

436
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,657
As you can see here…

437
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,161
Did you not say
that he was an interpreter from Qing?

438
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,579
His Majesty was quite pleased…

439
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,830
Then why is it…

440
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,583
- I'm glad. If you'll excuse me.
- Of course.

441
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,126
…he seems so familiar?

442
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,776
What? Who is he?

443
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,235
Mun Gyu-ha.

444
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,695
Mun Gyu-ha?

445
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,572
He is Kkot-nim's older brother.

446
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,786
Of all people to choose.

447
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,290
He dares to conspire with
an old lover's family to take me down.

448
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,585
When it was my sword he wielded

449
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,631
to get rid of that wench years ago?

450
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,304
What a bold move you are making, my lord.

451
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,311
What evidence you have provided me with.

452
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,023
Now, if there will be blood spilt,

453
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,319
it shall only be that of yours, my lord.

454
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,948
- His Lordship wanted this here.
- Yes, coming!

455
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,121
Hurry.

456
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,372
Oh my heavens.

457
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,543
Be careful of the rocks.

458
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,569
Hurry!

459
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:26,200
Think of nothing else. Right? Carry out
Her Ladyship's orders. Understood?

460
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,534
Yes, sir.

461
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,063
Drag him out!

462
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,038
What do you think you are doing?

463
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:16,041
For the crime of illegally trading sulfur,
as prohibited by state law,

464
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,835
through the guild's silver mine,

465
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,838
for the crime of inflicting
significant harm on the guild

466
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,299
by causing the loss of innocent lives
due to an accident in said mine,

467
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,593
and for the crime of embezzling
from the guild

468
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,557
while accumulating wealth
under a borrowed name…

469
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:40,440
For these numerous offenses,
I hereby order the grandmaster ousted.

470
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:44,027
Do you have proper grounds
for accusing him of those activities?

471
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,115
Oh, I do. Not only do I have
the proper grounds,

472
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,158
I also have evidence
that he recently registered

473
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,327
a guild that was initially
under a borrowed name

474
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,622
in his very own name.

475
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,090
Have him bound and lock him up.

476
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,218
Then question him for the name
of the mastermind or accomplice.

477
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,595
Yes, my lady.

478
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,472
- Take him.
- My lady!

479
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:13,974
Wait.

480
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,519
Shall I

481
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,522
send him to the government office instead?

482
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:40,959
My brother.
