1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,053
Have you found out anything else?

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,931
I looked into the painters
the guild conducts business with.

3
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,475
But none of them seemed suspicious.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,520
I also did not find questionable ledgers
in the guild's library.

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,063
When it comes to the painter,

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,566
it seems the chief merchant
handles the matter.

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,776
As is expected.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,363
You must delve even deeper, then,
I suppose.

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,575
To do so,
you must not raise any more suspicions.

10
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,410
You were close to being found out.

11
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:42,208
Sim Jae-yi. That wench
nearly ruined everything we've worked for.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,337
And I'm certain
she'll complicate things again.

13
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,964
Get rid of her.

14
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,058
DEAR HONGRANG

15
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,537
I appreciate all you have done
for the chief merchant

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,081
as his lead merchants over the years.

17
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,502
Nevertheless, I am glad to see that
you have all made the difficult decision

18
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,462
to come and attend this meeting.

19
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,214
For this loyalty,

20
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,509
I shall repay you generously
for a long time to come.

21
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,676
You have my word.

22
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,262
Yes, my lady.

23
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,728
I have gathered you all here
not to ask you to turn against my husband,

24
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,523
but to help guide the guild
in a new direction.

25
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,944
I sincerely hope
that you do not reproach yourselves at all

26
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,946
for attending this meeting.

27
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,368
However, if perhaps you leave here
wishing you hadn't come,

28
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,578
then I hope you are prepared
to lose your life

29
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,581
and for all of your kin
to face the consequences

30
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,959
for generations and generations to come.

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,797
You have my word. It will be so.

32
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,552
Now then, shall we begin
this auspicious meeting?

33
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,475
Lady Min.

34
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,601
Merchant Mun.

35
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,979
It is not us, the lead merchants,

36
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,316
or the guild's disposition that guide
the chief merchant in any direction.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,694
- What does then?
- The patrons, my lady.

38
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,364
Those who have been instrumental
in ensuring the guild's profitability

39
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,116
through their constant patronage.

40
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,161
But especially the patrons
with significant influence

41
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,998
who've done business with the guild
due to the trusted relationship they had

42
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,584
with the previous chief merchant,
your late father.

43
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:54,090
That is the reason why they would be more
favorably inclined toward you, my lady.

44
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,386
I suggest you win them over first.

45
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,569
Her Ladyship held a covert meeting
with the lead merchants.

46
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,237
It does not bode well for us.

47
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,447
Rumors are circulating

48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,617
that the guild's ownership has already
been transferred to young master Hongrang.

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,327
Let us set off at daybreak.

50
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,163
I shall go to the Jin Arts store.

51
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,813
I want you to see to this task personally
and in utmost secrecy.

52
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,192
Yes. I will be most cautious, my lord.

53
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,404
- Has business been good these days?
- Yes, my lord.

54
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,004
Is something troubling you, my lord?

55
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,256
No.

56
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,385
I thought I smelled a familiar scent.

57
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,636
A scent?

58
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,313
Mun Gyu-ha.

59
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,565
What?

60
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,775
Uh, what of him, my lord?

61
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,571
How has he been faring these days?

62
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,616
He is dead, my lord.

63
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,912
His addiction to drinking and gambling
ruined everything he had.

64
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,957
Then the mother he had been neglecting
passed away.

65
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,044
He took his own life soon after that.

66
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,052
BIG EYES AND LEAN FACE

67
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,111
I am so sorry for keeping you waiting.

68
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,574
Let us get you someplace safe first, then…

69
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,592
What did you do to my sister?
Where is she?

70
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,011
- Guards!
- Where is she? Speak up!

71
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:31,349
What have you done to Kkot-nim?
Where did you send her?

72
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,352
Where is she? Please tell me!

73
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,020
Make your choice.

74
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:40,525
Either you leave with that wench
or take this stamp and assume your place.

75
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,071
It is up to you. Choose wisely.

76
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,710
You could leave with nothing

77
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,047
or secure your place here.

78
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,039
Young mistress.

79
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,419
My lady, are you still asleep?

80
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,547
Are you? I have brought you some food.

81
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,717
Four days have passed
since you've been in here.

82
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,803
My lady?

83
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,939
<i>And I'm certain she'll</i>
<i>complicate things again. Get rid of her.</i>

84
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,901
Whether you are an imposter or not,

85
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,446
I hope you are no longer in pain.

86
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,326
And yet,

87
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,620
she's in no position

88
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,039
to worry about others.

89
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,624
My lady.

90
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,885
Oh! Oh no, goodness! Eul-bun! Eul-bun!

91
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,513
Eul-bun!

92
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,309
- What is it, Mother?
- She's not well.

93
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,810
The poor young girl.

94
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,187
What about my sister?

95
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,673
<i>Sister,</i>

96
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,883
<i>please get better.</i>

97
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,982
I feel sad when you're in pain.

98
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,068
Please… get better.

99
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,571
I want you to feel happy.

100
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,083
The combination of her being
unable to eat, coupled with anxiety,

101
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,960
caused her spleen
and stomach to malfunction,

102
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,962
resulting in her coughing up blood.

103
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,256
After a few days of good rest,
she will be well.

104
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,635
There's no need to worry.
I shall prescribe <i>yeonsimsan.</i>

105
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,262
Let it steep in water
and have her drink it.

106
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,774
Oh my. This is Sin's <i>Miindo </i>painting,
is it not?

107
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,277
How on earth did you manage
to get your hands on this?

108
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,113
I shall buy it from you right now.

109
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,740
What is your asking price?

110
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,033
This is a gift.

111
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,703
A present from Her Ladyship
to you, Your Honor.

112
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,413
- What?
- Ah.

113
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,209
She's offering this as a gift?
A piece as precious as this?

114
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,634
Very well. What would Her Ladyship
like in return?

115
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,347
She has returned?

116
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,773
What? Is there something else?

117
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,701
I acted too rashly.

118
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,495
It was careless.

119
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,956
I know full well

120
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,958
the extent of your pain.

121
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,795
I've caused you even more suffering.
I am so sorry.

122
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,260
Believe me.

123
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,346
Perhaps

124
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,140
he really is Hongrang.

125
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,142
Have you thought about that?

126
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,146
What would you do then?

127
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,570
I must accept it.

128
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,656
If he is your brother,
in a way, he is my brother too.

129
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,753
If I understand correctly,

130
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,048
the person who conspired with Hong-sik
to have me drink the pomegranate wine

131
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,383
was not Sim Jae-yi.

132
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,052
It was the substitute brother.

133
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,221
She was trying to protect him.

134
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,808
And I simply danced to her tune.

135
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,369
I am utterly repulsed.
I've lost my appetite.

136
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,539
What is it you want to say?
Why are we all here?

137
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,167
Please get on with it.

138
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,589
Hongrang.

139
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,426
- Yes?
- Pay a visit to your great-uncle.

140
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,764
But he lives so far.
Why do you wish him to go?

141
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,474
I received a letter from him.

142
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,228
He last saw Hongrang when he was
but a child. He wishes to see him again.

143
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,773
It was inconsiderate of me not to have
sent Hongrang to visit him sooner.

144
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,193
May I take my sister with me?

145
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,696
I have yet to recall
so many memories from my childhood,

146
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,326
and it worries me that I may
unintentionally cause him distress.

147
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,370
I'd like her to accompany me.

148
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,541
She would help alleviate my uneasiness
and aid me in recalling my memories.

149
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,668
Very well. You may take her.

150
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,894
- He is away from home yet again?
- Yes, my lord.

151
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,110
His leg condition
must be completely cured, then.

152
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,611
He no longer needs his palanquin.

153
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,946
W-Well, that is--

154
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,907
Take this and have it delivered
to His Honor.

155
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,294
- He gave you this and then he simply left?
- Yes, my lord.

156
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,547
I see both the husband and the wife

157
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,009
are being remarkably tactful
in their efforts, are they not?

158
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,012
However, since I've already received
a treasure from Her Ladyship,

159
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:52,308
it would be unlikely
for him to persuade me with anything else.

160
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,064
What?

161
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,566
What on earth?

162
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,735
Get my carriage ready.

163
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,155
I must go to the Min Family Guild
this instant!

164
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,215
- This is an imitation.
- How can you tell?

165
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,969
It is such intricate work.
It is almost impossible to discern.

166
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,015
Are you suggesting
that Lady Min sent me a forgery?

167
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,767
Are you sure about this?

168
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,478
Yeol-guk,

169
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,398
it is not that I distrust your judgment,
but how can you be sure?

170
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,277
These two pieces look identical.
How can you tell one from the other?

171
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,112
I am sure that I'm not mistaken.

172
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,368
All pieces that come into the guild
have been marked in a certain way.

173
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,383
JIN

174
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,804
How deceitful! The nerve of that woman.

175
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,478
Your Honor,

176
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,815
you have been greatly wronged here.

177
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,942
Please forgive me.

178
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,360
Oh, no.

179
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,029
You have done nothing wrong.

180
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,532
I now realize that Lady Min

181
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:36,412
has been acting in a very undignified way
to claim the guild for herself.

182
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,124
She likely meant no harm, my lord.

183
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,042
She lacks a detailed eye for art.

184
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,753
You see, she typically
handles the guild's financial matters.

185
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,506
Huh.

186
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,216
Now, wait.

187
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,512
There must be others
who have also received a forgery.

188
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,354
Lord Hong,

189
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,733
you should have sent word
that you would be coming.

190
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,359
Please come inside.

191
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,318
Hmph.

192
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,322
Chief Merchant…

193
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,800
Find out what is going on.

194
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,093
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,423
- Why have you brought a dagger?
- Do you remember what I taught you before?

196
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,344
I do, but vaguely.

197
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,971
I hold it like this?

198
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,349
Allow me.

199
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,063
I think it was like this.

200
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,690
Have mercy.

201
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,150
Was that correct?

202
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,071
Yes. I give you it
so you can protect yourself like that.

203
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,578
You must come back safely.

204
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,665
I will.

205
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,628
Tie them up tightly. Make sure.

206
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,095
All right.

207
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,268
My dear son,

208
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,521
it pains me so much
that I cannot go with you.

209
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,441
There is an urgent matter
that I must attend to.

210
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,610
His Lordship
is a strict and principled man,

211
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,697
so be sure to treat him
with the utmost courteousness.

212
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,823
I will.

213
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,033
I will see you soon, Mother.

214
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,569
I'm having them followed.
There's no need for worry.

215
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,638
- Help yourselves.
- Let us eat.

216
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,610
Heavens, this tastes good.

217
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,050
Oh my goodness.
You are just a fledgling, aren't you?

218
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,891
How ever did you fall from up there?

219
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,273
It might have been pushed out
by its own mother.

220
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,232
What?

221
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,778
Mother birds tend to abandon chicks
that are weak or have deformities.

222
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,365
Keeping it alive would mean another mouth
to feed. Most likely it would die anyway.

223
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,661
I don't know. This one wants to live.

224
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,539
Look. See how its wings are flapping.

225
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,332
I believe it's telling us
it needs our help.

226
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,543
It wants to go back to its nest.

227
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,384
Here. You hold it.

228
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,140
Hand it back to me
once I get close to the nest.

229
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,684
Can you even… climb?

230
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,166
You hold it.

231
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,721
What are you waiting for?

232
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,198
Oh!

233
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,162
What?

234
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,747
Are you going to catch me?

235
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,541
- Hmm.
- All right, then, as you wish.

236
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,213
Oh!

237
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,302
You said that you would try!

238
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,098
You said you would try harder to be
a little brother. Is this what you meant?

239
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,642
I thought that's what
little brothers were like.

240
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,019
Immature, reckless, and impulsive.

241
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,948
The objects I sent the patrons
were all imitations?

242
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,449
Yes, my lady.

243
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,576
That cannot be.

244
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,579
We retrieved them from the strongroom,
so how could that be possible?

245
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,207
Someone must have
tampered with the pieces.

246
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,208
But who?

247
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,835
Why?

248
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,299
Do you mean the items
were not authentic to begin with?

249
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,592
This is disastrous.

250
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:54,057
I have damaged the guild's reputation
and the trust of its patrons.

251
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,726
I have to be the one
accountable for everything, mustn't I?

252
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:03,567
My lady, I have heard rumors
that Madam Gwigokja is close by.

253
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,861
Find out where she is. Right now!

254
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,487
Yes, my lady.

255
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,378
<i>Do away with her on the journey.</i>

256
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,840
Say she fled to find her brother.
That should be a sufficient excuse.

257
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,926
I have evidence to prove she saved
enough money working with the strays

258
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,344
<i>to flee to Yanjing.</i>

259
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,020
Hah!

260
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,847
Hongrang! My heavens, is it really you?

261
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,641
Why, you've not changed one bit, indeed.

262
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,519
I thought I would never get to see you
again before I died.

263
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,897
Do you remember me at all?
Please, take a look around.

264
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,399
Everything should be
exactly as you remember it.

265
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,407
No wonder. I thought it looked familiar.

266
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,117
Beautiful.

267
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,328
Especially the pine tree.

268
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,913
Of course you remember that!

269
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,332
You used to stand on the tips of your toes

270
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,751
and say that you would
grow taller than it. Hmm!

271
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,003
Goodness. Hmm.

272
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,851
I owe everything to my sister.

273
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,814
It's thanks to her I have been able
to recall things little by little.

274
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:10,151
Oh, of course. You two were inseparable
ever since you were little.

275
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,653
Oh, yes, yes.

276
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,198
Jae-yi, is it not?
You have not changed a bit either.

277
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,286
Oh, yes. Welcome back.

278
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,383
…to become such a dashing young man.

279
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,720
I hear you thought differently.

280
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,142
Pardon?

281
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,311
What was it?

282
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,105
What instantly prompted you to deny

283
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,441
that he was the brother
you had lost 12 years ago?

284
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,489
I did not

285
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,451
find him recognizable at all.

286
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,370
Then, what about now?

287
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,956
Do you still have doubts
that he is your little brother?

288
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,725
Let me tell you something.

289
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,814
In my youth, I led countless soldiers,
and every single one of them

290
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,902
had a fear of some sort pent up inside.

291
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:40,241
Fear often stems from something
one experiences in childhood.

292
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,578
Soldiers who have memories
of almost drowning as a child

293
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,913
develop a fear of water.

294
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,707
Those who recall
falling from a considerable height

295
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,417
develop a fear of heights.

296
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,718
Which means that…

297
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,931
you must fear this.

298
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,522
You were severely burned
by a brazier's flame in this very room.

299
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,149
It must have left you with a scar.

300
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,654
Yet, look at you.
You do not seem to fear fire at all.

301
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,041
It is simply because I have experienced
much worse horrors.

302
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,588
Intense hunger left my insides feeling
as though they were being seared by fire.

303
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,551
<i>The biting cold made my skin</i>
<i>feel as if it were being torn apart.</i>

304
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,095
<i>That was worse than any pain from a burn.</i>

305
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,017
<i>In the darkness,</i>
<i>where I could not see an inch ahead of me,</i>

306
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,145
I hoped for a single ember to warm me.

307
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,022
<i>I did not care</i>
<i>if it meant I could burn up or die.</i>

308
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,650
<i>However, despite the hunger</i>

309
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,986
<i>and the bleak cold and dark,</i>

310
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,531
what I feared most
was nothing that would hurt me physically.

311
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,241
It was the fear of being alone.

312
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,666
No other kind of fear
could surpass that feeling of loneliness.

313
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,252
No other fear

314
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,671
will ever be greater.

315
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,803
Fortunately, it appears that you will not
have to endure such a fate.

316
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,037
She is here.

317
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,886
You should not be staying
in such an awful place.

318
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,555
Come with me, please.

319
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,849
You are

320
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,685
at risk of losing something
again, I gather.

321
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,275
I beg you to lay a blessing upon me.

322
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,238
I fear that both myself and my son
appear to be at serious risk

323
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,823
of falling into grave danger.

324
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,282
Who is at fault?

325
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,494
If you had not put yourself at risk
to begin with,

326
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:33,206
you would not have had to come here
at all, would you?

327
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:34,958
Yes.

328
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,419
It is because I acted rashly.

329
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:44,634
An imitation exists
only because an authentic one exists.

330
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,552
What?

331
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,430
What do you…

332
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:17,125
I once thought that it might be better
if you did not in fact return home.

333
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,003
I had hoped that you had either passed on

334
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:24,257
or found happiness in another life
far from your homeland.

335
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:30,096
I did not want you to one day suffer
the consequences of your parents' sins.

336
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,767
Forgive me.

337
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,645
What do you mean by that?

338
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,482
Remember this.

339
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:47,071
Spilling innocent blood
will have its consequences.

340
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,450
We will rest here for the night.

341
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,083
Take the porters
and settle someplace farther.

342
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,525
Why are you lurking here?

343
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,948
Let us end this quickly.
We wouldn't want to wake anyone.

344
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,254
Hongrang?

345
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,552
Hello? Are you sleeping?

346
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,928
I'm talking to you!

347
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,460
Such a shame.

348
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,712
Quite wasteful.

349
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,256
You are all good swordsmen.

350
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,219
Now tell me, who sent you?

351
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,096
<i>You are up against a Soul Reaper.</i>

352
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,682
Take only your most skilled men with you.

353
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,643
Do not let her out of your sight.

354
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,104
You must not let him harm
a single hair on her head.

355
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,995
Get rid of the bastard.

356
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,541
But the grandmaster's orders
were to protect the lady, sir.

357
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,512
I doubt your silence is due to loyalty.
Perhaps pride? Or is it work ethic?

358
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:38,931
However,

359
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,351
pride and duty are luxuries

360
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,312
that mercenaries who kill for money
can ill afford.

361
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,399
I do understand though.

362
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,567
You see,

363
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,820
I am not much different from you.

364
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,429
Where is she?

365
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,309
Oh! What is it?

366
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,145
- Did something hap--
- I…

367
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,896
thought I had lost you.

368
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,816
- Again.
- What?

369
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,401
I said I thought I had

370
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,653
lost you again.

371
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,948
You thought you did what?

372
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,294
What was that just now?

373
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,547
Springing into action.
Was that to protect me?

374
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,843
Just stop it.

375
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,138
What? Stop what?

376
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,062
What is it now?

377
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,613
That must have happened
when I went for a stroll to, uh…

378
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,158
Why are you hurt?

379
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,579
Why do you keep getting hurt?
I do not understand why.

380
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,957
Why?

381
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,858
Now then, we must resolve this issue.

382
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,317
In order to do so,

383
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,320
we will compare the pieces you received
with the ones I have kept.

384
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,906
We will identify which ones are authentic

385
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,783
and which ones are imitations.

386
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,702
We will do it right here and now.

387
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,459
Send in the appraisers.

388
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,556
Goodness, why are they so quiet?

389
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,855
I, for one, remain hopeful.

390
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,070
Why do they need to stare at it
for so long? Good heavens.

391
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,864
Be quick, damn it.

392
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,450
What is your opinion?

393
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,496
After conducting multiple examinations
and speaking amongst ourselves,

394
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,289
we have reached a unanimous conclusion.

395
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,959
The pieces on the right-hand side
are authentic.

396
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,044
We were had, then.

397
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,798
- How on earth did this happen?
- I am curious to know as well.

398
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,091
Did you mean to deceive us from the start?

399
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,844
We would very much like to hear
what you have to say.

400
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:46,762
Lady Min,

401
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,473
speak up and explain yourself!

402
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,419
- Oh, my heavens!
- Oh! Oh!

403
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,838
What do you think you're doing?

404
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,298
You are mistaken.

405
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,679
This! And this!

406
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,099
All of these are the fake pieces!

407
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,394
We had the appraisers inspect them
right before our eyes.

408
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,395
Yes.

409
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,397
I know.

410
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,609
They are fake as well!

411
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,403
All those imbeciles.

412
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:49,366
So now let me show you the truth.

413
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,786
Bring him in!

414
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,130
It is Chu, the son-in-law
from Jin Arts Supply Store, is it not?

415
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,633
Which of these did you draw?

416
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:12,639
The ones on the right-hand side
are the ones I drew, my lady.

417
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,018
What nonsense.

418
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,728
I leave my mark

419
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,772
on all my imitation pieces.

420
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,822
Is that so?

421
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,616
Then show us.

422
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,911
We need to see if there is a mark there.

423
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,596
JIN

424
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,474
No! Those markings
indicate their authenticity.

425
00:48:55,974 --> 00:49:00,687
It is a mark in my handwriting
indicating that it is a work of imitation.

426
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,356
Work of imitation?

427
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:25,921
The character "Jin"?

428
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,636
- The handwriting is identical.
- So that one is fake?

429
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,679
Exactly.

430
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:48,777
Now then, shall I
fill that chest up with gold or

431
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:53,115
shall I have your family's heads cut off
and put them in there?

432
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,117
This is ridiculous!

433
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,875
What do you think you are doing?

434
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,004
I merely took a page out of your book.

435
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,172
What did you do?

436
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,259
You had the authentic pieces
replaced with forgeries.

437
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,052
Is that why you think you can do this?

438
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,224
That you can falsely claim
that those imitations are authentic?

439
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,227
You will have to face
the consequences of this action.

440
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,604
There are dozens of appraisers,

441
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,483
as well as the original painters
who will be able to identify their work.

442
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,403
An imitation is what it is.

443
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:35,073
It will never be an original,
no matter how much you insist otherwise.

444
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:38,744
But that is exactly what is happening now.

445
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,419
No! All of these are authentic pieces!

446
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,795
Put the fire out now!

447
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,097
Put it out!

448
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,724
Dowse the flames. Hurry!

449
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,726
Hurry! Put it out now!

450
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,228
- Fire!
- Fire!

451
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,897
Fire!

452
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:17,699
These are authentic pieces! No!

453
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,038
What makes a fake a fake

454
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,582
is the existence of an authentic.

455
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,002
Well then,

456
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,881
which ones should be
considered authentic now?

457
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,639
Will you do something for me?

458
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,570
Ridiculous.

459
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,572
I should not have cried.

460
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,744
Strange, is it not?

461
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,538
I am the one who is injured,

462
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,541
yet she's the one in pain.

463
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,418
Is it because we are alike?

464
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,803
It was pity.

465
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,555
I was feeling sorry for her.

466
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,684
Watching her show concern for someone else
when she is clearly suffering.

467
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,688
It was such a sad sight to behold.

468
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,859
Rest assured

469
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,319
I am well aware
that there are worse things.

470
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,697
Souls that are worse off.

471
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,959
This emotion will pass.

472
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,741
We cannot have the Min Family Guild's
only daughter looking this gaunt.

473
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,913
You should go and rest.
You will be exhausted from all the travel.

474
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,209
Welcome home, my beloved son.

475
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,419
- Have you been well, Mother?
- Yes.

476
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,629
Let us go inside.

477
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,915
Oh dear.

478
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,637
Why is the girl still alive?

479
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,307
I doubt it was a failure on your part.

480
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,351
Have you kept her alive intentionally?

481
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,352
Yes.

482
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,604
It would be tragic.

483
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,981
Tragic, how?

484
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,525
I am not the guild master's real son.

485
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,736
Mu-jin is adopted, and he is just there
to further his cause.

486
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,821
The girl, though,

487
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,532
Sim Jae-yi is his daughter by blood.

488
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,200
If you keep her alive,

489
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,828
she'll prove useful
when the critical moment arrives.

490
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:54,165
But still, she remains suspicious of you.
And she will keep you at risk.

491
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,250
Her trust…

492
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,878
That is all that I need to earn from her.

493
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,924
But can you truly earn her trust?

494
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,761
It has been a long time.
My goodness, you look pale.

495
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,430
Have you seen a specter?

496
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,597
No.

497
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,018
It is just that I heard…

498
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,894
Ah.

499
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,480
You heard the rumor that my mother died

500
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,232
while I was searching
for my missing sister,

501
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:24,029
and that I had killed myself after
indulging in drinking and gambling, yes?

502
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,364
Mm. Well, I'm sorry to say,

503
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,241
it is only half true.

504
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,285
As you can see,

505
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,619
I am alive and well.

506
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,956
I have been living in Qing.

507
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,835
My uncle owns some land there,
so I thought I would offer him some help.

508
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:39,753
I see.

509
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,630
What are you doing here now?

510
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,631
Oh.

511
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,552
Yes. I have a task to attend to.

512
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,305
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have some place to be.

513
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,724
Let us talk some more at another time.

514
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:56,811
I must say, though…

515
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,066
how can you be so heartless?

516
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,818
She was once your lover, was she not?

517
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,158
I am curious.

518
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,870
How could you not ask
about my sister Kkot-nim's whereabouts?

519
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,664
Perhaps you simply do not care.

520
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,208
Or is it

521
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,586
that you know better than anyone else
where she is?

522
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,970
<i>I will protect you</i>

523
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,139
<i>at all costs.</i>

524
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,157
It is good to see you again, Master.

525
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,550
It has been so long,

526
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,261
dear Mother.
