1
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,344
<i>You know how people</i>
<i>are born into a family with a name?</i>

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>You are someone's son,</i>

3
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>someone's little brother,</i>

4
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,559
<i>someone's cousin or friend.</i>

5
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,353
<i>Even someone's neighbor.</i>

6
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,064
I was never something to anyone.

7
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,566
I was always alone.

8
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,651
As if I'd just

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,695
dropped from the sky.

10
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>Who on earth are you?</i>

11
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,035
<i>I must know.</i>

12
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:29,047
DEAR HONGRANG

13
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,053
That is your decision?
You wish to go with him?

14
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,472
Yes.

15
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,724
Do you have a specific reason why?

16
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,978
I have already told you

17
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,358
that I would do what I could
to free myself from being at your--

18
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,320
You know that a birthright
cannot be denied when you want it to be.

19
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,073
As my blood,
you have a legal right to the guild,

20
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,575
which is essentially my legal right.

21
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,660
That is the law.

22
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,538
Which is why it is necessary for me

23
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,790
that you remain here.

24
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,125
Do you understand?

25
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,751
If I stay,

26
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,547
are you certain it will help your cause?

27
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,136
I want to explore.

28
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,140
I want to experience life
as a normal person for once.

29
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,643
Please let me go.

30
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,938
I cannot bear to be here.

31
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,649
Can you not understand?

32
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,284
She actually offered to leave
with the pitiful stake herself?

33
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,328
- And the chief merchant approved of this?
- Yes, my lady.

34
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,498
That cunning cow.

35
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,418
She is a clever one.

36
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,461
She always finds ways to save herself.

37
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,634
The chief merchant should know one thing,

38
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,136
and if he does not already,

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,181
then it is about time he realizes.

40
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,228
No matter how much
he tries to squirm away,

41
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,063
he will always be

42
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,316
within my reach.

43
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,590
I thought I was clear when I told you
to leave without complicating things.

44
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,635
Is that not what we agreed on
when I saved your life?

45
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,929
So what is all this
about taking Jae-yi with you?

46
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,930
Rodent Scrap.

47
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,684
You know that name, do you not?

48
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,566
I have nothing left to lose.

49
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,319
She is all I need,
but I doubt you feel the same.

50
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,529
You must have had very good reasons

51
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,282
for casting aside your name
for all these years.

52
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,536
Whatever your reasons may be

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,081
and whatever your intentions are,
I do not care to know.

54
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,123
All I ask is that

55
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,918
you let Jae-yi go.

56
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,006
Does Jae-yi know?

57
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,427
Did you tell her?

58
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,570
Even Lead Merchant Jang is resigning?

59
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,823
He cannot turn to Her Ladyship,
nor can he just sit still

60
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,908
and risk who-knows-what things
that come his way.

61
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,785
He intends to just play it safe for now.

62
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,245
- Oh my.
- Goodness!

63
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,415
The chief merchant is in dire straits.

64
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,750
With the discovery of that guild
and the chief merchant,

65
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,335
who was very close to him,

66
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,503
backed into a corner,

67
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,588
even his close associates

68
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,008
are busy washing their hands
of responsibility.

69
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,760
Why is he allowing
his daughter to leave? I don't know.

70
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,887
She is the sole pretext
for him to keep his place.

71
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,849
Now Chief Merchant Sim
is nothing more than a paper tiger.

72
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,107
This is your first roll call
as the grandmaster, is it not?

73
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,948
You have no idea.

74
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,118
I have been eagerly awaiting this day
for so long now.

75
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,799
What is going on?

76
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,928
- Where is everyone rushing off to?
- To the treasure chamber.

77
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,348
You should hurry there, my lady.

78
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,655
It moves me
that you traveled all this way.

79
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,116
You have honored us with your presence.

80
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,411
The more I see,
the more seemingly refined he is.

81
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,539
It is as if

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,625
I am looking at a waterfall

83
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,961
frozen in the snowy winter.

84
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,588
So pure, fair, and strong.

85
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,341
And yet merciless and effortless.

86
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,678
His winnowing intelligence and air

87
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,472
are that of no ordinary man
I have encountered.

88
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,308
Even the most magnificent objects
are useless

89
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,311
if you do not happen to possess them.

90
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,898
For an object that you cannot use

91
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,234
may lead to a downfall instead.

92
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,780
Indeed.

93
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,784
The sharper the blade of the sword may be,

94
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,456
the more threatening it becomes
when it is in the hands of another.

95
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,876
On to other matters.

96
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,089
Regarding Lord Song's son
who came back from the dead,

97
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,050
I heard he eventually passed away.

98
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,135
Yes, Your Highness.

99
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,683
If the boy was fated to die,

100
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,603
it would have been easier
if he had not returned at all.

101
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,438
But, Your Highness…

102
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,068
<i>when the family dug his grave</i>
<i>to place him back in his coffin…</i>

103
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,867
<i>…they discovered</i>
<i>it had the body of the child</i>

104
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,869
<i>they buried the previous year in it.</i>

105
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:20,041
<i>Due to Lord Song's repeated appeals,</i>
<i>the royal court has issued a decree.</i>

106
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,545
<i>They want the Royal Investigation Bureau</i>
<i>to look into the matter thoroughly.</i>

107
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,507
<i>Meanwhile, the Criminal Justice Agency</i>

108
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,427
<i>is to search for children who have</i>
<i>gone missing or vanished over the years</i>

109
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,471
<i>and increase patrolling efforts.</i>

110
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,182
They are enforcing
stricter curfews for children.

111
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:41,020
They are to question witnesses
to try and find the Snow Man.

112
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,317
Pursuing a delusion…

113
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,446
…it will not guarantee a thing.

114
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,991
Suppose they catch it. Then what?

115
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,120
Why waste their energy
on such a futile endeavor?

116
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,082
This leaves me with no other choice.

117
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,838
I may have to create a painting
that captures the essence of yin and yang.

118
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,424
The recent state of disarray
in the country

119
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,220
is very likely a result
of an imbalance between yin and yang.

120
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,265
Many years ago,

121
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,270
my beloved painting of yin and yang
was lost, was it not?

122
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,230
It has always weighed on me

123
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,192
that I have not been able to paint
anything as profound since then.

124
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,032
Here is what I expect of you.

125
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,204
Avoid excessive concern
with guild matters or secular customs,

126
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,041
and instead focus
on issues of greater importance.

127
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,213
I shall do so with the utmost sincerity.

128
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,115
Apart from the burns and bruises
found on the body of young master Song,

129
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,491
many injuries and inflammations

130
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,828
caused by exposure
to toxic substances were observed.

131
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,122
Upon analysis, traces of limestone,

132
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,000
alum, arsenic,
and other similar substances

133
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,835
were found inside the child's body.

134
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,508
Alum, limestone, and arsenic?

135
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,761
Substances that are not commonly used.

136
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,680
There must be a location with
a consistent supply of these materials.

137
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,474
- We must find it.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,984
We must hurry.

139
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,571
Now that the situation has escalated,
they are most likely rushing as well.

140
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,431
- If you leave, will you ever come back?
- I am not sure.

141
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,978
Still, it must be a relief that you are
going to be with your brother.

142
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,940
Yes, that is true. It is better
than marrying into a random household

143
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,983
or facing her mother's constant abuse.

144
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,404
What about Hongrang?
Did he not object to you leaving?

145
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,049
In other words,
you are willing to abandon everything,

146
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,136
regardless of whether some stranger
comes in and takes over,

147
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,180
taking control of the guild
and the household.

148
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,897
He is an imposter.

149
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,234
That is why
you have gathered all your belongings.

150
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,945
You are going to look
for the real Hongrang, are you not?

151
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,947
Are you not disgusted by him?

152
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,782
Why are you turning a blind eye?

153
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,993
It is not about that.

154
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,413
I cannot forgive myself.

155
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,622
For being fooled?

156
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,418
Do you know
what the first thing I felt was?

157
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,504
The feeling I had inside when I found out?

158
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,214
It was relief.

159
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,885
I felt a sense of relief,

160
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,138
even though he had been deceiving me
and everyone else.

161
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,515
He had stolen my brother's name.

162
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,311
And even though my real brother might
still be wandering around somewhere,

163
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,938
when I found out
that he was not really him,

164
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,025
I felt so relieved.

165
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,610
You see, even then,

166
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,945
I did not want him to get hurt.

167
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,532
I could not bear
the thought of him getting hurt.

168
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,870
That is why I go.

169
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,290
I cannot do it.

170
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,668
I cannot forgive myself.

171
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,480
Welcome, my lord.

172
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,151
That pair is light and sturdy, my lord.

173
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,323
- I shall take these.
- Right away, my lord.

174
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,262
Grandmaster, sir,

175
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,431
I suggest you reveal
that he is an imposter.

176
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,103
If you do, he will not be able
to avoid the punishment of death.

177
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,731
Once he is gone, you should no longer have
any concerns about the young mistress.

178
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,691
No.

179
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,276
I cannot do that.

180
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,235
Why not?

181
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,196
At this moment,

182
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,866
Jae-yi's heart belongs to him.

183
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,830
She will never be able to forget him
if she loses him right now.

184
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,336
Does it not anger you that all the years
of hard work you have endured

185
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,297
will be for absolutely nothing?

186
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,513
They were hard years.

187
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,557
Very difficult to endure, indeed.

188
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,311
Jae-yi was with me the whole journey.
She helped me.

189
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,649
That is why I cannot bring myself

190
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,484
to lose her now.

191
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,195
What is more…

192
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,452
I cannot be the one
to send him to his death.

193
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,455
He saved my life.

194
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,041
He has done it several times now.

195
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,098
- Please spare us!
- Have mercy on us!

196
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,104
Stand up!

197
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,830
Calm yourself and stop squirming.

198
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,749
I will make your skin
as fair as porcelain.

199
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,239
Jae-yi!

200
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,701
Jae-yi.

201
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,165
Hello, brother.

202
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,598
They are Java sparrows.

203
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,894
Once they find a mate,
they remain together their whole lives.

204
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,312
If one of them dies,

205
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,315
then the surviving partner
often does not live much longer.

206
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,400
It cannot go on.

207
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,987
I suppose they are each other's lifeline.

208
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,950
I hope that you will
take good care of them.

209
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,370
I can too.

210
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,748
We will both raise them
at Gapsan Mountain together.

211
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,547
All right.

212
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,049
We can do that.

213
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,723
Promise me something.

214
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,726
What?

215
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,228
That you will try to forget.

216
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,438
All of it.

217
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,608
All that has happened
at the Min Family Guild.

218
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,069
To be honest,

219
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,157
this place has been
like a battlefield to me.

220
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,578
I never knew what would be flying at me
from where and when.

221
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,666
I never knew what would become a weapon
that would end up hurting me.

222
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,460
I was always anxious and scared.

223
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,045
Anything could become a sword

224
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,506
or an arrow that could pierce me.

225
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,967
Anything at all.

226
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,803
Except for you.

227
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,600
I know.

228
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,269
I felt the same way.

229
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,689
Of course.

230
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,943
Now that it is just the two of us,

231
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,738
I hope you can forget the rest.

232
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,409
You will never have to be scared
or anxious about anything.

233
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,869
You and I can

234
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,789
become like the Java sparrows.
We can be each other's lifeline.

235
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,543
All right.

236
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,087
I will forget it all.

237
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,758
I have to.

238
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,292
What do you think you're doing,
you rapscallion bastards?

239
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,090
Forgive us our indiscretion.

240
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,469
I am here to escort you.

241
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,223
My master wishes to speak with you
on an urgent matter.

242
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,151
An imposter?

243
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,696
That is what I said.

244
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,449
I am well aware

245
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,452
that for many years now
that is all you have done.

246
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,080
Bring me imposters.

247
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,792
That is all the more reason
for you to trust me.

248
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,420
Since I created all those imposters,

249
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,257
I should be the best at discerning
who is an imposter or not.

250
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:45,304
However, I do not base the observation
solely on my keen instinct.

251
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,807
The rogue is not acting alone.

252
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,644
There is a mastermind
who sent him to infiltrate the guild.

253
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,355
A ruthless group of black-clad swordsmen,

254
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,858
trained solely for killing,
are defending him.

255
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,110
If true, what do you think
they are working toward?

256
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,695
They want you.

257
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,824
They want to overthrow you
and take the guild for themselves.

258
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,952
Have you heard of the Snow Man?

259
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,790
Huh. If you have not, I assume
you have heard about Lord Song's son.

260
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,667
It's been the talk of the town lately.

261
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,755
Those scoundrels are planning
something to do with that incident.

262
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:24,426
They are trying to tie you somehow
to the boy's return and this Snow Man.

263
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,969
Their goal is to

264
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,598
tarnish your reputation
and undermine your position.

265
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,309
Are there any grounds
to support this theory of yours?

266
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,602
Irrefutable proof.

267
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,688
Those rogues have devised a trap

268
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,358
that, inevitably,
you will find yourself falling into.

269
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,863
Why do you hesitate?

270
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,199
I am offering you saving grace.

271
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,576
Think about what has been going on.

272
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,579
The circumstances in the guild of late.

273
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,832
Your position is
becoming increasingly precarious.

274
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,211
If that is the case,
the discovery of Hongrang as an imposter

275
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,172
would become an opportunity for you,
would it not?

276
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:07,302
Give me 5,000 nyang,
then hand over the imposter to me.

277
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,346
I would like to know what proof you have.

278
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,390
Ten o'clock tomorrow night,

279
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,433
bring me the money.

280
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,312
Then I shall present it to you.

281
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,896
Tell me.

282
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,691
Who is the painter?

283
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,860
Where is he?

284
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,902
I have no idea.

285
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,946
I do not know!

286
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,323
I said I don't know!

287
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,159
Shall I help you remember?

288
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,410
Oh no!

289
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,374
Limestone powder.

290
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,883
Alum powder.

291
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,928
Calm yourself.

292
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,347
I will make your skin
as fair as porcelain.

293
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,727
I see you remember now.

294
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,657
The question is, where did
young master Song get all of those wounds?

295
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,036
When he appeared,
his entire body had been burnt black.

296
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,913
Either a large fire occurred somewhere

297
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,833
or the child was confined
in an enclosed space that was lit on fire.

298
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,170
Seeing as he managed to return home
in such horrific condition,

299
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,422
it suggests that he was likely nearby.

300
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,549
But, apparently,

301
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,386
when they examined the clothes
he was wearing when he returned,

302
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,182
there was a piece of broken ceramic
stuck to the fabric.

303
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,979
Do you see where this is leading?

304
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:29,986
Now,

305
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,113
take a look.

306
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,208
No need to look surprised.
I suggest you see for yourself.

307
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,386
Do you know
who this stone kiln belongs to?

308
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,304
It is one of yours.

309
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,351
Of course, you were not aware of this.

310
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,646
As chief merchant, you are not concerned
with an abandoned kiln.

311
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,731
That is what those bastards
are counting on.

312
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,649
Correct?

313
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,045
- Dispose of him.
- Yes, my lord.

314
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,336
What?

315
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,795
What is it?

316
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,013
If the child had escaped,
you should have done him in right away.

317
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,226
What reason do you have
for abandoning the kiln site?

318
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,770
If you moved the other children,

319
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,230
you should have reported
their new location to me immediately.

320
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,440
Reported?

321
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,697
Who do you take me for?
A slave who reports to you?

322
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,283
- What was that?
- A money king, my foot.

323
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,744
More a money slave.

324
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,582
What you hold in your hands is merely
the facade of the Min Family's Guild,

325
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,834
and you are on the verge of losing that.

326
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,588
So how dare you speak to me like that?

327
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,270
Here. Take this to save face.

328
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,273
It will help stave off
destitution for you.

329
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,111
Can you even imagine
how much this piece will sell for?

330
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,821
In other words,

331
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,574
I am now worth far too much
to be humoring the likes of you.

332
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,244
You have lost your mind.

333
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,998
You are now merely a piece
that has lost its function and purpose.

334
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,110
It is me! Open the door!

335
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,699
Open the door, quick!

336
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,363
At last I've found you.

337
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,823
This is not the painter.

338
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,671
I miss her.

339
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,133
I just…

340
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,887
I want to see her.

341
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,692
Young master Hongrang.

342
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,113
Are you in, my lord?

343
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,116
Where have you been all day?

344
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,617
You are coming home so late.

345
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,496
Pardon me, my lord.

346
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,499
I thought
you could bid young master Mu-jin

347
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,334
and young mistress Jae-yi farewell

348
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,877
before they leave tomorrow.

349
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,320
So you are sure…

350
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,949
Hongrang…

351
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,703
is an imposter?

352
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,773
I was waiting for you.

353
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,276
To say goodbye?

354
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,029
No, Jae-yi.

355
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,864
Then why?

356
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,407
I deceived you.

357
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,202
I…

358
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,750
I am not your little brother.

359
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,217
I am not Hongrang.

360
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,844
Then who are you?

361
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,055
What are you?

362
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,560
I am no one

363
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,062
of any importance.

364
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,191
It might have been better
if I were normal,

365
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,609
but I never was.

366
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,656
I was born into a nobleman's household
as a lowly and insignificant slave.

367
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,909
For a while,

368
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,203
I was a living talisman

369
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,248
who suffered the pain
on behalf of the young master there.

370
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,875
Then, one day, I just ran away.

371
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,794
I was on my own.

372
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,170
I was living on the run.

373
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,839
I was constantly being pursued.

374
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,092
And then I met him.

375
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,846
You mean the…

376
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,848
The Snow Man.

377
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,184
He took me to a place somewhere.

378
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,270
That is where it all began.

379
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,607
I had to endure things
that I could not make sense of.

380
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,151
I could not understand it.

381
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,655
But when I found out why,

382
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,201
that is when I realized
I could never live a normal life.

383
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,958
I could not tell you.

384
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,919
I was too ashamed.

385
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,505
Even for myself…

386
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,550
I was hideous.

387
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,886
Contemptible.

388
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,682
That is why…

389
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,769
you were the last person I wanted to tell.

390
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,148
Knowing what I was,

391
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,775
knowing I had no right to…

392
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,155
I waited for you here. I had to.

393
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,616
Hoping.

394
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:53,956
Yes.

395
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,126
Sincerely hoping you would come,

396
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,879
despite the fact that I have deceived you

397
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,340
and caused you so much pain.

398
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,219
I have missed you so.

399
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,099
I simply had to see you again.

400
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,025
I love you.

401
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,740
I think it is love I feel for you.

402
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,825
I think so.

403
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,994
If it is not that, then

404
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,038
I could not explain it.

405
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,960
Whatever you are,

406
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,088
it changes nothing.

407
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,551
Even if everything has been a lie
and you have been deceitful.

408
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,969
Even if no one,

409
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,431
not even myself,

410
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,809
offered to forgive me,

411
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,645
I still desperately…

412
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,776
want only you.

413
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,783
That is why I decided to leave.

414
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,126
Do not go.

415
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,838
You cannot.

416
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,507
I won't let you.

417
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,158
There we are!

418
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,578
Hold this here. Oh my goodness.

419
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,205
All right, there.

420
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,666
Pull this rope here.

421
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,003
Goodness!

422
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,506
That looks right. Now rest a bit.

423
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,551
- Oh.
- I think we're all done here.

424
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,886
Where on earth has she gone?

425
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,597
Did you search the garden?
I have no idea where she could be.

426
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,266
Where could she be?

427
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,197
They have taken the horses.

428
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,073
The one that belongs to the mute
is gone too.

429
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,493
They may have realized
something was amiss and escaped.

430
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,869
They cannot be far.

431
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,372
Search every nook and cranny
for them. Hurry!

432
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,665
Yes, my lord.

433
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,211
Jae-yi!

434
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,318
Grandmaster, sir!

435
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:12,988
Hongrang,

436
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,824
he's disappeared as well.
