1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,722
It was the day the young mistress
and the young master held a ritual

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,765
in honor of the memory
of the late Lady Ha.

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,227
You dare make my son bow on the floor?!

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,355
Allow him to bow to this lowly spirit?

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,858
- Huh?!
- Mother!

6
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,910
SIM JAE-YI

7
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,037
Ha!

8
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:15,200
Young master! Oh!

9
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,786
Can you hear me?

10
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,330
Madame Gwigokja, please follow me.

11
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:25,210
Young master,
we can't let them see. Come with me.

12
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,344
<i>I was so afraid that I would be blamed</i>

13
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>that I did not know what to do.</i>

14
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,391
<i>I was surely not in my right mind when</i>
<i>I moved the young master out of sight.</i>

15
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>When I was able</i>
<i>to pull myself together again,</i>

16
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,690
<i>I left to get the others</i>
<i>to come and help me. </i>

17
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,404
Only when I came back
with the other servants,

18
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,740
there was no trace of the young master.

19
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,575
He was not where I had left him.

20
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,412
As if he had simply disappeared
or been snatched away.

21
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,713
Dispose of him.

22
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,813
He is not dead.

23
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,526
Those are not my son's remains.

24
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,738
Even for you,

25
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,282
this trick is truly pathetic.

26
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,200
Did you really believe

27
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,744
that you could push the true heir out
with this nonsense?

28
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,246
Did you truly believe

29
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,956
that a measly skeleton

30
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,584
is enough to ensure
that everything becomes yours?

31
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,544
I ask you to hold a funeral in his honor.

32
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,547
He has left us.

33
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,132
Your son is gone.

34
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,676
I want to send my little brother off
in peace.

35
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,888
Imagine how scary and lonely
it was for Hongrang.

36
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,724
How awful it must have been
for him to be down there all alone,

37
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,350
buried in the mud.

38
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,899
You want me to have a funeral for my son?

39
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,444
Ridiculous!

40
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,405
You can throw those old bones away.

41
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,325
I'll die before I grant your request,
for that is not my son.

42
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,409
Then end your life.

43
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,418
Die soon. You know
death is what you deserve.

44
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,963
Where is my son?

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,424
My real son that you were supposed
to bring back to me!

46
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,718
What have you done with my son?!

47
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,303
Your son is on the table!

48
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,514
Hongrang is dead, and it was your doing!

49
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,766
Do you deny it?

50
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,560
That you are responsible
for his disappearance?

51
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,978
That he is gone because of you?

52
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,148
It was the talisman to ensure my death
that was the cause of this.

53
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,652
Your obsession with being rid of me
is what led you to kill your own son.

54
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,612
You are the one

55
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,490
who ended Hongrang's life.

56
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,449
You did this.

57
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,539
I did not!

58
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,708
This is not my son.

59
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,377
It is not.

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,336
It is not!

61
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,630
He is not gone!

62
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,800
He is not my son!

63
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,637
No!

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,391
No! This is not my son!

65
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,686
HONGRANG'S GRAVE

66
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,838
My apologies

67
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,173
for taking the liberty of using your name.

68
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,717
In return…

69
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,847
I will devote my life
to protecting your dear sister

70
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,390
for all of my days.

71
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,144
I give you my word on this.

72
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,817
Now that I have found him,

73
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,654
my heart will not let me say the words to…

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,364
to let him go.

75
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,701
To send him on his way.

76
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,747
"Farewell"

77
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,165
should suffice.

78
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,880
A farewell is a wish for safe travels.

79
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,343
When it is a longer journey,
it is also a fond goodbye

80
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,179
until we can reunite once more.

81
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,306
A way to say
that we have made good memories

82
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,391
and wish to relive them soon.

83
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,226
I think that

84
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,022
"farewell" is a way
of sending loved ones on their journey

85
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,648
until they can be together again.

86
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,369
Farewell…

87
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,955
my dear Hongrang.

88
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:38,356
DEAR HONGRANG

89
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,614
I must recreate
my living canvas talismans,

90
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,159
even if it means
my body will not withstand the task.

91
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,577
However,

92
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,329
for Hongrang…

93
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,837
annihilate the black-clad swordsmen
who ruined my ritual

94
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,215
and return that ungrateful wretch to me.

95
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,261
Highness, my only wish is to serve you.

96
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,029
The imposter's faithful servant
will say nothing.

97
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,407
Find out where
the assassins are headquartered.

98
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,491
Understood.

99
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,662
While we destroy the swordsmen,
I shall get rid of the Soul Reaper.

100
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,665
The prince ordered
that we bring him back alive.

101
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,751
Yes, my lord.

102
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,251
I can imagine how scary it was.

103
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,128
And painful.

104
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,547
I hated it.

105
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,591
It made me ashamed.

106
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,009
The shame is not yours.

107
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,719
All those who abused you,

108
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,804
the shame is entirely theirs.

109
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,435
Your words are a soothing balm.

110
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,147
But I still bear the scars.

111
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,321
Just as how your hurt

112
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,615
shows here…

113
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,118
and here.

114
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,496
I hope the future

115
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,624
allows us both…

116
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,546
to erase our scars and forget our pain.

117
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,549
It does not have to be forgotten

118
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,092
or erased.

119
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,512
I think it remains a part of us
to be honored,

120
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,515
to be respected, if you are willing.

121
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,693
I am willing.

122
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,948
I am convinced that the grand prince
will in all likelihood

123
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,992
try to blame his wrongdoing on me.

124
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,411
If we are to have any chance
of thwarting His Highness,

125
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,664
we have no choice but to recapture
the imposter before he does.

126
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,333
Yes, my lord.

127
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,243
What are you doing?

128
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,297
You forgot this inside.

129
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,591
Right.

130
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,995
- I want to go get some supplies in town.
- We could use some.

131
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,124
- I will go gather more firewood.
- Hm.

132
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,242
Tell me where your headquarters are.

133
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:28,080
Give me what I am looking for and I will
let you leave here with your life.

134
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,082
Or refuse to answer the question

135
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,085
and you die here on my floor.

136
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,530
I will not try to force you to return.

137
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,241
I am simply here to tell you
why you should come back to me.

138
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,659
You are being absurd.

139
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,827
The one you are with

140
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,413
is not going to be here much longer.

141
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,916
He will leave you alone
without his protection.

142
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,585
He would never do that.

143
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,504
Yes, he will.

144
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,422
Your lover is dying.

145
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,384
I must assume
you have seen the rashes on his skin.

146
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,970
The others used as artwork have died,

147
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,931
or are about to,
which is your father's doing.

148
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,225
For years, he aided the prince
in torturing children,

149
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,269
using toxic materials on their skin
for human canvases.

150
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,523
They bathed them in alum and arsenic,
which are harsh and caustic.

151
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,525
The rash is one of the milder symptoms.

152
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,444
You must have also noticed shortness
of breath due to damage to the lungs,

153
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,905
stiffness or seizures,
and even loss of vision.

154
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,908
You know this yourself.
He was exposed for many years.

155
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,577
Even so, he is strong.

156
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,122
The deterioration has already started.
He <i>is </i>going to die.

157
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,666
Please do not say any more.

158
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,417
He had to know
what the future was holding,

159
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,255
which means his keeping you close was
nothing more than cowardly selfishness.

160
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,881
- Quiet!
- Is the truth too much to bear?

161
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,716
It is the truth you would hope for.

162
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,803
Only I no longer believe a word you say.

163
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,308
I only wanted to give you some time
to make the right decision.

164
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,977
Turn away from him before it is too late.

165
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,815
Even if this is the truth, your hopes
of regaining me in your life are futile.

166
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,901
I belong at his side and nowhere else.

167
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,862
As you wish.

168
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,822
If that is the strength of your bond,

169
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,700
I shall sever it for good.

170
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,589
I have done what you suggest. I went to
physicians and other herbalists as well.

171
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,844
There must be something you can do.
Is there some medicine you have not tried?

172
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,016
If the patient suffers skin rashes
and loss of vision,

173
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,059
it is a sign the disease is most advanced.

174
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,313
There is little to be done but wait
to see if the body can heal itself,

175
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,564
or if it will succumb.

176
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,083
Jae-yi?

177
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,202
Why have we not heard
from Hongrang, sister?

178
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,330
Because I told him to leave
when he delivered the partition deed.

179
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,207
- What?
- He did his part.

180
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,584
Hongrang's mission is accomplished,
is it not?

181
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,755
Kkot-nim! Shield us!

182
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,395
Kkot-nim!

183
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,148
Sim Yeol-guk!

184
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,943
You bastard!

185
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,910
So it was you.

186
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,329
How are you still alive?

187
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,665
The child I was carrying

188
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,335
took all the impact of the sword…

189
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,548
you sent the assassin to wield against us.

190
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,473
Where has he gone?

191
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,183
Where is the imposter hiding?

192
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,060
Leave her!

193
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,357
Brother… brother!

194
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,735
- Brother…
- My lady!

195
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,284
Brother…

196
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,376
We must go!

197
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,339
I cannot leave him.

198
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,551
- Brother, no…
- My lady, I must keep you safe.

199
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,322
What are you doing
in the assassins' stronghold, Father?

200
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,282
Ha.

201
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,992
The Soul Reaper.

202
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,661
You wish to get to him first

203
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,288
in order to protect yourself
against His Royal Highness.

204
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,623
How did you know

205
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,292
that this was the assassins' headquarters?

206
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,547
Ah.

207
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,466
I suppose the question answers itself.

208
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,722
I have been harboring a traitorous thief
all these years.

209
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,685
Or you must have secured the information
for an offer of riches.

210
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,105
He is not here, my lord.

211
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,849
Your brothers have been attacked,
and In-hoe is being held captive?

212
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,812
I must go to him.

213
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,862
Are you well enough
to attempt to rescue him?

214
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,740
Your body is getting… worse.

215
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,326
You were aware?

216
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,746
Why did you not say so?

217
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,623
I wanted to tell you,

218
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:12,211
but I thought it would worsen
the pain and guilt you feel.

219
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,882
This is why I must go now.

220
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,718
Before my condition worsens
and my skills are no longer useful.

221
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,223
If I fail to destroy the prince's forces,

222
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,726
you will have to watch over your shoulder
your entire life as I have.

223
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,896
I cannot protect you if he lives.

224
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,398
Please understand I must do this.

225
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,193
It is the only way we can survive.

226
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,571
I promise I will return to you.

227
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,618
To your side.

228
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,630
Go, then.

229
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,218
You must do this.

230
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,845
But remember that once you return,

231
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,930
it will be us.

232
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,641
Only the two of us, far from those walls.

233
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,313
I wish we could have
fallen in love sooner, Jae-yi.

234
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,275
As do I.

235
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,070
Then all those first days
of meaningless frustration

236
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,365
would count as our cherished memories now.

237
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,911
Once you come home,

238
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,872
you stay by my side

239
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,333
where you belong

240
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,919
for all eternity.

241
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,379
Hm.

242
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,464
However I can…

243
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,843
I will always be there for you.

244
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,094
For all eternity.

245
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,971
For as long as there are stars.

246
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,681
Eternally.

247
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,998
<i>And Mother told me to tell you this,</i>

248
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,083
which should lead you right to the deed.

249
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,002
Stroke the shoulders

250
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,545
of Mong-jun.

251
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,715
As for this man,
do you perhaps recognize him?

252
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,305
<i>Mong-jun was the childhood name</i>
<i>of the previous chief merchant,</i>

253
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,641
<i>who was not only my father,</i>
<i>but also your grandfather.</i>

254
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,923
Hongrang has managed to secure the deed.

255
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,050
My son has guaranteed our reign.

256
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,137
We must only await his return
and all will resume its rightful order.

257
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,891
Let us go.
I want everything ready to greet my son.

258
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,194
My sweet son!

259
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,863
I am not your sweet son.

260
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,827
- Of course you are.
- I am not your son.

261
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,788
- You are not my mother.
- What are you saying?

262
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,456
Who else would be?

263
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,875
The woman you and the chief merchant
tried to destroy.

264
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,461
Kkot-nim, who you left for dead.

265
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,296
She is my mother.

266
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,147
Who would protect her if you died?

267
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,443
Protect her well.

268
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,612
I hope you live on, my lady.

269
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,780
For many years.

270
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,782
To experience what it is like

271
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,286
to be forsaken and pitiful
and know the ache of true loss.

272
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,931
Did I hear you correctly?

273
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,685
Yes, I want to report Chief Merchant Sim
for wrongdoing and unlawful acts.

274
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,772
This report details
his longstanding deceit

275
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,774
and criminal offenses over the years.

276
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,111
As evidence, I have brought ledgers
belonging to the guild

277
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,779
as record of his corrupt practices.

278
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,521
Sim Jae-yi…

279
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,191
Ungrateful demon.

280
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,570
You dare to report me?

281
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,739
Move along!

282
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,699
- Let go!
- Let me go!

283
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:36,910
My lord!

284
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,704
My lord, why are you taking our friends?

285
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,622
Relay this message.

286
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,998
If you wish to have them back,

287
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,751
the Soul Reaper
is to return to His Highness.

288
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,879
- Why are you doing this?
- Let me go!

289
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,214
My lord!

290
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,674
My lord!

291
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,930
Let me go!

292
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,682
- Let me go!
- I said let go!

293
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,434
Let me go, I said! We've done nothing!

294
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,435
Let me go!

295
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,482
Let go!

296
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,694
- Here.
- Wait here.

297
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,825
Highness, your command is executed.

298
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,578
I have brought those who will lure
your precious painting back to you.

299
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,495
Is that so?

300
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,123
Should I take that
as a sign of shallowness

301
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,083
or proof of your idiocy?

302
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,802
My belief was that you were
an excellent judge of value,

303
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,137
knowing what things are worth.

304
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,640
Yet you insult me by offering
such worthless merchandise

305
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:46,980
when something of ultimate value has
fallen conveniently into our hands.

306
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,575
Highness!

307
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,745
You are aware that woman
is merely a demon in disguise?

308
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,414
It is she who caused
my most cherished painting

309
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,875
to forget its purpose
and spiral into chaos.

310
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,501
Therefore, we must end the spell

311
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,338
and all thoughts or reasons
to revolt against us.

312
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,136
You are to stab this vile creature
through the head and heart.

313
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,472
Be done with this evil.

314
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,810
Jae-yi!

315
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,520
- Jae-yi!
- Jae-yi!

316
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,938
Let me go!

317
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,023
Let me go!

318
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,902
- Don't do this. She's not a demon!
- Jae-yi! No!

319
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,074
Young mistress Jae-yi is in danger.

320
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,883
Will this never be done?

321
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,127
Kkot-nim,

322
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,672
it was only after I was told
that you were gone

323
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,551
that I realized it was all
Min Yeon-ui scheming against us.

324
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,431
Kkot-nim, protecting you
was my greatest mission.

325
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,183
I was driven to undertake mad actions

326
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,894
in the attempt to pay
for how I wronged you all those years ago.

327
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,396
It was my curse.

328
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,443
And why I failed to recognize you before.

329
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,778
You have my life in your hands.

330
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,574
It is your privilege to end it
if you so desire.

331
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,784
But will you allow me my vengeance first?

332
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,620
You know that I have
only ever loved one woman,

333
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,123
and that my heart belongs to you.

334
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,897
Commence the process.

335
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,382
Did you really think I would do this?

336
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,634
Did you truly believe

337
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,968
that I would kill

338
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,096
my one and only reason for living?

339
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,552
No! Mu-jin!

340
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,482
Brother!

341
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,486
Jae-yi!

342
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,175
No! You cannot!

343
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,514
It… it is a relief.

344
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,475
Now, at last,

345
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:16,893
my heart is free.

346
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,686
I may go

347
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,438
without the fear

348
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,942
that you would never forgive me
for what I have done.

349
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,610
You cannot die, brother.

350
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:26,861
With that word,

351
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,864
I can be at peace once again.

352
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,532
When you call me that,

353
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,785
I feel such joy.

354
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,453
I've craved nothing more.

355
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,457
I am sorry for wanting and dreaming

356
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,459
beyond that.

357
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,628
I cannot let you die.

358
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,219
The master will survive this.
The Soul Reaper is here.

359
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,887
I hope you will escape safely.

360
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,639
Brother.

361
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,266
- Always.
- Let me help you.

362
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,435
Come with us. You must leave now.

363
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,534
Go! Hurry! This way.

364
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,451
Come.

365
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,038
- What is it?
- There are children in here.

366
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,668
One, two, three, pull!

367
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,797
- Come with us!
- Come now!

368
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,361
In-hoe.

369
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,534
I came too late.

370
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,161
I am sorry, my friend.

371
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,238
Master!

372
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,451
I shall carry you.

373
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,078
Bu-yeong.

374
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:40,995
Yes?

375
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,123
Let us rest a while.

376
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,167
Of course.

377
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,293
My sister

378
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,005
was worried, was she not?

379
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,425
I told her you would survive your injury
and that she need not worry.

380
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,177
You did well.

381
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,222
As always.

382
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,932
Your presence

383
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,935
has always been loyal and true.

384
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,062
Could you serve her

385
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,857
as you have served me all these years?

386
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,526
I would be honored, my lord.

387
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,985
Then my heart is glad.

388
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,741
Thank you.

389
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,035
I will leave you now.

390
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,287
Where will you be going?

391
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,127
<i>Some place far away.</i>

392
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,254
<i>Back to</i>

393
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,506
<i>more glorious days.</i>

394
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,591
<i>That is where</i>

395
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,135
<i>I shall remain</i>

396
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,471
<i>for all eternity.</i>

397
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,900
Young master! Do you hear me?

398
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,611
Mu-jin?

399
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,678
Jae-yi!

400
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,155
Jae-yi!

401
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,666
Take the children to safety.

402
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,211
I will follow you very soon.

403
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,857
Go.

404
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,209
Hurry, children! We're almost there.

405
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,586
Stay together and follow us, quickly!

406
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,850
Not yet. Not yet.

407
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,275
Come, come, come.

408
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,235
This way.

409
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,599
I have longed for your return.

410
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,269
But, child,

411
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,022
why so much anger
in your creator's presence?

412
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,943
Why this persistent hatred in your eyes?

413
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,322
You are no doubt acting
with a blinding ignorance

414
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,365
and willful misunderstanding.

415
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,994
Why did you do

416
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,371
such heinous things

417
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,914
to me and all the others?

418
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,208
My intention to attain

419
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:01,464
a higher existence is not driven
by selfish aspirations or cruel ambition.

420
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,804
My birthright, my destiny,

421
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,890
is to be the people's vessel.

422
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,313
Only when I have transformed to a true god

423
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,942
will the world rise
to its purest ideal of existence.

424
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,948
You are a royal fool,

425
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,202
imbued with his own distorted madness.

426
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,620
A spoiled good-for-nothing

427
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,790
who invented a twisted delusion
to erase his worthlessness.

428
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,003
You tortured innocent children
because of your own sense of inferiority--

429
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,671
How dare you loose your tongue?!

430
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,508
How dare you pretend you are a god?!

431
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,719
How could you be so foolish?

432
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,513
How could you be so arrogant?

433
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,599
You were but useless scrap
before being put into my hands.

434
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:57,228
I was the one who saved you
from the filth into which you were born.

435
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,896
You were nothing more than vermin,

436
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,149
destined to rot like foul-smelling trash,
a lowly rat!

437
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,361
I repurposed you into a glorious being.

438
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,489
Do you not see the honor of being chosen?

439
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,074
Not once

440
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,743
was I ever able to breathe
without feeling pain

441
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,328
or fall asleep without constant fear.

442
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,374
And not once did I truly laugh or cry
to my heart's content.

443
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,293
I often wished to die
and end the suffering.

444
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,338
With the others.

445
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,425
You took our souls while we lived.

446
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,720
I took it all.

447
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,182
I own every one of you.

448
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,185
How could I not capture your spirit?

449
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,148
You will be released soon.

450
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,984
Once I have finished
recreating my paintings.

451
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,035
Try to paint now.

452
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:05,588
Oh… no!

453
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,848
No! My hands!

454
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,919
Even if I were to leave this world…

455
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,256
do you think this would end?

456
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,595
I have etched my royal spirit
onto the canvas that covers you.

457
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,472
The essence of your creator

458
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,225
will live on as you will.

459
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,601
What is more,

460
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:05,606
as long as my masterpieces representing
virtue and infinitude remain alive,

461
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:10,194
a god destined to inherit the great cause
will one day reappear.

462
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,571
I will never cease
to be a ruler in this universe!

463
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,074
My legacy will carry on wherever you are!

464
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:38,556
No. I… will not… allow it…

465
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,075
Loving you changed my life.

466
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,539
After I had completed my mission,
I had planned to end my own life as well.

467
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,668
I thought that this filth
must be torn off or burned away.

468
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,754
I believed I was condemned
by the shame of it.

469
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,298
That I had to die

470
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,801
in the hopes of feeling human again.

471
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,612
Your love changed all of that.

472
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,825
I know I can live with these scars.

473
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,121
Your love made me human.

474
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,084
And has let me become a man.

475
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:10,309
This night seems much longer than usual.

476
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,481
I wonder when morning will come again.

477
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,578
The sunrise will find us.

478
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,539
You might want to rest.

479
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,501
You must be tired, my love.

480
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,268
What if my eyes do not want to open?

481
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,648
I would not want to sleep too long
and keep you waiting.

482
00:46:58,857 --> 00:46:59,858
Do not worry.

483
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,694
You may take a stroll into your dreams,

484
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,988
but if I feel
that you have wandered too far,

485
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:06,824
I will call you…

486
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,869
and you will return to my side.

487
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,496
Jae-yi…

488
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,875
I can no longer see you.

489
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,463
Know that I am with you,

490
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,674
holding you.

491
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,552
The black of night has closed in.

492
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,557
You are all that exists in the world.

493
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,186
Only

494
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,481
your presence feels stronger now.

495
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,651
When something is hidden from us,

496
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,987
it is not necessarily gone.

497
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,533
It is just like how you cannot make out
the stars on rainy nights.

498
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,329
We know they are there
looking down on us, as always.

499
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,539
When I miss the stars,

500
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,625
I will tell myself that I am
simply weathering a long rainy season.

501
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,548
All I will ask of you

502
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,968
is please come back to me.

503
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,470
Be guided back to my side by them

504
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,140
on a clear, lovely night.

505
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,351
I will.

506
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,770
Where?

507
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,481
Where should I go now?

508
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,026
Where your heart calls you.

509
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,278
As I will do also.

510
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,113
Where is that?

511
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,449
Right here at your side.

512
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,035
Here, where you are with me.

513
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,786
Just the two of us.

514
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,414
I am glad.

515
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,377
We are both where we are supposed to be.

516
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,341
We just need to…

517
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,636
be at peace like this.

518
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,971
Like this?

519
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,892
What should we do one day?

520
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,314
There are so many new things
that we have not had time to discover yet.

521
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,235
What should we do first?
Perhaps a boat ride?

522
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,862
Because the weather is beautiful.

523
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,572
Maybe go for a night stroll

524
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,493
on a long stone-walled path
and wish upon the moonrise.

525
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:16,578
Hm?

526
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,372
And I want to swing.

527
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,959
So push me as high as you possibly can.

528
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,503
And…

529
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:44,147
We will make aster leaf rice together.
The leaves are in season.

530
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,900
We will find a place to eat in the forest.

531
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,236
In the evening,
we can lie down on the wooden porch

532
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,612
and talk about everything.

533
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,406
Then…

534
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:30,944
2 YEARS LATER, SPRING

535
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,655
Where is Hongrang?

536
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,950
I want to see my son.

537
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,495
Why is he taking so long to return?

538
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,538
Where has he gone off to again?

539
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,041
He will come to you soon.

540
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,919
Your son is on his way home.

541
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,260
Where is Hongrang?

542
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,678
I wonder

543
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,765
when is that boy going to return?

544
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,684
Soon.

545
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,190
Your son will be coming back to you soon.

546
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,004
You want to try to hold it closer.

547
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,298
Don't squeeze too hard. Look.

548
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,842
Try to catch me!

549
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,103
It's my turn to count!

550
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,355
You have to count
to at least ten this time.

551
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,982
I'm counting now!

552
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:36,444
One, two, three, four…

553
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,529
Hello, little one.

554
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,613
Cheater!

555
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,061
I am right on your sleeve now.

556
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:11,980
Look at this.

557
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,524
Look at this flower and remember

558
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,360
<i>that I am by your side.</i>

559
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,212
<i>Jae-yi.</i>

560
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,799
There you are.

561
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,816
IN MEMORY OF PARK ZI-A
