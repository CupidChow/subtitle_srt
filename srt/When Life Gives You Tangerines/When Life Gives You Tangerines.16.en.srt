WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,568
Can we get more squid soup?

3
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,070
- Sure thing.
- Of course.

4
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,160
Are we reading this or not?

5
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,746
"A village over…"

6
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,206
Welcome!

7
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,415
Welcome!

8
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,003
You have to wait a bit.

9
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,671
- We'll call you soon.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,634
Please wait a moment.

11
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,390
Guys, I told you
the line here is really long.

12
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,560
<i>And at last, the bells began to dance</i>
<i>in the heart of the forest,</i>

13
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,438
<i>along with the sound of card swipes.</i>

14
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,442
I can't retire because of Ae-sun.

15
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,863
<i>The "trash dumpling" scandal is impacting</i>
<i>even handmade dumpling shops.</i>

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,574
<i>The nightmare chicken shops experienced</i>
<i>during the bird flu</i>

17
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,159
<i>is now hitting dumpling shops.</i>

18
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,244
Choi Ji-woo was here.

19
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,662
Let me wrap this for you.

20
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,581
I'll make you an amazing wrap. Here.

21
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,582
Open up.

22
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,877
Stop glaring at customers
asking for more squid soup.

23
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,255
- Let's eat this.
- You should fix what needs fixing.

24
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,465
Your daughter-in-law is a cut above mine.

25
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,510
I don't want it. You have it, Grandpa.

26
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,720
Who will you give it to?

27
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,682
Which grandpa will you give it to?
Which one?

28
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,892
Here. That's right.

29
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,524
You can't ask with your mouth open.

30
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,360
- Can we have some more squid soup?
- Of course!

31
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,529
- More soup here, please.
- For us too.

32
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,905
Yes, of course.

33
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,451
Hey, why are you putting so much squid in?
That's why they eat it by the potful.

34
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,330
Add squid soup to the menu,
or you'll end up with nothing.

35
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,628
We need to hire people.
This is too much work for you.

36
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,631
Who said it was too much for me?

37
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,385
<i>That darn money made my mom dance.</i>

38
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,555
<i>Singing in the rain</i>

39
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,015
<i>Singing in…</i>

40
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,392
Why are you going down
the stairs like that?

41
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,269
Are you past menopause?

42
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,397
I don't know. It's strange.

43
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,734
I'm just so thrilled.
Is this what having money feels like?

44
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,195
We're so busy
from early morning to late night.

45
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,617
But it's not hard to keep going
when the cash register keeps filling up.

46
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,119
Are you happy?

47
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,706
Yes, I'm so happy.

48
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,628
Maybe the heavens were stingy with us
just to bless us all at once.

49
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,255
Deliveries during the World Cup.

50
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,924
Domestic duty-free stores in Jeju.

51
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,426
They also filmed <i>All In </i>in Jeju.

52
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,305
Joonggonara helped us catch Cheol-yong.

53
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,017
An actress endorsed our restaurant.
How did all this happen?

54
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:51,231
It feels like we're suddenly raking in
a huge bonus right now.

55
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,776
Honey, you know what?
I think we should go on trips.

56
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,237
Let's go to Guam and China.

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,281
That damn Mi-suk gets to go,
so why can't I?

58
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,203
Why do you always say, "That damn Mi-suk"?

59
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:12,377
If every day were like this,
I'd want to live for thousands of years.

60
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,217
<i>Singing in the rain</i>

61
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,762

00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:47,203
THE ORIGINAL SQUID RESTAURANT

65
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,247
That damn Mi-suk.

66
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,000
How dare she call her place
"the original"?

67
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,169
Did you take over all the squid in Jeju?

68
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,671
Do you have a patent for it?

69
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,843
Then do you have a patent
for riding on someone else's success?

70
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,638
No, wait. Maybe a patent
for getting a foot massage?

71
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,099
I told you

72
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,102
I had cramps in my toes!

73
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,520
Change your sign.

74
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,105
Change your menu!

75
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,649
Let her be.

76
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,609
I'm actually thankful.

77
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,237
It's better she competes with us
for the same thing.

78
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,577
Yeah? Why's that?

79
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:32,457
The real deal always sells better
when it's next to a knockoff.

80
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,964
Sir, can we get more squid soup?

81
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,965
Yes, of course.

82
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,843

00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,557
<i>even Mom would always lose to.</i>

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,267
Hey, daughter.

87
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,103
I told you I wanted to eat it myself!

88
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,314
Me! Me! I wanted to.

89
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,566
I wanted to!

90
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,860
<i>And I had someone like that too.</i>

91
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,903
Mom!

92
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,322
I wanted to do it!

93
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,909
<i>Even a terrible 37-year-old</i>
<i>needed a mother.</i>

94
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,582
Oh dear. Come on.

95
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,835
I know she's in her terrible fours,
but how can she do this?

96
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,046
All I did was feed her.

97
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,049
I fed her when she wanted to feed herself.

98
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,055
Say "bye-bye" to Mommy.

99
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,682
Bye-bye, I'll be back soon!

100
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,519
<i>I only had eyes for my child,</i>
<i>and Mom only had eyes for me.</i>

101
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,604
She's gotten thinner.

102
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,522
I'll be back.

103
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,818
She's such a sly girl, acting all shy.

104
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,445
<i>I knew a thousand</i>
<i>of my daughter's expressions,</i>

105
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,698
<i>but I could picture hardly any</i>
<i>of my mom's expressions.</i>

106
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,077
<i>I had no idea back then</i>

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,622
<i>that I'd one day remember my mom</i>

108
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,918
<i>only through photos of her</i>
<i>with awkward expressions.</i>

109
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,593
Dear me, you stubborn child.

110
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,763
Why don't you listen to your mom?

111
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,017
Even though you're my grandchild,

112
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,856
I get a bit upset
if you wear my daughter out too much.

113
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,153
The person you take most for granted
in the world

114
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,239
is the person

115
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,285
who's the most precious to me.

116
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,918
Please go easy on my daughter.

117
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,466
Please look after my daughter
for a long time.

118
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:47,884
Okay?

119
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:56,142
<i>Sleep, sleep, rock to sleep</i>

120
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,563
<i>My baby sleeps well…</i>

121
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,398
<i>For some reason…</i>

122
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,608
Seriously?

123
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,776
<i>…saying "thank you" felt so awkward.</i>

124
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,820
Who asked you to clean the place?

125
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,530
And why did you clean the bathroom?

126
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,824
Go back to sleep.
You said it was your day off.

127
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,328
Mom, this is exactly why
I don't want to call you over.

128
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,580
Hey, Terrible Thirty-sevens,

129
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,790
just say thank you.

130
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,585
I can tell how you feel
just by looking at your eyebrows.

131
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,254
So just put her down.

132
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,091
You said you're getting cupping
on your back.

133
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
I swear,

134
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,599
Sae-bom is the first thing in my life

135
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,185
that's ever made things not go my way.

136
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,854
How can she be so stubborn?

137
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,856
She never says "yes" the first time.

138
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,068
Serves you right.

139
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,195
You have a daughter just like you.

140
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,492
Honestly, you were annoyed too, right?

141
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,411
How did you raise three kids?

142
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,999
You should always take the drumsticks
and do whatever you want in life.

143
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,086
You need to live your life
so you don't grow resentful.

144
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,798
If you keep doubting whether it's worth it
and wondering if this is right,

145
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,258
even your kid can tell.

146
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,219
She can tell just by looking at your face.

147
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,181
You're Sae-bom's whole universe right now.

148
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,270
But

149
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,773
that won't last long.

150
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,526
One day,

151
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:33,197
you'll be a background figure
in your child's life anyway.

152
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,952
So you just do more
of what you want to do.

153
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,748
Mom, do you have regrets?

154
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,043
You couldn't do everything you wanted.

155
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,838
I did everything because I wanted to.

156
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,844
Oh Ae-sun the lonely orphan,
Oh Ae-sun the maid,

157
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,721
and Oh Ae-sun the high school dropout.

158
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,141
The most wonderful title I've ever held

159
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,561
is being Geum-myeong
and Eun-myeong's mother.

160
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,398
I've lived an extraordinary life
in my own way.

161
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,775
Don't pity the life that I've lived.

162
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,946
You know,

163
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,866
maybe I lack maternal instinct.

164
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,868
Sometimes, I get so angry…

165
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,830
and I end up yelling at the kid.

166
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,915
I think I'm losing it.

167
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,168
Who becomes a mother overnight?

168
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,671
Your child will grow, and so will you.

169
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,008
Sae-bom.

170
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,011
Will you chew your food 100 times again
tomorrow morning?

171
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,055
Will you change your clothes ten times?

172
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,725
Why do you give me
such a hard time every morning?

173
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,769
Why?

174
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,815
If I eat early, you leave earlier.

175
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,819
Once I finish my food and get dressed,

176
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,946
you go to work.

177
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,910
Is that why you've been doing that?
You didn't want me to go?

178
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,418
I'm sorry I yelled at you
the other day, okay?

179
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,795
I'm so sorry.

180
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,588
Come here.

181
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,466
Oh dear.

182
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,552
Mommy loves you, Sae-bom.

183
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,013
I love you so much, okay?

184
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,682
Kisses.

185
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,768
<i>A mother's daughter</i>
<i>was growing into a mother herself.</i>

186
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:32,024
<i>Mom hoped her daughter's time</i>
<i>with her own child wouldn't be too tough.</i>

187
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,444
GEUM-MYEONG: GINGER TEA
SAE-BOM: CHOPPED VEGGIES

188
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,737
CHUNG-SEOP: BLACK GARLIC

189
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,073
<i>Throughout her life,</i>

190
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,951
<i>Mom always cut her own time</i>
<i>to quilt mine together.</i>

191
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,792
- Honey.
- What is it?

192
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,045
You know the money we saved
to buy Sae-bom a piano?

193
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,173
Can we spend it on my mom and dad?

194
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,802
I just have this feeling

195
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,847
that I'll regret it if I don't do it now.

196
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,142
Honey.

197
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,685
Yeah?

198
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,978
Why are you asking me?

199
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,521
You're the one

200
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,982
who gets to make the decisions.

201
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,114
What now?
Should I take off my socks again?

202
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,249
<i>Patient 109, please proceed to window two.</i>

203
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,459
So how much is it?

204
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,045
Checkups are pricier in Seoul, right?

205
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,216
I need to pay like this
so you guys stop putting it off.

206
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,803
Parents need to treat their children
with respect too.

207
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,680
Do it by staying healthy, okay?

208
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,098
Just the blood test for me.

209
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,560
Dad, your knee pain is chronic.

210
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,146
Mom, cupping doesn't cure everything.

211
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,900
- So how much is it for both of us?
- I'll just take the blood test.

212
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,909
Hey, Yong-geon!

213
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,744
I'm in Seoul.

214
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,079
No, I can't go.

215
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,375
Now that we're better off…

216
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,460
Yes, that's right.

217
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,087
…he's learning the guitar.
Acoustic guitar.

218
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,132
Dad? A guitar?

219
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,927
Yeah. Just move on with the lesson
without me.

220
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,471
Others had time to enjoy playing guitar,

221
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,890
but your dad
never got to try it even once.

222
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,934
Kim Kwang-seok is his idol.

223
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,477
Come on.

224
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,481
He has a hobby
for the first time in his life.

225
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,025
PRECAUTIONS FOR ENDOSCOPY

226
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,244
I told you we should've removed
your age spots.

227
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,372
When did you get so old?

228
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,000
No, what I'm saying is…

229
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,630
I don't want to go.

230
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,759
What is it?

231
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,887
Does someone keep asking you to come?

232
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,139
The thing is…

233
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,354
I can't go to build the retaining wall.

234
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,903
I shouldn't go
to build the retaining wall.

235
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,286
Dong-myeong…

236
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,081
I shouldn't…

237
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,793
Dong-myeong…

238
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,839
Dong-myeong.

239
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,301
Dong-myeong.

240
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,388
Dad is…

241
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,308
Dong-myeong.

242
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,518
Dong-myeong.

243
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,021
<i>For a long time, Dad kept calling out…</i>

244
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,480
Dong-myeong!

245
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,153
<i>…the name he couldn't bring himself</i>
<i>to say before.</i>

246
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,198
Dong-myeong.

247
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,788
Dong-myeong.

248
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,082
<i>That day, Mom saw…</i>

249
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,417
Dong-myeong.

250
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,378
<i>…where Dad was imprisoned</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

251
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,926
<i>Retaining wall?</i>

252
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,344
ENDOSCOPY CENTER

253
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,348
"I shouldn't have gone
to build the retaining wall."

254
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,850
"I shouldn't have gone."

255
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,687
That's what he said.

256
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,817
Your dad also kept repeating
Dong-myeong's name.

257
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,570
That's when I finally realized

258
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:51,575
why we were never able to speak
about Dong-myeong.

259
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,330
Well,

260
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,958
I asked when I was going under,

261
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,293
but they said I could go
'cause it was done.

262
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,881
Dad, aren't you hungry?
I'll get you whatever you want.

263
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,300
- Pork belly?
- Pork belly?

264
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,343
Yeah.

265
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,053
<i>Within their hearts…</i>

266
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,475
<i>lay a grave,</i>

267
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,229
<i>tiny yet enormous.</i>

268
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,285
Vroom.

269
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,996
Honk.

270
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,132
You're unbelievable.

271
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,218
Have you been coming here
to do that all this time?

272
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,517
You thought I'd come tomorrow,
so you came today?

273
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
Tomorrow is the day.

274
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,523
I had a feeling you'd come today,
so I followed you.

275
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,279
I'm sure Dong-myeong wants to see
both his parents on his birthday.

276
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,949
It's different.

277
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:20,330
Families all gather together
and visit where the parents are buried,

278
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,375
but where the child rests…

279
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,213
I couldn't look you

280
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,382
in the face.

281
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,815
How can our baby stay on his own?

282
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,699
Oh no.

283
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,537
Our baby must be scared again.

284
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,708
Our baby must be scared.

285
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,798
<i>Their footsteps created a smooth path,</i>

286
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,550
<i>and through all four seasons,</i>

287
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,763
<i>the grave where their child lay</i>
<i>remained the neatest of all.</i>

288
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,166
<i>Where Dong-myeong lay,</i>

289
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:51,171
<i>cuter yet more heartbreaking things</i>
<i>were placed.</i>

290
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,548
GRADE 1
YANG DONG-MYEONG

291
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,858
Let's go.

292
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,739
Let's go home.

293
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,075
Back home.

294
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:31,545
<i>I finally understand now</i>
<i>why we could never bring up</i>

295
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,381
<i>Dong-myeong.</i>

296
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:46,268
When guilt outweighs longing,
it can never become a cherished memory.

297
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,441
<i>He was the youngest,</i>
<i>and we absolutely adored him.</i>

298
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,819
<i>He was simply an angel.</i>

299
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,036
<i>At least we got to hold an angel</i>
<i>for four years.</i>

300
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,041
<i>If I had to do it all over again, I would.</i>

301
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,711
<i>We can see him again when we get up there.</i>

302
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,341
The day we will see him again
is getting closer.

303
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,097
I don't want to.

304
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,476
I'd rather Dong-myeong didn't
come see me when I die.

305
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,144
I prayed every day

306
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,774
for Dong-myeong
to forget about us completely.

307
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,151
Just like how I miss him,

308
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,569
if he's alone

309
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,906
missing us, it'd be…

310
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,496
I was worried whether he could bear it…
if he could bear missing us.

311
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,596
When do I get to see that?

312
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,019
What's the title of today's poem?

313
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,902
"The Most Adorable Uncle."

314
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,570
Uncle Dong-myeong.

315
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,158
When I told the kids,
"This is Uncle Dong-myeong,"

316
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,327
it felt so strange.

317
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,621
It felt strange, but…

318
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,416
I was happy.

319
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,169
Maybe Dong-myeong would feel less lonely.

320
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,130
You know, it's strange,

321
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,259
but I feel like
I've become less of a bad mom.

322
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:49,016
Listen now. By nature,
how can you be a bad person?

323
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,977
Dogs have dogs, and cows have cows, right?

324
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,894
Hello?

325
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,979
What about an angel?

326
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:54,896
Yeah, what is it?

327
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,316
- You said Dong-myeong was an angel.
- Hold on.

328
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,734
Every night when you sleep,

329
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,778
I put in so much effort
to keep your back in check.

330
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,948
I've been busy trying to push
the wings back into your back,

331
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,950
so I couldn't even sleep.

332
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,913
Father, Yang Star wants to talk to you.

333
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,459
Not Mom? Me? She wants to talk to me?

334
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,461
Wake up the kids. Let's go home.

335
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,925
Hey, Yang Star.

336
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,219
Is she going to be in the papers again?

337
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,305
Mom? She's right here.

338
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,724
I thought you wanted to talk to me.

339
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,642
Yeah.

340
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,561
She wants to talk to me, right?

341
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,398
Right.

342
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,154
What is it?

343
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,572
Yeah.

344
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,950
<i>Just as things were starting to look up,</i>

345
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,827
<i>just as the struggles got brushed away</i>…

346
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,579
Really?

347
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,915
What? What is it?

348
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,168
<i>…it felt like the heavens were paying off</i>
<i>overdue wages all at once,</i>

349
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,046
<i>and as they did, they made a sound.</i>

350
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,716
<i>"Sorry. So sorry."</i>

351
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,511
They just want to do another checkup.

352
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,388
It's probably nothing.

353
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,891
Even if it is something,
everything is treatable these days.

354
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,768
- Mr. Yang Gwan-sik.
- Yes.

355
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,728
Please wait by the blood test room.

356
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:22,901
What kind of curveball is this?
How could Steelheart do this to me?

357
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,530
Dad.

358
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,615
Don't worry.

359
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,158
Don't be scared.

360
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,370
I'm right here. I'll be right here, okay?

361
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,665
I'm not worried at all.

362
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,167
Wouldn't I know my own body?

363
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,796
<i>We didn't know</i>

364
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:49,261
<i>just how fragile</i>
<i>the Steelheart really was.</i>

365
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,894
- Mom.
- Yeah.

366
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,398
Don't cry, no matter what the doctor says.

367
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,277
Your dad isn't. He's not.

368
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,530
There's no one in the world
as good as your dad.

369
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,824
Mom. Mom?

370
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,659
- Yes?
- Don't you trust me?

371
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,330
Even if he is sick,
I'm just going to fix him.

372
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,040
Yeah, I trust you.

373
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,168
I do.

374
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,919
So don't cry in front of Dad.

375
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,007
Dad is a bit shocked too.

376
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,388
You've had rheumatoid arthritis
for a long time.

377
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,891
You've endured the pain for far too long.

378
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,060
Symptoms of multiple myeloma

379
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,646
are sometimes mistaken
for rheumatoid arthritis,

380
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,107
leading to delays in diagnosis.

381
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,487
Multiple myeloma
is a type of blood cancer.

382
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,448
You can think of it
as a distant relative of leukemia.

383
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,743
<i>Dad barely knew a single popular song,</i>

384
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,788
<i>and he always asked, "Is that Sung Yu-ri?"</i>
<i>when he saw a girl group.</i>

385
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,290
<i>It was frustrating.</i>

386
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,211
<i>Dad just wanted to talk to his daughter.</i>

387
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,631
<i>He, too, was a person</i>
<i>who wanted to play the guitar.</i>

388
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,967
<i>But I didn't know, or I pretended not to.</i>

389
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,763
People who endure well only visit
after their illness has worsened.

390
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:19,351
It had already advanced to kidney failure.
Weren't you aware?

391
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,645
You must have been very tired.

392
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,230
So…

393
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,025
what will happen now?

394
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,111
In the current state,

395
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,824
without immediate treatment,
it could be dangerous.

396
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,536
That's how it is now.

397
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,626
<i>The heavens were so harsh to my dad,</i>

398
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,463
<i>who had only just begun to like</i>
<i>Kim Kwang-seok.</i>

399
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,509
Yes.

400
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,595
You don't need to pick us up.

401
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,599
Geum-myeong. We're not doing this
for just a day or two.

402
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,353
Don't do that.
You'll just wear yourself out.

403
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:23,957
Here.

404
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,713
Don't you worry.

405
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,174
I'm going to make sure you recover.

406
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,802
Then all will be fine.

407
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,014
Let's go.

408
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,658
<i>The 24 sessions of chemotherapy</i>
<i>melted even Steelheart.</i>

409
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,162
<i>Mom forgot what season it was.</i>

410
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,790
Hey, Flower-sun. Look at these flowers.

411
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,754
Things like this inspire poems.

412
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,134
Have you been writing your poems?
When do I get to see them?

413
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,722
You love flowers so much,
yet you're only looking at my feet.

414
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,933
You'll be in big trouble
if I let you fall.

415
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,646
Take a look. Let's look at them together.

416
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,041
Next year, let's go to Zhangjiajie
to see the fall leaves.

417
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,961
The damn Mi-suk went there.
She couldn't stop bragging.

418
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,468
Why hold my hand so tightly?
Are you afraid someone might take me away?

419
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:04,140
If you're not by my side, I have no one.
You know that, right?

420
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,934
Of course you do. You have our kids.

421
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,102
I don't.

422
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,146
They both have their own families now.

423
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,733
My precious burden.

424
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,236
Ae-sun, my burden.

425
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:21,783
As kids, just thinking about how you had
no croakers at your uncle's house

426
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,744
made me so mad I couldn't sleep.

427
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,163
Ever since then,

428
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,710
I've had this burden stuck in my heart.

429
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,507
So make sure to overcome this.

430
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,969
A single mother
is also a burden to her kids.

431
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,264
Don't let me grow old feeling all alone.

432
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,351
Of course. I can't leave you behind.

433
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,567
I wouldn't dare leave
my dear Ae-sun behind all alone.

434
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:00,280
<i>Dad's time passed like cherry blossoms.</i>

435
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,371
That was tough, wasn't it?
Didn't it make you feel nauseous?

436
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,040
Not really. It didn't really hurt.

437
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,460
Of course it was painful.

438
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,086
How can it not hurt?

439
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,921
Mr. Yang Gwan-sik.

440
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,839
Yes.

441
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,509
Drink this. Drink it, all right?

442
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,970
- Mr. Seo Ji-won.
- Yes.

443
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,390
Did you get the blood test done?

444
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:32,103
No. They told me downstairs
to come up here first, so--

445
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,355
The procedures are all written here.

446
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,232
Oh my.

447
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,151
- Please go.
- Sorry?

448
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,403
- Go outside.
- Well, this…

449
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,239
You can't just walk in.
You have to place those out here.

450
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,366
Right, I didn't see that.

451
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,118
It's written right here.

452
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,329
PLEASE PUT YOUR APPOINTMENT PAPERS
IN THE TRAY AND WAIT

453
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,790
Ms. Park Gyeong-ja. Please come in.

454
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,008
So it's okay for him to eat meat?

455
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,678
Someone said meat wouldn't be good
for him to eat.

456
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,096
Eating well is good for him.

457
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,432
I'll see you next month.

458
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,977
Well, sir, is it okay for him
to get moxibustion?

459
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,980
I hear moxibustion would be good for him.

460
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,567
Are you going to ask
about everything you found online?

461
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,699
<i>- Patient 832.</i>
- Next, please.

462
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:32,121
Is this not it? I have number 832 here.

463
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,501
You can't bring the reception ticket
to the payment counter.

464
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,629
I see. So this number is--

465
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,130
It's written over there.

466
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,215
Well, this is…

467
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,803
<i>Please proceed to window seven.</i>

468
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,930
Isn't 835 here anymore?

469
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,934
Do it.

470
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,143
Just do for her!

471
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,729
There are so many working here,

472
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,024
so why can't you just do it
for those who've misunderstood?

473
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,484
What's wrong?

474
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,363
And what's with the sighing?
Why did you sigh in someone's face?

475
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,991
- Honey.
- Nobody knows at first.

476
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,410
Why did you scold her
and make her feel small?

477
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,412
You think you're all so great?

478
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,289
You come up with things only you know

479
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,916
and treat others like fools
if they don't understand.

480
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,544
She's smart too.
She's even smarter than you!

481
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,379
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Hey, Geum-myeong.

482
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,299
And why are you busy?
What's keeping you so busy?

483
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:29,345
Always come with us to the hospital.
That's a rule now. Got it?

484
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,516
It's because Dad is sick.

485
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,102
Being in pain makes you tetchy.

486
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,940
I mean, just a migraine
is bad enough to set you off, so…

487
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,319
He wasn't mad at you. You do know that?

488
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,866
You think Dad's absolutely
on my side, don't you?

489
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,868
He's not.

490
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,161
If you and I fight,

491
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,788
Dad will always take your side.

492
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,376
I may be his number one,
but you're his number zero.

493
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,797
To Dad, you're like the One Ring
from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

494
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,633
Mess with you, and they're dead meat.

495
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:14,223
<i>Patient 848,</i>
<i>please proceed to window four.</i>

496
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,896
<i>Dad could see Mom.</i>

497
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,486
<i>He could see her sitting here alone</i>

498
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,113
<i>in the distant future.</i>

499
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:38,915
Cancel it.

500
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,876
Go with a four-person room tomorrow.

501
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,130
I didn't get this room for you.
It's to make Mom feel more comfortable.

502
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,840
All right?

503
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,553
I could never have gotten you
a private room.

504
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,640
I hit the jackpot
by having a daughter like you.

505
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,059
Then get well soon and pay me back.

506
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:03,064
Watch Sae-bom for me,
and keep your son-in-law disciplined.

507
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,276
He's still good to you, right?

508
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,321
He's head over heels for me.

509
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,999
I'll come with him tomorrow,
help wash your hair--

510
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,333
Are you leaving?

511
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:27,255
You don't want me to go?
You always rush me to leave, so what's up?

512
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,883
Sleep here tonight. It's a private room.

513
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,059
Private rooms come
with a pillow for the family too.

514
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,310
It's so nice.

515
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,355
So, how much is this place?

516
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,524
Honey, go to Geum-myeong's and wash up.

517
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,943
She will stay here tonight.

518
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,160
That's insane.
Lack of mental and financial competence?

519
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,495
So they took away Mom's class presidency?

520
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,956
- That homeroom teacher was crazy.
- Son of a bitch.

521
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,624
Son of a bitch.

522
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,751
Unbelievable.

523
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,050
So Mom headbutted that woman?

524
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,430
She totally broke
the innkeeper's nose with her head.

525
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,102
So you saw Mom there?

526
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,731
You saw her lying by Dong-myeong's grave?

527
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,691
I did.

528
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,863
I secretly followed her,
worried she might jump into the sea.

529
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,449
How did she carry on?

530
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,909
Back then,

531
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,703
your mom was only 28.

532
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,831
Twenty-eight.

533
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,544
When I asked her to marry me,

534
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,422
I promised I'd either make her a poet,

535
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,884
send her to college,
or send her to the mainland.

536
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,097
I thought
I wouldn't even get to fulfill one.

537
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,391
But your mom's been writing these days.

538
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,728
Just seeing that makes me so happy.

539
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:10,817
Your mom once won the writing contest.

540
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,112
She was the top of her high school.

541
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,740
That's how amazing your mom is.

542
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,911
She's so precious beyond words.

543
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,834
Be good to her.

544
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,794
Please take care of her, okay?

545
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,965
Dad, you're so annoying.

546
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,926
You told me to stay
so you could tell me this.

547
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,265
I feel sorry for my daughter
right until the end.

548
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,392
I'm even leaving my wife in your care.

549
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,271
Where do you think you're going?

550
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,897
I don't want it.

551
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,692
I'm not done growing yet.

552
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,777
Raise me more before you leave.

553
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,321
Why are you in a rush to leave us?

554
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,408
Geum-myeong,

555
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,245
you made me feel like I caught a whale

556
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,039
in a tiny boat.

557
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,293
You were the first
to learn the times tables.

558
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,962
Then you went
to Seoul National University.

559
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,006
Goodness.

560
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,842
I was overwhelmed, yet sorry.

561
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,720
I was sorry to you every day.

562
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,599
I'm sorry to my daughter,

563
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,309
but when I think of your mom,

564
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,478
I'm so sorry, it kills me.

565
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,232
I can't sleep.

566
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,651
I can't sleep.

567
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,530
Then stay by Mom's side longer.

568
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,866
Just stay a little longer.

569
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,327
Geum-myeong.

570
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,538
Of course I want to.

571
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,459
I really do want to.

572
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,214
To me…

573
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,092
your mom means the world.

574
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,556
Don't treat her like a nuisance.
Don't get frustrated.

575
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,226
Don't get annoyed with her.

576
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,770
Be sweet to her.

577
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,442
Be sweet to her.

578
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,073
How am I…

579
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,372
How am I supposed to say goodbye to you?

580
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,299
Dad.

581
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,802
Dad, I'm sorry.

582
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,470
I'm so sorry.

583
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,890
I'm sorry for being annoyed at you.

584
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,104
I… I'm sorry for always rushing
to hang up our phone calls.

585
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,273
But

586
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,986
I didn't do it
because I was actually annoyed.

587
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,615
It was really never that, Dad.

588
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,579
I know.

589
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,165
Of course I know.

590
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,918
My daughter is the best.

591
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,550
<i>I had a loving dad.</i>

592
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,762
So is Dad coming or not?

593
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,766
<i>But my dad didn't have a loving daughter.</i>

594
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,769
"A dragon from the stream."

595
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,564
Why do I dislike hearing that?

596
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,693
Who benefits if a dragon rises
from the stream?

597
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,362
The pillar, the older sister,
the eldest child. I'm sick of it all!

598
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,780
Yang Geum-myeong!

599
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,035
<i>His loving request</i>
<i>for me to be sweet to my mom</i>

600
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,038
<i>still stings in my heart.</i>

601
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,541
You want me to live like you?
Is that what you want?

602
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,877
<i>I did it so I wouldn't live like you.</i>

603
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,671
I hate the idea
of living within your means.

604
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,758
You always reeked of cooling patches,
but what did you do for me?

605
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,427
<i>We took Dad for granted,</i>

606
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,972
<i>as though we owned him forever.</i>

607
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,808
Can he stay home?

608
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,187
That's what he really wants.

609
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,773
He says he wants to stay home,
even if just for a while.

610
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,025
He wants to see the sea.

611
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,277
If he stays home,

612
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,197
he will get better.

613
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,419
Father.

614
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,506
You pedal sitting down,
so your back will be fine.

615
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,301
I guess you can sit in this chair
and listen to Kim Kwang-seok.

616
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,971
I searched all over the Internet
to find this LP, and…

617
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,056
Your guitar…

618
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,437
Dad, what…

619
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,856
Why…

620
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,734
Why did you get so thin?

621
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,362
Dad.

622
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,782
Dad, why?

623
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,617
Come on.

624
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,994
You're a dad. Don't embarrass yourself.

625
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,289
Dad, what's wrong?

626
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,085
I asked you to watch me.

627
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,171
I told you I'd buy you a Mercedes.

628
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,340
I told you I'd buy you your boat!

629
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,845
I've watched you.
Dad has watched you all along.

630
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,057
You've been a good son.

631
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,186
I already know.

632
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,814
I always knew, but I…

633
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,275
I…

634
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,488
Your brother passed away
three days after your birthday.

635
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,323
Just accept living without a birthday.

636
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,034
But that's not fair!

637
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,454
I don't want to!

638
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,999
I don't want to!

639
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,711
Eun-myeong, come out here.

640
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,180
Eun-myeong, choose one.

641
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,058
We can have homemade rice cakes
or go out for <i>tangsuyuk </i>on your birthday.

642
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,768
You can't do both. Just pick one.

643
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,354
A robot toy and <i>tangsuyuk.</i>

644
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,068
So should I keep buying them
for you in secret or not?

645
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:28,986
You should.

646
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,364
Just be sure to keep it a secret.

647
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,951
You're gonna tell your sister, aren't you?

648
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,454
You blabbermouth.

649
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,709
I think you like me more than Geum-myeong.

650
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,005
Have these too.

651
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,465
<i>You only bought them for me.</i>

652
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,675
You gave them to me in secret.

653
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,220
I knew all along.

654
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,183
I just chose to remember
only what I wanted.

655
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,643
You blabbermouth.

656
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,437
There you go spilling everything again.

657
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,106
I'm a son of a bitch.

658
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,028
Now you're insulting me like that?

659
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,661
The aunties harvested these.

660
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,579
That damn sea.

661
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,708
It must be upset that you are unwell,
so it gave even more.

662
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,713
<i>The sea gives endlessly,</i>
<i>even if we harvest from it all our life.</i>

663
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,008
Mom, your son's here.

664
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,135
Wash up quickly.

665
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,263
Wash up and eat.

666
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,852
<i>To us, Dad was the sea.</i>

667
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,608
<i>We all relied on him to live.</i>

668
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,532
<i>This tiny person</i>

669
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:02,121
<i>bought me a cup of cherry cola</i>
<i>and asked me to sign a contract with her.</i>

670
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,832
<i>She said she'd make me</i>
<i>a celebrity lecturer.</i>

671
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,459
<i>Honestly, I found it ridiculous,</i>

672
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:13,173
<i>but after seeing the company's name,</i>
<i>I decided to give it a chance.</i>

673
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,719
<i>The next speaker I'll introduce is someone</i>

674
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,930
<i>who is changing the game in the world.</i>

675
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,475
<i>Here's Yang Geum-myeong,</i>
<i>the CEO of Ever Study.</i>

676
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,438
TODAY'S NOTABLE LECTURER
YANG GEUM-MYEONG, CEO

677
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,231
My goodness.

678
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,317
Look, it's Geum-myeong.

679
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,194
<i>We had to repay our debt.</i>

680
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,698
<i>We lit up his path to the stars</i>
<i>with a fanfare.</i>

681
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,826
Hello, my name is Yang Geum-myeong.

682
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,329
When I was studying in Japan,

683
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,458
I used this to record lectures
and listen to them over and over again.

684
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,755
<i>As I couldn't speak the language,</i>
<i>this was all I had to rely on.</i>

685
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:59,261
<i>I thought, "Wouldn't it be great</i>
<i>to carry the teacher in my hand?"</i>

686
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,765
One day, I went back to my hometown
and looked at the bookcase.

687
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,934
Then something hit me
like a ton of bricks.

688
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,481
There was my mom's

689
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,485
very old college entrance workbook.

690
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,696
Is she talking about me?

691
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:22,076
<i>My mother was truly an amazing person.</i>

692
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,287
<i>She was smart and diligent,</i>

693
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,039
<i>and she really wanted</i>

694
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,083
to pursue her studies.

695
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:34,088
If my mom had access to classes
in her hand back then,

696
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,215
she would've studied
to her heart's content.

697
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,759
She would've soared so high.

698
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,846
Even without living in an education hub
or getting expensive tutoring,

699
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,518
a literary girl on an island
should be able to study if she wants to.

700
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,020
I believe anyone,

701
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,774
whoever they may be,
whenever and wherever it may be,

702
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:58,112
should have the opportunity to study
if they truly want to.

703
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,406
And that's how

704
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,658
Ever Study

705
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,954
began from my mother's dream.

706
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,253
I can't believe it.

707
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,463
What is she doing?

708
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,800
She's even good at selling stories.

709
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:27,683
<i>Just in time, the number of high-speed</i>
<i>Internet users surpassed 10 million</i>

710
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,643
and PMP devices came out too.

711
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,813
Video calls even reunited
families divided by the Korean War.

712
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,734
I was certain
the era of online lectures would arrive.

713
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:41,447
I pressed on with the relentless diligence
I inherited from my father.

714
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,073
She mentioned me too.

715
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,993
<i>There were things</i>

716
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,871
<i>we had to show our dad at all costs.</i>

717
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,124
<i>To honor the history and resilience</i>
<i>of Jeju's </i>haenyeo,

718
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,752
<i>the Haenyeo Museum</i>
<i>officially opened today.</i>

719
00:45:55,544 --> 00:46:02,509
<i>Opening a museum dedicated to the history</i>
<i>and resilience of Jeju's </i>haenyeo

720
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,471
<i>will allow us to showcase </i>haenyeo
<i>to the world.</i>

721
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,974
<i>To be included</i>
<i>in the list of World Heritage sites,</i>

722
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,978
<i>we want to show we're alive,</i>
<i>our culture is also alive, and…</i>

723
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,147
<i>Alive!</i>

724
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,815
<i>Yes, we are alive.</i>

725
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,401
<i>We are alive!</i>

726
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,781
<i>With the resilient pioneering spirit</i>
<i>of Jeju's </i>haenyeo…

727
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,742
Are you serious?
You think you'll be a good son like this?

728
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,828
How can you take money from my wallet
to buy A-reum a headband?

729
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,247
It's Jeong A-ram, not A-reum.

730
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,543
Honey, did you give him these highlights?

731
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,213
- Open up.
- Just look at him.

732
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,176
You go to school with this hair
to date A-reum, don't you?

733
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,302
I know everything.

734
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,721
Your dad knows it all.
He's a total expert.

735
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,600
But why does it seem like
my father keeps laughing?

736
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,478
I feel like you smile
every time I squabble with my kid.

737
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,897
We're switching sides in life, right?

738
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,900
You always reap what you sow.
Serves you right.

739
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,156
What?

740
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:12,788
Honey.

741
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,499
What?

742
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,583
What is it now?

743
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,001
I can't believe it.

744
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:22,005
What's up with this family?
There's never a moment of peace.

745
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,882
Now what?

746
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,301
You kept your promise.

747
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,138
You kept one of the three.

748
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,695
<i>"To the Heart That Leaves Me Behind."</i>

749
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,240
<i>By Oh Ae-sun of Dodong-dong, Jeju.</i>

750
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:53,370
<i>I believed I had to hold your hand</i>
<i>To feel its warmth when I was young</i>

751
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,125
<i>But now I know you're with me</i>
<i>Even if you're not by my side</i>

752
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,628
<i>Now that I have a warm spot too</i>

753
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,215
<i>Just the thought of you</i>
<i>Warms my whole heart</i>

754
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:11,096
<i>I'll live knowing the moon is still there</i>
<i>Even during the day</i>

755
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,934
<i>So if you're going to leave,</i>
<i>go like the gentle waves.</i>

756
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:20,147
<i>After 50 years</i>
<i>Finally set me down and be free</i>

757
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,401
<i>My precious dear</i>
<i>You have worked so hard</i>

758
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,281
<i>My precious dearest</i>
<i>Here's to all you've been through</i>

759
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,167
All you've been doing is crying lately.

760
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:51,219
See? You did keep one of the promises.

761
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,641
Now that my poem has been published
in a book, I'm a poet too.

762
00:48:56,642 --> 00:49:00,062
If you hadn't ended up with me,
it would have been published ages ago.

763
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,898
I couldn't do it without you.

764
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,192
I couldn't write poems like this one.

765
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,154
Goodness. Damn Ae-sun.

766
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,448
My burden, Ae-sun.

767
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,410
Are you happy?

768
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,163
I am.

769
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,626
I'm so happy.

770
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,510
They're kissing.

771
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,595
Piggyback ride?

772
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,514
I'm heavy.

773
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:39,393
Come on, there are kids watching.
Behave yourselves.

774
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,187
Because of you two,
the kids think love is everything.

775
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,564
Buy 100 copies
and give them to the fishing co-op.

776
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,858
Make sure you do, all right?

777
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,910
<i>Mom prayed all night</i>
<i>that time would stop that day</i>

778
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,748
<i>and that the bonus track would never end.</i>

779
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,463
Honey.

780
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,800
Let's just live like this.

781
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:18,098
I just want to live like this
for five more years.

782
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,145
No,

783
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,398
let's be together for all the seasons

784
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,484
just once more, okay?

785
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:34,698
Fearing I would leave before seeing any
of the wishes come true drove me crazy.

786
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,035
But seeing you write poetry before I go

787
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,288
has made my heart feel much better.

788
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,706
So much better.

789
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,667
In our next life…

790
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,547
I'll keep five, no, ten promises.

791
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,718
Will you be with me again
in the next life?

792
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,768
Will I be able to…

793
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,438
meet you again in the next life?

794
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,106
Why?

795
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,026
You don't want to meet me again?

796
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,910
Such blessings never strike back-to-back.

797
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,790
How could I be the only one
living in a flowery heaven?

798
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,587
You suffered all your life because of me.

799
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,007
Thanks to you,

800
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,761
I was never lonely for a day.

801
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,806
Not even for a day.

802
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,894
Where could you ever find
a life like this?

803
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:48,897
Ae-sun.

804
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,649
Yeah?

805
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,193
I have one favor to ask you.

806
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,864
When my time comes…

807
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,034
don't cry too much.

808
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,122
When Oh Ae-sun cries,

809
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,625
it tears me apart.

810
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,004
Then I can't go like gentle waves.

811
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,008
What I want to see…

812
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,638
in my final moments…

813
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,309
is your smile.

814
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,188
Thanks to your smile,

815
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,984
my entire life has been filled with joy.

816
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,912
Oh dear.

817
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,665
You can't even do that for me?

818
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,877
Pat my back.

819
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,187
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>

820
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,941
<i>Rock to sleep</i>

821
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,071
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>

822
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,866
<i>Rock to sleep</i>

823
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,703
<i>My baby…</i>

824
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,038
I miss her so much.

825
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,999
<i>…sleeps well</i>

826
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,962
<i>Sleep quickly</i>

827
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,381
<i>Sleep quickly</i>

828
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:45,472
<i>A black dog walks away</i>

829
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:52,604
<i>A black dog walks this way</i>

830
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,152
<i>Come help my baby sleep</i>

831
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:05,742
<i>Then I'll help your pups sleep</i>

832
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,120
<i>My mom always said</i>

833
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,290
<i>there were difficult days</i>
<i>but never lonely ones.</i>

834
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,918
<i>Looking back, her life was a paradise.</i>

835
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,212
Goodness me.

836
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,757
<i>Dad spent his life patting our backs.</i>

837
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:26,179
<i>Even until the very end,</i>
<i>he gave us all his strength.</i>

838
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,681
<i>Honey, you'll have an accident.</i>

839
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,225
<i>Stop driving and pull over for now.</i>

840
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,269
<i>- I'll be right there.</i>
- It's fine.

841
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,896
There aren't any cars.

842
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,857
- There are no cars on the road.
<i>- There are no cars?</i>

843
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,568
Dad, don't go until I get there.

844
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,112
Don't go until I see you.

845
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,031
<i>The heavens showed us one final mercy</i>

846
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,867
<i>so that we could give him</i>
<i>our final escort.</i>

847
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,453
Dad, I'm here. Dad, I'm right here.

848
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,081
Dad, I'll stay right here.

849
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,084
Dad, don't be scared.

850
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,962
Dad, I'm sorry.

851
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,299
Dad, I love you.

852
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,967
Dad, I'm sorry.

853
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,051
Dad.

854
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,470
- Dad.
- Honey.

855
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,222
Dad, I'm sorry.

856
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,518
<i>The last look Dad saw on our faces</i>

857
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,646
<i>was filled with a sadness</i>

858
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,982
<i>that he'd never seen before.</i>

859
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,478
<i>You should have been easier on yourself.</i>
<i>Why have you aged so quickly?</i>

860
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,565
<i>But you're still the same.</i>

861
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,737
<i>I've gotten older too.</i>

862
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,115
<i>No.</i>

863
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,534
<i>You're the same.</i>

864
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,288
<i>In my eyes, you've looked the same</i>

865
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,749
<i>for the past 50 years.</i>

866
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,057
<i>There was a girl in the boy's life.</i>

867
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:41,356
<i>All his life,</i>
<i>the boy kept the girl's world safe.</i>

868
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,611
<i>Thank you, honey.</i>

869
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,989
<i>You've lived a good life.</i>

870
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,951
<i>A truly great life.</i>

871
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,832
<i>Was it all right?</i>

872
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,296
<i>Was our time together good?</i>

873
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,175
<i>It was more than perfect.</i>

874
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,438
<i>It was so wonderful</i>
<i>that I couldn’t have asked for more.</i>

875
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:28,611
<i>Gazing at the one person</i>
<i>etched into his life…</i>

876
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,535
<i>Dad</i>

877
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,997
<i>slept in for the first time.</i>

878
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,426
<i>After leaving his last gifts behind.</i>

879
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,557
Your dad asked me to give this to you,
no matter what.

880
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,062
<i>Dad</i>

881
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,443
<i>never withdrew</i>
<i>the paltry amount of money I sent him.</i>

882
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,069
He never used the money

883
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,531
but kept updating the bankbook,
so I asked why.

884
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,785
He said the fact that you thought
to send him money meant so much to him.

885
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,914
Why didn't he use it?

886
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,082
The 100,000 won you sent

887
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,960
brought your dad happiness
worth a million won.

888
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,256
But all he had for himself

889
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,259
was this single section of the wardrobe.

890
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,180
Dad, you're so annoying.

891
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,308
<i>Dad's uneven love had just ended,</i>

892
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,102
<i>while mine was only beginning.</i>

893
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,442
That damn Mercedes.

894
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,945
Your dad wanted to buy you one.

895
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:56,407
He wanted you at least
to live an awesome life.

896
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,245
What's the mileage on this?

897
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:03,873
You really are

898
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,669
so much like my daughter.

899
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,937
You wear these hairpins every day
and lose them every day.

900
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,607
Why do I bother buying them for you?
You lose them every day.

901
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,053
<i>Mom's treasure trove</i>

902
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,806
<i>was filled with 50 years of affection.</i>

903
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:21,618
<i>It held his heart, never to cease.</i>

904
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,382
Honey, what should I do?

905
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,472
How am I supposed to live on?

906
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,080
Stop making rolled omelets.

907
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,460
You couldn't bear to eat <i>sujebi</i>
after Dong-myeong left.

908
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,254
When I'm gone,
you'll cry at the sight of rolled omelets.

909
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,319
If the kids ask you
to live with them later,

910
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,697
just give in and go along, okay?

911
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,032
If you're here alone,

912
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,284
I'll cry.

913
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:19,861
Goodness.

914
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,489
When did he move them all down?

915
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,674
You were busy.

916
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,343
You were so busy, my husband.

917
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,639
<i>Just as she knew</i>

920
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:08,367
SEEING A LOVED ONE RETURN EACH DAY
THROUGH THE DOOR THEY LEFT IN THE MORNING.

921
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,663
IT WAS A MIRACLE EVERY DAY.

922
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,008
I've come a long way.

923
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,428
I really have.

924
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,853
Now let's keep it going.

925
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,108

01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,961
I'll be back.

930
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,296
I'll be back soon.

931
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,349
No,

932
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,478
it's just that my husband is over there.

933
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,073
Look.

934
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,742
I wrote the entire book.

935
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,870
I finished it.

936
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,252
<i>I'm sending you my parents' 70 years.</i>

937
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,880
<i>I believe it's a story</i>
<i>that should not be forgotten.</i>

938
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:48,217
<i>From Yang Geum-myeong, the eldest daughter</i>
<i>of Yang Gwan-sik and Oh Ae-sun.</i>

939
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,608
The words you've held
deep in your heart all your life.

940
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,651
That'll be the best poem of your life.

941
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,712
Teacher, can you color mine?

942
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,634
Why do you always ask me
to do everything for you?

943
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,511
You should get used to doing things
on your own.

944
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:36,307
Spend time drawing on your own.

945
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,768
Talk to yourself a bit.

946
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,645
Play cards.

947
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,439
That way, you can stay healthy.

948
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,442
Loneliness can make you unwell.

949
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,152
Oh my.

950
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,529
Why do you keep giving me yours?

951
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,241
Yesterday, I went to a restaurant
with my daughter and her husband.

952
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,993
I ordered my own food.

953
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,870
It's thanks to you.

954
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,956
All thanks to my teacher, Ae-sun.

957
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,839

960
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:21,060
<i>But yesterday, I ordered what I wanted</i>

961
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,020
<i>I ordered a special sushi set</i>

962

964
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,820
Have some. Here.

965
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:33,197
Oh, why do you all keep giving me things?

966
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:37,618
- You're so lovely.
- Because I remind you of your daughter?

967
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,247
It would've been wonderful

968
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,542
if my daughter could be like you,
sitting at a desk.

969
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,255
It'd be nice to live like your teacher,
sitting at a desk and writing stuff.

970
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:59,098
<i>I wish my mother were here</i>
<i>to peel these tangerines.</i>

971
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,226
<i>I'd treat her to a special sushi set.</i>

972
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,147
<i>What I wanted to say the most in my life…</i>

973

Mom!

977
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,873
Others live to be 90 or even 100,

978
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:26,292
so what was the hurry?

979
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,503
Were you born again
in this wonderful world?

980
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:35,468
I hope you get to sit at that desk
you've always wanted and live like a boss.

981
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,100
MY DAUGHTER

982
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,105
Hey, what is it?

983
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:52,943
Nothing much. It's just the same old.

984
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,029
What?

985
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,032
All of a sudden?

986
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,079
You said you couldn't come
this month either.

987
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:07,666
Oh no, I shouldn't have given your aunt
the sour kimchi.

988
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,962
Mom, stop bringing more out
and just have a seat.

989
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:17,051
You like it sour,
and Eun-myeong likes it fresh.

990
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,512
I always have to make it separately.

991
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,472
You're just killing me.

992
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,058

Oh my.

997
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,292
Why are you so into Lim Young-woong?

998
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,046
Your father loved Kim Kwang-seok.

999
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,590
He learned guitar to play this song.

1000
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,386
But he never sang it for me

1001
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,555
because I might cry.

1002
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:06,725
But then, I heard Young-woong singing it.

1003
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:10,563
It made me tear up.

1004
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,651

01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:13,227
I thought that at the last minute,
these book peddlers would ask us

1043
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,272
to contribute money
to publish the poetry collection.

1044
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,024
But it wasn't a scam after all.

1045
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,152
I must be out of my mind.

1046
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,323
It says, "<i>Oh Ae-sun's Poetry Collection.</i>"

1047
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:27,950
Mom.

1048
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:32,997
I bet Dad is happily laughing now, huh?

1049
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,378
Grandma's using her cheat code again.

1050
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,635
HERE'S TO ALL YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

1051
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:47,970
TRIBUTE

1052
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:50,556
THE BEAUTIFUL, DREAMLIKE STORY
BROUGHT ME TO TEARS

1053
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,349
"I'M SORRY. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU"

1054
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:53,267
EDITOR'S NOTE

1055
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:06,780
MENTAL AND FINANCIAL COMPETENCE

1056
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:14,079
So you're here to see the flowers today.
How do you feel about them?

1057
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,915
The flowers remind me of my first love.

1058
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,835
- First love. Of course.
- Go live with her, then.

1059
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,547
Hye-ran. That's dirty.

1060
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,014
Excuse me, ma'am.
What are you doing over there?

1061
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,474
I'm right here.

1062
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,226
Ma'am, who did you come here to see?

1063
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,521
Well, my mother-in-law told me
to go with the pretty lady.

1064
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,398
Then who would it be?

1065
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,442
Which one would it be?

1066
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,337
LITTLE PUNK

1067
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,799
THE DAY WE BECAME THE SAME AGE

1068
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,133
I WAS TEN WHEN I LOST MOTHER

1069
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,052
SHE LEFT BEHIND HER THREE CHILDREN AT 29

1070
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:12,137
WHEN I TURNED 29,
I CRIED LIKE I WAS TEN AGAIN

1071
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:50,926
Wait.

1072
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,678
Are you crying?

1073
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:56,682
Yes.

1074
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,017
What's wrong with me?

1075
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,104
Why am I tearing up?

1076
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:05,524
You love it that much?

1077
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:07,651
It's just…

1078
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:10,028
I'm so…

1079
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:12,614
So…

1080
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,828
How should I put it?

1081
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,707
I'm proud of her.

1082
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,084
So proud.

1083
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,465
OH AE-SUN

1084
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,382
CONTENTS

1085
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,676
SPRING IN A HEARTBEAT
THE BLAZING SUMMER SUNSHINE

1086
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:35,804
What should we do to celebrate your debut?

1087
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,516
Just say it. Don't hold back.

1088
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,226
Your daughter is a big shot now.

1089
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,854
And she even bought you a house.

1090
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:46,940
Come visit me more often.

1091
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:52,279
My wish before my time comes is to see
my busy daughter a hundred more times.

1092
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,409
Why would you say something like that?

1093
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:02,664
I barely see you ten times a year
because you're so busy.

1094
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,461
I'd be so happy
if I could see you a hundred times.

1095
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,884
That's why I said
you should come to Seoul with me.

1096
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:16,595
Why are you so diligent
in going to the nursing home?

1097
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:22,643
Even when you're old,
you want to have a place in the world.

1098
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,146
I'd hate being treated
like an extra even more.

1099
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:29,358
I'd just be enjoying myself if I were you.

1100
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:33,237
You were always so busy your whole life.

1101
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,866
To tell you the truth,
I go there because I'm excited.

1102
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,955
When I'm there,
they all call me "Teacher."

1103
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,627
You could say
I've really moved up in life.

1104
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:56,218
<i>From a </i>haenyeo's <i>daughter</i>
<i>who cried every day at sea,</i>

1105
01:15:56,718 --> 01:16:01,473
<i>to the Literary Girl embarrassed</i>
<i>by everything in the world…</i>

1106
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,977
Now we have a house and a boat.

1107
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,605
<i>…to a captain's wife</i>
<i>filled with overwhelming joy…</i>

1108
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,693
<i>to Chief Oh,</i>

1109
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:16,154
<i>to a lady filleting fish at the market,</i>

1110
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,367
<i>to a supposed teacher at 70,</i>

1111
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,078
<i>and finally, to Oh Ae-sun the poet.</i>

1112
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,624
<i>In life, you never know what will happen</i>
<i>unless you go for it.</i>

1113
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:32,504
It would've been a shame
if I'd given up halfway through it.

1114
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,508
I'm so glad I lived through it.

1115
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:38,468
So,

1116
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,638
is it spring for you again?

1117
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:43,557
Yes.

1118
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,852
Yes, it's spring again. Spring.

1119
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:49,646
I thought

1120
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:55,694
life went from spring to summer,
fall, and then winter,

1121
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,280
but I was wrong.

1122
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,951
It sometimes feels like winter,

1123
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,580
sometimes like spring.

1124
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:13,795
I've had myriad spring days.

1125
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,886
<i>70 years of stars came together</i>
<i>to form the Milky Way.</i>

1126
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:26,475
I've had many sparkling moments.

1127
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,185
I've had so many.

1128
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,276
The 70 years of my life
spent in a flowery heaven

1129
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,986
are all in this book.

1130
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,740
<i>The countless memories</i>
<i>she buried in her heart</i>

1131
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,700
<i>were now in full bloom.</i>

1132
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,285
So,

1133
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:47,913
are you happy?

1134
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:51,833
Yes.

1135
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:53,919
I am.

1136
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:58,131
I'm so happy.

1137
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,720
<i>My mom is now shining</i>
<i>in the most beautiful colors.</i>

1138
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,809
<i>To my love.</i>

1139
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,437
<i>From the age of nine until now,</i>

1140
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,815
<i>thanks to you,</i>

1141
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:18,568
<i>my life has been spring every day.</i>

1142
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:25,242
<i>This book wouldn't exist</i>
<i>if it weren't for you.</i>

1143
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,453
<i>Until the spring we meet again,</i>

1144
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,999
<i>I'll live as though every day is spring.</i>

1145
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,668
Come here.

1146
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,132
If I become a poet someday,

1147
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,300
I'll wear two-piece dresses
like celebs do.

1148
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,094
Also, if I become rich,

1149
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:47,889
I'm going to live in a two-story house
and raise an adorable dog.

1150
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,308
I'm going to have
our kids learn piano too.

1151
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:53,019
I'm going to eat out quite often.

1152
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:56,148
I'm going to drive a Jeep

1153
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,358
and wear Ray-Bans.

1154
01:18:58,442 --> 01:18:59,359
You like cars?

1155
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,278
Yeah.

1156
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,447
You actually like something?

1157
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,992
I'll take you in that car,
and we'll go everywhere together.

1158
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,410
Even to America.

1159
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,746
I love it!

1160
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,709
Hand in hand, swaying and chatting,
let's do everything we want.

1161
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,044
I love it. I love it too.

1162
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:22,549
Let's do all kinds of things
for as long as we live.

1163
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,301
Let's do whatever we want!

1164
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:38,899
<i>To their seasons,</i>

1165
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,527
<i>once so young and still so tender.</i>

1166
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:46,490
<i>With remorse, gratitude,</i>

1167
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,576
<i>and the deepest respect.</i>

1168
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,663
<i>Here's to all you've been through.</i>

1169
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,219
"IF YOU CAN'T, JUST BACK DOWN.
WE'RE ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU."
