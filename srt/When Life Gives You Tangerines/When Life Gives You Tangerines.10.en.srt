1
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,235
<i>I want you to listen to me.</i>
<i>I'm gonna say this again.</i>

3
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:15,784
<i>I did not have sexual relations</i>
<i>with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.</i>

4
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>I never told anybody…</i>

5
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,204
<i>The strongest wind</i>

6
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,665
<i>is the one that blows within one's heart.</i>

7
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,586
<i>No power on earth can overcome it.</i>

8
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,422
I'm completely innocent
in all this.

9
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,716
Absolutely guilt-free.

10
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,553
No guilt whatsoever.

11
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,472
So then, why?

12
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:43,144
Why am I no longer the chief
and just put out to pasture?

13
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,191
Hey, Park Yeong-ran.

14
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,401
Come here.

15
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,370
You disrespect me too, huh?

16
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,666
I said to come over here.
What the hell do you do at home, huh?

17
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,544
You get to eat white rice
with the money I make for you,

18
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,712
and you can't even watch our kid?!

19
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,714
She behaves like that
because she takes after you.

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,133
I know everything!

21
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,426
Go to sleep if you're drunk!

22
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,764
What, little jerk? Whose kid are you?
Whose side are you on?

23
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,183
Father, do you even know how old I am?

24
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,812
Ha!

25
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,276
Oh! Hey.

26
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,777
Hey. Hey, you punk!

27
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,654
Maybe you never came to see me
on sports day

28
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,239
because I'm not your kid, after all.

29
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,784
While you hauled ass to see spring flowers
or mountains in the winter…

30
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,369
"Hauled ass," really?

31
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,580
…Mom hasn't ever missed a day
fixing us a hot lunch.

32
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,998
Hey!

33
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,877
And who brought you
your stepmom here, huh?

34
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,880
I can always get you a new stepmom,

35
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,340
but I'm your genitor!

36
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,843
If you guys are gonna break up,
I'm going with her.

37
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,760
What boy?

38
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,679
I'm treating you like a dad

39
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,682
only because she lives with you, you know.

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,144
Bring the broom here.

41
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,230
Where's the broom?

42
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,734
- Huh? Where's the… Where's the…
- Oh-seong, go to your room.

43
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,818
Ow!

44
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,403
You shouldn't be like that to your dad.

45
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,448
Split up with him already!
Come on! What's there to lose?

46
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,241
- But I…
- Who put this here?

47
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,659
I am staying with your father.

48
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,953
- Who put this year? Oh, ow.
- I'm staying with him.

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,585
My God! Jeez!

50
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,469
I knew it.

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,305
You'd never survive without me.

52
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,101
You get to put food on the table
thanks to the money I earn.

53
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,645
Huh?

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,648
The food I bring to our house.

55
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,025
I'll stay.

56
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,072
I will stay.

57
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,740
How dare…

58
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,368
We'll grow old together.

59
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,456
Then, I'll see you in paradise.

60
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,175
KNOCK
YOU BETTER KNOCK

61
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,106
Oh shit.

62
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,369
Get out.

63
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,331
You little…

64
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,086
God, I wish I could knock you out
with a damn flying kick now.

65
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,671
I said, get out!

66
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,588
Good God.

67
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,382
God, God, God.

68
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,053
Mom!

69
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,348
Listen, if you were Han-eum,
I would've given you a beating.

70
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,599
You know that?

71
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,311
You have a boyfriend, and you look like
you're a battle-worn soldier?

72
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,397
Why… why do you have a photo
of Hwang Shin-hye?

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,649
If you wanna look like her,
you'll need a different body.

74
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,568
Why can't you just leave me alone?

75
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,195
Of all people,
how could you be involved with their son?

76
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,365
You idiot. His mother and our, our…

77
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,910
- Damn it.
- What about her?

78
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,871
Don't worry about it.

79
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,749
You're gonna be embarrassed
when you find out.

80
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,376
Stop this bullshit
while I'm still being nice.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,297
Let me think about it, then.

82
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,094
You go and tell the guy…

83
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,266
<i>that I'll kill him</i>
<i>if I ever see him again.</i>

84
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,275
Let's just end it, okay?

85
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,320
No, I don't want to!

86
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,655
Is this because of those bastards
Oh-seong and Han-eum?

87
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,366
Or is it because of my father?

88
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:12,288
I am me, and my father is my father.
And I don't listen to my dad anyway.

89
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,708
Look, don't tell anyone
that we're together anymore.

90
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,212
Don't cut in line at the store
and expect me to serve you.

91
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,257
If you're going to the roller rink,
please go to Ssangbong.

92
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,385
No, I'm gonna be your girlfriend.

93
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,137
I won't let you date
anyone else but me. No way.

94
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,681
If you do, I'm gonna beat up those girls.

95
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,935
You don't believe I will?
You don't believe I will?!

96
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,270
Oh, I think you will.

97
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,439
I won't let you end us.

98
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,025
I can't.

99
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,195
- One more thing, Bu Hyeon-suk.
- What?

100
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,412
You be well.

101
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,837
They're crying.

102
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,675
You son of a bitch!

103
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,721
Don't ever let me see you again.

104
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,265
I'll kill you dead!

105
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,769
You're breaking up
because you got your ass kicked?

106
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,272
Great! So I'll tell my brothers
to keep doing it!

107
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,898
To beat you up each time they see you!

108
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,900
They ever beat you, huh?

109
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,988
Okay, fine. Let's run away.

110
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,198
Make sure they don't catch us.

111
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,869
The arcade, the rolling skating rink,
Chilseongtong. I can't go anywhere.

112
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,539
Your brothers' friends
are just everywhere.

113
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,708
I got on the bus yesterday,

114
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,169
and the bus driver
was one of their friends.

115
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,840
He told me to stay on
until the end of the line.

116
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,136
How can I live here now, huh?

117
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,221
I need to live too.

118
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,557
Then we'll run.

119
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,517
Let's run away.

120
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,021
- What?
- I can't live like this either.

121
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,065
My father even broke off my bedroom door.

122
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,360
Do you wanna run away together?

123
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,738
You know, he even said
that if I keep seeing you,

124
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,616
he would shave my head
and send me to a monastery.

125
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,326
You believe he'll do it?

126
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,078
So then, all of your friends
would be monks and nuns.

127
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,081
Are we gonna run or not?

128
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,379
Answer me. Are you or not?

129
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,466
I don't know.

130
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,604
Honk. Honk. Keep honking.
Keep honking the horn.

131
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,648
Keep honking.

132
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,027
They look like
the center of the Korean flag.

133
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,822
They're having
the time of their lives there.

134
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,908
This is their springtime right now.

135
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,787
I mean, is it springtime that's
the problem, or is it their bloodline?

136
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,540
- I love you.
- I love you too.

137
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,502
<i>In retrospect,</i>
<i>one realizes springtime was a celebration.</i>

138
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,380
Come in, son.

139
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,840
<i>But to new growing buds,</i>
<i>spring feels like war.</i>

140
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,758
Hello.

141
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,928
You come to my son's too?

142
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,431
<i>Like when new buds push their heads</i>
<i>through the concrete.</i>

143
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,528
You don't even know how to ladle soup.

144
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,660
- Did your mother not teach you?
- Ah, it's, uh, the seaweed is all tangled.

145
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,537
Hey, keep your hands out!

146
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,872
We don't do that in our home.

147
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,007
The two of you are here. Oh.

148
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,134
This is a great birthday.

149
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,409
This kimchi is… is so, so good.

150
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,579
It's hard to find good kimchi in Seoul.

151
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,248
I mean, uh,
I don't mean kimchi in Seoul is all bad--

152
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,416
I bought it.

153
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,127
Mm. Mm.

154
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,964
It's been a while
since I've had homemade food.

155
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,342
It feels like I could eat two bowls.

156
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,510
We value portion control.

157
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,684
Do your parents know…
you come to a boy's apartment?

158
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,439
She's not here a lot.
I invited her since it's my birthday.

159
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,359
That wasn't a question for you.

160
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,572
So, Geum-myeong.

161
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,284
This isn't Yeong-beom's apartment.
This is my place.

162
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,453
I got this for him.

163
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,166
I don't… want you
frequenting my apartment.

164
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,879
- Mother.
- I don't want Geum-myeong in my apartment.

165
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,927
Of course, continue dating.
Learn how romance works.

166
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,931
Mom, I told you. I'm dating Geum-myeong
'cause I plan on marrying her.

167
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,561
You asked for a place near school,
and this is so…

168
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,525
so…

169
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,570
You are my pride.

170
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,572
And now my pride is damaged.

171
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,704
<i>Love in our hearts</i>
<i>was a wind that made each of us waver.</i>

172
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,997
<i>And that wind felt like a typhoon.</i>

173
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,668
Is your family a conglomerate?
Like Samsung or Hyundai?

174
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,212
Is your family really
so much wealthier than mine?

175
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,175
We go to the same school.
My parents care about me

176
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,552
as much as yours care about you.

177
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,096
Why should I feel ashamed
that I can't ladle soup, huh?

178
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,557
Do you ladle well?
Did your mother teach you?

179
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,809
I'm terrible at that.

180
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,812
It's so unfair.

181
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,524
Everything just feels so wrong.

182
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,819
I… I just… I just feel like a cheap clown,

183
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,697
dancing for a lady who won't like me,
no matter what I'm doing.

184
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,950
I can't stand being treated like this.
You get that?

185
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,702
I despise that feeling.

186
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,878
DIGESTIVE DRINK

187
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,925
Why did you have so much food?

188
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,387
I wanted to try and impress your mother.

189
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,222
That's why I ate so much.

190
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,101
What girl does not want to impress
her boyfriend's mother?

191
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,730
I won't get engaged to Mom's pride.
Do you understand me?

192
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,778
Now you have to decide.

193
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,323
Choose if you wanna be
a good husband or a good son.

194
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,407
You can only be one.

195
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,453
Please, I really don't want a man
who needs to please everyone.

196
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:11,332
Before you think about proposing,
you must choose one or the other.

197
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,960
Well, who… who could pick one
over the other though? I…

198
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,588
- No man would ever…
- Some men would.

199
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,089
What?

200
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,133
My father did it.

201
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,760
Oh.

202
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,347
Let me make myself clear in this.

203
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,809
I won't marry your mother's son, okay?

204
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,896
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>she was emotional</i>

205
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,189
<i>about everything at the time.</i>

206
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,525
<i>She was like an owl</i>
<i>that screeched all night</i>

207
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,485
<i>at the slightest sound of a breeze.</i>

208
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,740
<i>This is Kim Gi-deok on </i>Two O'Clock Date.

209
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:50,579
<i>So I believe the '90s is indeed</i>
<i>the renaissance of mainstream culture.</i>

210
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,375
<i>You could say it's the roaring '90s.</i>

211
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,835
I love this painting.

212
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,753
I guess he doesn't wanna be
Picasso anymore.

213
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,464
See? You can do your job right.

214
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,882
It's so clear.

215
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,926
You can tell what this movie is about.

216
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,055
Just looking at it makes me
wanna perform the Lambada. Yeah?

217
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,641
Good job.

218
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,187
Oh, that lady's back again.

219
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,731
She always figures out
when it's opening night.

220
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,776
Where does she get
the resale tickets?

221
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,821
I've never sold her any tickets before.

222
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,365
Do you think they might be counterfeit?

223
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,142
We're not interested.

224
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,019
Okay, listen.

225
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,314
- We don't want resale tickets.
- No, I just have a question.

226
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,442
Does that look like Choi Jin-sil?

227
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,113
Maybe it doesn't look like her?

228
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:10,117
- I think it looks like her.
- Oh, that means this one is well-drawn.

229
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,286
- Sorry?
- Or not. I don't know.

230
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,330
Oh, no. I'm sure. I'm sure, yes.

231
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,083
I heard that was drawn by an art student.

232
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,793
Ah.

233
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,380
Why won't people ever look at
that piece of art before they walk in?

234
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,424
Maybe they're busy, but it makes me sad

235
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,843
that they won't look at
the painting even once.

236
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,637
It really breaks my heart.

237
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,641
<i>A Picasso lived in</i>
<i>the basement floor of the Cannes Theater,</i>

238
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,060
<i>and to someone,</i>
<i>this theater was their Louvre.</i>

239
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,938
Stop! Don't resell tickets!
Not in my theater!

240
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,482
Scalping is a societal menace! You hear?

241
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,275
No selling resale tickets!

242
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,486
Stop it, I said!

243
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,364
Does that man really think I'm a scalper?

244
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,759
Since you're already here,
you may as well watch a movie.

245
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,638
This one coming out in two days
is really good, I hear.

246
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,182
We're showing it again
because it was so popular.

247
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,436
Oh, no. You really shouldn't
give out free tickets.

248
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,064
Ah, sure, but you're not just anyone.

249
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,151
This is an employee benefit
offered by the owner himself.

250
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,656
Come at 2:00 p.m. on Monday.
It's normally empty then,

251
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,950
so it'll feel like
you rented the theater for yourself.

252
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,909
Thank you.

253
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,370
By the way,
could you please not tell my son

254
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,455
that I come here to look at his paintings?

255
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,375
Chung-seob doesn't know I come here.

256
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,212
He packs his lunch when he leaves home
and comes back fully covered in paint.

257
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,924
Maybe he feels embarrassed,
but he doesn't tell me where he paints.

258
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,051
Not everyone gets to paint big pictures.

259
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,137
- If they paint, they're painters.
- Of course. Yes.

260
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,682
That painting is so good,
and all I want is to see his work.

261
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,188
I've seen every one of my son's drawings
since elementary school.

262
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,024
It's one of life's joys.

263
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,110
I look forward to film premieres
for that reason.

264
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,278
Hmm.

265
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,449
Uh, our theater
would be ruined without "Park-casso."

266
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,583
Sir, you're not from Seoul, are you?

267
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,007
Wow!

268
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,351
What is it this time?

269
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,729
Did Eun-myeong sell something
at school again?

270
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,274
Eun-myeong's mom.

271
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,985
Don't call me that anymore, please.

272
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,696
Should we call you
Geum-myeong's mom, then?

273
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,532
Did I get a call from Seoul?

274
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,825
Geum-myeong has a boyfriend.

275
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,411
Of course she's not thinking about
Mom and Dad.

276
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,830
It's unfair.

277
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,917
It's as if calling us first
is a difficult burden.

278
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,170
Well, they're only kids
while you're raising them.

279
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,465
Once they leave the nest,
they're busier than the president.

280
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,301
Children don't have time for parents
once they leave home.

281
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,596
What, did you have another bad dream?

282
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,944
Anyway, why did the school call you?
Eun-myeong last in his class?

283
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,862
He's not last.

284
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,781
Because Cheol-yong is in that class.

285
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,785
It's about cigarettes.

286
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,538
You promised you wouldn't spill it.

287
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,957
So does that
sneaky little punk smoke, now?

288
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,542
He doesn't smoke.

289
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,835
He sold them.

290
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,671
He sold some cigarettes.

291
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,423
AUNTIES' SEAFOOD HOUSE

292
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,842
He's something else.

293
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,303
Well, I suppose it's better
to sell them than to smoke them.

294
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,889
He goes to the general store,
lies to the old man

295
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,599
about the cigarettes being for us,

296
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,728
and he basically acts like
a cigarette delivery man.

297
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,022
He even adds a markup on resale.

298
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,944
Honestly, I'm more curious about what
Eun-myeong will become than Geum-myeong.

299
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,824
Have you asked him why he does that?

300
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,661
What do you mean why? He's a teenage boy.

301
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,079
He thinks he knows it all.

302
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,623
I mean, you've never asked the boy

303
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,376
why he feels the need
to earn cash of his own?

304
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,380
Oh, I'm not sure
why he's always out to make cash.

305
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,757
Well, that's why you have to ask.

306
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,927
You may have birthed him,
but you can't read his mind.

307
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,014
You know, I noticed you never raise
your voice at Geum-myeong,

308
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,308
yet you're only tough
on Eun-myeong, right?

309
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,143
Geum-myeong's a tough cookie,

310
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,521
but you're way too overly careful
with her, like Jell-O.

311
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,150
Eun-myeong's a laid-back boy,
but you're so hard on him.

312
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,445
Geum-myeong is a sensitive
and emotional girl like me,

313
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,155
and Eun-myeong is…

314
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,616
- Well--
- A pushover.

315
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,534
- Is that it?
- Come on, I never thought that.

316
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,206
If you keep hammering tough shells,
maybe they'll seem unaffected at first,

317
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,626
but eventually, you will start to see
cracks on the surface.

318
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,379
Don't show your children favoritism, ever.

319
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,131
'Cause they will

320
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,258
always remember.

321
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,136
Well, it's 'cause
this is just so irritating.

322
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,265
Oh, but I can't change
that he does things that are so awful.

323
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,769
It's not because Geum-myeong is a child
you can gloat about

324
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,104
and Eun-myeong is one
that you're embarrassed of?

325
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,233
So what? I'm no saint.

326
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,026
So what?

327
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,527
So what?

328
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,824
<i>…may be the star of tomorrow.</i>

329
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,078
<i>A forward-thinking choice.</i>

330
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,538
<i>High-performance Elantra.</i>

331
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,553
So…

332
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,267
I'm indebted to you again.
How can I repay you?

333
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,184
Ah…

334
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,395
Don't worry about it.

335
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,982
See, I would love to…

336
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,653
Mm…

337
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,949
If you, uh…
Could you do a painting for me?

338
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,702
That way, I might get a high price for it.

339
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,705
Picasso's work got valuable
after he died, I heard.

340
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,710
Is there any form of guarantee
you'll live longer?

341
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,379
Uh…

342
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,342
- Were you joking?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

343
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,260
Ah.

344
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,974
- I'll go back to the box office now.
- Well…

345
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,644
Yes?

346
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,063
Thanks so much, really.

347
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,858
No. It's not like I paid or anything.

348
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,485
No, I mean, my mother, uh…

349
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,994
It's her first time watching
a movie in a theater.

350
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,713
Oh no. You have to run.

351
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,215
No, you have to run. Have to run.

352
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,853
She watches <i>This Weekend's</i>
<i>Classic Movie </i>on TV every week.

353
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,732
I guess I've been too focused
on living my own life.

354
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,869
<i>Our loved ones</i>
<i>who sway our hearts.</i>

355
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,079
You know, son?

356
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,997
I started crying from the moment

357
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,166
the projectionist with glasses
walked in the room.

358
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,084
Alfredo?

359
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,168
Uh-huh.

360
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,754
How come there was no fire extinguisher
in the projection room?

361
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,298
Why did he have to put out the fire?
He should've saved himself.

362
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,133
He should've jumped out the window.

363
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,469
Then he would've only broken his legs.

364
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,179
Hmm.

365
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,516
I wonder what he did
for a living after he lost his job.

366
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,477
Maybe Toto sent him money
because he's a nice boy.

367
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,021
Did you cry because
Alfredo couldn't make a living anymore?

368
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,690
You know, Toto is

369
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,318
like you, my son.

370
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,989
Toto reminds me of you.

371
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,369
Ah, so, uh,
what did you wanna give to Ms. Yang?

372
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,537
I'll give it to her.

373
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,706
Ms. Yang, your major's English lit?

374
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,042
Yes.

375
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,877
PHOTOCOPY, PRINTING, BINDING

376
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,005
You can rely on me until you graduate.

377
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,219
These are all in English.
People just won't pick them up.

378
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,513
The total price of these books
is quite a lot.

379
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,473
English books are more expensive.

380
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,101
Some of these even have notes in them.

381
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,104
I don't know if I can accept all of these.

382
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,732
This has to be why some prefer daughters.

383
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,153
I'm here all day, 365 days a year.

384
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,614
Seeing my son's work at movie premieres
is as much excitement as I can get.

385
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,367
But today, I was absolutely happy.

386
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,077
All thanks to you.

387
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,038
You know, I think
I'll remember this day until I die.

388
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,170
Uh, well,
now that you've said that,

389
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:27,340
I feel like, maybe,
I did an incredible thing.

390
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,760
Oh, Mother, stop adding to the box.

391
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,472
How is she supposed to carry them all?

392
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,183
She can't lift this by herself.

393
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,643
Not by herself.

394
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,130
Want a drink?

395
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,466
Dri… dri… dri… dri…

396
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,967
Drink?

397
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,677
- No drinks, then?
- Your order.

398
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,137
- Yeah.
- Go on. Take it.

399
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,472
- Thank you.
- I don't think so.

400
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,724
- Uh, so, yeah.
- Okay.

401
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,523
So…

402
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,400
Um, yes?

403
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,154
If you're thankful, instead of noodles,
um, could you help me…

404
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,155
Oh.

405
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,495
Your girlfriend keeps knocking my shoes
out of the way at my front door.

406
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,874
She's aware that there's nothing
going on between us.

407
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,293
I think it's her way of

408
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,255
processing guilt before she gets married.

409
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,301
Oh, so you're letting
your girlfriend marry another man?

410
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,683
Wow. How… laid-back of you.

411
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,603
Mm. The man she's marrying
is a noodle shop owner's son.

412
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,480
Are they rich because of noodles?

413
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,732
Pildong Noodles.

414
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,489
Really a perfect family to marry into.

415
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,491
She's hesitant

416
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,369
for some reason, but…

417
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,955
So convince her not to marry him.

418
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,959
If she lets go of Picasso
for the noodles guy, that's her choice.

419
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,003
You can say to her face,

420
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,548
"You can marry that guy if you want.
Not my loss."

421
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,968
Or give her family a gift and say,

422
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,387
"May I ask for
your daughter's hand in marriage?"

423
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,432
At least try so you don't
have regrets afterwards.

424
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,101
How would you know if I'm better than him?

425
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,021
You don't know me… that well.

426
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,480
Your mom loves you a lot.

427
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,779
So that's why you paint whatever you want.

428
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,075
You have
a deep-seated stubbornness in you.

429
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,371
See, I'm precious to my parents too.

430
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,876
I'd like to think that having my chin up

431
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,004
is how I'm the pride
of my mother and father.

432
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,424
I'd like to think that. I would.

433
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,596
So…

434
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,141
You don't have to take my side.
You don't even know me at all.

435
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,517
What do you mean?

436
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,187
You befriend folks
and realize life is life.

437
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,396
No, we're different.

438
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,983
If you get to know them,
there's wickedness in all people.

439
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:32,901
There is.

440
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,781
<i>There was a time</i>

441
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,409
<i>when showing kindness to strangers</i>
<i>was dangerous.</i>

442
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,996
<i>Less than three months</i>
<i>after a 13-year-old was murdered</i>

443
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,331
<i>in the Hwaseong serial killings…</i>

444
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,417
Oh my. I am so sorry again.

445
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,754
Yes, please let me know.

446
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,922
Please.

447
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,049
Those bastards deserve
to be beaten to death.

448
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,551
We have the phrase
"beat to death" for a reason.

449
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,345
How can a man be that evil?

450
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,681
Oh, is that right?

451
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,767
Oh, okay.
Oh, please, please tell Geum-myeong to…

452
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,145
to call me when she gets home
if you could…

453
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,148
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

454
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,191
Thanks.

455
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,444
When you kidnap a child,
you're not taking one life.

456
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,947
You snuff out
three of them at the same time.

457
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,533
How can parents cope with losing a child?

458
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,543
Losing a child is devastating for anyone,

459
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,962
but if that's how you lose your child…

460
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,879
Goodness.

461
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,176
Why? Is Geum-myeong out late again?

462
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,138
I can't figure out
what she's up to so late.

463
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,724
I told her to stay home once the sun sets.

464
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,101
Why? You're still having bad dreams?

465
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,686
About what?

466
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,110
It could relate to
the ancestral rite coming up.

467
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,697
As a child, on that rites day,
you had something happen.

468
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,407
You mean Aegi Hill?

469
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,492
That hill you and I climbed together,
remember?

470
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,746
Just thinking about it
gives me chills.

471
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,875
I still recall the smells

472
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,002
on the hill that day.

473
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,914
Hurry up, now.
There's meat on the ancestral rite table.

474
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,541
My dad will give it all to my brother.

475
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,126
You see that black dragonfly?

476
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,088
It's only visible to people
but not to other dragonflies.

477
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,006
Why not?

478
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,425
It's the Grim Reaper for dragonflies.

479
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,595
It's the same for us.

480
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,515
We can't see our Reaper either.

481
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,564
What is it? Are you gonna catch it?

482
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,899
You go ahead first.

483
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,151
Let's just go.

484
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,823
If I catch that one,
other dragonflies won't be killed.

485
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,868
Baby dragonflies probably want to live
with their parents too.

486
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,996
Ae-sun, my dad's gonna yell at you again.

487
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,875
<i>Was that what people call being bewitched?</i>

488
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,418
<i>I don't know why I chased it.</i>

489
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,778
AEGI HILL
BUS STOP

490
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,546
I need to ride the bus,
but I hurt my leg, so

491
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,674
could you go to that store

492
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,760
and change this coin to ten hwans?

493
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,484
What did the shop owner say?

494
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,154
That he's not a local bank.

495
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,406
Did he yell at you?

496
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,826
No, but he did give me side-eye.

497
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,079
That is for your help.

498
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,503
You're a very sweet girl
and kind-hearted too.

499
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,299
Obedient as well, aren't you?

500
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,928
But… you don't have to give me this.

501
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,138
Well, then will you help me
get more change?

502
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,058
Because I need to ride
two different buses.

503
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,149
Since the store owner
didn't like giving you change,

504
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,488
go find the cabbage truck vendor
in the alley behind the telephone pole.

505
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,783
Could you get some change from that man?

506
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,994
Then… I'll give you another coin.

507
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,958
My legs hurt pretty badly, as you can see.

508
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,367
What are you doing here?

509
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,577
- Mom?
- What are you up to?

510
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,373
- What are you doing here, Mom?
- Who gave you this money?

511
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,752
- Sir!
- What?

512
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,796
You know that guy?

513
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,471
Huh?

514
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,683
That lady was here just now.

515
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,437
<i>Gwang-rye said</i>
<i>her heart was pounding out of her chest,</i>

516
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,732
<i>but she couldn't say anything</i>
<i>because she didn't want to scare you.</i>

517
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,151
But, Mom, what are you doing here?

518
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,447
<i>It was such an odd coincidence.</i>

519
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,742
<i>I was in a neighborhood</i>
<i>that I had never gone to,</i>

520
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:59,912
<i>and I met my mom, who would</i>
<i>never ever go to that neighborhood.</i>

521
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,498
<i>You still don't know, do you?</i>

522
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,543
<i>Your mother went out</i>
<i>looking for you that day.</i>

523
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,635
I love that I don't have to get firewood,
thanks to you.

524
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,179
What's the big deal?

525
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,681
We still have plenty of the wood
you brought last time.

526
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,142
This is the least she can do.

527
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,812
Her child's been living and eating here
for free for years.

528
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,274
She should do that much
for her child support at least.

529
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,903
Don't have Ae-sun carry firewood.

530
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,323
Get rid of <i>jeongjong</i>
and put <i>makgeolli </i>on the table.

531
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,450
That's what Han-gyu likes best.

532
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,203
Where is Ae-sun?

533
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,872
She doesn't care
that it's her dad's death anniversary.

534
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,999
She just wants to roam all around town.

535
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,003
Where's Ae-sun?
We have meat stew. Where is she?

536
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,465
She ran after a Grim Reaper dragonfly.

537
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,217
What?

538
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,512
<i>A mother's instinct</i>
<i>is a powerful thing.</i>

539
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,015
<i>Apparently, she climbed up and down</i>
<i>a mountain that day.</i>

540
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,688
You have to eat
the meat stew for your dad.

541
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,191
Why did you run off
instead of eating the stew?

542
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,241
Give it to me.

543
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,909
Why?

544
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,744
But this one is mine.

545
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,662
It's bad luck.

546
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,512
How did you know I was here?

547
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,932
I have eyes on the back of my head, dear.

548
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,183
That's what moms need.

549
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,522
Do you think that lady
will come to get her money?

550
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,943
- Ae-sun.
- Hmm?

551
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,653
Did the woman see your face?

552
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,446
She did.

553
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,532
Tell me.

554
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,409
What's she look like?

555
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,495
Well, she had a pale face

556
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,330
and odd scratches on one wrist.

557
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,457
<i>Can you imagine your mother</i>
<i>not going after someone</i>

558
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,293
<i>who'd laid a hand on her child?</i>

559
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,718
Come see today's first catch!

560
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,137
Come take a look!
We'll give you a good rate.

561
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,973
Directly from <i>haenyeos. </i>Three for 50 hwan.

562
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,268
- Come on. It's a good deal.
- Fine. Give me one more. One more.

563
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,479
It's the price
for risking our lives diving for these.

564
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,190
Oh, forget it. I don't want it.

565
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,107
Goodness.

566
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,443
What are you doing?

567
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:38,946
Oh, enough!

568
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,950
Are you going to look at the wrist
of every woman in Jeju? Really?

569
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,499
You're driving all our customers away
by yanking their wrists.

570
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,044
Have you been here
trying to find the criminal?

571
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,838
That cow saw my daughter's face. Her face.

572
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,217
- I'm gonna get some conches.
- Ah.

573
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,927
Conch is basically free.

574
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,054
- Hurry up and eat.
- What's your price for these?

575
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,641
Well, how much are you offering?

576
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,978
Hey, I sent the boat away.

577
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,773
Why are you always after young girls?

578
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,067
Is there an age limit
on who can be a beggar?

579
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,820
If you touch it, you gotta buy it.

580
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,908
They get disobedient if they're too old.

581
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,993
We need kind and sweet children.

582
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,121
That one was exactly right.

583
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:30,873
Goodness.

584
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,458
What the hell?

585
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,877
You can check her wrist
after we sell her something.

586
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,837
This lady must've lost her mind.

587
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,090
What the hell is wrong with you?
Let her go!

588
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,136
What the hell? She's strong as a boar.

589
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,224
You piece of shit. Were you going to have
my daughter beg for money?

590
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,060
What? You bitch!

591
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,188
Get them!

592
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,398
Get those people!

593
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,400
Get those damn infidels!

594
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,943
Hey, get over here!

595
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,946
My daughter? How dare you!

596
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,993
You bitch!

597
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,581
<i>So what happened?</i>

598
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,046
<i>So she beat her to death,</i>
<i>obviously.</i>

599
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,756
<i>Beat her to death?</i>

600
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,385
<i>She and her partner</i>
<i>absolutely deserved to be beaten to death.</i>

601
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,971
Get away, you crazy!

602
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,472
Die, you bitch!

603
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,613
In those days,

604
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,241
there was no proper legal system
in this country,

605
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:53,289
so the police didn't say a lot
if you killed someone who deserved it.

606
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,043
If you take a man
who's practically dead to the station,

607
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,462
the police would just phone it in.

608
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,089
They actually used to
beat people to death.

609
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,677
It happened to be
the day of his ancestral rite.

610
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,307
Your mother said
your father saved you that day.

611
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,017
I disagree.

612
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,519
Your mother saved her child that day.

613
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,105
Nothing beats a mother's instinct.

614
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,149
Oh.

615
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,276
Mama's up late tonight.

616
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,278
She may forget some things,

617
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,698
but she doesn't forget the day
we celebrate her elder son.

618
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,951
Nothing beats a mother's instinct.

619
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,955
My mother once said to me…

620
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,793
<i>"…I have eyes on the back of my head."</i>

621
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,961
"That's what moms need."

622
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,431
<i>Hey.</i>

623
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,058
<i>You have a call.</i>

624
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,017
Okay.

625
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,189
My goodness.

626
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,317
Do people in Jeju not watch
<i>Eyes of Dawn </i>or what?

627
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,653
She always calls when this show's on.

628
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,364
Yeah, everything's fine.

629
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,201
Anyway, what could happen in a day?

630
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,162
EYES OF DAWN

631
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,083
Are you going to call me
every time you have a dream?

632
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,420
Why are you home so late every night?
Where are you going every evening?

633
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,463
You're acting kind of crazy.

634
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,716
<i>Did they fix that street light</i>
<i>in that nearby alley?</i>

635
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,011
<i>It's a scary world out there.</i>
<i>You need to be home early.</i>

636
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,555
<i>Sleep at home.</i>

637
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,224
Never outside.
'Cause I can feel it if you do.

638
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,102
Do you call each night
'cause you think I'll have too much fun?

639
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,771
<i>You're not dating anyone, are you?</i>

640
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,774
I won't be able to bear it
if you upset me too.

641
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,527
<i>You are your mom and dad's pride.</i>

642
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,822
<i>My hopes are all in you, so if the pillar</i>
<i>of this home starts doing reckless things…</i>

643
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,157
That damn pillar of the home.

644
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,578
Um, why's your hope all in me?

645
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,913
<i>Do you not have your own life?</i>

646
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,081
<i>Think about it.</i>

647
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,251
Even if I sleep somewhere else,
what can you do from over there?

648
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,504
<i>If I wanted to fool you,</i>
<i>I could do it a hundred times over, Mom.</i>

649
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,589
Well, that's wonderful.

650
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,383
<i>So stop worrying about it, okay?</i>

651
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,968
<i>Please.</i>

652
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,928
<i>You need to live your own life.</i>

653
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:18,017
Try having a child.
Try having a child that's just like you.

654
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,022
You wear those hairpins every day,
and I keep looking for them all the time.

655
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,192
Why do I bother buying them for you?
You keep losing them anyway.

656
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,945
Thinks she's better than everyone,
am I right?

657
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,992
I got these at the hardware store,
so I just bought a set.

658
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,080
Go visit her in Seoul
and install them yourself.

659
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,084
I bet she can do it herself
since she's all that,

660
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,754
and I'm the only one who's worried.

661
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,174
Babies are only children
until they leave the nest.

662
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,091
Jeez.

663
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,470
She may have grown into an adult now,

664
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,972
but I see her the same way I always have.

665
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,808
Is this about that dream?

666
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,896
What is this dream you keep having?

667
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,110
Why won't you say anything?
You still having nightmares?

668
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,114
It's not a nightmare. It's nothing much.

669
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,684
Oh, for goodness' sake.

670
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,396
I told you I'd give you candy
after your food was done, didn't I?

671
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,815
Give me a hug! Mommy!

672
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,358
<i>Give me a hug!</i>

673
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,111
Miss Oh! Miss Oh!
Geum-myeong is in trouble!

674
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,697
Is she bleeding? Tell me! Tell me!

675
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:57,468
Oh! I told you I'd give you candy
after your food was done.

676
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,219
- Mommy.
- Why don't you ever listen to Mommy?

677
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,929
<i>Mommy.</i>

678
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,437
Another nightmare?

679
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,862
What are you dreaming about these days?

680
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,786
I told you I'd give you candy
after your food was done.

681
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,372
- Ms. Oh!
- Is she bleeding? Tell me! Tell me!

682
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,620
Darling.

683
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,624
Look, my darling.

684
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,920
I'll get your sister,
and I'll be right back.

685
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,131
Okay?

686
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,095
I'll be right back.

687
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,686
When I return,

688
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,773
I'll give you candy every day.

689
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,066
Hmm?

690
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,738
<i>Mom has suffered</i>

691
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,158
<i>so many great losses.</i>

692
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,584
<i>Maybe that's why she worried more.</i>

693
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:41,089
<i>She believed that always being vigilant</i>
<i>could stop misfortunes from happening.</i>

694
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,008
Geum-myeong. Geum-myeong.

695
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,473
Honey?

696
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,433
Honey? Honey?

697
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,018
Honey?

698
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,854
Baby? Baby?

699
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,698
Oh God. Oh no. Oh God.

700
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,784
Oh, honey. Darling.

701
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,619
Honey. Oh God.

702
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,748
Help me.

703
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,417
Help!

704
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,837
Baby. Baby.

705
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,130
What's wrong with you?

706
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,091
Baby.

707
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,968
We need

708
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,804
to call the doctor.

709
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,643
Somebody.

710
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,604
Somebody, call the… the ambulance.

711
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,900
Call for an ambulance. Okay, Gwan-sik?

712
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,320
Why won't anyone call for the ambulance?

713
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,784
Geum-myeong. Geum-myeong.

714
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,202
Geum-myeong. Geum-myeong.

715
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,343
Help!

716
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,014
Help! Ambulance!

717
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,308
Call an ambulance! Somebody!

718
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,354
Baby!

719
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:49,384
Hey. Why… why did you just… just
walk in here like this, huh?

720
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,762
She's inhaled carbon monoxide.

721
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:52,679
Carbon monoxide!

722
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,349
Oh! Oh no!

723
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,475
Bongcheon.

724
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,645
Bongcheon 5-dong San-108.

725
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,021
108!

726
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,523
108! Yes!

727
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,652
No, no, you need to climb the stairs.

728
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,320
It's impossible to drive here.

729
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,905
Yes, yes.

730
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,121
<i>In a time</i>
<i>when kindness was hard to find…</i>

731
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,623
Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.

732
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,249
Baby.

733
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,252
Baby. Mom's right here. Right here.

734
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,590
<i>…when all three major unsolved</i>
<i>crime cases took place in Korea,</i>

735
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,886
<i>Mom called me every night</i>
<i>after the nine o'clock news was over.</i>

736
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,930
Here! We're here! Right here!

737
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,348
<i>Her nerves would annoy me.</i>

738
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,432
Here!

739
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,351
Here, here! Sir!

740
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:43,105
<i>But it was her nerves</i>
<i>that saved me that day.</i>

741
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,239
It's so quiet.

742
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,331
Honey.

743
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,583
Oh, my dear.

744
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,585
Baby.Oh!

745
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,631
Are you okay? Oh, goodness.

746
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,051
<i>Just like that,</i>
<i>she's saved me countless times.</i>

747
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,193
Oh. Oh my!

748
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,949
Oh no. Honey! Hey, babe!

749
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,409
Oh! Oh!

750
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,209
You better treat your parents
well when you grow up.

751
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,377
If you're so much trouble,

752
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,338
I hope it's because
you're gonna accomplish big things.

753
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,506
Will it leave a scar?

754
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,216
You're worried about her scar?

755
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,177
She's lucky it's not worse.

756
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,306
Who would believe that her dad caught her
when she fell off the roof?

757
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,516
- Mom.
- Oh.

758
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,852
- Dad.
- Oh my.

759
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,606
Why was she on the roof anyway?

760
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,358
She was a magpie, she kept saying.

761
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,319
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

762
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,571
Mm-hmm. Oh.

763
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,240
Oh, you got stitches.

764
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,035
It must hurt so much.
You sweet little thing.

765
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,996
<i>Many moons later,</i>

766
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,249
<i>when I could no longer</i>
<i>speak to her on the phone,</i>

767
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,419
<i>I missed hearing her nervous voice.</i>

768
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,298
I'm so sorry. Mm?

769
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,092
Sorry, honey.

770
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,718
Sorry.

771
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,347
It's okay. It's okay.

772
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,600
<i>Her heart sank</i>
<i>countless times.</i>

773
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,395
<i>I wish I could've shown her</i>
<i>how much I appreciated her.</i>

774
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,025
<i>When it's already too late,</i>
<i>regret catches up with us.</i>

775
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:50,287
"JUST GET READY AND GO,
RIDE THE MOMENT WITH ALL YOU HAVE."
