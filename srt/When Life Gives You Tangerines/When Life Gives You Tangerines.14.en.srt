00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:20,121
How could he think of running away
after blaming his friend for everything?

3
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,211
He planned to take everything and run.
That's why he opened the pawnshop.

4
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,464
You think I didn't like him
'cause he was bottom of the class?

5
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,718
When he was ten, he came to our house
and stole your dad's washer fluid.

6
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,719
My washer fluid?

7
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,138
- Why would he?
- God knows why.

8
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,891
He just stole
whatever he could get his hands on.

9
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,351
He came with empty pockets,

10
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,561
but every time he said goodbye and left,

11
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,730
his pockets were always so stuffed!

12
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:50,026
What's the point of saying that?
The issue now is the <i>buncheong </i>stoneware.

13
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,986
That woman is such a liar,

14
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,615
claiming it was appraised for 70 million
on <i>Authentic Masterpieces.</i>

15
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,075
Seventy…

16
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,452
Seventy million won?

17
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,247
Why leave her <i>buncheong </i>stoneware
at a tiny pawnshop?

18
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,873
Oh my goodness.

19
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,752
Why did you do it? Why?

20
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,548
Why did it have to be with Cheol-yong?
And why a pawnshop?

21
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,300
Is it a pawnshop's fault?
Blame the IMF crisis.

22
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,262
They're handing out credit cards
and cash advances,

23
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,556
so who the hell would come to a pawnshop?

24
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,226
That's not all. Gold collection.
That goddamn gold collection campaign!

25
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,937
With the country throwing
a one-two punch at me, how can I--

26
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,189
Should they not even collect gold
for your sake?

27
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,486
You wanted to strike gold and look cool.
And now, none of this is your fault?

28
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,698
You should live within your means.

29
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,701
You took out a loan for the pawnshop.
That damn lucky strike!

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,578
I did it so I wouldn't live like you.

31
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,248
I hate the idea
of living within your means.

32
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,334
You always reeked of cooling patches,
but what did you do for me?

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,377
Yang Eun-myeong!

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,964
What have you ever done for me?
You've always had your favorite.

35
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,551
Be honest. Have you two ever told me
that I'm the best?

36
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:01,431
To Geum-myeong, you always say,
"You do everything well."

37
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,602
Did you ever say that to me?
Why do I always go on about money?

38
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,479
What else can I beat Geum-myeong in?

39
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,356
I did it for you to notice.

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,859
Just so you'd look at me. Okay?

41
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,285
Why can't I have a birthday party?

42
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,038
You threw one for Geum-myeong.
What about me?

43
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,664
Eun-myeong.

44
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:27,999
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,378
I just have such a bad headache right now.

46
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,714
Get up.

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,216
Make me rice cakes!

48
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,884
I want rice cakes too!

49
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,761
Come here, Eun-myeong!

50
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,645
Your brother passed away
three days after your birthday.

51
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,563
Just accept living without a birthday.

52
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,858
You're the eldest son
who should soothe your parents.

53
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,027
You have to live
for you and your brother now.

54
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,821
Otherwise, your mother can't go on.

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,574
But that's not fair!

56
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,328
I don't want to!

57
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,165
I don't want to!

58
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,251
Eun-myeong, come out here.

59
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,004
YANG GEUM-MYEONG
DAILY SCHEDULE

60
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,385
What in the world are you drawing?

61
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,511
Just watch.

62
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,012
YANG EUN-MYEONG
SPELLING TEST

63
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,810
Mom and Dad have a huge hole
in their hearts because of Dong-myeong.

64
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,395
How can anyone live like that?

65
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,192
It needs to be filled for them to live.
So what should we do?

66
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,403
Stop asking me and just say it.

67
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,115
You get a "Well done" stamp
for doing your homework well, right?

68
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:43,992
Look at this.

69
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,746
We have to stamp it countless times
with a tiny stamp.

70
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,166
We have to keep stamping
every day to fill it up.

71
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,504
So they can go on.

72
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,090
You understand?

73
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,635
You're the know-it-all.
What am I supposed to do?

74
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,429
"Know-it-all"?

75
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,725
YANG GWAN-SIK

76
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,519
Look at this. Look at what I got.

77
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,317
Wow. It went up by ten.

78
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,528
I got one wrong on home economics.

79
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,905
The teacher made the test question weird.

80
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,576
One? One question out of all subjects?

81
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,638
What am I, a dog?

82
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,724
I only get leftovers?

83
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,478
Dad and your sister
have to take packed lunches.

84
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,773
I want more pork cutlets.
Fry me a new one.

85
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,692
Your sister's picky about food
and has exams.

86
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,612
And Dad's work is very tiring.

87
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,660
What's wrong with you?

88
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,412
Have you hit puberty already?

89
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,921
Goodness.

90
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,634
Kang Ho-dong's mom must have no regrets.

91
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,929
If a mother had a son
who brought home a golden calf,

92
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,681
what's left to wish for?

93
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,769
A golden calf is all you need?
You'd want nothing else if you had one?

94
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,606
Mom, just follow me.

95
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,692
If you stay by my side,
the least you'll get is a golden calf.

96
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,277
I'm gonna buy you a Mercedes.

97
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:51,452
I'll stop Dad from sailing his boat
and make you quit your street stall.

98
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,288
It will be me, not Geum-myeong!

99
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,917
When's that ever gonna happen?

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,630
If you won a golden calf for me,

101
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,176
I could just go all around Hallasan
dancing and bragging.

102
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,721
Goodness. You're such a windbag!

103
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,141
Where did you get that from?

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,605
Your sister just got things done
without saying a word.

105
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:35,246
<i>Carelessly-spoken dry words</i>
<i>made Eun-myeong grow up hungry.</i>

106
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,374
<i>Favoritism is really unfair.</i>

107
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,627
It's better not to love at all.

108
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,589
Giving less love is so unfair.

109
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,341
It stops a child from growing.

110
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,761
<i>Mom's long-standing fear had come true.</i>

111
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,851
Aren't you scared?

112
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,229
Of course I am.

113
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,565
I still can't believe it.

114
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,320
How is this thing going to come out of me?

115
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,448
But

116
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,493
what's scarier than giving birth

117
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,245
is what happens afterward.

118
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,665
Why's that?

119
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,210
Well,

120
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,922
they say experience is the best teacher,

121
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,924
but I don't know much.

122
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,344
I haven't had much to learn from.

123
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,306
Worried you won't know how to be a mom?

124
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,267
What do I do for them
when they hit puberty?

125
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,354
What if they're a bit of a punk?

126
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,523
Are you that worried about it?

127
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,485
To be honest, what I fear the most…

128
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,450
is that I might hurt them
because I don't know how to be a mom.

129
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,327
That scares me the most.

130
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,374
This tiny thing is coming into the world,
trusting only me.

131
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,502
I can't scar the baby's life.

132
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,674
You won't scar their life.

133
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,762
You couldn't even if you wanted to.

134
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,558
The truth is…

135
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,979
I want to be a really good mom.

136
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,481
A really good one!

137
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,778
Do you know why I named my son Che-il?

138
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,739
It means "number one,"
something I've never been.

139
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,534
Never.

140
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,121
That's how you two raised me.

141
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,341
What about your mom?
You think she was ever number one?

142
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:57,471
That pork cutlet you were so hung up on.
How many do you think your mom got to eat?

143
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,098
Go.

144
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,017
- You darned…
- Step out for a bit.

145
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,894
You darned… foolish idiot.

146
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,354
Don't get me out of here.

147
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,150
Your darned, ungrateful son
will pay his debt using his own back.

148
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,320
Have it your way! What an honorable son!

149
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,949
Father.

150
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,118
Dad!

151
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,661
Kick her out.

152
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,456
Kick her out!

153
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,249
Give me some money.

154
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,376
Please give me some money!

155
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,003
Do I owe you money or something?

156
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,963
I know there's my share.

157
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,174
Think of it
as giving me my inheritance now!

158
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,508
Am I already dead to you?

159
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,678
What am I supposed to do?

160
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,264
You want me to be a prisoner's wife?

161
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,767
You want Che-il to be a criminal's son?

162
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,812
Tell them to catch the real criminal.
If he's innocent, why pay for him?

163
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,943
Eun-myeong really didn't do
anything wrong!

164
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,530
He did it so we could live a better life!

165
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,240
If he's innocent, he'll get out.

166
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,331
So money comes before me?

167
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,667
Of course it does. A hundred times over.

168
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,462
Have you ever done anything
to be a good daughter?

169
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,885
Did you ever make me a boat captain
or chief of the co-op?

170
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,055
Money does it all.
It's the real filial duty!

171
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,850
You think being a child
is some kind of privilege?

172
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,730
I don't need a child
who never listens to me either!

173
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,821
Dad, do you know
what I envy most about my sister-in-law?

174
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,365
Having a father like hers.

175
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,078
With my fate, even if I were reborn,
I could never have a dad like hers.

176
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,957
She has a heart
like a fancy car with a big engine.

177
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,252
But your daughter's
not even worth a wagon.

178
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,304
Yeah, same here!

179
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,392
It's only 70 million.
Is it such a big deal?

180
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,271
"Only 70 million"?

181
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,233
Hey, have you even earned 100 won?

182
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,528
Respect, gratitude,

183
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,698
and affection for one's parents.

184
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,077
Even ten billion wouldn't be enough
to buy these things.

185
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,414
No money can pull out

186
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,084
the peg you drive into your child's heart.

187
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,086
You think you're the only one who thinks?

188
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,466
I think too. I think way ahead of you!

189
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,051
The ship you treasure
more than your own child

190
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,846
got its price tag
right after it was made, right?

191
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,642
But a person's worth
is only determined after they die.

192
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,522
Starting tonight,
you can spend sleepless nights

193
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,693
in fear of how much your life
will truly be worth.

194
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,492
AUNTIES' SEAFOOD HOUSE

195
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,745
CHEOL-YONG SALON

196
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,705
Go ahead and take my life.

197
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,418
Even if you beat me to death,
I don't know where Cheol-yong is.

198
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,921
You won't find a single cent
even if you cut me open.

199
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,381
That <i>buncheong </i>was worth 70 million won!

200
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,427
Why should her son pay
for what your son ran off with?

201
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,805
My son is also a victim in a way.

202
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,932
Look at her running her damn mouth!

203
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:33,103
My good kid trusted a snake
and got bitten.

204
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,398
You can tell just by looking
at Eun-myeong's nasty hairstyle.

205
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,776
Who's been messing with his hair
all those years?

206
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,278
His bad influence rubbed off on my son.

207
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,989
He's gone and ruined my son's future too.

208
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,243
Ae-sun, aren't you going to say anything?

209
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,787
We can't fight for you forever!

210
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,251
You're colluding with him, aren't you?

211
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,755
If you find out where my son is,
please let me know.

212
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,759
I have to change the name of the shop
thanks to my wonderful son.

213
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,016
Did Cheol-yong sell
the <i>buncheong </i>stoneware

214
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,688
to buy you this television
and that gold ring?

215
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,232
Got any evidence?

216
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,568
Bring me the evidence.

217
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,570
Now that I see you like this,

218
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,947
I get why Cheol-yong turned out
so horribly!

219
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,199
Did Eun-myeong end up in prison

220
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,244
because he takes after
his high-school-dropout mom?

221
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,163
He just turned out as he was meant to.

222
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,838
What the hell?

223
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,424
You pea-brained bitch!

224
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,717
Let go now!

225
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,720
There are three of us! Damn you!

226
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,690
- Chip in!
- Let go first!

227
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,983
You chip in too!

228
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,653
If you make someone cry blood,
at least act like you'll pay it back!

229
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,532
Ae-sun, why don't you
let her go first and…

230
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,037
When your son gets taken away,
you go into a blind rage!

231
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,789
I don't care about anything right now!

232
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,707
Got it?

233
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,794
She's indeed Gwang-rye's daughter.

234
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,017
<i>Mom grabbed someone by the hair</i>
<i>for the first time in her life.</i>

235
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,191
You'd lose to her now.

236
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,902
That was some technique, huh?

237
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:49,073
She grabbed her hair and twisted her body,
like some <i>ssireum </i>technique.

238
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,909
They say moms grow stronger over time

239
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,328
while dads grow more fragile.

240
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,456
- That Steelheart?
- Yeah.

241
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,712
<i>Dad also went to do something</i>
<i>for the first time in his life.</i>

242
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,643
Didn't I tell you to invest in a place
while they were building in Seogwipo?

243
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,730
Your son was always going on
about lucky strikes.

244
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,651
Stay and hang out for a bit.

245
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,654
Goddamn IMF crisis. Seriously.

246
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,991
I have to do my own deliveries these days.

247
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,367
- Hey!
- Sir.

248
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:34,994
Could you maybe

249
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,121
lend me…

250
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,001
You've known me for a long time.

251
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,627
I never take a day off.

252
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,296
I'll catch all the fish in the sea
so that I can--

253
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,674
Captain Yang, you're not young anymore.

254
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:53,137
Your knees get so sore in bad weather,
you can't even pull in your nets alone.

255
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,096
Sir.

256
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,348
Everyone knows me
as a great fisherman, and--

257
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,684
The world has changed.

258
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,981
They're sweeping up fish
with trawlers the size of a house.

259
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:08,235
But you're still old-fashioned,
letting all the small, borderline fish go.

260
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,613
You're the best at following spawning
and closed fishing seasons in Jeju.

261
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,117
Who on earth makes money like that?
Have you made a lot, Captain Yang?

262
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:16,910
Sir.

263
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,621
I'll pay you back.

264
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,249
I'll pay you back,
be it with fish or my body.

265
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,877
Good grief, just get the idea already!

266
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,421
You're really making me uncomfortable.

267
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,173
Just go! Leave.

268
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,926
The whole port is avoiding you,
Captain Yang.

269
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:38,682
How did such an upstanding, reserved man
end up like that?

270
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,518
Parents bear the burden of their kids.

271
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,732
My son just turned 26.

272
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,862
To me, he's like my crooked finger.

273
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,447
and I…

274
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,449
I…

275
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,661
can't just give up and leave.

AUGUST 18, TYPHOON CARMEN

281
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,887
<i>Dad returned to sea after just three days,</i>
<i>even after sending Dong-myeong off.</i>

282
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,768
<i>In the end, Dad sold 20 years of his life,</i>

283
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:53,358
<i>which carries the three of us</i>
<i>and which he could never part with.</i>

284
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,861
<i>He sold Geumeundong, his boat.</i>

M.F.L.

286
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,215
Erase the moth. Why did you draw it here?

287
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,257
It's a butterfly.

288
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,638
Write a poem for me too.

289
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,265
Titled "Yang Gwan-sik."

290
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,478
Why would I?

291
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,826
<i>"M.F.L."</i>

292
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,622
<i>by Oh Ae-sun from class 1-5</i>
<i>of Dodong Girls' High.</i>

293
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,418
<i>When it's around, it's annoying</i>
<i>When it's not, I'm curious</i>

294
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,836
Why read it so many times?

295
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,840
<i>When I tease it, it's fine</i>
<i>When others do, I get mad</i>

296
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,972
<i>With eyes open, I pretend not to see</i>
<i>With eyes closed, its image comes to me</i>

297
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,225
<i>Unnoticed, like the sea I see every day</i>

298
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,478
<i>Yet without it,</i>
<i>I'm alone in the vast world</i>

299
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,148
<i>Like candy hidden in my mouth</i>

300
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,943
<i>Its sweetness overflows all around</i>

301
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,237
<i>Is this it</i>

302
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,990
<i>Is this it</i>

303
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,617
<i>Is that why</i>

304
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,870
<i>My heart stays in spring every day</i>

305
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,293
I told you to read it at home, didn't I?

306
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,681
My first love.

307
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,560
It means "My First Love," right?

308
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,312
I know it does.

309
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,149
Who said it was you? Who said so?

310
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,113
Hey!

311
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,241
You think just because we did it once,
you can keep doing it?

312
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,076
- God.
- I can't?

313
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,997
I can't do that?

314
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,794
No questions!

315
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,630
No more questions from you.

316
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,161
"Spring every day," my foot.

317
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,955
It's not spring at all.

318
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,043
It's not spring at all.

319
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,969
<i>The boy's hands now made</i>
<i>the rustling sounds of winter branches.</i>

320
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,721
- Yeah, this is our boat.
- Our boat.

321
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,098
Daddy's boat.

322
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,015
Daddy's boat.

323
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,851
- Hello.
- Were you inside?

324
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,437
You'll wear out the boat by staring.

325
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,941
My wife kept saying
she wanted to see our boat again.

326
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,692
You said you wanted to see it too.

327
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,860
No, I didn't.

328
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,990
Daddy!

329
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,618
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

330
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,870
Hi.

331
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,623
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

332
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,250
- Did you catch a lot?
- Daddy!

333
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,503
- Daddy! Hurry!
- Daddy!

334
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,049
Have you decided on the boat name?

335
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,885
You'll feel more fond of it
after you've named it.

336
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,637
Well,

337
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,431
it's Eunyeong.

338
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,100
So you must be Eun-yeong.

339
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,519
That's great. That's so great.

340
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,063
Geum-myeong, Eun-myeong…

341
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,484
and Dong-myeong grew up
thanks to this boat,

342
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,403
so it will do the same for her.

343
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,487
Thank you.

344
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,451
Oh my.

345
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,124
Wow, this is the boat's full history!

346
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,922
These are from the last three years,
but if you need them…

347
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,176
They are all old-fashioned,
so I don't know if they'll be helpful.

348
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,594
FISHING LOG

349
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,762
Is it really okay for me to have these?

350
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,973
I don't think
I'll be a boat captain again.

351
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,768
Well, we'd be really grateful. Truly.

352
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,814
- Eun-yeong, say, "Thank you."
- Thank you, sir.

353
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,358
Yes, thank you as well.

354
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,818
Thank you.

355
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,488
<i>We were the only ones who didn't know.</i>

356
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,910
<i>We never knew that the time Dad spent</i>
<i>at sea flew by in a heartbeat.</i>

357
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,040
At least you're out.
That's all that matters.

358
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,709
Wait, I'm asking how you came up
with the money.

359
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,795
- You sold the apartment?
- Let's go.

360
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,880
You sold the boat?

361
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,593
You did, right?

362
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,388
Damn it.

363
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,648
Don't cry.

364
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,942
If you cry,
it will make your father cry too.

365
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,694
He will cry countless times in his heart.

366
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,530
Why would you sell the boat?

367
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,616
Why would you do that for me? Damn it!

368
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,246
We sold it because you're our number one!
Why wouldn't you be?

369
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,333
<i>A child may abandon sick parents,</i>
<i>but not the other way around.</i>

370
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,002
I hate this. Seriously.

371
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,756
I really hate this!

372
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,467
How could we not get you out?

373
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,469
How could we leave you in there?

374
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,555
<i>A bucket that's always filled to the brim,</i>

375
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,140
<i>no matter how many leaking holes it has.</i>

376
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,602
<i>That's something Eun-myeong already had.</i>

377
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,814
You can resent me,
but don't do that to your father.

378
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,025
Do you know
that your father eats five meals a day?

379
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,904
His work was so hard
that he ate five meals a day all his life.

380
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,241
He wouldn't have to live like that
if not for you guys.

381
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,161
You can resent me,
but how can you resent him?

382
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,079
Don't.

383
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,414
If you do,

384
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,041
your father's efforts
would've been in vain.

385
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,043
So what's he doing now?

386
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,423
If he doesn't catch fish,
what are you going to sell?

387
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,509
You just worry about yourself, okay?

388
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,803
Whatever I do,

389
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,097
I do well now.

390
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,017
<i>The Literary Girl has changed.</i>

391
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,900
Not there, ma'am. Over here.

392
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,944
Let me fillet your squid.

393
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,530
See how fresh the squid is at this time.

394
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,534
I'll fillet it perfectly for you.

395
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,330
Only 2,000 won for 20
and 3,000 won for 40!

396
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,874
Just bring them over to me.

397
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,917
I'll fillet them for you!

398
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:12,088
<i>The girl who said 50 won for one cabbage</i>
<i>and 150 for three, no matter what,</i>

399
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,006
<i>has changed.</i>

400
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,133
Hey! Are you the only one working here?

401
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,552
If you keep slashing prices,
you will doom us all!

402
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,473
Ma'am, you bought some squid?
Let me fillet them for you.

403
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,099
I'll fillet them perfectly.

404
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,102
Excuse me, ma'am.
What are you doing over there?

405
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,103
I'm right here.

406
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,439
Now you're stealing
other people's customers?

407
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,524
You stole them, not me!

408
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,653
Ma'am, who did you come here to see?

409
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,156
Well, my mother-in-law told me
to go with the pretty lady.

410
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,241
Then who would it be?

411
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,412
Which one would it be?

412
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,582
Hey! It could be me!

413
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:53,380
<i>The Literary Girl evolved</i>
<i>like Squirtle evolved into Blastoise.</i>

414
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,464
Come on.

415
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,382
Goodness!

416
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,552
All right. Let's fillet them.

417
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,063
Wow, you have fast hands.

418
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,858
When I was your age,
I couldn't do anything like this at all.

419
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,860
You liar.

420
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,071
How can a fisherman's wife
not fillet squid?

421
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,074
My husband used to do it all for me.

422
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,535
He didn't want me to get hurt
or be scared.

423
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,370
Here's Oh Ae-sun's brag, verse one.

424
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:30,375
My husband keeps begging me
not to do stuff like this.

425
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,752
I just do it for fun.
Why waste time doing nothing?

426
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,047
My husband's a boat captain, you see.

427
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,383
Is he still a captain?

428
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,469
Tell her what he does now. Go on.

429
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,221
What does he do now?

430
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,558
Hang on.

431
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,686
It's my daughter.
She went to Seoul National University.

432
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,355
She always calls me around mealtime.

433
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,525
Hi, sweetie!

434
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,445
You wanna make sure
that I'm eating every day?

435
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,322
Here comes the second verse
of Ae-sun's brag.

436
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,950
<i>The children's phone calls</i>
<i>at every meal time</i>

437
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,910
<i>were a source of power between them.</i>

438
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,956
Goodness, I don't need a checkup!

439
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,667
No, don't bother.

440
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,839
I love you too. Take care.

441
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:22,510
Hey, I bet she didn't say she loves you.
You're just saying that, aren't you?

442
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,725
<i>The less she had, the more she bragged.</i>

443
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,937
Hey, there goes your boat captain.

444
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,063
There he goes.

445
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,693
<i>I think that's how</i>
<i>Mom protected her own heart.</i>

446
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,905
Whatever. None of them ever get calls.

447
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:47,577
It's only my kids who are always calling
to ask if I ate or what I ate.

448
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,996
They're just jealous.

449
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,999
You should change the candle right away
if the flame weakens.

450
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,001
It will be cold.

451
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,300
They don't even know the law
and think a holding cell is a prison.

452
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:06,221
That damn Mi-suk clearly knows about it,
but she keeps asking,

453
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,348
"Why aren't you talking about your son?"

454
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,974
"What is he up to?"

455
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,101
What nonsense. Damn bitch.

456
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,981
No matter how much my life has shrunk,

457
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,901
it's better than flirting
with others' men.

458
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,444
Has your life shrunk?

459
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,781
Of course not.

460
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,741
I'm just saying.

461
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,786
That's not what I meant.

462
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,830
Everyone here is envious of me.

463
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,042
Should I buy you a good cream?
An expensive one?

464
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Why?

465
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,505
It looks like I put on blush.
Cute, isn't it?

466
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,842
They call me the pretty one here.

467
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,306
Oh man.

468
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,685
Why is life like this…

469
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,562
Why is it like this?

470
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,153
What's wrong?

471
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,406
Are you getting old?

472
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,243
Why do you keep getting more tearful?

473
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,831
How could I make you sit here like this?

474
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,207
Oh man.

475
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,627
I couldn't even fulfill
any of your three wishes.

476
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,630
I robbed you of your life.

477
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,596
So what if you know what "nostalgia" is?

478
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,848
What about college?

479
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,225
What about becoming a poet?

480
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,685
What about the mainland?

481
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,605
I can't give you everything.

482
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,650
But one thing I will do for you,
no matter what.

483
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,611
Come on.

484
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,990
Can't you at least just say
you'll give me everything?

485
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,702
Just tell me you will give me
the moon and the stars!

486
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,172
You should've said no
when I was chasing you.

487
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,050
You shouldn't have lived with me.

488
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:13,389
Without you, I'd truly be an orphan
with no one in this world.

489
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,142
Without Yang Gwan-sik,

490
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,312
Oh Ae-sun couldn't have lived her life
as a coy girl.

491
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,148
Should I teach that damn Mi-suk a lesson?

492
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,035
Why are you aging on the outside
but not on the inside?

493
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,622
How come your heart never changes?
It's so annoying.

494
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,214
CHARMZONE CONTROL CREAM

495
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,882
Lucky you, Hyeon-suk.

496
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,719
My father-in-law
has never given me any cream.

497
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,433
I've noticed
you haven't been dressing up much

498
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,061
or wearing your hair all curly lately.

499
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,938
Why don't you go get a perm?

500
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,773
Perms are expensive.

501
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,320
Read this for me.

502
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,530
- What?
- This book.

503
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,031
Right. Okay.

504
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,249
Are you guys the only ones eating here?

505
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,417
Come on.

506
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,877
You know his father loves rolled omelets.

507
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,797
How can you hide two-thirds of it?

508
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,798
Goodness me.

509
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,469
Tell Eun-myeong to come home
and join us when we eat

510
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,763
instead of making us set the table twice.

511
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,934
How much damn booze does he chug
to be knocked out until late morning?

512
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,479
Mother, I'm hurt!

513
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,109
I'm not going to eat.

514
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,372
We have a daughter-in-law
who's just like our daughter.

515
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,385
Why aren't you asleep?
We can put Che-il to bed.

516
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,558
You guys should have it.

517
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,728
You're sitting down?

518
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,271
To drink too?

519
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,441
You already know I like to drink.

520
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,362
I was just looking for the hammer,

521
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,116
but I found the acorns
my daughter-in-law squirreled away.

522
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,245
Who buys a box of beer
for their daughter-in-law?

523
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,958
It's not easy to live with strangers

524
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,836
after eating your mom's cooking
for 20 years, is it?

525
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,715
Honestly, I don't think living
with the in-laws is that difficult.

526
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,634
Huh?

527
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,512
I see.

528
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,556
Actually…

529
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,187
I'm so stressed out because of Eun-myeong.

530
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,026
What about him?
Is that punk causing trouble again?

531
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,157
Father, you don't know
what your son's been up to, do you?

532
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,754
- Stop going to the ping-pong club.
- Who are you to tell me to go or not?

533
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,176
People say Bu Sang-gil is the only one
playing in a mixed doubles team.

534
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:22,221
Mixed doubles is a sport too.
Hyun Jung-hwa, Yoo Nam-kyu!

535
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,848
Are you lonely or something?

536
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,602
Lonely, my ass. Damn it.

537
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,646
I'm the boss in my house!

538
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:35,026
Come on, you don't have to act
like the boss all the time.

539
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,110
Everyone avoids me.

540
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,451
You can touch him, you know.

541
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,168
Is this how
having a first grandchild feels?

542
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:56,005
He's a spitting image of his dad.

543
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,215
Of his mother.

544
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,802
Of his mother.

545
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,512
Fine.

546
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,723
Let me know
if you want to see your grandson.

547
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,308
I'll arrange it secretly for you.

548
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,270
You want something from me, mister?

549
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,147
"Mister"?

550
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,943
You don't call me "Hey, you" anymore.

551
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,445
What's the father of a daughter to do?

552
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,572
I know how you feel.

553
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,159
You think your son-in-law is a thief too?

554
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,287
Wearing a love charity badge
makes you great?

555
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,206
Try to show some love at home too.

556
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,583
Then you won't go play ping-pong
on New Year.

557
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,554
The tangerine field is yours.

558
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,142
Accept it as payment
for cleaning up after me.

559
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,189
While your father-in-law was alive…

560
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,444
he never went to see
the camellia flowers in winter.

561
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,490
When the canola flowers bloomed
in the west of Jeju,

562
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,367
he'd go east to enjoy himself.

563
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,954
When the camellia flowers bloomed
in the east,

564
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,831
he'd go west to enjoy himself.

565
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,042
That's what philandering is like.

566
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,463
He knew other people also
saw his actions as shameful.

567
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,468
He kept up those antics
until he kicked the bucket,

568
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,804
but I didn't know how else to survive,

569
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,515
so I just put up with it.

570
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,520
I bottled it up, and in the end,
it took a toll on my health.

571
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,230
Mother.

572
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,858
Why are you doing this?

573
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,651
What am I supposed to do?

574
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,070
The tangerine field is yours.

575
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,614
Do what you want with it.

576
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,208
You're out looking
for a lucky strike again, aren't you?

577
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,169
Seriously, that punk.

578
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:08,262
Dong-jin's brother got out of the army,
so the boys are hanging out.

579
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,348
I'll be home early.

580
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,395
When do I ever drink milk?
I'll have diarrhea.

581
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,948
We should stop him right away.

582
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,244
If he causes trouble again,
there's nothing left for us to sell!

583
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,164
All kids act up sometimes.

584
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,667
But even a conch with spikes is valuable.

585
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,965
Let's see. There.

586
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,009
There you are. Good.

587
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,809
You know,

588
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,895
Hong-nam's big brother Hong-sik
opened a shop.

589
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,316
Is this really the time to worry
about Hong-sik, Hong-nam's older brother?

590
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,485
How late will you stay out?

591
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,947
I don't want it.

592
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,325
They're hot. These chestnuts are hot.

593
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,244
Hey, I don't even like chestnuts.

594
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,079
It's what you like.

595
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,378
It's below zero today.
Don't stay out for too long.

596
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,281
<i>The words he used to tune out every night…</i>

597
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,741
Sticky rice cakes.

598
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,871
Buckwheat jelly.

599
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:02,001
<i>…could not be shaken off</i>
<i>now that they were said by his own child.</i>

600
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,086
Sticky rice cakes!

601
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,883
Buckwheat jelly!

602
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,515
Sticky rice cakes!

603
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,186
Buckwheat jelly!

604
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,439
<i>No one sells sticky rice cakes</i>
<i>here now, right?</i>

605
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,567
That's because Eun-myeong's doing it now.

606
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,488
Even if he tries to get a job,
no one will hire him

607
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,156
because he's been to jail.

608
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,367
They all rejected him and called him
a deadbeat who steals money.

609
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,830
He goes out in this cold weather
and wanders around for six or seven hours.

610
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,458
I hate it.

611
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,919
I hate it so much.

612
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,717
Father, for the time being,
could you feed three more people?

613
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,013
Our Che-il will eat almost less
than a half portion anyway.

614
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,101
The other day, some drunkard
kicked the rice cake box.

615
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,562
Someone called him up to the fifth floor,

616
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,441
bought one portion of buckwheat jelly,
and asked him to take out their trash.

617
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,986
He has to. He has to do something.

618
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,405
He's the head of his household.

619
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,159
<i>Although that's what he told her…</i>

620
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,370
Just tell him he's doing well.

621
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,955
Let him know.

622
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,753
<i>…a wall of Dad's heart</i>
<i>silently crumbled to pieces.</i>

623
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,047
How can I tell him he's doing well?

624
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,511
<i>Eun-myeong can't stand that kind of work.</i>

625
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,304
<i>You know it too!</i>

626
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,685
Seriously, damn it!

627
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,273
<i>The number of suicides this past year</i>
<i>has reached record numbers.</i>

628
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,067
<i>More heads of households</i>
<i>are taking their own lives</i>

629
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,152
<i>due to job loss or financial struggles.</i>

630
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,988
Dad.

631
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,741
Dad, please find Eun-myeong!

632
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,619
If you don't find him, I'll take my life!

633
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,329
I'll take my own life too!

634
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,539
Where are you off again?

635
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,665
He's on a boat.

636
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,042
He's on a boat! Mi-suk saw him!

637
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,502
The deep-sea fishing boat?

638
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,392
Not the sea!

639
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,228
Don't let him go out to sea!

640
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,358
You'll bring Eun-myeong back, won't you?

641
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,902
You'll bring him back, won't you?

642
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:23,619
<i>You know how much it is to fuel this boat?</i>
<i>Who are you to tell me to turn?</i>

643
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,579
Please turn the boat just this once!

644
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,040
I'll pay for the gas as well!

645
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,752
<i>Time is money, too, isn't it?</i>
<i>Stop talking nonsense.</i>

646
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,755
<i>For fuck's sake. Hang up now!</i>

647
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,632
This is Bu Sang-gil from Dodong-ri.

648
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,592
<i>Bu Sang-gil, my ass!</i>

649
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,010
<i>Off to a shitty start.</i>

650
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:40,928
Double.

651
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,974
I said double!

652
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,059
Goddamn it!

653
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,186
I said double, and you won't back down?

654
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,491
Did you raise your son in a bubble?

655
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,368
All he did was throw up.

656
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:08,330
- Thank you.
- Were you on a passenger ferry or what?!

657
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,624
What, you turned it back for free?

658
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,459
Acting all goddamn generous.

659
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,671
Why cause all this fuss
by letting a young boy get on the boat?

660
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,755
Lower the price!

661
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,382
Lower what price?

662
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,259
- It's a done deal.
- Why, you…

663
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,637
You have any idea how hard it is?
People die so easily.

664
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,640
People drown, get caught in net haulers,
killed by ropes, lose hands.

665
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,892
Everyone runs away from it!

666
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,520
That's how hard it is!

667
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,898
Why would you do something so deadly?

668
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,527
If it's that hard,

669
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,946
how did you manage?

670
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,247
Let's go.

671
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,959
- Mom can't go on if you go to sea.
- But you did it all!

672
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,962
No matter how hard it was, you did it!

673
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,466
Did someone say
you make a fortune on that boat?

674
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,884
You after the lucky strike?

675
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,138
I wanted to get your boat back.

676
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,100
I don't need my boat back.

677
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,103
Just don't get on a boat.
Do something else.

678
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,148
If I do something else,
are you gonna buy everything again?

679
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:25,324
You know what people said to me
when I was selling sticky rice cakes?

680
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,328
Here are two more.

681
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,625
I don't need change.

682
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,419
- Sorry?
- Listen, kid.

683
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,837
Be good to your father.

684
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,172
Be good to him.

685
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,056
I'm really not hungry.

686
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,935
I don't really like
these kinds of emergency crops.

687
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,562
You be good to your father. Be good.

688
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,237
Four packets at this hour?

689
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,905
I don't know. I was told to.

690
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,240
By your mom?

691
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,908
Oh, and I was told to tell you--

692
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,284
To be good to my father?

693
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,791
<i>Are they paying for Christmas seals?</i>

694
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,544
<i>Are my sticky rice cakes</i>
<i>like a charity badge?</i>

695
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,088
Seriously, damn it.

696
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,426
How much is this? Damn it.

697
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:32,057
<i>Everyone buying rice cakes from me</i>
<i>tells me to be good to you!</i>

698
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,726
<i>You planned this with my father-in-law!</i>

699
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,520
He gave everyone a 5,000-won bill.

700
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,565
<i>You both gave money to the neighbors</i>
<i>and the ping-pong club.</i>

701
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,442
<i>Everyone bought my rice cakes</i>
<i>with my family's money.</i>

702
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,403
This is embarrassing.

703
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,824
This is so embarrassing.

704
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,117
<i>Seriously,</i>

705
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,620
<i>I was so embarrassed and sorry to you.</i>

706
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,957
Be good to your father,
or you'll deeply regret it.

707
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,334
Don't worry about it!

708
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,050
He needs to make money
to stay motivated in the cold.

709
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,304
That way, he can shake off sleep
and have a reason to get up.

710
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,263
- And--
- So?

711
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,557
I should give money
to people in our building?

712
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,850
To buy your son's food?

713
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,686
You know all kinds of people around town.

714
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,440
Who would complain
about getting free rice cakes?

715
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:26,695
And whether you like it or not,
he's not just my son, is he?

716
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,494
I can't believe I'm stuck
with a guy I can't stand. Damn it.

717
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,164
Do you know when I started to dislike you?

718
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,333
I don't want to know.

719
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,709
I haven't liked you

720
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:44,004
since the day you got on my boat
with your little floral lunch box.

721
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,882
I didn't want to be on it either.

722
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,717
Life is just the luck of the draw.

723
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,095
I thought you were just living off luck
and enjoying life.

724
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,975
Seeing you enjoy life because you happened
to meet a smart, frugal wife

725
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,853
put me on the verge of getting angry.

726
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,941
And you know,
I was set up on a date with her.

727
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,277
Come on, don't be on the verge
of crossing the line.

728
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,280
But it wasn't thanks to your wife.

729
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,116
You're different.

730
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,294
Turns out you were different from me.

731
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,671
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

732
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,673
- Get off now.
- No, I won't.

733
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,007
Get off already.

734
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,050
No, I won't!

735
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,928
Seriously, you are driving me nuts.

736
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,388
Why do everything for me?

737
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,932
You always tell me
to handle my own future.

738
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,225
Hurry up, won't you?

739
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,102
Your mom's crying.

740
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,270
What am I, a baby?

741
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,982
How long are you gonna clean up
after a grown-up?

742
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:45,941
A grown-up?

743
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,902
I'm not done raising you yet.

744
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,114
<i>Perhaps there are no grown-ups.</i>

745
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,993
Crazy bastards,
talking crap like "deadbeat" and "jail."

746
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,245
If they talk shit, I won't let them be.

747
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,580
I'll kill them. I will!

748
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,000
<i>It seems like everyone is a kid.</i>

749
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,516
Who told you to get on that boat?
You want me to die? Is that it?

750
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,519
I heard you sold rice cakes too!

751
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,521
Hyeon-suk told you everything, didn't she?

752
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,273
Why didn't you tell me?

753
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,025
Aren't you talking to me anymore?

754
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,234
Are you still mad at me?

755
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,069
Tell her you're sorry!

756
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,238
Tell your mom you'll never do it again!

757
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,322
No!

758
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,036
It's all my fault!

759
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,791
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

760
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,463
I'll make you pork cutlets every day.

761
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,470
Stop crying like that!

762
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:00,182
Every time you do that,
the whole family becomes helpless.

763
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,331
A deadbeat.

764
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,625
A windbag.

765
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,711
A thief who blew someone else's money.

766
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,215
You know why I hired you
even though no one else would?

767
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,301
I don't know
if I should say this about a person.

768
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,596
I'm hiring you because you're the son
of a premium horse.

769
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,557
At races,
premium horses can cost millions.

770
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,685
But their offspring
are even more expensive.

771
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,521
They're worth millions without racing.

772
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,941
Cows, horses, and people
all have different tiers.

773
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,445
People look down on a diligent person
for being old-fashioned these days.

774
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,406
But your father's level of diligence
is something

775
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,534
that no one should dare to look down on.

776
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,245
Is everyone here itching to nag me
whenever they see me?

777
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,330
I got stopped three times on my way here.

778
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,457
So why did you try to run a business?

779
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,085
You soured it,
so now your parents in their fifties--

780
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,212
I soured it? No, the IMF crisis did.

781
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,551
<i>The new millennium is almost upon us.</i>

782
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,053
<i>Let's all shout together!</i>

783
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:24,349
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

784
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:27,769
<i>The coming age mercilessly drove us</i>
<i>out the door without fail.</i>

785
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,188
Four! Three!

786
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,690
Two! One!

787
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,904
<i>At last, the new millennium has arrived!</i>

788
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,453
It's the 2000s now.

789
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,538
Can you believe it?

790
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:50,208
We've been together
since the 1950s, right?

791
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:59,718
I think something big will happen
in our family in the new millennium.

792
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,261
Why is that?

793
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,558
Because we hit rock bottom.

794
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,646
It's not easy for all four family members
to lose their jobs, is it?

795
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,441
Are you happy?

796
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,027
You laugh so easily at silly things.

797
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,616
Even a cat shrinks as small as it can
before it springs up.

798
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,536
I think something is about to "Ready, go!"

799
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:32,083
<i>It'll help you develop a lean physique</i>
<i>and toned muscles.</i>

800
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,836
<i>While almost silent,</i>

801
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,048
<i>it also minimizes joint impact</i>
<i>with its elliptical rotation,</i>

802
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,176
<i>making it a fun workout</i>
<i>for people of all ages and genders.</i>

803
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,638
<i>Four exercise machines in one, Cyclone!</i>

804
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,806
<i>The secret to our stock?</i>

805
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,061
<i>In our family, not even our son,</i>
<i>let alone his wife, knows.</i>

806
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,022
Hey, it's Natasha!

807
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,524
Natasha! It's the Natasha noodles again!

808
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:04,199
I wonder if Song Bu-seon
is handling the noodles well.

809
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:09,704
Why should my past
become the subject of your jokes?

810
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,248
That's hot.

811
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:16,503
Bu-seon's noodles do look really good.
I feel like I'm tasting them by looking.

812
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,588
Shall I cook some <i>ramyeon?</i>

813
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,590
One last time?

814
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,092
- Babe.
- Yeah?

815
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:26,846
Don't you think a time will come
when we can do everything with our eyes?

816
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:32,185
We could get to places, eat, learn,
and exercise just with our eyes.

817
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:40,777
What is it?

818
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,488
Are you coming up
with another business idea?

819
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,825
Right now, everyone is broke
because of the IMF crisis.

820
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,413
When everyone's struggling together,

821
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,916
shouldn't there be
a redistribution of wealth?

822
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,880
Shouldn't I also try to grab an ace
at a time like this?

823
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,590
You're right.

824
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:06,344
Heroes rarely emerge
in peaceful and prosperous times.

825
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,680
You got this!

826
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,522
I've gotta have some <i>ramyeon.</i>

827
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,417
<i>Will you be swept by the waves?</i>
<i>Or will you ride the waves?</i>

828
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,379
<i>…and straight to the catcher. He's out!</i>

829
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,881
<i>Game over!</i>

830
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,760
<i>That was up to the runner.</i>

831
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:52,474
I passed, thanks to the IMF crisis!

832
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,934
The exam used to be held
once every two years.

833
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,063
But now, it's held every year
because of the IMF crisis!

834
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,523
Yes!

835
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,984
I checked the answers for myself!

836
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,403
I won!

837
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,405
I really won!

838
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,992
<i>But, Mom,</i>

839
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,120
<i>why do you keep saying you won</i>
<i>instead of saying you passed?</i>

840
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,622
<i>It makes me feel uneasy.</i>

841
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:20,043
<i>It felt amazing the moment I hit it.</i>

842
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,503
<i>I saw the ball get past</i>

843
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,214
<i>and ran to second base.</i>

844
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,133
<i>Words can't describe</i>
<i>how exhilarating that was.</i>

845
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,886
I saw liberation when I was 13,

846
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,972
and now I get to see
"Long live Korea" once again.

847
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:37,560
I wonder if Lee Seung-yuop
wanted to be a baseball player as a child.

848
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:43,650
You'd have no regrets if you could win
a medal in the dream you pursued.

849
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,777
You have many regrets?

850
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,612
What regrets could you have?

851
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:50,281
Your life has been
like a precious jewel all along.

852
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,368
Your husband still thinks
you can't carry a bag of rice.

853
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,413
You're right.

854
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,542
If I lived your life,
I would have written poems.

855
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,836
I'd have written something.

856
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,005
The entire island knew
you wanted to be a poet.

857
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,465
So why don't you write?

858
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,177
Is there an age limit to writing poetry?

859
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,806
If all the literary girls became poets,

860
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,101
everyone would be one.

861
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,478
How can you get by without writing?

862
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,022
If I had lived Oh Ae-sun's life,

863
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:27,193
I would've written a thousand poems
just to brag about my life.

I heard your daughter
started a business too.

875
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,880
She must have some backup, right?

879
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,725
<i>to make a big move.</i>

880
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:27,188

Ready, go.

882
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,505
SPREAD YOUR WINGS AND FLY
