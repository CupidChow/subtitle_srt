00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,358
Whoa!

3
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,360
Careful. Careful.

4
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,112
One, two.

5
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,572
Wait. Lift it higher.

6
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,408
<i>The road ahead</i>
<i>could be a million miles long…</i>

7
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,536
Oh! No, I told you to be careful!

8
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,331
If this breaks, I'm going to kill myself.
Be gentle.

9
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>But the greatest worry</i>
<i>you will ever have</i>

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,460
<i>is the one in front of you.</i>

11
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,295
Sir? Can you help lift?

12
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,630
One, two, three.

13
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,050
Hey, Mom?
Did we really have to bring that thing?

14
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,511
It's huge! There's nowhere to put it.

15
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,597
Where is this supposed to fit
in that tiny apartment?

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,892
This was my dowry.

17
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,019
The first nice thing I ever had.

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,523
If you're really downsizing,
you shouldn't have brought so much stuff.

19
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,443
Who on earth brings a mother-of-pearl
wardrobe when they move? Seriously.

20
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,986
That's Tongyeong mother-of-pearl.

21
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,904
Huh?

22
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,406
All right. Let's go. Let's go.
Let's take it up.

23
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,324
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

24
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,201
- Let's do it.
- Take that side.

25
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,244
- Okay.
- Tip it over.

26
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,537
- One, two.
- Wait.

27
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,789
God.

28
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,166
- Turn it this way.
- Why did we have to move away?

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,753
- That brat gets whatever she wants.
- Who are you calling a brat, huh?

30
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,257
You know Cheol-yong's sister actually
gives him some of her pay as an usher.

31
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,926
What about her?

32
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,803
Is she leading this family
or tearing it apart?

33
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,513
You…

34
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,600
You're always giving me a hard time, Dad.

35
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,727
What have you done to your hair?

36
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,147
Are you trying to make
the other kids at school laugh?

37
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,025
- Pull on your end.
- Okay, get ready. Lift! Lift!

38
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,752
Why won't this…

39
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,591
Oh my God.

40
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,432
So what's it for? Our dirty shoes?

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,440
Why aren't the aunties here?

42
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,569
They couldn't wait to come by
for my circumcision. Where are they now?

43
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,238
The aunties are busy
because of the Olympics.

44
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,116
Wait, I don't get it.

45
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,077
I thought they hated the Olympics.

46
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,371
- They're Jeju's representatives.
- Ah!

47
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,916
The government decided
to give the <i>haenyeo </i>a role,

48
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,168
so the aunties made amends.

49
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,837
Well,
isn't that convenient for them.

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,593
Where do you think you're going?
You promised me you'd study.

51
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,221
So I can go to
a pricey school too?

52
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,307
Then what? Are you gonna move into a hut?

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,312
What happens to your precious dowry, then?
Your mother-of-pearl wardrobe?

54
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,649
Oh my God.
I feed you well enough, don't I?

55
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,693
Why is it always about money?
Is that all that you--

56
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,819
Don't waste power.

57
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,447
Are you going to Cheol-yong's again?

58
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,579
Come here.

59
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,263
You know what? This is better.

60
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,140
A little better.

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,935
I'll do the living room next.
All with your favorite flower.

62
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,104
Oh, it's already peeling.

63
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,191
You chose a good place for the wardrobe.

64
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,069
When you get home,
you can hang your clothes right away.

65
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,321
It works perfectly.

66
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,866
You're just a bit smarter with these
kinds of things. You make good choices.

67
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,076
Why are you so talkative all of a sudden?

68
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,122
You think florals would work
for the curtains?

69
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,042
Let's do it. I have the store's number.

70
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,669
- I'll… I'll call--
- It's all right.

71
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,715
I like this place already.

72
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,222
It was just bringing up the wardrobe.

73
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,892
You know how important it is to me.

74
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,478
That's why I lost my temper earlier.

75
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,066
Now she laughs?

76
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,444
Have you ever even lived in an apartment?

77
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,364
You're used to the house.
It's gonna get stuffy in here.

78
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,617
Where do we hang laundry?
Where do we put the fermenting jars?

79
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,203
I didn't live in houses
because I preferred to.

80
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,332
I don't mind if it's a stuffy apartment
or your parents' spare room.

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,668
You are my home. That's enough for me.

82
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,340
You should've married a rich man.

83
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,510
You love dressing up nice.
You love reading books.

84
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,554
You were born to be a rich man's wife.

85
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,557
What are you saying?

86
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,893
All the wives of Dodong-ri
will be jealous.

87
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,396
Just look at this garden I have.

88
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,320
Where did you get this wallpaper?
It's so old-fashioned.

89
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,990
<i>The road ahead</i>
<i>could be a million miles long…</i>

90
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,909
Stop, you'll make a mess.

91
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,746
<i>But the greatest joy</i>
<i>you will ever have</i>

92
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,248
<i>is the one in front of you.</i>

93
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,668
You gave your daughter everything,

94
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,837
so now it's back to street vending.

95
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,842
Jeez.
You're as stubborn as Gwang-rye.

96
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,761
You could've let us maintain
the previous name at least.

97
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,012
AUNTIES' SEAFOOD HOUSE

98
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,182
Why should my name
be up there? I didn't pay for it.

99
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,393
I would never accept it. Never, ever.

100
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,146
Tell me,
since you have years of experience,

101
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,148
has pride ever put food on the table?

102
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,900
I wouldn't invest this much
in something that doesn't pay.

103
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,864
Anyway, you better not
waive my vendor fee.

104
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,699
I'll pay full price like anyone else.

105
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,702
And before you get any ideas,
I'll just sell <i>tsukidashi, </i>okay?

106
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,745
Don't dare try to slip me
any of your inventory.

107
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,330
Goodness.

108
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,915
Oh!

109
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,376
What's the matter with you? I've had it!

110
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,254
You can't do your schoolwork,
but you have time to play with that ball?

111
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,214
- I'm sorry.
- Your hair.

112
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,258
What's with that? Who paid for that?

113
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,301
I dunno.

114
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,970
You're selling that
superstitious stuff again, aren't you?

115
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,680
Oh my. Oh my. What the--

116
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,808
Oh, I've had enough! You make me so mad!

117
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,185
- I can't stand it!
- What did I do?

118
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,728
It's soaking wet.

119
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,899
Turn off the faucet. Hurry.
Poor Ae-sun's clock is destroyed.

120
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,610
Hey, careful, careful.
Watch your hand.

121
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,869
He left before dinner.
Where did he go?

122
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,163
Probably at Cheol-yong's again.

123
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,377
There's nothing as comforting
as a young child, is there?

124
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,090
No matter what,
they always come running back to Mommy.

125
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,511
Don't be too hard on the kid.

126
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:36,098
A leaf can be torn apart
even in a gentle drizzle.

127
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,273
Oh, Auntie, when will I grow up finally?

128
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,568
When I do, I'll let you know.

129
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,489
<i>It turns out</i>
<i>none of us have it all figured out.</i>

130
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,034
You bought a big one.
Why would you do that, I wonder?

131
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:59,330
Could it possibly be your way
of asking us to be good to your wife?

132
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,540
Yes.

133
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,168
Boy, your people skills
have come a long way.

134
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,215
<i>Every time I felt my heart</i>
<i>aching with growing pains,</i>

135
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,510
<i>the hearts around me</i>
<i>were growing a little bit too.</i>

136
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,306
- I'm coming!
- Do that later.

137
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,934
- Button up your vest.
- Don't bother, dear.

138
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,353
- Okay, where would you like us to stand?
- You want me here?

139
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,188
- Ready?
- Look. Come to the middle.

140
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,439
Hey, come here.

141
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,733
- Okay, is everything ready?
- Wait one second.

142
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,985
- Ow, come on.
- One second.

143
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,778
- Hold still. Hey.
- Leave my hair alone.

144
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,115
One, two, kimchi!

148
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,546
<i>Yesterday, it was cold.</i>

149
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,678
<i>Today, it's 30 degrees. It is very hot.</i>

150
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,814
<i>Come on, Mom.</i>
<i>I told you to stop street vending.</i>

151
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,318
<i>I hate how you have to eat sitting out</i>
<i>on the street there every day.</i>

152
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,070
What did she write here?

153
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,280
COME AND CHECK US OUT!

154
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,283
<i>Today, it's 30 degrees. It's very hot.</i>

<i>When I realized Mom was street vending</i>

158
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,759

00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,722
<i>I resolved</i>

160
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,599
<i>that I would never again</i>

It's just my kid on the other side.
What's the big deal?

170
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,641
I know, but if you could even put up
a hook-latch, that would be enough.

171
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,103
What, do you not trust us?

172
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,397
Hmm? You're a funny one.
I'll give you that.

173
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,317
You know, the girl who lived here
before you never said a thing.

174
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,320
She just thought our baby was cute.
She couldn't get enough.

175
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,155
Just look at him. Look, look.

176
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,199
- <i>We need Yeong-sim!</i>
- He's adorable!

177
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,535
<i>- Please!</i>
- Yeah.

178
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,329
<i>We need Yeong-sim. Please!</i>

179
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,248
Cute boy. Mm.

180
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,544
Really, you should know how hard it is
to find a room for rent these days,

181
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,379
even harder than finding an apartment.

182
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,883
As far as tenants go, we have plenty
of options, but you, not so much.

183
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,305
YEONG-SIM
YEONG-SIM'S DREAM

184
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,852
Let's just go easy on each other
and try to get along.

185
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,646
Sure, if you say so.

186
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,984
It's not like I have another choice.

187
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,446
Also, I say this
because I have a daughter your age.

188
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,864
No boyfriends allowed.

189
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,159
- Not even one.
- Not even Park Chung-seob.

190
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,578
If you were my daughter,
I'd break your legs if I caught you.

191
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,955
If I were your daughter,
you'd put up a hook-latch.

192
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,125
DO NOT ENTER! KNOCK!

193
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,469
Sh, sh.

194
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,223
Hey, quiet. You wanna get caught?

195
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:53,981
Hi there.

196
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,275
Cheol-yong's here.

197
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,277
That's right, your son.

198
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,653
Uh-huh.

199
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,992
<i>MacGyver </i>is on right now,
but my son isn't coming out of his room.

200
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,036
Yeah.

201
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,245
Sure thing.

202
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,791
I can't believe Cheol-yong would do this.

203
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,168
If he was so afraid of
his dad yelling at him,

204
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,462
he shouldn't have
finished last in his class.

205
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,049
So now, not only is he last,
he's a runaway too!

206
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,786
Why did you lock the door, son?

207
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,079
P… privacy.

208
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,414
P… I'm sorry?

209
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,834
Privacy. It means get out of my room!

210
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,964
So now it's your room, eh?
You didn't buy this place though.

211
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,423
So what?

212
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,261
That's all you've had to say to me lately.
"So what?" It's annoying.

213
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,223
Come on, get out already!
You just don't understand.

214
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,724
Excuse me?

215
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,067
So what do we do now? You tell me.

216
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,446
What am I supposed to do
if you won't talk to me?

217
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,742
Fine, let's just break up.

218
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,161
You don't love me anymore.
Not enough to even shave for me.

219
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,206
It's not because I don't love you.
I can't stop loving you.

220
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,750
- I don't even know how!
- Then what are you gonna do?

221
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,169
Quit your job and take
the teacher certification exam.

222
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,713
I can't just marry anyone.

223
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,591
I definitely can't marry a bum.
What are your paintings worth?

224
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,509
Why are those more important than I am?

225
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,178
I should ask him
to soundproof it next.

226
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,265
How am I supposed to convince
my dad about you? Can you at least shave?

227
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,058
Am I worth less to you
than your facial hair?

228
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,563
Oh, make sure to give me the biggest one.

229
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,148
Give Bu-seon the smallest one.

230
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,274
Sure.

231
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,195
Huh?

232
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,158
Somebody took the key, Dad.

233
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,452
Bu-seon, are you in there?

234
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,330
- Bu-seon!
- Bu-seon!

235
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,499
Song Bu-seon!

236
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,090
- Oh my.
- How dare he.

237
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,510
He's just a teenager, remember?
A teenager.

238
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,721
Yeah? So what?
That doesn't give him a pass.

239
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,639
Just think.

240
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,934
Remember you would bring me croakers
when you shouldn't have.

241
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,438
Your mom wanted to
shove your head in dirty dishwater.

242
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,651
Here.

243
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,030
So… I can handle my mom.

244
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,865
No problem.

245
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,873
Hang on.

246
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,501
Why are there two forks?

247
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,004
Why did Mom give me two forks?

248
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,635
Bu-seon!

249
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,721
Song Bu-seon!

250
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,099
- This is the wrong place for me, I think.
- Open the door.

251
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,269
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

252
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,397
- Song Bu-seon!
- Song Bu-seon!

253
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,024
Hey, Song Bu-seon! Open the door!

254
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,113
Bu-seon!

255
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,075
- Hey, open the door!
- Open the door!

256
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,743
- Open the door!
- Oh my God.

257
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,662
- Open it!
- Oh my God.

258
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,372
Open it!

259
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,124
Who… who… who are you?

260
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,459
Oh my God!

261
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,340
Open the door!

262
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,385
Oh my God! Are you insane?

263
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,220
What do you think you're doing?

264
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,436
Hey!

265
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,354
Open the door!

266
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,231
Hey!

267
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,944
Listen, could you help us out
this one time?

268
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,946
Please, my dad will kill us.

269
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,406
- Song Bu-seon!
- Please help.

270
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,866
Song Bu-seon!

271
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,701
- Please help me.
- Open the door!

272
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,911
<i>The look</i>
<i>in this hairy boy's eyes</i>

273
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,623
<i>made me think of a mole</i>
<i>that's been cornered by a hunter.</i>

274
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,298
<i>So I let him in.</i>

275
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,925
Yay! Wow!
Geum-sun just won!

276
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,681
So, Dad, I, uh…

277
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,642
Don't get up.

278
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,687
I made some <i>Jjinbbang. </i>Thought I'd share.

279
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,940
I wanted to see how you were settling in.

280
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,777
It's just… you're early.

281
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,238
I thought you'd be
working at the factory today.

282
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,449
Since when are you interested
in what I do?

283
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,911
You have a pretty big closet here,
don't you?

284
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,329
Dad, what about dinner?

285
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,874
This is the perfect size
for your blankets, huh?

286
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,876
Uh, yeah, I suppose it is.

287
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,424
What do you mean you "suppose"?

288
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,720
You know what?
I think I will go outside for a bit.

289
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,930
What about that one?

290
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,058
You using the extra storage?

291
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,436
- Yeah, I…
- Uh, Dad, she said she's stepping out, so…

292
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,188
Oh, uh, hold on, sir.

293
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,440
I keep my underwear in there.

294
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,194
No need to see all that.

295
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,450
As I said, I think I'll go out.

296
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,453
Yeah, Okay, sure.

297
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,127
What are you hanging around here for?

298
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,504
Oh, uh…

299
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,297
No, I wasn't. I… I just

300
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,301
was wondering who the new tenant was.
That's all.

301
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,428
Well, that's odd
'cause you've never cared before.

302
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,640
You only care about
your freedom and your boyfriends.

303
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,810
Dad, it's not like that.

304
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,354
Come out.

305
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,274
Come out right now.

306
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,775
- Dad, listen.
- Mr. Song.

307
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,901
Really, it's not--

308
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,404
You either walk out, or I drag you out.

309
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,780
Right now.

310
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,366
Cheol-yong, come out.

311
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,494
Oh, we said we'd take it easy.

312
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,745
Park Cheol-yong.

313
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,331
Come out.

314
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,499
Park Chung-seob!

315
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,168
Park Chung-seob!

316
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,551
<i>When Grandma Min-ok</i>
<i>turned 60, she said,</i>

317
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,930
<i>"Anyone who claims to be a moral person</i>

318
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,766

319
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,315
Excuse me?

320
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,777
Could you, uh…

321
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,376
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,173
<i>Sure, it was embarrassing,</i>

324
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,425
<i>but that was the day we first met.</i>

325
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,057
I knew it!
Cheol-yong, you little punk.

326
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,601
Your father lost his nails, you know that?

327
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,895
Your father works his fingers
to the bone at the market.

328
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,064
- How dare you run away from home!
- Honey.

329
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:32,981
How…

330
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,358
Hold on.

331
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,448
Did he get smaller?

332
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,284
How is he smaller?

333
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,584
Cheol-yong?

334
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,353
Who are you?

335
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,985
Wait.

336
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,404
Are you a girl?

337
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,035
Oh my God.

338
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,730
So, uh…

339
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,274
That haircut.

340
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,443
Did you do that yourself?

341
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,112
Has money been tight?

342
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,280
Actually,

343
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,490
my parents did this.

344
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,164
So, I was wondering.

345
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:18,503
Those letters.
Does YEM stand for "Yang Eun-myeong"?

346
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,255
Yes, it does.

347
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,425
Why are
my son's initials on your backpack?

348
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,302
Are you close to each other?

349
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,055
Are you?

350
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,639
She's my girlfriend.

351
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,602
Oh my God.

352
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,898
- It's been 500 days.
- Where the hell did I put that paddle?

353
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,317
This bastard needs 500 spankings!

354
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,152
You dated
in elementary school.

355
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,072
- We were older than that!
- Who… who told you that, son?

356
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,325
- Aunt Gyeong-ok.
- Ah! Tell Yang Gyeong-ok to get here now!

357
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,451
Love isn't illegal!

358
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,036
What did you just say, boy?

359
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,538
<i>There's an outcry with no sound</i>

360
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,249
<i>An eternal handkerchief of nostalgia</i>

361
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,086
<i>That waves</i>
<i>That waves towards the blue sea</i>

362
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,088
<i>The first man hanging in the air…</i>

363
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,465
We didn't rush into it.

364
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,759
At first, I didn't even like her

365
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,303
because of the hair on her upper lip.

366
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,181
But… but after ten years,
it suddenly didn't matter anymore.

367
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,975
What was I supposed to do?

368
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,354
Oh God.
I don't wanna hear any of this! Stop it!

369
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,564
This family just treats me
like an afterthought!

370
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,900
But she loved me
more than anything in the world.

371
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,402
More than her brothers even!

372
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,866
I hope you're happy now, dummy.

373
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,034
Congrats.

374
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,329
<i>Yang Eun-myeong's weakness</i>
<i>for love was just like Dad's.</i>

375
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:39,334
The thing is,
I've always had a thing for bad boys, so…

376
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:50,011
Listen, young lady, being in love
doesn't excuse running away. You get that?

377
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,139
Your mom and dad. Do they know?

378
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,433
They wouldn't know yet.

379
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,311
I only left home this morning, so…

380
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,564
Why don't you tell us who you are, dear?

381
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,441
Let's start with your name.

382
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,609
Tell me, what is it?

383
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,112
Hyeon-suk.

384
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,991
I think Hyeon-suk can speak for herself.

385
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,622
Bu Hyeon-suk.

386
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,420
Hello there.

387
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,843
"Bu" Hyeon-suk.
Does that mean your father is

388
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,595
Bu Sang-gil?

389
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,973
Yeah.

390
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,225
Oh my God.

391
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,354
<i>How can a love scandal</i>
<i>span two generations? It's a small town.</i>

392
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,440
<i>It extended</i>
<i>to a second generation</i>

393
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,525
<i>precisely because it's a small town.</i>

394
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,486
<i>I'm just shocked they're the same age.</i>

395
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,740
I didn't get to bring you kimchi
or visit when you were moving.

396
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,285
<i>When you met each other</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

397
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,621
<i>you must both have been</i>
<i>pregnant with them.</i>

398
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,583
Hyeon-suk, never step on a pile of poop.

399
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,045
You have to marry a man
like this lady's husband, okay?

400
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,467
Hyeon-suk is also going to
Dodong Elementary, right?

401
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,552
<i>There are only</i>
<i>so many people in a grade,</i>

402
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,096
<i>and they had ten years of school</i>
<i>to figure it out.</i>

403
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,684
You cared so much for your daughter
that you completely neglected your son.

404
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,103
Do you even know what kind of students
he's hanging out with?

405
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,066
<i>Considering the odds,</i>
<i>it's actually not that surprising.</i>

406
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,027
We have a female student
who's as much trouble as he is!

407
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,197
He wouldn't have anything
to do with girls, sir.

408
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,784
He doesn't know how
to get along with them.

409
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,746
He can't even get along
with his own sister.

410
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,208
Sisters are different.
Even I can't hang out with my sister.

411
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,418
Oh.

412
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,904
<i>I think this is about</i>
<i>more than chance.</i>

413
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,447
<i>I think this is about taste.</i>

414
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,325
<i>He must take after his father. </i>

415
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,413
What can I say?
Indecency seems to run in the Oh family.

416
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,001
<i>Just have a look</i>
<i>at my own daughters instead.</i>

417
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,296

<i>"wise and enlightened," and Jeong-suk,</i>

418

420
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,235
At least come inside and say hello.

421
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,528
What, are they getting engaged?

422
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,447
<i>If you ask me,</i>

423
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,658
<i>I think Bu Sang-gil</i>
<i>still has a bit of a crush on Ae-sun.</i>

Passion is inherited too.

Do you?

434
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,600

For once in her life,
my daughter-in-law is speechless!

438
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,863
- Oh you!
- Well, you seem very happy about it.

439
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,115

your whole life.

441
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,244

00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,762
I'm not asking for much.

511
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,057
I'm asking you to help me out
for once in your life.

512
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,396
- Wanna come see a movie?
- No. I don't think so.

513
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,692
Oh, it's that scalper-lady.
Lady! I told you to get out of here!

514
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,194
You're not allowed to resell our tickets!

515
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,863
<i>He's our very own Picasso.</i>

516
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,532
We have a Picasso
in the basement of Cannes Theater.

517
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,494
Never raises his voice,
but he's stubborn as a bull.

518
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,830
He always keeps his eyes down
when he gets caught,

519
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,457
but he just goes and does it again.

520
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,752
The boss has been more than patient
with him. I would've gone crazy.

521
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,545
So he's an actual artist, is he, huh?

522
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,172
I suppose he is.

523
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,925
As much as anyone who paints
a billboard anonymously can be.

524
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,968
Hmm. But he hasn't been fired yet.

525
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,678
The boss is a softy.

526
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,763
Huh?

527
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,889
After he yells at him,

528
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,141
he ends up feeling so badly,
he buys the kid some dinner.

529
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,310
Uh-huh.

530
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:27,528
So how do you know each other?
Why did he introduce you to us?

531
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,405
Oh, I met him somewhere.

532
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,865
Two tickets, please.

533
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,202
That's how it goes.
You meet a guy, then you end up with him.

534
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,412
What?

535
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,795
Next.

536
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,380
TELL US THE NAME OF THE MOVIE

537
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,840
One ticket, please.

538
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,594
Next customer.

539
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,471
TICKET
GHOST

540
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,556
- Excuse me.
- How many?

541
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,141
I'm not here for <i>Ghost.</i>

542
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,852
<i>Byeon Kang-soe </i>is later at night.
Next customer.

543
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,271
- Have you seen it?
- Next customer.

544
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,982
Come see it with me later.

545
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,150
Are you gonna buy a ticket?

546
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,787
I suppose crazy people
buy movie tickets too.

547
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,082
What the…

548
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,815
Hey, ma'am?

549
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,236
Ma'am?

550
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,530
- Can you watch the box office for a bit?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,786
SHOWTIMES
GHOST

552
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,157
It's really Christmas now.
The best Christmas ever.

553
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,367
That's why I'm here.

554
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,288
Aw! Look at you in overalls, babe.

555
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,082
Mm, you lost weight.

556
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,708
You're so cute.

557
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,807
Should I flash the projector on them?
How do you know her?

558
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,726
I don't really know her.

559
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,645
You helped a stranger get a job?

560
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,856
Well… can't say I know her,

561
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,691
but I can't say I don't either.

562
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,985
Mm-hmm. So that's how it is.

563
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,656
- Might be something between you one day.
- Nothing will happen.

564
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,367
You never know between a man and a woman.

565
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,829
Just because there's a goalie
doesn't mean you can't score.

566
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,040
We wear hard hats on construction sites
because it's the safe thing to do.

567
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,376
But secretly, you don't mind the danger.

568
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,795
Nice story. You should make a movie.

569
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,132
Why won't anything happen?
Are you related to her?

570
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,050
No, It's just…

571
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,555
We've seen each other
in very embarrassing situations.

572
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,602
Why are they going back there?

573
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,564
- You know exactly why.
- Sure.

574
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:55,278
I don't want a girlfriend anymore, okay?
Especially not from ticket sales.

575
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,282
Hey. Why are you
talking to me instead of her?

576
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,537
God. This is crazy.

577
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,207
Life is short,
and love is a rare privilege.

578
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,377
Here.

579
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,383
- You know what?
- What?

580
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,553
- My family doesn't know.
- What?

581
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,554
That I'm in Korea.

582
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,390
I was supposed to come
at the end of the month,

583
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,933
but I came early.

584
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,478
You're a gangster, aren't you?

585
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,771
Should I tell them?

586
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,357
Should I?

587
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,777
You better not.

588
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,906
You know, between you and a puppy,
you're the cuter one.

589
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,622
DAEHAN NEWS

590
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,214
Hey, man.

591
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,549
Why did you turn that on?

592
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,386
I got this place
because of the hilltop view.

593
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,889
If we go all the way up,

594
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,225
we'll see the biggest Christmas tree
in Korea.

595
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,727
You won't see one that big
even in America.

596
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,815
If I lived too close to the school,
friends would come over too often.

597
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,735
Rooms near the school
are always in demand,

598
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,779
so of course, all the landlords are jerks.

599
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,865
Honestly, it's a relief
these people don't feed me.

600
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,325
Not that I eat much anyway.

601
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,952
HELP US FIND OUR MISSING STUDENTS

602
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:27,995
Geum-myeong.

603
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,622
Huh?

604
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,415
What is it?

605
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:33,918
You can't live here.

606
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,671
Look at this place.
It's worse than Harlem.

607
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,758
The people who spray-paint that stuff,

608
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,886
they gotta be sick in the head. Honestly.

609
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,806
Why live in such a dangerous area?

610
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,101
I can't sleep
knowing you live somewhere like this.

611
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,021
Why are they fighting
in someone else's neighborhood?

612
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,864
That man's an artist.

613
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,201
He's the artist who works at our theater.

614
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,078
Stop overreacting.

615
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,039
No one would want his
girlfriend to live in a place like this.

616
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,249
I'm worried sick.

617
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:17,086
What do you mean "place like this"?
I'm doing just fine here.

618
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,381
Pack your things tonight.

619
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,760
- Move to our neighborhood.
- Where in your neighborhood?

620
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,429
To your apartment?

621
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,805
You really don't know Seoul.

622
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,849
You're the one who doesn't know Seoul.

623
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,059
Not me.

624
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,232
I'm just saying this
because I'm worried about you.

625
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,445
Just leave, okay?
I don't want you in my room.

626
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,906
You're living in a Korean slum,
a place where serial murders happen.

627
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,285
Then go back to America
if you're American now.

628
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,745
I…

629
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,375
You better not follow me.

630
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,761
<i>The kid never smiles ever.</i>

631
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,388
He keeps his mouth closed all the time.

632
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,725
I couldn't even strike up
a conversation with him if I wanted to.

633
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,561
Hey, can't you just eat from
the already open ones?

634
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,772
Who do you think
he bought the dumplings for?

635
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,273
So the kid could have some.

636
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,819
Then stop yelling at him
and scaring him off.

637
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,279
It's a waste of good money.

638
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,323
Give them to him yourself.

639
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,242
Our Picasso paints beautiful ladies

640
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,745
without showing so much
as an inch of skin.

641
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,122
Now what sense does that make?

642
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,969
AEMA WANTS TO RIDE AGAIN
MADAME AEMA

643
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,726
Huh. How did he not get fired for this?

644
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,677
Does he sleep here too?

645
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,309
BAEK SEOK'S POETRY COLLECTION

646
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,614
ME, NATASHA, AND THE WHITE DONKEY

647
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,369
THOUGH I'M POOR
I LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL NATASHA

648
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,163
SO TONIGHT, THE SNOW WHUMPFS DOWN

649
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,167
Because you're not
interested in money?

650
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,795
Oh, I forgot!
You're a noble artist, aren't you?

651
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,466
You're always saying
that I always talk about money,

652
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,676
but hey, I'm not the one who's poor.

653
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,678
You feel noble
because you don't care about it,

654
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,055
but every time we're together,
no matter what we do,

655
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,391
I'm the one who has
to worry about money all the time.

656
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,935
"How much was the pork cutlet?"
"How much is the movie ticket?"

657
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,604
Whenever we plan a trip, I have to think,

658
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,981
"Oh, he doesn't have money.
We can't do it."

659
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,191
We dated for three years,

660
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,276
and we've never been to
a Western restaurant.

661
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,570
Always <i>kalguksu,</i>
<i>jjolmyeon, kalguksu, jjolmyeon!</i>

662
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,406
I swear I feel pathetic
being your girlfriend!

663
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,742
Is that what art means?

664
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,036
Tell me. Is that what art stands for?

665
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,497
How much longer can this go on?

666
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,042
How long until you've finished rebelling
and marry the man your father wants?

667
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,879
Just leave. Don't worry about saving face.
Just get out of here.

668
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,130
You're just letting me go?

669
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,215
- I'm sick of this.
- What?

670
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,759
While we've been together,
you went on six blind dates.

671
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,761
I don't deserve this.

672
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,387
I'm done.

673
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,057
I've had enough of your disrespect.

674
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,186
I don't even like you anymore. Just leave.

675
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,648
Is there someone else?

676
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,032
There is a girl, isn't there?

677
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,035
That's why you're pretending to be strong.

678
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,578
Like you do?

679
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,583
Why won't you pick up the phone?

680
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,629
You do have someone. I know.
And yet, you pretended to be the victim.

681
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,840
So what do you want me to do?
If I ask you to stay, will you?

682
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,348
<i>I think</i>
<i>that was the exact moment</i>

683
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,891
<i>when my landlord's daughter</i>

684
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,310
<i>started kicking my shoes as she passed by.</i>

685
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,777
Um, I brought you some dumplings.

686
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,198
The projectionist asked me to do it.

687
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,453
You know, I really don't know why
we end up in awkward situations.

688
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,540
It gets worse every time, right?

689
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,417
I don't believe this.

690
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,547
PART-TIME USHER
CANNES THEATER

691
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,090
Did you get her the job here?

692
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,720
Wait. Uh…

693
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,806
So this is
your little secret at the theater.

694
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,641
How sweet.

695
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,184
Look, she even brought you food.

696
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,561
Ah, uh…

697
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,187
No, I--

698
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:31,609
Hey, uh, little help? Maybe you could try
explaining to her what--

699
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,110
I cannot believe this.

700
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,362
You guys deserve each other.

701
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,035
What a clueless girl.
She doesn't even know she's a third wheel.

702
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,748
You're a high school dropout.
She goes to Seoul National University.

703
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,666
Watch your mouth.

704
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,755
<i>The fall breeze</i>
<i>turned into a spring wind.</i>

705
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,051
<i>And the spring wind</i>
<i>continually howled in my heart.</i>

706
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,973
THE WIND WHISTLES
WHILE THE HEART WHIMPERS.

707
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:53,477
"JUST GET READY AND GO,
RIDE THE MOMENT WITH ALL YOU HAVE."
