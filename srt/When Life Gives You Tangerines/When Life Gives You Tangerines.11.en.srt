1
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,150
EMERGENCY ROOM

3
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,416
So, actually,

4
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,461
I lived in that room a few years ago.

5
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,799
There was always a draft because
the windows were so bent out of shape.

6
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,842
I suppose that's what saved her today.

7
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,806
Oh God. What if I hadn't made it?

8
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,266
What if I'd missed the flight?

9
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,020
I don't know why,
but I just knew I had to come.

10
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,148
You saved her life, ma'am, you did.

11
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,608
No. No.

12
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,528
Geum-myeong's the one who saved my life.

13
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,241
By staying alive, she saved my life.

14
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,618
She's much kinder than I am.

15
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,871
I really can't take this anymore.

16
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,666
I really can't.

17
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,632
You have to stay healthy

18
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,093
'cause Geum-myeong still needs you. Here.

19
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,761
Oh my.

20
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,600
Uh, are you the landlord's son-in-law?

21
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,936
Well, uh…

22
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,652
That's

23
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,196
Park Geum-myeong's son, no?

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,156
Huh?

25
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,533
Park Geum-myeong's son?

26
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,076
Huh?

27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,122
I mean, I never knew who his dad was.

28
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,927
Gimme.

29
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,097
What?

30
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,646
You're freezing.

31
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,735
It's not like you are nobility.

32
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,280
Why won't you let me take care of you?

33
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,907
Hush now, okay?

34
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,326
Let's talk about this later.

35
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,869
We should get married now.

36
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,871
Let's just go and get it over with.

37
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,998
Quiet! My mom's here.

38
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,297
Tell them to go play house somewhere else.

39
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,257
Goodness, she's all grown up.

40
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,886
Excuse me.

41
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,888
Have you filled this out yet?

42
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,307
Oh, right.

43
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,145
If you didn't want it,
why did you take the ring?

44
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,898
With the ring,
it's a done deal. A done deal!

45
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,694
Don't go. Marry me. Here's a ring.
You take the ring, and it's a done deal.

46
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,699
How did she find a boy
just like her father?

47
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,284
I told you to move.

48
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,204
- Enough, please.
- I told you to move out of there.

49
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,248
Have you ever been poisoned before?

50
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,209
The doctor said being nagged at
will give me more headaches.

51
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,753
But why did you have to be
poisoned in the first place?

52
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,466
Just marry me and move in with us.
I mean, we even have a water heater.

53
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,885
You're proposing to me
with a water heater?

54
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,762
What happened to the diamond ring?

55
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,391
Jeez, I guess they have no shame,
talking on and on.

56
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,935
I'm not asking
for anything unreasonable.

57
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,937
They don't fix street lights
in that neighborhood.

58
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,648
I hate that you have to climb
that hill by yourself.

59
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,943
I hate that you can see
your own breath in that room.

60
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,947
I hate that you can't sleep because
you have to sell late-night movie tickets.

61
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,908
I hate that you can't make phone calls
because of your landlord.

62
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,867
I hate it all.

63
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,537
Why do you have to put up with it?
No one else does.

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,247
Who wants to live like that?

65
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,540
Nobody!

66
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,752
Don't you watch the news?

67
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,548
It happens in the blink of an eye.
You can die in an instant.

68
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,759
What if you died from carbon monoxide
when you were alone? Huh?

69
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,846
What if something happens and you die?

70
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,806
Yeah, but I didn't die.

71
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,520
- I couldn't take it!
- Come on.

72
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,564
What's wrong?

73
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,358
I thought boys stopped crying
after basic training.

74
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,528
Seriously, you're an officer.

75
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,448
If you die, I'll die too.

76
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,783
That's all I could think in the taxi here.

77
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,784
Hey,

78
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,162
no matter what, life goes on.

79
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,080
So if I died, you'd move on?

80
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,958
I mean, eventually.

81
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,501
Yeah, I would.

82
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,383
Stop smiling.

83
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,843
Hmm?

84
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,263
Oh, you're too cute.

85
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,640
It's so annoying.

86
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,811
It wasn't that bad.
It was just a little gas.

87
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,606
Besides, you know I have tiny nostrils.

88
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,150
I couldn't inhale that much,
even if I wanted to.

89
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,198
Geum-myeong,

90
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,492
please don't ever be alone.

91
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,619
Please?

92
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,954
I'm the one you're marrying.

93
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,624
It's not like you'd be marrying my mom.

94
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,629
I'll do whatever it takes
for my family to give us their blessing.

95
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,673
Ae-sun will live with me.
She won't be living with my grandmother.

96
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,510
I'll make sure
she won't lay a hand on her.

97
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,179
I'll make sure my mom
takes it easy on you.

98
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,682
She has her opinions, but you just
have to butter her up a little.

99
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,936
She doesn't like me.
I don't really like her either.

100
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,357
Deep down, my mom is a nice person.

101
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,610
But if she is so nice,
why was she so rude at our family dinner?

102
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,325
- What did she say to you?
- Oh my God.

103
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,494
You scared me.

104
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,162
- Hello there, Mrs. Oh.
- That's how it is?

105
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,289
Your mother doesn't approve
of my daughter. That true?

106
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,876
No, Mom. That's not what we meant.

107
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,045
Why not? Why?

108
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,188
I can't believe my own eyes.

109
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,901
Are you really Sang-gil's daughter?

110
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,611
Mm-hmm.

111
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,030
Ooh. This is hilarious.

112
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,116
Why is it funny who her dad is?

113
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,868
I think he'd be proud, is all.

114
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,953
She's living out his dream.

115
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,414
Cut the bullcrap.
They don't need to hear it.

116
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,416
Many years ago,
your mother and your father

117
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,209
sat across from each other in those seats.

118
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,671
- Hey.
- This was a café. They met for coffee.

119
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,882
- Hey.
- They were on a blind date.

120
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,468
You two could've been siblings.

121
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,220
Watch it. Ae-sun is gonna kill you.

122
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,098
You're just like
Romeo and Juliet.

123
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,350
Mm. Bit uglier though.

124
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,646
<i>Will their first great love last,</i>

125
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,692
<i>or will it only be</i>
<i>a heartbreaking memory of young love?</i>

126
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,365
<i>At the time, they were completely</i>
<i>caught up in their emotions</i>

127
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,617
<i>without holding back.</i>

128
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,370
What does your mother not like
about my daughter? Tell me.

129
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,039
No, ma'am, I didn't mean…

130
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,375
As her guardian,
we need you to sign this form.

131
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,463
- Me?
- Of course, who else?

132
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,465
You are her guardian. Aren't you?

133
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,633
Oh, I'm not--

134
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,720
But you brought her in. I saw you.
You ran here with her on your back.

135
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,888
Who is he?

136
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,185
Why is he your guardian?

137
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,729
You know what? I don't like her son.

138
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,817
I'm talking about you.

139
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,947
Just tell me if they dated.
Give me a simple yes or no.

140
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,783
Are you just
making stuff up again or what?

141
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,953
Hey, if I tell you,
will you rat me out to your dad?

142
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,788
You can't fool me.
Remember when I was little,

143
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,957
you convinced me
you had a tiger at your house?

144
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, just forget it.

145
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,213
Good, drop it. There are some things
better off left in the past.

146
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,092
They never dated.

147
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,806
However, they almost got married.

148
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,709
You think that's funny?

149
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,630
Ah. A little bit.

150
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,971
THREE AUNTIES'
FRESHLY PICKED BY HAENYEO

151
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,533
What in God's name
is that thing on your head?

152
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,035
Are you about to plow a field?

153
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,161
Hey, Dad,

154
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,538
are you happy?

155
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,832
Ah, you can't really think
that makes you look good.

156
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,336
Just shave your head.
I'll pay you 50,000 won.

157
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,641
THIS IS NOT TRASH

158
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,185
THIS IS MY PRIDE I'VE THROWN AWAY FOR YOU

159
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,478
COME BACK TO ME, YEM

160
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,900
HYEON-SUK LOVES YOU FOEVER

161
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,110
26 MONTHS OR 26 YEARS
I PROMISE I WILL WAIT

162
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,665
Do people still get beat up
in the military?

163
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,249
I never taught you how to handle that.

164
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,502
Why did you insist on coming
if you were gonna cry?

165
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,586
Jeez, seriously.

166
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,299
You should've gone to college.
I knew you should.

167
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,634
<i>With the implementation</i>

168
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,220
<i>of the College Scholastic Ability Test</i>
<i>this year,</i>

169
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,181
<i>many students are experiencing</i>
<i>quite a lot of confusion.</i>

170
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,976
<i>While the Academic Ability Exam</i>
<i>was based on memorization,</i>

171
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,646
<i>this new test is geared</i>
<i>toward comprehensive reasoning…</i>

172
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,273
They expect kids
to run before they can even walk.

173
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,944
If they keep changing the exams,
how can the slower kids go to college?

174
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,489
<i>He joined the army?</i>

175
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,782
Last-minute decision.

176
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,786
He hasn't done his military service yet?

177
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,956
I know he looks old enough
to have fought in the war,

178
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,417
but our Picasso is only 28.

179
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,337
He said soju and popcorn are for the boss.

180
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,381
Everything else is up for grabs.

181
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,508
Popcorn for me?

182
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,302
How can he leave without saying goodbye?

183
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,762
Why didn't he tell us?

184
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,640
I can't eat all of this on my own.
It's too much.

185
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,559
We worked together for years.

186
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,895
Are you quitting too?
I guess you won't be seeing him again.

187
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,606
We might run into each other… again.

188
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,816
No, you won't.

189
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,736
You won't see him again in this life.
Maybe the next.

190
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,448
The stars have to align for you
to meet someone once in a lifetime.

191
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,950
If you let them pass you by.

192
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,578
I'm afraid that's all she wrote.

193
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,927
Apparently, he carried me just like that.

194
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,347
NEVER LET YOUR GUARD DOWN
NEVER LET THEM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT

195
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,558
AND NEVER FALL IN LOVE
THE BODYGUARD

196
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,312
Seoul boys are heartless after all.

197
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,617
<i>That year,</i>

198
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,620
<i>everything about my life</i>
<i>seemed to be shifting.</i>

199
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:25,304
<i>And the grand prize winner</i>
<i>of the 1993 KBS Korean Music Awards is…</i>

200
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,935
<i>…Kim Soo-hee for "Sad Love"!</i>

201
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,189
<i>Kim Soo-hee defeated Seo Taiji.</i>

202
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,943
<i>The winds of fall</i>
<i>overcame the passions of spring.</i>

203
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:43,322
<i>The year 1993, a year filled</i>
<i>with all kinds of ups and downs,</i>

204
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,907
<i>is finally coming to a close.</i>

205
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,411
<i>Fighting the wind</i>
<i>that rages in our hearts is a losing game.</i>

206
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,872
So, have I changed a lot?

207
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,382
<i>The wind always blows in the fall.</i>

208
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,353
<i>But it also blows in the spring.</i>

209
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,691
Oh jeez.
How does he expect me to sell this thing?

210
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,402
<i>Whatever the season,</i>

211
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,153
<i>it blows and blows.</i>

212
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,324
I'd like to think that.

213
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,951
I'd like to.

214
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,079
<i>Our hearts</i>
<i>never cease to be moved.</i>

215
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,587
"I, a poor man,

216
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,507
love the beautiful Natasha dearly."

217
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,176
"So tonight, the snow falls heavily."

218
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,930
Oh, so you saw that too.

219
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,808
I guess you like that one especially.

220
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,477
Well, I just…

221
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,022
So you're a sentimental one.

222
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,820
I suppose

223
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,074
in poetry, poverty can seem dignified.

224
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,036
There's nothing cool about
not having money,

225
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,872
but poetry gives it beauty.

226
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,917
Well,

227
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,544
you're a painter.

228
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,881
I couldn't paint to save my life.

229
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,511
You use that talent to make money.

230
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,056
Not everyone can do that.

231
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,559
So, Mr. Toto,

232
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,978
I'm afraid you're not so poor after all.

233
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,480
And if I may be so blunt,

234
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,733
your Natasha
isn't exactly beautiful either.

235
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,986
Don't let her make you feel small.

236
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,489
I mean,

237
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,242
I don't know if anything I'm saying
will help you get over her.

238
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,621
But your Natasha

239
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,415
is a bit of a donkey
without her makeup on.

240
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,754
Um…

241
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,800
My mom was curious.

242
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,928
Were you planning
to take any grad-school exams?

243
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,934
She wants to give you books for it.

244
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,373
If you keep saying,
"I feel sorry for myself, my life sucks,"

245
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,791
your life will suck.

246
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,253
If you don't think you're worth 100 won,

247
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,463
who's gonna think you're worth 1,000?

248
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,175
So instead of
pitying yourself all the time,

249
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,303
try to find the courage
to talk yourself up instead.

250
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,473
You kinda look like
Master Roshi right now.

251
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,350
Do you read <i>Dragon Ball?</i>

252
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,729
Look, just be glad you're not my family.

253
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,355
'Cause if you were my little brother…

254
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,315
Pow.

255
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,317
I'd beat some sense into you.

256
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,697
So you do know how to laugh.

257
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,825
Wow. I didn't know I could.

258
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,630
So that's the tree?

259
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,014
The biggest Christmas tree in Korea.

260
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,558
Ah.

261
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,978
I got this place
because of the hilltop view.

262
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,398
If we go all the way up, we'll see
the biggest Christmas tree in Korea.

263
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,108
Wow.

264
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,572
I think we've seen each other in the most
embarrassing situations of our lives.

265
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,659
I think you're like

266
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,120
that Christmas tree over there.

267
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,918
Trees do their job by just standing still
no matter where they are.

268
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,921
Yeah, how so?

269
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,090
Oh, you know.

270
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,509
Wherever a Christmas tree is,

271
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,303
if it's in an apartment
or a lonely corner store,

272
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
it always shines bright, no matter what,

273
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,601
and takes your breath away.

274
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,774
I thought I should say that
on a day like today.

275
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,651
It's like you said,

276
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,112
I'm talking… talking people up.

277
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,957
Hang on. Are you going away or something?

278
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,141
MY LOVE BY MY SIDE

279
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,609
MY LOVE BY MY SIDE
DAVICHI

280
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,706
<i>Student passenger.</i>
<i>This stop is Neung-dong Intersection.</i>

281
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,041
<i>Neung-dong Intersection.</i>

282
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,172
Ma'am,
this is Neung-dong Intersection.

283
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,423
This is your stop.

284
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,740
<i>There was a time</i>
<i>when everyone held their heads up.</i>

285
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,831
<i>A time when people</i>
<i>were open about their feelings.</i>

286
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,999
KIM HYUN-SIK BEST HITS

287
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:13,712
<i>A time when we looked at each other</i>
<i>instead of our cell phones.</i>

288
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,509
Like it?

289
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,677
I do.

290
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,221
When did you record this?

291
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,140
You said you like
Kim Hyun-sik more than me.

292
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,808
I was joking.

293
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,238
Tough day at work?

294
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,031
It must not be fun.

295
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
Nobody goes to work for fun.

296
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,329
Everyone needs a check.

297
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,333
Are you taking the bar for fun?

298
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,043
Even so,

299
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,504
was this what you wanted to do?

300
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,258
Hmm? Was it your dream
to work in an office?

301
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,135
Mm…

302
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,722
I just wanted to be free.

303
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,601
Always have.

304
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,855
Claiming independence as an individual

305
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,818
is actually
a pretty impressive accomplishment.

306
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,906
<i>But we never really</i>
<i>claimed independence.</i>

307
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,451
<i>College, graduation,</i>
<i>introducing our families.</i>

308
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,831
<i>Our parents were involved</i>
<i>in every aspect of our lives.</i>

309
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,126
Okay, that's it. We're leaving.

310
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,296
They're almost here.

311
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,132
The traffic is really bad in Seoul.

312
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,509
They know we took a flight to get here,
don't they?

313
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,929
He should've left
a little bit earlier.

314
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,348
How bad could the traffic be?

315
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,062
Geum-myeong,
why are you being so anxious, dear?

316
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,273
You always tell me to relax.

317
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,941
You know what? Forget it.

318
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,819
Don't be like that. Don't start.

319
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,237
We should call it off.

320
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,039
Oh, I'm sorry we're late.

321
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,957
We hit traffic just as
we were getting close.

322
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, hello.

323
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,924
The traffic must've been awful.

324
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,594
I hope none of you got carsick
on the way here.

325
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,555
<i>Geum-myeong was overly polite that day.</i>

326
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,723
We're very late.

327
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,601
Oh, that's okay. It's all right.

328
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,773
<i>My mom told a woman</i>
<i>who never once apologized, "It's okay."</i>

329
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,859
<i>That was the dynamic in the room.</i>

330
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,488
We've met before. I'm Park Geum-myeong.

331
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,078
<i>That day,</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

332
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,498
<i>I saw how my dad hides his callouses</i>
<i>when he shakes your hand.</i>

333
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,166
I'm Geum-myeong's father,

334
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,168
Yang Gwan-sik.

335
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,966
Eventually, the parents let the kids
have their way.

336
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,718
I knew my wife would come around.

337
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,554
If he wants to get married,
let's get things moving.

338
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,432
Dating a girl for too long isn't
very polite on the man's part, is it?

339
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,267
Think of the time she loses.

340
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,478
Well, Yeong-beom is in no hurry.

341
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,939
- Listen.
- Uh, Father?

342
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,190
Thanks.

343
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,651
I've been thinking. When they're married,

344
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,487
they should really start
calling each other "honey."

345
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,697
It'd be a bit weird
to hear my son calling his wife

346
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,368
"Geum-myeong" all the time
since that's my name too.

347
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,954
It would be much better
if she had a different name.

348
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,459
Help yourselves.

349
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,924
<i>It's my fault.</i>
<i>I'm the one who taught her that.</i>

350
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,640
<i>She's only doing what she saw growing up.</i>

351
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,522
Let's eat.

352
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,607
Let's eat.

353
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,278
Aren't you bringing out <i>sungnyung?</i>

354
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,323
<i>My precious child.</i>

355
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,201
<i>I should have shown her a better way.</i>

356
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,787
Here, have some steamed fish.

357
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,248
<i>It broke my heart</i>
<i>to see that my daughter</i>

358
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,708
<i>had turned out exactly like me.</i>

359
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,881
Mmm.

360
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,386
We have a few dates
in mind for the wedding in Jeju.

361
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,263
Did you not tell them?

362
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,143
Why are you looking at him?

363
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,479
Uh, Mom, I thought I told you--

364
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,648
I'm afraid
having two weddings is unacceptable.

365
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,400
We'd be a laughing stock.

366
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,695
I can't have my son being paraded
down there like a show monkey.

367
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,699
I understand
that the island has its own customs,

368
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,952
but Geum-myeong will be
a part of our family now, not yours.

369
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,288
I think her new family takes priority,
don't you?

370
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,174
So in any case,
we should choose one place.

371
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,636
Would you like to have it in Jeju?
We're willing to give up Seoul.

372
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,847
No, uh, we should have it in Seoul.

373
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:20,018
You'd be free from household chores
from now on. Congrats.

374
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,481
I doubt it.
Look at how she ladled your soup.

375
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,026
We have our work cut out for us, don't we?

376
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,157
I'm not sure she can handle managing
our household when she knows so little.

377
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,700
Well,

378
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,161
that might be a bit much.

379
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,205
She still has her job, after all.

380
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,624
Yes, it would.
Which is why she'll stop working.

381
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,876
Won't you?

382
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,921
Mother, can we talk about this some--

383
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,506
I wasn't speaking to you, son.

384
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,260
Oh! I haven't tried the <i>sungnyung.</i>

385
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,636
I…

386
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,263
Oh, sure.

387
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,145
I hope you know how to ladle
<i>sungnyung </i>at least.

388
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,401
Most eldest daughters
do housework quite well.

389
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,860
Geum-myeong is a bit different.

390
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,529
It's strange.

391
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,531
As long as she can make a decent stew.

392
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,088
Peas. I want some peas, Mommy.

393
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,382
Peas. Peas. Let's have some peas.

394
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,806
Huh?

395
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,603
<i>Mom never forgot the moment</i>
<i>Dad turned around for her that day.</i>

396
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,690
<i>His family always said</i>
<i>he was the first husband to turn around</i>

397
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,651
<i>and eat with the table behind him</i>
<i>in Dodong-ri history.</i>

398
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,820
I want to eat at this table from now on.

399
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,488
Why?

400
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,033
<i>My Dad</i>
<i>was picking his own battles,</i>

401
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,117
You insolent son.

402
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,787
<i>And he never left Mom alone</i>
<i>on the battlefield.</i>

403
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,082
I wanna eat at this table with you, Mom.

404
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,585
Dogs are better. Dogs.

405
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,462
<i>As I was ladling </i>sungnyung,

406
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,173
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>Dad's choice to turn around that day</i>

407
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,300
<i>was nothing short of revolutionary.</i>

408
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,511
I'll take over. I'm great at ladling.

409
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,306
No, stop it. Just sit down.

410
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,266
It's okay. Let me do it.

411
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,854
Here.

412
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,985
- You really don't have to.
- Please eat.

413
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,788
Geum-myeong,
you know nothing about housework

414
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,040
because your mother does it all for you,

415
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,541
doesn't she?

416
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,965
I couldn't bring myself to teach her.

417
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,968
She's too precious.

418
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,513
She's our darling girl.

419
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,395
That's why I chose not to teach her.

420
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,329
No, no. We'll be all right.

421
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,957
You should just give
your parents a ride instead.

422
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,751
We prefer the subway anyway. Just go.

423
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,294
I'll call a taxi for you, at least.

424
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,631
Oh, no, we couldn't.
Seoul has too many cars as it is.

425
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,007
The traffic will make us late.

426
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,093
Just take a taxi, Mom?

427
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,889
Take a taxi, I said.

428
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,321
Thanks for today. We'll see you.

429
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,115
Bye, Geum-myeong.

430
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:03,992
Bye.

431
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,618
Bye.

432
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,956
Goodbye, please get home safe.

433
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,376
Bye, Geum-myeong.
Take care. We'll call you.

434
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,170
I don't want you to worry about a thing.

435
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,298
There's nothing you can't handle.
I know that for sure.

436
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,758
Let's go. Come on.

437
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,386
Bye, Geum-myeong.
I'll call you when I'm home.

438
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,889
Have a safe trip.

439
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,280
Mom's crying right now.

440
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,951
It's my fault, isn't it?

441
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,415
You're just like a little child.

442
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,001
You're innocent and sweet.

443
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,141
My goodness, Geum-myeong.

444
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,936
It turns out you're something
of an indoor plant, aren't you?

445
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,896
- Mother.
- "Mother," what?

446
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,816
You keep interrupting
every time I open my mouth.

447
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,485
What, are you upset
you didn't take her side even more?

448
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,570
Could we please not do this right now?

449
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,530
Please?

450
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,827
Your mother has some nerve
to speak to me that way.

451
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,411
Too precious for housework?

452
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,040
She only said that to get back at me.
I was against it in the first place.

453
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,792
- Mother, please!
- What?

454
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,046
You know, Mother,

455
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,590
you say I'm an indoor plant.

456
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,886
- That's exactly what I am.
- Hey!

457
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,638
It's true.

458
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,392
I grew up in the safety of a greenhouse

459
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,563
and cared for like
the most precious thing in the world.

460
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,231
So for my parents' sake…

461
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:03,736
I'm asking if you could
please be gentle with me.

462
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,449
I don't like to see them cry.

463
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,799
I didn't
send her to college just to ladle soup.

464
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,761
She's never had an issue speaking up
so why can't she stand up to his mother?

465
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,973
Why'd you do it?

466
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,104
You couldn't stand it, could you?

467
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,109
I wanted to show she has parents too.

468
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,652
Parents that support her!

469
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,239
So you wanted to send a message.

470
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,408
You certainly held back.

471
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,745
I kinda expected you
to call it off right there.

472
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,748
I wanted to a thousand times over.

473
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,709
But I couldn't hurt our girl like that.

474
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,547
She loves this boy,
and she's more than good enough for him.

475
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,258
No doubt about it.

476
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,429
I'm gonna help her through this.
I'm going to handle all of it.

477
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,390
I'm going to make sure
that family can never say

478
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,934
her dowry wasn't good enough.

479
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,561
I won't let them crush her.

480
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,689
Do you hear me, Gwan-sik? I won't!

481
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,363
I know, honey. I know that.

482
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,539
I told you we should've taken a taxi.

483
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,459
His mom hates it when people are late.
She hates waiting.

484
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,920
I can't believe I'm doing this.

485
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,799
- Mom, hurry!
- What, is she your boss now?

486
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,592
Come on, we have to cross.

487
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,053
- I'm not going.
- Mom, come on.

488
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,972
I told you my feet hurt, didn't I?

489
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,099
I told you we should've taken a taxi,
didn't I?

490
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,018
Is she holding a stopwatch
to see when we arrive?

491
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,228
So what if we're late?

492
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,565
Seriously, they were an hour late
to our first dinner, weren't they?

493
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,526
Ugh, Mom.

494
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,111
What is wrong with you?!

495
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,571
Why do you care so much?
What do you owe her?

496
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,366
You always act like
you're the boss at home.

497
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,370
So what does it mean if you let
that family treat you like nothing?

498
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,039
That means me and your father
are less than nothing!

499
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,503
Oh, how gorgeous.
You look beautiful.

500
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,214
Pink looks so good on you.

501
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,341
I could have sworn
you were in your thirties.

502
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,761
There's no way I look 30. No way.

503
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,556
Let's go with pink, then.

504
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,560
We had another shade of pink somewhere.

505
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,811
Hmm.

506
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,981
If you're not going to help me choose,
why did you come?

507
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,067
Um…

508
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,279
What?

509
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,701
- Don't you want flowers on it?
- Do you think?

510
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,454
Okay, let's see
what florals we have in pink.

511
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,497
Oh, I dunno.

512
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,208
I don't wanna look too flashy.

513
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,377
What, do you have another daughter?

514
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,797
You'll be the mother of the bride
only once, so

515
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,716
do everything you want.

516
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,217
Well…

517
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,931
I've always liked those cute ones

518
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,517
that have a bunch of tiny flowers in rows.

519
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,771
I remember Cheol-yong's mother
wore a <i>hanbok </i>like this

520
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,189
on his wedding day.

521
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,150
So you wanna be flashy, after all.

522
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,611
Of course we can add floral patterns.

523
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,864
People might mistake
your mother for the bride.

524
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,326
Your mom is so young, isn't she?

525
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,162
Let's go with the one before.
The dark brown.

526
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,958
But, ma'am, are you sure?
The pink is a much better color on her.

527
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,669
Are you the one getting married?

528
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,754
Uh…

529
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,173
I want this emerald color.

530
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,176
Oh, uh, Mother?

531
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,345
My mom really likes pink, so--

532
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,763
Who wears pink these days?

533
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,141
You're not the only one inviting guests.

534
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,812
Thank goodness I'm here
getting you through this.

535
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,313
Thank goodness.

536
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,415
I thought,
since you kept turning down our gift,

537
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,501
you might like this instead.

538
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,255
There's no need.

539
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,382
Oh, well, uh,

540
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,928
if you let us know
what you'd like to get as dowry, we could…

541
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,222
It's all right. I appreciate the thought.

542
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,141
But, uh,

543
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,727
why only appreciate the thought?

544
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,980
Please. You can tell me what it is.

545
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,194
I'd appreciate it
if you would at least take…

546
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,781
Fine, then. I'll take it.

547
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:14,088
I know my Geum-myeong
may not be everything you'd hoped,

548
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,175
but she's thoughtful.

549
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,343
She has a big heart.

550
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,595
You'll see. Mm.

551
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,431
At least I hope so.

552
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,185
And you know,
I really do, uh, like your son.

553
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,980
And more than that,
my daughter really likes him.

554
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,817
It's very clear he cares for her.
Anyone can see that.

555
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,903
So I can't help liking him.

556
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,740
- Can I be honest with you?
- Uh, yes?

557
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,908
The truth is, Ms. Oh,

558
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,869
I have these thoughts
that I can no longer keep to myself.

559
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,246
Hm.

560
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,793
Oh!

561
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,796
Why are you so late?

562
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,965
- Things are awkward enough.
- Why are you out here?

563
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,176
I was worried you wouldn't find the place.

564
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,221
They're alone right now?

565
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,432
Yeah. Why? Is that a problem?

566
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,518
Jeez, your hair is crazy.

567
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,063
- Where is it? Which way?
- It's right over here.

568
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,481
- This way?
- Yes.

569
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:14,815
What's wrong?

570
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,527
There's no mother who will hold
their tongue for the sake of their child.

571
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,905
I think I'll regret it
for the rest of my life

572
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,449
if I go through with this
without saying anything.

573
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,993
I see.

574
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,079
I propose this.

575
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,373
Let's stop this wedding, Ms. Oh.

576
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,001
I've tried so hard to let go of my pride,

577
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,212
but you understand me as a mother.

578
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,130
You know what my son is.

579
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,549
He is everything I have.

580
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,344
He's my work of art.

581
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,764
I'm sorry for saying this,

582
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,434
but Geum-myeong doesn't check off
all the boxes for me.

583
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,438
Is that what you want for her?
To join a family that's not fond of her?

584
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,861
Convince Geum-myeong,
and I'll tell my son.

585
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,863
Let's find a way to stop this wedding.

586
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,573
I'm sure it's for the best.

587
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,244
Right?

588
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,878
I just don't get…

589
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,968
what it is you don't like
about Geum-myeong.

590
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,742
You didn't say a thing the entire meal.

591
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,120
- Yeong-beom was losing his mind.
- So what if he was?

592
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,706
Do you really like him that much?

593
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,915
What?

594
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,043
I just don't know what
you like about that boy?

595
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,128
What, do you not like him?

596
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,631
- No, I don't like him.
- Why?

597
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,801
I just don't.

598
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,720
I mean, what's so special about him?

599
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,556
It's not like he's passed the bar exam.

600
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,267
He doesn't amount to anything so far,
so who cares?

601
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,020
Oh yeah? What about me, then?

602
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,480
How am I any better?

603
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,648
You couldn't say a thing to his mom
about your dress,

604
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,068
so you must think
I'm even more worthless than he is.

605
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,487
Not at all. I would never think that.

606
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,489
Okay, then why couldn't you
say anything to her?

607
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,074
Why are you bending over backwards--

608
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,909
Because I want her to like my daughter!

609
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,161
I don't want her to be cold to you.

610
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,497
I don't think you're less than he is. No!

611
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,668
How could you even think I felt like that?
I've never heard such a load of crap.

612
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,383
Wait.

613
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,636
Did his mom say something to you?

614
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,435
I couldn't even send you to kindergarten

615
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,646
without worrying
if you'd get along with the other kids.

616
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,941
How can I lash out at that woman
when I know you're joining her family?

617
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,152
Then lash out. Stop pretending!

618
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,075
It's your decision.

619
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,577
No one else's.

620
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,122
Just make the right choice for my sake.

621
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,084
Because if your dad and I
have to watch you get hurt by that woman,

622
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,585
we'll be devastated, Geum-myeong.

623
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,715
<i>At my house,</i>
<i>I was the bratty child.</i>

624
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,302
<i>At his house,</i>
<i>I would become the black sheep.</i>

625
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,097
<i>- Everything was my fault.</i>
- Mother.

626
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,182
This is your doing.

627
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,560
I told you, it was my decision.

628
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,936
I can think for myself.

629
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,647
Geum-myeong, do you have a house?

630
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,773
Do you have assets?

631
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,403
No? Did you think luring Yeong-beom away
would get you all of that?

632
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,989
This is exactly why I'm moving out, Mom.
You're making it so hard.

633
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,908
I'm sure you nagged at him endlessly
until he agreed.

634
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,411
You think you have him
wrapped around your finger.

635
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,829
Mom, did you hear what I said?

636
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,746
Mother.

637
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,625
I never asked Yeong-beom
to move out of your house once.

638
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,586
Oh, I'm sure. God, you're sneaky.

639
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,214
<i>When I didn't react</i>
<i>to her attacks at all…</i>

640
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,257
Mom, go home.

641
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,009
Was it your mother?

642
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,261
<i>…she always crossed the line.</i>

643
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,598
I was quite blunt with her
on how I felt about you.

644
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,350
Is she that determined
to make Yeong-beom her son-in-law?

645
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,103
- Mother, go home. Please.
- Let go!

646
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,649
What do you mean, hmm?
What'd you say to her?

647
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,819
Did your mother not tell you?

648
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:33,115
My goodness. She really wants you
to join this family, doesn't she?

649
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,326
- Mother!
- What did you say to her?

650
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,871
I told her we should both
stop the wedding.

651
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,123
Can I not say what I think?

652
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,378
<i>She's as snobby as they come,</i>

653
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,672
turning up her nose at you like that.

654
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,967
I think she's comparing herself
to you because you still look pretty.

655
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,344
It's obvious.

656
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,096
That's why she gets the emerald dress
while you get brown.

657
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,724
I'd be more than happy
to wear the ugliest <i>hanbok </i>in the world

658
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,434
a thousand times over

659
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,270
if it meant she'd treat
Geum-myeong a little better.

660
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,147
Who could hate Geum-myeong anyway?

661
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,859
All her teachers loved her,
and I'm sure she'll learn to like her.

662
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,946
You know, when she had…
she had that horse-faced teacher

663
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,281
that made her bring him coal
for the furnace every day.

664
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,826
Eventually, he gave Geum-myeong
the Best Character Award.

665
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,995
I had to pay him 30,000 won

666
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,456
to bribe him.

667
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:27,962
I made sure our children always took a few
extra rolls of <i>gimbap </i>with them to school.

668
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,423
I would tell them to share
what they didn't eat with their teachers.

669
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,803
I thought it would protect our kids
from the pain of having

670
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,471
a class presidency stolen.

671
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,307
Now you hope her dowry
will do the same thing?

672
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,144
There's nothing more upsetting
than your child being bullied.

673
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,147
Why can't that woman see that?

674
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,900
Why does she have to be so cruel?

675
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,444
What do you mean?
Did that stuck-up lady say something?

676
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,071
No.

677
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,782
It's just…

678
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,910
She's always so harsh to Geum-myeong.

679
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,583
Geum-myeong can handle herself.
She'll be all right.

680
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,876
No, I can tell she won't.

681
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,004
She'll be on edge
for the rest of her life.

682
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,422
I know how that feels.

683
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,756
Geum-myeong is different.

684
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,426
<i>We always taught her to respect herself.</i>

685
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:21,056
I see you're dead set on driving
a wedge between me and my son.

686
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,725
You can't even hide your intentions.

687
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,602
Something else your mother
didn't teach you?

688
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,937
Mom, why are you doing this?

689
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,106
How far are you going to go?

690
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,066
I haven't said half of what I should!

691
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,986
It's only my good manners
that have held me back.

692
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,279
Your manners?

693
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,074
Oh, Mother, just stop it.
You never treated us kindly.

694
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,910
Not me or anyone in my family.

695
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,913
- I think I've had enough.
- What?

696
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,458
I've put up with you not because my family

697
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,419
is any less than yours is.

698
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,922
If I spoke up for myself,
you'd humiliate your son,

699
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,842
and my father's hands
aren't embarrassing either.

700
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,220
I would what?!

701
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,264
Humiliate him?

702
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,808
Child, when I first met your father,

703
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,311
I thought he had the hands
of a day laborer!

704
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,897
- That's enough!
- My parents aren't embarrassing at all.

705
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,358
Nothing about my family embarrasses me.

706
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:16,570
This entire time,
I was… way more embarrassed

707
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,365
of what I was putting up with
to join yours.

708
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,787
Please, you think this wedding
could happen without me?

709
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,248
If I want to stop it, I will. Got it?

710
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,417
Got it?

711
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,092
Don't worry.

712
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,222
I'm calling it off.

713
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,437
If I stay with you,
my parents' hearts will break.

714
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,480
I can't do it.

715
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,569
You're breaking off the engagement?

716
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,489
You? You?

717
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,617
Come on, Mom,
why can't you just stop it? Please!

718
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,910
Don't you tell me to stop!

719
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,788
Your life is my life!

720
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,125
You're my son! My pride and joy!
You are my whole life!

721
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,835
But his life is his own.

722
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,715
No matter how often you say it's yours,

723
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,010
Yeong-beom has to live it.

724
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,974
<i>I just don't understand.</i>

725
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,602
What is it you don't like
about my Geum-myeong?

726
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,648
This is marriage we're talking about.

727
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,067
No offense to her,

728
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,405
but marriage works best when the families
are a good fit for each other.

729
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,956
I never let my daughter go hungry
a day in her life.

730
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,876
I worked hard to make sure
she could do anything she wanted.

731
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,755
But you didn't ever really think she could
escape the shadow of her poverty.

732
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,007
That's impossible, isn't it?

733
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,010
How could a flower
that has lived in the shade

734
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,138
ever grow as tall as one in the sunlight?

735
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,855
Please excuse my bluntness…

736
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,360
but now that I've spoken my mind,

737
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,698
I feel like a huge weight
has finally been lifted off my shoulders.

738
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,246
Have you considered

739
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,458
what will happen
now that you have confessed that?

740
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,542
I can tell you.

741
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,965
It'll break your son's heart, ma'am.

742
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,929
It will crush your son for sure.

743
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,737
<i>You've robbed your son</i>
<i>of his own life.</i>

744
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,665
<i>Hi, my name is Pororo.</i>

745
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,624
<i>Hi, Pororo.</i>

746
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:18,710
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

747
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,129
<i>Uh, Pororo, what are you doing?</i>

748
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,678
<i>This morning,</i>
<i>Pope Francis arrived in Korea,</i>

749
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,389
<i>marking his first time ever</i>
<i>visiting the country.</i>

750
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,307
<i>Kim Seon-hee reports on the scene.</i>

751
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,978
<i>Pope Francis has arrived</i>
<i>in his private plane</i>

752
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,980
<i>at Seoul Air Base in Seongnam.</i>

753
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,189
<i>Of all the popes…</i>

754
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,650
<i>As extreme heat</i>
<i>overwhelms the nation,</i>

755
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,486
<i>we are seeing a steep increase</i>
<i>in the number of heat stroke patients.</i>

756
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,448
<i>According to the Korean Disease Control</i>
<i>and Prevention Agency, for two months…</i>

757
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,550
You're still awake.

758
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,345
You've been drinking again.

759
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,557
Good night.

760
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,435
Please stop this.

761
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,561
Please.

762
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,772
Why is it so difficult with her?

763
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,358
It's not fair.

764
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,069
Why should I live this way?

765
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,072
Go to bed.

766
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,825
After what I went through to raise you?

767
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,370
This is how your wife treats me.

768
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,667
You only ever feel sorry for yourself.

769
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,754
Don't you?

770
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,884
What do you have to complain about?

771
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,011
You were always too sensitive.

772
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,431
Everything I've ever done was for you.

773
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,974
I lived for your sake.

774
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,726
You know it's true.

775
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,938
If you'd married her,
you'd be even more unhappy now.

776
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,693
How can you do this to me?

777
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,989
How can you humiliate me like this?

778
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,993
You are my whole life.

779
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,955
My whole life.

780
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,623
It's not your life. It's mine.

781
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,919
Or it was until I was stupid enough
to let you take it away.

782
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,758
I suppose you're happy, at least.

783
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,678
You're happy, aren't you?

784
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,304
See that?

785
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,101
You're the only one
who smiled at my wedding.

786
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,362
<i>As it turned out,</i>

787
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,948
<i>my first love</i>
<i>didn't have a fairy tale ending.</i>

788
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:57,953
Geum-myeong.

789
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:01,999
Hey, wait.

790
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,753
Did your mom tell you she made my mom cry?

791
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,340
Well, she did.

792
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,261
Now we don't ever have to cry
because of her again.

793
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,603
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

794
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,022
<i>This morning at 2:00 a.m.,</i>

795
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,983
<i>the North Korean leader</i>
<i>Kim Il-sung passed away.</i>

796
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,943
<i>It is with the deepest regret</i>

797
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,611
<i>that we announce to the people</i>

798
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,031
<i>of the glorious</i>
<i>Democratic Republic of Korea</i>

799
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,742
<i>that our great leader,</i>
<i>Comrade Kim Il-sung,</i>

800
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:42,622
<i>passed away suddenly at 2:00 a.m.</i>
<i>on July 8th, 1994.</i>

801
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,541
<i>How is it possible</i>

802
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:48,128
<i>that our great leader's heart of steel,</i>

803
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:52,507
<i>so impervious to external attacks</i>
<i>and filled with love for his people,</i>

804
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,302
<i>has truly stopped beating?</i>

805
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,724
<i>After 34 hours</i>
<i>from the news of Kim Il-sung's death,</i>

806
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,767
<i>the Pyongyang Broadcast…</i>

807
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,102
<i>The day I broke off</i>
<i>our engagement…</i>

808
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:09,274
<i>I cried like a North Korean spy.</i>

809
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,249
Geum-myeong.

810
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,927
<i>We dated for seven years.</i>

811
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,680
<i>It took us a year to break up.</i>

812
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,768
Like I said, the only option you have now
is to be a good son.

813
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,271
You can't just be nice to everyone
and just hope it works out.

814
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,107
Everyone around you is miserable,

815
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,110
and you just stand there
acting nice. It's annoying!

816
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,112
Do you have to say it that way?

817
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,614
<i>We jabbed at each other.</i>

818
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,949
<i>We hurt each other.</i>

819
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,286
But you've never lived with me.
We should at least try it out.

820
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,414
I already know how it feels
to be treated like dirt by your family.

821
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,837
You don't want me in your life anymore?

822
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,756
Can you mean that?

823
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,385
Sure! In fact, once you're out of my life,
I'll be happier than ever.

824
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,030
I never asked you to hug me.

825
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,324
<i>We yearned for each other</i>

826
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,744
<i>and poured out our hearts with no regrets.</i>

827
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,270
It's cold.

828
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,814
You'll freeze.

829
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,951
It's past midnight.

830
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,080
I can still give you flowers,

831
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,498
right?

832
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,715
Why are you giving me flowers
on your birthday?

833
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,052
It's a birthday present for me.

834
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,350
Man, it's cold.

835
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,018
So cold.

836
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,315
Yeong-beom.

837
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,238
You have to stop.

838
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,746
I can't take it.

839
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,706
It's too draining.

840
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:21,925
Are we done, then?

841
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,512
You don't love me anymore?

842
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,188
Say something.

843
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,107
I do.

844
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,360
How could I not?

845
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:44,114
I do love you very much.

846
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,243
But I love myself as well.

847
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,913
I can't do this anymore.

848
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,876
- I can't stand being sad.
- I'll never see my mom again.

849
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,630
- Geum-myeong.
- Why would I want you to live like that?

850
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,174
How can I be happy
if your heart is aching?

851
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,318
I think if we became a family,

852
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,863
we would just end up resenting each other.

853
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,032
But I can't let you go.

854
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,950
What am I gonna do?

855
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,457
You'll be okay.

856
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,793
As I always say…

857
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,214
life goes on for the living.

858
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,012
I am sorry.

859
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,641
I'm sorry I was so mean to you at the end.

860
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,394
No, I'm sorry.

861
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,563
I was so…

862
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,690
So…

863
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,612
Thank you.

864
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,448
Thank you for everything.

865
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,121
Thank you for everything, Yeong-beom.

866
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,796
They say you'll always remember
your first love.

867
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,340
I'm glad it's you.

868
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,385
Do we have to do this?

869
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,512
Is it really over?

870
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,778
Come on.

871
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,281
I can't.

872
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,202
Hold me one last time?

873
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,718
I'll miss your smell.

874
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,805
If anything happens,

875
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,141
you give me a call, okay?

876
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,103
You have no one in Seoul.

877
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,188
Promise me you'll call.

878
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,317
I will.

879
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,778
I promise.

880
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,824
So does this mean…

881
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,495
Does this mean we'll never see each other?

882
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,165
How can we?

883
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,835
How can we not?

884
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,422
This is so unfair.

885
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,507
This is so unfair.

886
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,969
<i>He was my first love, my family,</i>

887
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,639
<i>and my best friend in Seoul</i>

888
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,933
<i>when I didn't know a soul.</i>

889
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:05,273
<i>As I said my final goodbye</i>
<i>to the boy who was closest to me,</i>

890
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,151
<i>I felt like the Little Prince</i>

891
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,071
<i>leaving his rose behind</i>
<i>on his tiny planet.</i>

892
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:03,326
"JUST GET READY AND GO,
RIDE THE MOMENT WITH ALL YOU HAVE."
