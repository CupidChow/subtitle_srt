00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,443
<i>Chaos ensues</i>
<i>after the implementation</i>

3
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,236
<i>of the new waste disposal policy.</i>

4
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,364
<i>People are getting rid of things</i>
<i>they should not throw away</i>

5
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,742
<i>out of fear that they may end up</i>
<i>having to pay fines.</i>

6
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,160
FROM YEONG-BEOM
TO GEUM-MYEONG

7
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,162
I couldn't just throw it away.

8
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,456
I had to pay for the garbage bags I used.

9
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,666
I made sure to be respectful.

10
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,836
<i>Residents put warning signs</i>
<i>in front of their homes…</i>

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,715
Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
Hey, hurry, hurry, hurry.

12
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,676
Hot, hot, hot.

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,178
WEDDING INVITATION

14
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,435
I tore off the limbs
and cut up one of the big stuffies

15
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,021
so the pieces would go
in the bags they need to.

16
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,023
It all felt really wrong.

17
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,858
You're out of kimchi too?

18
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,860
Everyone knows I ended the engagement?

19
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,363
Oh, what in the world do you eat?

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,949
At least you're still alive.

21
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,534
Life goes on for the living.

22
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,954
Get off your rear end.
Your mom called me again.

23
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,873
She wants to make sure you're okay.

24
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:08,211
You heard of pain spots, huh?
Areas of the body that feel pain.

25
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,297
There's pain spots in our organs.

26
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,634
In all of our internal organs.

27
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,557
Heartache isn't simply a thing you say.

28
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,017
There's pain you actually feel

29
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,686
where your heart is.

30
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,896
Your heart

31
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:32,694
feels… this tight pain.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,280
It's true.

33
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,658
Call your family, you ungrateful child.

34
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,372
<i>I couldn't see</i>
<i>my best friend of seven years any longer,</i>

35
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,500
<i>but my best friend of 20 years</i>

36
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,461
<i>was still by my side.</i>

37
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,256
Geum-myeong, are you okay?

38
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,885
You have food to eat?
You have nothing in your fridge, huh?

39
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,220
Do you want me there?

40
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,847
I made a lot of <i>jangjorim.</i>

41
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,852
Even married couples can part ways.
High-class people do what they want.

42
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,731
So, uh, he isn't calling you, right?

43
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,026
Okay, okay. I won't mention that guy.

44
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,736
Sure, good night.

45
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,491
She always says, "Forget it." Forget what?

46
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,037
She say that again?

47
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,708
Well, she only ever says "Forget it,"
or "Mom, you don't have to know."

48
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,628
I wish she'd talk to me

49
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,421
or that she'd use me to vent.

50
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,589
She's a grown-up now.

51
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,425
What's a mother for otherwise?

52
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,720
No one worries more about her than I do.

53
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,015
Do you feel bad
she's not asking you for help anymore?

54
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,018
She'd always ask me first.

55
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,104
Now she tells her problems
to everyone else

56
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,856
and turns me away.

57
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,191
Traitor.

58
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,069
There's no betrayal worse than that.

59
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,489
<i>You're the only one I'm telling, Mom.</i>

60
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,408
This is a secret,

61
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,787
but I like Kim Jeong-geun.

62
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,539
I might even marry him.

63
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,087
Why?

64
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,880
Why do you like Jeong-geun?

65
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,883
He's cute.
The cutest boy in our neighborhood.

66
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,844
Goodness.

67
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,557
Geum-myeong, you're a big girl now. Huh?

68
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,810
You have a crush on a boy.

69
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,273
You know what though?

70
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,444
I do wish
you'd mature a little more slowly.

71
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,738
Just be a child longer.

72
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,656
Why?

73
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,993
Because you're adorable right now.

74
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,036
You're so adorable now.

75
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,333
<i>Geum-myeong.</i>

76
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,547
You tell me all your secrets
when you get bigger, okay? Hmm?

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,341
You're my secret keeper, Mom.
Of course I will.

78
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,884
- Of course.
- Oh yeah?

79
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,220
I'm closest to you, Mommy.

80
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,930
Even more than Kim Jeong-geun?

81
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,766
Goodness.

82
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,437
Mom, who's your best friend?

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,523
Who me? Oh, I think that'd be you.

84
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,444
Do you……have a crush on anyone?

85
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,364
Oh, my crush is Yang Gwan-sik.

86
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:24,949
Over me?

87
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,953
Well, no, you're my favorite
in the whole wide world.

88
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,664
Good, because you're my favorite, Mom.

89
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,874
Really?

90
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,918
Yeah, that's why
I bought Popeye for a snack.

91
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,922
Because you said once
Popeye was your favorite snack.

92
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,591
Apollo is my favorite.

93
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,675
Oh, dear.

94
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,510
You got Popeye 'cause of that?

95
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,430
I decided not to buy the Apollos this time

96
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,766
because I love you so much, Mommy.

97
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,393
Oh gosh.

98
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,353
POPEYE

99
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,645
Thank you.

100
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,814
I'm very glad to hear that.

101
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,734
<i>We used to be</i>
<i>each other's world.</i>

102
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,072
<i>One left that world behind</i>
<i>while the other stuck around.</i>

103
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,158
And what do you want for dinner?
Anything you like.

104
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,077
I want <i>jangjorim.</i>

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,703
I'll make you <i>jangjorim </i>for…

106
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,748
<i>My mom remained</i>
<i>the sweetest mother in the world,</i>

107
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,459
<i>and she was always my secret keeper.</i>

108
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,317
What are we going to do
with all this food?

109
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,237
- It's no fun just us two.
- Mm.

110
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,949
She has an office job.
It's hard for her to get here on weekends.

111
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,617
It'd be tiring for her.

112
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,414
<i>After the thousandth time</i>
<i>she called to ask if I had eaten,</i>

113
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,375
<i>I started feeling really hungry.</i>

114
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,838
Mom, I'm hungry.

115
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,965
<i>I missed my mom's food.</i>

116
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,885
Hi, baby. You didn't say you were coming.

117
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,137
I used vacation days.

118
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,182
Ah, but why didn't you call me?
It's pretty late.

119
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,308
I'm hungry, Mom.

120
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,103
Yeah! We've got food. We do.

121
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,772
I'll make steamed rice.
Just wait.

122
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,986
Honey.

123
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,989
I just made a whole pot of <i>jangjorim.</i>

124
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,701
Your dad's been peeling quail eggs
to give to you since yesterday.

125
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:36,706
Oh! <i>Chonggak </i>kimchi too.
I have well-fermented <i>chonggak </i>kimchi.

126
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,791
You like it sour, right?

127
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,545
Eun-myeong likes it fresh,
and you want it sour.

128
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,382
I always have to keep them separate.
You guys always give me more to do.

129
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,300
Goodness.

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,638
The floor's cold. Wait. Here.

131
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,190
<i>The truth is, it was obvious.</i>

132
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,649
<i>It was obvious</i>

133
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,612
<i>how forlorn it was inside that apartment,</i>

134
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,574
<i>just five minutes ago,</i>
<i>how lonely they must've felt.</i>

135
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,659
All right. All right.

136
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,164
If you'd called me,
I would've come to the airport.

137
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,292
Why, so you can wait there
an hour earlier?

138
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,679
Eat and go back to sleep, okay?

139
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,933
Oh my God. I'm not a pig in a cage.

140
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,978
<i>As a child,</i>
<i>when I fell, she gave me candy.</i>

141
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:41,896
Here.

142
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,316
Oh, Mom,
you know broccoli's just the worst.

143
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,193
It'll help you digest.

144
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,320
I think

145
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,241
we should have noodles
for a simple lunch. Here.

146
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,869
This is a simple lunch?

147
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,206
Then what would
a complicated one look like?

148
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,667
<i>After I recovered from the mumps,</i>

149
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,126
<i>she made me pork cutlet.</i>

150
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,962
You love spicy noodles.

151
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:10,841
Geum-myeong.

152
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,886
Steamed bun, your favorite.

153
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,263
You love red beans.

154
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,891
<i>They were eager</i>
<i>to do one more thing</i>

155
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,810
<i>for their heartbroken daughter.</i>

156
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,312
Yeah.

157
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,108
Yeah, well, she arrived out of the blue.

158
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,653
She missed her mother,
that's why.

159
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,280
Yes, son.

160
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,831
Amberjack.

161
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,292
Look what I got. Real amberjack.

162
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,711
Is there fake amberjack?

163
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,672
<i>They took care of me yet again.</i>

164
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,800
Dad, I'm going to gain weight.

165
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,385
Whoa, amberjack. Great!

166
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,389
<i>They made sure</i>
<i>that I didn't lose a single pound.</i>

167
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,100
Really?

168
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,810
Yeah, sure.

169
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,064
- Oh, it's so cold.
- Hey. Your brother wants to say hi.

170
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,901
What?

171
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,362
You miss me
now that you're a soldier, huh?

172
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,240
"Oh, Geum-myeong."

173
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,909
<i>You got dumped, huh?</i>
<i>He dumped you, right?</i>

174
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,911
<i>"Oh, Yeong-beom."</i>

175
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,335
<i>In that refuge, where I was</i>
<i>comfortable but also uncomfortable,</i>

176
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,964
<i>I hibernated like a bear in the winter</i>
<i>to regain my strength.</i>

177
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,104
Geum-myeong.

178
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,774
Geum-myeong.

179
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,568
Geum-myeong.

180
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,487
Huh? What?

181
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,782
Wanna sleep longer?

182
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,370
Uh, are you tired?

183
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,538
Yeah.

184
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,083
Come on, get up.

185
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,794
I wanna sleep longer.

186
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,338
Come, let's go somewhere together.

187
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,173
Can we just go later?

188
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,472
Ah, Dad! I'm tired!

189
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,435
Okay, go back to sleep.

190
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,663
<i>I'll never know why</i>
<i>I realized it at that moment.</i>

191
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,881
<i>When I went on trips with Yeong-beom,</i>

192
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,967
<i>I'd happily wake up at 4:00 a.m.</i>

193
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,973
You knew I'd come out, right?

194
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,434
Why do I have a life jacket on?

195
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,699
GEUMEUNDONG

196
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,121
Are you not fishing today?

197
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,292
- Well, I'm off so…
- You're off?

198
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,419
Apparently, there are no clouds.

199
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,631
There it is. There.

200
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,345
You woke me up
to look at the sunrise?

201
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,972
You know that condo
next to the restaurant?

202
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,226
To see it from here,
you have to pay 30,000 won a night.

203
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,978
You're getting to see it for free
just because of your dad.

204
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,856
Oh, I can give you 30,000 won.

205
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,316
Pay me, then.

206
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,613
It feels wonderful to look at the sunrise.

207
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,574
Oh, every time I see
the sun come up, I pray

208
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,411
so that all things will go well
for you and your brother, Geum-myeong.

209
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,832
You see the sunrise every morning?

210
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,750
Are you out here so early every day?

211
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,380
You don't ever want to sleep in?

212
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,842
Oh, sure. I can't think of anybody
that doesn't wanna sleep in.

213
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,886
So then why do you sail out
every morning this early?

214
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,808
How can you live like this every day?

215
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,186
Maybe if I sleep a little less,

216
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,398
the two of you will get to sleep
a little more.

217
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,527
That's why
I wake up so early, you see.

218
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,028
<i>If I think about it,</i>

219
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,199
<i>there was never a day</i>
<i>when Dad woke up later than I did.</i>

220
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,035
Don't you have lotion?

221
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,913
Wow, Mom only packed things you love.

222
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,708
That's for you, Dad. It's rolled omelet.

223
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,168
Your Mom was so excited
to prepare food for you.

224
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,672
Does it ever get scary?

225
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,133
Well, of course.

226
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,845
There's nothing in the world
scarier than the ocean.

227
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,515
So you just keep coming out here?
Even though you're scared?

228
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,226
When the winds are strong, and I'm afraid,

229
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,395
I always look at one thing.

230
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,313
The lighthouse?

231
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,564
Oh, no.

232
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,650
Look. You see that small light over there?

233
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,361
That's a fishing boat.

234
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,780
The only beacon I need.

235
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,619
See, if I believe people on that boat
are as lonely and scared as I am,

236
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,620
it's less scary.

237
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,622
It's less scary
knowing someone's with you here.

238
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,463
Me and your mom
are never going to leave you,

239
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,381
just like that boat.

240
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,302
If ever you're hungry,
don't hesitate to come home.

241
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,388
Dad, um,

242
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,475
I need you to be honest.

243
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,895
You're embarrassed in front of
all the neighbors because you

244
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,105
already mailed the invitations.

245
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,565
I'm not embarrassed.

246
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,567
I would've been
if you'd married into that family.

247
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,321
I knew things wouldn't work out
between you. I knew it.

248
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,907
It'll work out, dear. I know it will.

249
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,159
But you always say that.

250
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,205
Just because you say it
doesn't mean it'll actually happen.

251
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,873
What else can I do

252
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,834
except to just wish you the best?

253
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,630
If you were born into
a prosperous, successful house,

254
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,132
they would've done everything for you,

255
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,719
all kinds of things, and they'd make sure

256
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,429
that you'd never get hurt.

257
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,057
Then, in the next life, don't be my dad.

258
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,319
Don't be my dad ever again.

259
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,488
Save yourself the trouble.

260
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,824
I'm glad to do it.

261
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,117
I loved it.

262
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,787
I never thought of it as trouble
because of you. No trouble at all.

263
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,083
Dad, if you have 100 of something,
you always give me 120.

264
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,918
Why do you keep doing that?

265
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,754
Life wouldn't be easier with a rich dad.

266
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,590
I wouldn't trade you
for Hyundai's founder.

267
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,928
I think my knees are better now.

268
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,848
Oh, please go to the hospital
if you're in pain.

269
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,767
You think cooling patches
are going to solve the problem?

270
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,394
This is so annoying.

271
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,230
You're so annoying.

272
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,654
I don't mind
if you're not marrying anyone.

273
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:17,036
And if I'm being honest with you,
I… I think it's even better. I like it.

274
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,328
I'll get hitched.

275
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,956
You've always loved being married.

276
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,042
Why tell me not to get married? Why?

277
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,905
<i>That day,</i>
<i>I saw the sun differently.</i>

278
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,741
<i>It brought a new light</i>

279
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,160
<i>over the lonely ocean.</i>

280
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,456
<i>But it was only when</i>
<i>my own sun began setting</i>

281
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:08,045
<i>that I realized how warm it was</i>
<i>to sit by my dad's side.</i>

282
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,934
Hey, there.

283
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,019
Why were you on the boat?

284
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,772
I watched the sun come up with Dad.

285
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,024
Where's your mother? Is she not working?

286
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,193
It was just me and my dad.

287
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,695
- You two?
- Yes.

288
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,447
- Just you two?
- Yes.

289
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,871
Aren't you still in college or something?

290
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,915
- Dad, do you need help?
- Nah.

291
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,000
You look exactly like your mother did.

292
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,128
Do you study hard?

293
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,796
- I'm working, actually.
- Yeah? Where?

294
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,965
- Major corporation.
- Which major corporation? Jeez.

295
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,763
Ah, give it. It's Sunday.
You going out there?

296
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,057
Why does it matter what day it is
to a fine sailor?

297
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,393
Hey, put your shoes on properly.

298
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,688
What? Your wife kicked you out again?

299
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,940
Again? The hell do you know?

300
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,817
What do you know about my family?

301
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,944
Each family has a different dynamic, see?

302
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,030
Why is he so rude to you, Dad?
He can't talk to you that way.

303
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:21,160
Hey, your dad may be a captain now,
but you know what?

304
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,497
He used to pull in the net,
cook noodles for me, and--

305
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,418
Okay, that's really great.
However, you're both captains now.

306
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,419
Yeah, you know we are.

307
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,257
Eun-myeong broke up
with that man's daughter, right?

308
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,178
That family. I'm telling you, man.
That family.

309
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,263
Good God.

310
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,600
Gwan-sik won't be working for you

311
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,351
ever again.

312
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,899
Okay, don't do it then. Just go away, man.
Just go home. Just leave now.

313
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,533
Why would this spoiled brat hold his hand?
She's grown up.

314
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,619
SANDGLASS

315
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,394
So, uh,

316
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,022
what are you up to these days?

317
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,857
Are you doing okay at work?

318
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,990
Selling makeup there, right?
Or did you sell your brain to the TV?

319
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,544
So,

320
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,548
uh, if you, uh, have time off some day,

321
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,425
you wanna

322
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,594
take a morning boat ride?

323
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:04,888
Huh?

324
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,723
You know, when

325
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,892
the sun rises, and--

326
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,143
Hire somebody.

327
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,645
What?

328
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,188
I'm busy too.

329
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,366
You send that boy letters now? Huh?

330
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,160
If you ever visit him, you're dead meat.

331
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,496
- He won't see me even if I go.
- Say what?

332
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,668
You went there, you sneaky little--
I'm sending that boy to a military prison.

333
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,004
I have a friend who's a general.

334
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,344
Wow.

335
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,139
You are so shameless.

336
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,932
Excuse me?

337
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,685
You go around meeting women of all kinds.

338
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,813
I think it's hilarious
that you tell me I can't see one guy.

339
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,772
How dare you!

340
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,275
You brat. What the hell do you know?

341
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,361
All your kids saw the way you lived.
No one's taking you seriously.

342
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,447
Just keep saying, "How dare you."

343
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,782
Why you… I'm gonna shave
all your hair, you little--

344
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,409
Fine, just shave my head.

345
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,329
You've already ruined my life anyhow.

346
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,873
Keep me here forever, then. I dare you.

347
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,547
Don't be slamming that door on me, girl!

348
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,049
It was the wind!

349
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,097
- Honey.
- What?

350
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,432
I'm too loud again?

351
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,683
Did you buy this place?

352
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,770
And tell me, what the hell
have you been studying?

353
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,481
Uh, for dinner…

354
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,815
Whatever you like.

355
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,487
Actually, can you… go out for dinner?

356
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,489
Why do you have to eat at home?

357
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,866
It's a real bother.

358
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,120
It's a real bother?

359
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,206
It's a real bother?

360
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,458
Why is it a bother?

361
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,252
Put up your hands
if you think I'm a bother.

362
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,386
T.O. I LOVE EUN-MYEONG

363
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,513
WE'RE FAR YET CLOSE
I WILL ALWAYS WAIT FOR YOU

364
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,431
I DO WAT I WANT
DON'T TELL ME WAT TO DO

365
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,728
You all get to eat
because of me.

366
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,896
Got it?

367
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,856
Because of me!

368
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,655
They have a kumquat field.

369
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,741
It's two and a half acres, I think.
Or was it four acres?

370
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,787
That's a pretty huge difference,
two and a half to four acres.

371
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,207
Know what they say about
that family's dad? Have you heard?

372
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,668
He's Seogwipo's Yang Gwan-sik, they say.

373
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,711
He's a good husband.

374
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,215
And they have more than a kumquat field.

375
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:49,136
They own a mountain, and it's a huge one.

376
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,431
And what, you've got a crush on that guy?

377
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,683
Why are we talking about
the kumquat family?

378
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,936
They have a kumquat field.
They own a mountain.

379
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,897
They also have a son
who's a public official.

380
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,777
He went to college in Seoul. He's 29.

381
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,824
It's important to observe a man's father.

382
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,994
He would've learned
how to treat his family from him.

383
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,246
That why Eun-myeong's
such an expert at dating?

384
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,666
The kumquat man's son
resembles Choi Jae-sung.

385
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,002
You need a handsome man.

386
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,130
You end up fighting less
if you marry a handsome one.

387
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,341
Mom, it's been a year
since I broke off the engagement.

388
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,553
So what? You did nothing wrong.

389
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,472
Everyone in town knows we broke up, right?

390
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,558
If I find someone new already,
how will that make me look?

391
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,145
Who cares if they know?

392
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,734
Not everybody in town knows about it.

393
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,119
Why didn't you send these?

394
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,996
Well, I…

395
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,291
I knew you wouldn't follow through.

396
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,168
What?

397
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,837
That's how I raised you, dear.

398
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,722
<i>If she can't even</i>
<i>ride a tricycle,</i>

399
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,350
she'll just live in the kitchen
her whole life.

400
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,436
I want Geum-myeong to really have it all,

401
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,147
and I want her to really prosper
and to blossom.

402
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,899
Geum-myeong should be thriving.

403
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,194
I don't want her to set the table forever.

404
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,530
I want her to flip the table over instead.

405
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,126
Geum-myeong, go faster. Faster!

406
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,378
Quick, quick, quick!

407
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,382
Yes, go!

408
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,758
Faster!

409
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,555
<i>Well,</i>
<i>why didn't you flip the table over?</i>

410
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,640
<i>Did you not ever feel like it?</i>

411
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,225
Seven.

412
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,728
Eight.

413
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,399
<i>Why did you have to be</i>
<i>the nice one all the time?</i>

414
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,442
<i>It's not like there was a prize for it.</i>

415
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,236
ONE BASKET OF TANGERINES
80 WON FOR TEN

416
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,240
That's 11.

417
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,201
Huh?

418
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,578
That's 11.

419
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,496
<i>Because of you.</i>

420
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,414
Oh.

421
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,000
<i>Because of you.</i>

422
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,256
<i>You were looking at me</i>
<i>with those sweet, twinkling eyes.</i>

423
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,259
How could I not be aware of my actions?

424
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,517
One thing I realized
after I gave birth to you and your brother

425
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,688
is that the life I'm going to live then

426
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,566
is one that you children would remember.

427
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,361
You guys will talk about

428
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,990
how I lived my life at the funeral.

429
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,951
Once I realized that,

430
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,164
I knew I had to be conscious
of my actions all the time.

431
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,045
<i>I realized</i>
<i>why the invitation said,</i>

432
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:14,341
<i>"The Elder Daughter of</i>
<i>Yang Gwan-sik and Oh Ae-sun."</i>

433
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,886
<i>I was their Geum-myeong.</i>

434
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,387
Geum-myeong.

435
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,807
You did absolutely nothing wrong.

436
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,310
It's fortunate you avoided a pile of crap.

437
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,397
Yeong-beom isn't crap, you know.

438
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,900
I know. I know he isn't.

439
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,319
You never have to tell me that. I know.

440
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,280
I know you still cry inside.

441
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,869
When you were a child,
you cried for four days

442
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,830
when Kim Jeong-geun wouldn't sit with you.

443
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,835
How do you remember his name?

444
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,962
How can I forget it?

445
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,299
My best friend
entrusted me with her secret.

446
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:13,817
It's like boxing up your precious memories
and burying them underneath.

447
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,984
Right?

448
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,655
Sometimes, it's enjoyable to take it out
once in a while to look at.

449
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,910
They always say first love
is for the memories, dear.

450
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,621
Oh, Mom, what do you know?

451
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,957
Your first love lives here with you.

452
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:34,963
You need to enjoy life like you did
when you used to ride your tricycle.

453
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,049
Not enjoying youth
is a massive waste, you know?

454
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,387
My goodness.

455
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,348
Your hands are still so soft.

456
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,354
Just like fresh flower petals, dear.

457
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,272
So new.

458
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,737
Speak for yourself.

459
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,614
Do something with your talent.

460
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,824
Write your poems.

461
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,953
I write every day.

462
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,289
Over there is my poem collection.

463
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:14,002
1995 HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNT BOOK
OH AE-SUN

464
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,881
<i>It was as though</i>
<i>I was a new outfit</i>

465
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,467
<i>that had just been made</i>
<i>by a skillful tailor.</i>

466
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,763
<i>When I left, I was in pieces,</i>

467
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,891
<i>but when I returned,</i>
<i>I was stitched back together.</i>

468
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,966
She was only here a few days,

469
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,220
but the house feels emptier than before.

470
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,266
Well, it's just been
the two of us for a while now.

471
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,823
Oh my goodness.

472
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,457
She didn't have to do this. She didn't…

473
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,628
She's so sweet.

474
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,964
She's so sweet.

475
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,049
FOR THE FOOD
WRITE YOUR POEM

476
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,637
<i>In our family,</i>
<i>receiving so much</i>

477
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,473
<i>and repaying so little was acceptable,</i>

478
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,100
<i>and unfairly so.</i>

479
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,269
Oh, my bones.

480
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,980
My bones ache more and more every day.

481
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,656
Being a mother
is a losing game, isn't it?

482
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:12,537
Chung-su did <i>haenyeo </i>work
until after she was 80.

483
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,415
They didn't find
one decent outfit for her coffin.

484
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,544
All her children did was
to snatch money out of her hands.

485
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,172
They were never bothered
that they took away her life's work.

486
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,550
They blew all her money,
but they cried as if

487
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,218
they were ever good to her.

488
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,014
But still, she also said
that we witnessed a president

489
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,891
who put on a prison uniform.

490
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:38,021
At least she kept on working without
anyone's help until the end of her life.

491
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:38,980
Oh God.

492
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,734
A dog wouldn't even envy
a <i>haenyeo's </i>troubles.

493
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,195
But it's not about adversity.
It's all about character.

494
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,866
Ae-sun also needs
to draw the line somewhere.

495
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,411
Everyone and their moms get cared for.
Of course she's always out of money.

496
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,496
Should I try to stop her?

497
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,998
Leave them alone.

498
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,833
Once we leave this life,

499
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,045
Ae-sun won't have any friends
or her aunts for that matter.

500
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,381
We can't always defend her.
She must fend for herself for once.

501
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,346
Uh…

502
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,351
Well, at least I'm not gonna take it.
I hit back.

503
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,731
Can't you be just a little nicer to folks?

504
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,194
I guess I'm saying I don't get
why you have such good fortunes.

505
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,321
My brother is a total fool for you.

506
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,239
Your daughter is successful.

507
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,284
These annoying <i>haenyeo </i>kind of
gave you this store for free.

508
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,411
- Am I invisible?
- Know what else?

509
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,790
I, your wonderful sister-in-law,
constantly take good care of your in-laws,

510
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,250
- Don't I?
- I was wondering when you'd use that one.

511
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,379
In principle, my brother's the eldest.
Why should I be caretaker?

512
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,255
But you're not caretaker, are you?

513
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,842
You had your parents sell their house
because of your business there.

514
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,971
Now you're making your aging mom
take care of your kids.

515
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,890
Who's the caretaker? Please, girl.

516
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,600
That's my mom's most hated auntie.

517
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,646
Listen, when you were a child,
Ae-sun fed you three square meals a day.

518
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,649
You wouldn't be able to repay her
for what she did for you.

519
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,569
- You think Ae-sun's money is your money?
- Why are you butting in?

520
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,988
Hey!

521
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,114
What is that?

522
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,408
What did you bring this time?

523
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,454
ELVAN WELLNESS MAT

524
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,463
Ae-sun,
if Gwan-sik sleeps on that mat,

525
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,133
his knee will be all better,
and he won't ever get cancer.

526
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,218
You know I gave you a big discount, right?

527
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,178
Couldn't take advantage like that.

528
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,639
I think of you first
if I find anything special.

529
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,394
If Gwan-sik places his finger on the mat
while it's warm, the infrared from it…

530
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,106
Oh… What?
I can't give you a refund for that one.

531
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,402
You said your mother's back
has been hurting a lot.

532
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,779
Don't lie and say that
you bought it for her.

533
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,157
Say that I'm the one who got it. Hmm?

534
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,659
If I'm spending money,
I should get bragging rights.

535
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,663
You want
to embarrass me with this.

536
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,748
Go.

537
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,000
Go.

538
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,463
Hey. Please don't bring anything
to sell next time, okay?

539
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,424
Ae-sun.

540
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,968
Character molds destiny, right?

541
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,389
What, you envy my good fortunes now, huh?

542
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:19,891
Well…

543
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,520
Look. You took all my cash again today.

544
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,485
Come eat another one.

545
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,487
One more bite. One more.

546
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,116
Oh, why do I deserve pain like this?

547
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,746
Who knew that I'd still be babysitting
my grandkids at this age?

548
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,291
When you're done,
can you unplug these? Prevents fires.

549
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,543
Gyeong-ok blames me
for not dressing her kids

550
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,504
with enough clothes
whenever they get sick.

551
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,131
This is worse than taking care of
your dad's parents.

552
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,426
- Ya!
- Seo Dong-min, stand guard.

553
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,221
Attention! Atten-hut! Atten-hut!

554
00:34:59,138 --> 00:34:59,972
Oh God.

555
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,434
Why come here if you're just gonna
sit around without making a sound?

556
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,270
Go. Go home. Go to your wife.

557
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,356
No one's been on my side my whole life.

558
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,818
Your back. How is it?

559
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,320
Please worry about your wife's back.

560
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,739
Well, inflammation patches
won't be enough.

561
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,325
You need to get acupuncture.

562
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,410
I'll take you for treatment.

563
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,789
I must say I was probably
on Ae-sun's side a lot.

564
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,875
No one on this planet
would be so loyal to one's wife

565
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,086
against his mom as often as you.

566
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,754
Listen.

567
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,841
I wouldn't trade you
for Hyundai's founder.

568
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,262
I wouldn't trade you if Shin Saimdang
was available for a mother.

569
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,638
Hey. Pick your foot up.

570
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,598
Why would Shin Saimdang
wanna be your mother?

571
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,559
She's got a preference too, I'm sure.

572
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,812
I won't count on you
or your wife to treat me better.

573
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,190
There is no mother that can take pride in
having a fool for a son.

574
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,526
Even Shin Saimdang would turn her back.

575
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,321
Here, here.

576
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,200
If your disrespectful son is here,

577
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,369
you should make him clean.

578
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,079
Who implied that son? Who?

579
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,541
- Who said that?
- You said dogs are better, remember?

580
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,376
Everyone in town knows that.

581
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,587
Tell them to quit talking crap.

582
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,213
You've done good things.

583
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,969
I don't know anything about
losing a child,

584
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,762
but I know what it's like to lose parents.

585
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,100
Watching you move on was honorable enough.

586
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,603
Everybody knows about that.

587
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,498
Mom. Hey.

588
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,336
It's Jong-gu. Jong-gu.
Your eldest grandson Jong-gu is here.

589
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,422
Grandma, it's Jong-gu. Remember me?

590
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,884
You don't recognize him, Mom?

591
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,261
Jong-gu, the pathetic, dull dimwit.

592
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,181
Mom, you taught Jong-gu how to write.

593
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:09,518
He didn't know how to multiply,
but now he's a card shark, you know?

594
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,315
Chun-ok, you know who I am? Huh?

595
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,358
Who am I?

596
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,734
Chun-ok. Hey.

597
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,530
Oh my.

598
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,533
Mom, you used to be so well-versed
in writing when you were younger.

599
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,202
Now your mind is fading.

600
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,163
Why is it that your mind
has left you already?

601
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,706
Oh, hello.

602
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,959
Hi, Ae-sun.

603
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,126
Come on. Come on in.

604
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,628
When did you come down?

605
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,756
I thought maybe I might never celebrate
my sister's birthday again.

606
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,008
I'm afraid this might be her last.

607
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,136
Grandma.

608
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
It's me. Ae-sun.

609
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,433
She doesn't know.
She's forgotten everyone.

610
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,729
Ae-sun, I'm really, really upset.

611
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,189
She doesn't remember me.

612
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,149
Goodness.

613
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,610
Grandma.

614
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,153
Oh.

615
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,783
Grandma, I brought
<i>senbei </i>crackers for you. <i>Senbei. </i>Huh?

616
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,204
- After you finish up your meal, you can--
- I remember.

617
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,422
Han-gyu's daughter.

618
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,011
My Han-gyu's daughter.

619
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,812
So,

620
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,982
have you been well?

621
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,300
Grandma, I guess I've been

622
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,969
Han-gyu's daughter to you all along.

623
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,850
You always forget my name,
but not that I'm Han-gyu's daughter.

624
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,228
Does that make you upset?

625
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,522
I love it.

626
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,693
I really appreciate it.

627
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,028
What?

628
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,280
What is the matter?

629
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,032
What is it?

630
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,909
What's bothering you?

631
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:31,994
What is it?

632
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,788
Child, what is the matter?

633
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,540
Child, what is the matter?

634
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,917
Nothing's the matter.

635
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,460
It's nothing at all.

636
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,672
If something were wrong,
you'd buy her a new boat.

637
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,802
When Han-gyu's daughter said
she was having a hard time,

638
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,221
you bought her a whole new boat.

639
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,681
Mother, I'm struggling too.

640
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,143
Your 60-year-old daughter-in-law
is also suffering.

641
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,104
So will you get me a boat as well?

642
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,313
Stop it.

643
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,235
Grandma, listen,

644
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,363
would you like to… to live with us?

645
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,280
Oh, no.

646
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,658
But you should come live with us.

647
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,159
No.

648
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,704
You know Gwan-sik is a good man.

649
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,332
He'll do anything I ask of him.

650
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,209
I said no.

651
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,210
Why not?

652
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,379
Not your home, darling.

653
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,508
Am I a stranger to you?

654
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,510
Is that really what you think, huh?

655
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:37,101
Grandma, how about I get you new dentures?

656
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,894
How's that sound?

657
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,982
I'm just going to pull money
out of my savings

658
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,568
and then get you some nice dentures.

659
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,113
You'll get dentures?

660
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,448
Mm-hmm.

661
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,324
You helped me back then

662
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,828
when I needed some new teeth
when I was a child, remember?

663
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,706
<i>♪ Leopard cub with no teeth ♪</i>

664
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,250
<i>♪ Don't go near the water now ♪</i>

665
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,669

00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,963

00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>♪ Caw, caw, they will hide ♪</i>

668
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,676
Let's see. Let's see.
I'm not pulling the tooth.

669
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,137
I just wanna see if I did it right.

670
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,223
Don't lie to me.
You're gonna pull it out, aren't you?

671
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,227
You're so smart,
just like your dad. Silly girl.

672
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,688
Let's pull that tooth.
That crow is waiting for your tooth.

673
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,191
Wait a bit. Wait a bit.
Just let me count to ten.

674
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,444
It's not bad. It doesn't hurt at all.

675
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,238
Pull his tooth first.
His tooth is loose too.

676
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,157
So I'm sure if it's painful or not.

677
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,076
Oh, his parents can pull his tooth out.

678
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,875
Why do you have a string
wrapped around your tooth?

679
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,835
Go and ask your family to do it.

680
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,420
You're here to sell hairtail.

681
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,631
Why are you getting
your tooth pulled here?

682
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,842
Gwan-sik, you do it first.

683
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,219
Can you please be first?

684
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,640
Can you see if it's painful, please?

685
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,852
Aren't you scared?

686
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,271
So you're ready to do it?

687
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,152
Oh, my girl. You're so intelligent.

688
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,197
Where did you find a silly guy like him?

689
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,658
Good work. Good work.

690
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,494
Hmm?

691
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,955
- Did you pull it?
- Feel anything?

692
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,585
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>we lose our teeth for the second time.</i>

693
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,090
I can't believe that the little child

694
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,552
without her front teeth
grew up to be so big.

695
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,845
The old black crows

696
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,390
won't bring you
a new tooth now, will they?

697
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,017
Let me take care of your teeth.

698
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,896
Something is the matter, my child.

699
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,527
I know how you feel.

700
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,738
I know exactly how you feel.

701
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,033
There are times

702
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,829
when I want to call out his name
at the top of my lungs…

703
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,500
and cry my heart out.

704
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,546
After holding it in

705
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,090
for all of my life,

706
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,802
saying Han-gyu's name is…

707
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,182
even more difficult to utter than ever.

708
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,438
And I feel terrible that I can't.

709
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,862
So I know

710
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,448
how you feel.

711
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,785
I know exactly how you feel.

712
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,030
<i>I know how you feel.</i>

713
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,908
<i>Hearing her words,</i>

714
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,119
<i>Mom laid her head on her grandmother's lap</i>

715
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,708
<i>and cried her heart out for a long time.</i>

716
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,173
Why won't you go with her?

717
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,801
She's your favorite son,
Han-gyu's daughter.

718
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,720
Oh, I really wonder how much this cost.

719
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,683
What? Are you uncomfortable with her?

720
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,351
Her husband and her?

721
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,687
This is expensive, isn't it?

722
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,648
Hey, you bought her a boat,
so why feel bad about this?

723
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,025
Nothing wrong with your granddaughter
buying you this.

724
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,114
I didn't do that much for her.

725
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,242
I never even gave her any croaker.

726
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,619
How can I live there?

727
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,122
Shit, nobody forgets those damn croakers.

728
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,542
You poured all of
your life savings into her, didn't you?

729
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,377
Oh.

730
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,879
In the hereafter…

731
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,676
all I'll hear is Han-gyu screaming at me.

732
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,096
All I'll get to hear

733
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,765
is my son screaming at me.

734
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,778
It's warm. Oh.

735
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,909
I think I'll sleep well tonight.

736
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,227
Oh, look. Mama.

737
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,480
It's as if you're a newlywed.

738
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,983
Your children will remember you
by this photo.

739
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,694
Pink is a good color for you.

740
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,739
Did I do well, my dear?

741
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,118
Have I paid off your debt?

742
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,664
Yes, truly. Of course.

743
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,250
You did so well.

744
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,922
Oh, I'm running out of breath.

745
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,050
I think I'm just about ready.

746
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,056
You may breathe your last one now.

747
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,810
So,

748
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,394
was it

749
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,982
a wonderful life or… or a hard one?

750
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,623
<i>It was a wonderful life.</i>

751
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,709
<i>I got to live a life with all my children.</i>

752
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,422
<i>It was an amazing life.</i>

753
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,855
I can't believe it.

754
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,691
KIM CHUN-OK OF GIMHAE KIM CLAN
MAY YOU FINALLY BE REUNITED

755
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:44,236
Now we say goodbye
to someone every season.

756
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,363
Right?

757
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,285
We don't know what we had

758
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,829
until they're gone, one after another.

759
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,082
Both my parents.

760
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,836
<i>Your grandmother, your father.</i>

761
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,932
You're right, Mother.

762
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,312
My son's wife was definitely
a cut above your son's wife.

763
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,564
Yeah.

764
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:26,862
Oh.

765
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,822
I did it again.

766
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,574
I brought three spoons.

767
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,536
<i>Auntie Chung-su.</i>

768
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,917
<i>My grandmother.</i>

769
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:45,589
You really should've gotten… dentures.

770
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,508
<i>And…</i>

771
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,355
I hope you and I

772
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,274
leave this life together.

773
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,362
Hmm?

774
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,667
<i>We think</i>
<i>we arrive at the picnic together,</i>

775
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,836
<i>but people all leave at different times.</i>

776
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,923
<i>Just as the tides ebb and flow,</i>

777
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,801
<i>some leave us,</i>

778
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,428
<i>but some…</i>

779
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,807
Oh, he's here.

780
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,850
The door's open. It's open.

781
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,435
<i>…return to us.</i>

782
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:46,149
Oh!
Oh, dear. I'm so, so happy you're back.

783
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,986
Oh, Eun-myeong. It is so nice to see you.

784
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,737
Thanks so much, son.

785
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,867
Oh, well, why are you just standing there?
Get in here.

786
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,453
I made all kinds of things for you.

787
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,123
What is it? You wanna salute us?

788
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,960
Salute?

789
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,505
Hang on. Why do you have so much luggage?

790
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,179
Mother.

791
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,806
Okay. Go. Go ahead.

792
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,897
What, you bring something?

793
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:27,649
What?

794
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,112
Hi. It's been a while.

795
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,406
Oh my.

796
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,037
Hi, Hyeon-suk.

797
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,247
Bu Hyeon-suk, right?

798
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,171
Oh my. Oh, you… you guys

799
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,508
are still… still together. Wow.

800
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,261
So what's this about?

801
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,186
Uh…

802
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,481
Wh… why do you have
your hand on your b… belly?

803
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,108
Oh, oh, please don't scare me like that,
Hyeon-suk. What?

804
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,278
- Mother, Father.
- What? What? What? What?

805
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,864
No. Aah! I… I don't want to hear this.

806
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,324
You're Grandma and Grandpa.

807
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,410
Oh my God.

808
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,291
You're Han-bang's grandmother.

809
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,586
<i>In spite of</i>
<i>the coldest weather,</i>

810
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,089
<i>new buds always fight their way</i>
<i>out of the ground.</i>

811
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,217
- You idiotic, shameful… where is it?
<i>- Just like their springtime…</i>

812
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,677
- Oh.
<i>- …their winter arrived too soon.</i>

813
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,513
Where is it? You idiot.

814
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,640
You were supposed to serve your country.

815
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,603
Huh?

816
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:30,897
Stop!

817
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,644
Geum-myeong, wait!

818
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,700
Yang Geum-myeong!

819
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,578
Yang Geum-myeong!

820
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,002
Geum-myeong!

821
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:39,007
<i>A winter</i>
<i>as sparkly as their spring</i>

822
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,967
<i>was on its way.</i>

823
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,057
A GLISTENING WINTER

824
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:38,895
"JUST GET READY AND GO,
RIDE THE MOMENT WITH ALL YOU HAVE."
