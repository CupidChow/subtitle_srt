1
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,871
Oh dear.

3
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,374
Poems aren't that hard.

4
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,795
Just write down what you'd like to say.

5
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,129
That's a poem.

6
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,300
<i>Ok-sim, make some food.</i>

7
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>Look here, I want some food.</i>

8
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>Mom, give me food. Food. Food.</i>

9
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,433
<i>Stop asking me for food.</i>

10
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,978
<i>Ok-sim's life has flown by,</i>
<i>just feeding her family.</i>

11
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,650
The words you've held
deep in your heart all your life.

12
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,029
<i>"Loyalty and Filial Piety"</i>
<i>by Lee Byeong-seon.</i>

13
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,991
<i>Eyes are fading, ears are fading.</i>

14
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:02,580
<i>Listen, my son and daughter,</i>
<i>my back is killing me.</i>

15
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>Come see me more and more.</i>

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,839
Someone hasn't been able to write
a single letter.

17
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,968
Just write down
what you want to say the most.

18
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,929
That'll be the best poem of your life.

19
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,201
<i>I had no idea back then</i>

20
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,454
<i>that I would ever turn 70.</i>

21
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,264
<i>I had no idea back then</i>…

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,685
<i>that what I'd want to say the most at 70</i>

23
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,564
<i>would be the word</i>
<i>I used to say all the time.</i>

24
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,524
Mom…

25
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,771
Mom.

26
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,613
Mom!

27
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,199
Mom!

28
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,164
Mom!

29
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,209
Mom!

30
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,212
Mom!

31
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,589
Come ashore quickly!

32
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,592
Why are you always the last one
to come ashore?

33
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,680
Seriously!

34
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,266
Is your daughter an abalone or something?

35
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,184
Why did you go back in?

36
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,020
Did you go back in there just to annoy me?

37
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,399
Mom!

38
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,777
Seaweed flourishes in the spring.
That willful soul won't leave the sea.

39
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,320
Ae-sun.

40
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,655
Stop shouting for your mom.

41
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,199
Take a look at Mr. Yang's cheeks instead!

42
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,953
It's just sunburn!

43
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,457
Why is Ae-sun the only one who can't see
his heart burning in the spring sunlight?

44
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,003
Seriously, think about it.

45
00:04:55,086 --> 00:05:00,341
If a <i>haenyeo</i>'s daughter wed a fishmonger,
wouldn't she own the whole sea of Jeju?

46
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,926
You're so annoying.

47
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,515
There she goes.

48
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,060
Did you get slapped?

49
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,645
Why are your cheeks always red?

50
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,316
Gwan-sik got rejected again.

51
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,745
She should've given birth
to an abalone instead of me.

52
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,247
Mr. Yang.

53
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,375
I have two conches. There you go.

54
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,128
Come on, give me a good price.

55
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,755
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,092
Did you even scoop red seaweed
off the Dragon King's throat?

57
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,054
Greed kills a <i>haenyeo,</i>
not her lack of knowledge of the sea.

58
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,182
Greed is what gets a <i>haenyeo.</i>

59
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,310
How is Granny Hallim doing?

60
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,729
Her breathing isn't improving.

61
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,315
Our nets are the lifeline
for the sick <i>haenyeo,</i>

62
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,359
so let's share and save her life.

63
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,652
Is there only seaweed here?

64
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,155
My mom told me to get some abalones.

65
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,531
They're in there. Find them.

66
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,034
Spring abalones are as tiny as rat poo.

67
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,036
There's nothing to eat.

68
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,666
Why don't you just give her everything?
Go ahead!

69
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,627
There she goes again, freaking out.

70
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,253
Granny Hallim has three sons.

71
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,506
Why is it on us to feed her?

72
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,385
Would I risk my life every day
diving to the underworld just to feed her?

73
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,723
I sell my breath to catch abalones
to feed my own kids, not some granny!

74
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,184
You think you're so clever?

75
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,144
Who taught you how to dive?

76
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,605
Who do you owe
for being able to feed your kids?

77
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,942
All of your families have hungry kids
waiting open-mouthed,

78
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,985
and you wanna take care
of a sick old woman?

79
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,488
There's no way
I'm giving my abalones away.

80
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,323
The thought alone angers me.

81
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,825
Count properly!

82
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,202
How did she get sick?

83
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,955
We'd do the same for you if you got sick.

84
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,541
I'm not going to get sick.

85
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,085
<i>Haenyeo </i>live and die together.
We can't do it alone.

86
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,130
If you're all so giving,
why live in service of the Dragon King?

87
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,052
You got a new husband for a better life,
but you're even more willful now.

88
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,056
You take care of a new husband
who leeches off you,

89
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,183
but you won't share
with the master <i>haenyeo?</i>

90
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,394
When we both fled here
and lived like beggars,

91
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,979
who taught us how to dive?

92
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,108
If you don't appreciate Granny Hallim,
you're worth less than a saury.

93
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,612
So did your husband's mouth droop
'cause you're better than a saury?

94
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,073
He slept in the cold!

95
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,784
Your husband's mouth drooped
because he couldn't eat.

96
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,287
Yet you run your mouth
like you're special?

97
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,707
Even if you're right,
someone worthy should say those things.

98
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,376
Your kids have different surnames.
How worthy are you?

99
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,044
- Enough!
- Gyeong-ja!

100
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,547
- Come on!
- I knew it.

101
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,550
We can't go home until they fight.

102
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,268
What? Not again!

103
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,146
What the hell… You damn bitch!

104
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,857
Crap! Damn you!

105
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,943
What are you… You damn bitch!

106
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,612
Damn it!

107
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,407
I shouldn't have brought her
when I fled here.

108
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,617
What a waste!

109
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,368
So why poke a puffer fish?

110
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,580
Why mess with someone
who lives out of spite?

111
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,458
What a damn waste!

112
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,294
Go home and kick your leech of a husband.

113
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,463
Don't kick someone else's stuff.

114
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,818
Is an abalone your daughter?

115
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,155
I got an award,
but all you do is look at abalones.

116
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,698
Why would you write a poem?

117
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,326
Does it get us an abalone or a conch?

118
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,370
Come on, give it a read!

119
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,497
I was runner-up in the writing contest.

120
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,582
Go show it to your grandmother.

121
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,417
The Oh family loves scholars.

122
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,757
Show them and demand,
"Help me get through school."

123
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,259
Grandma doesn't like me.

124
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,178
She says I look more like you every day,

125
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,264
so she doesn't want to see me.

126
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,641
Go to your home and eat there.

127
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,810
I told you I'm eating here.

128
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,145
Go! Your stepdad will be back soon.

129
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,147
So what if he is?

130
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,859
Can't I even eat the conch
and red seaweed my mom collected?

131
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,030
Oh's daughter should eat with the Ohs.
Why beg for food here?

132
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,824
Uncle doesn't let me have croakers.

133
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,703
He doesn't?

134
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:43,207
He says Oh Jong-gu always comes last
because I get full marks and win awards.

135
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,793
He says I take all the eldest son's luck.

136
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,422
It's not that I want to eat croaker.

137
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,676
It's just not fair
that he's like that with food.

138
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,345
I don't want to eat at all.

139
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,472
While I eat,

140
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,349
I keep choking.

141
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,061
Can't I just live here?

142
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,605
Can't I?

143
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,523
No chance?

144
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,111
- Never?
- Why would you choke?

145
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,237
You did nothing wrong.

146
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,615
Who's gonna like you
if you choke while eating?

147
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,951
Go.

148
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
I said go!

149
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,329
Go earn your own love.

150
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,955
Go find your own food.

151
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,000
Hey, you're here again, Sun-ae.

152
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,376
It's Ae-sun!

153
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,794
Are you stupid?

154
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,712
Ae-sun.

155
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,381
Are you staying for dinner?

156
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,133
No, I won't be eating.

157
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,024
That rascal.

158
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,448
Here, Dad.

159
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,619
She's like a thorn in my side.

160
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,539
<i>I heard smoking can kill</i>
<i>even the Dragon King.</i>

161
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,378
<i>It's a death wish for a </i>haenyeo <i>to smoke</i>
<i>when her life depends on breathing.</i>

162
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,012
Why don't you just bring her here?

163
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,850
I still think
you should just bring her here.

164
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,522
For someone with nothing,
you're so damn nosy.

165
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,066
Even if we take her in,
do we have a house or any money?

166
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,652
There's no room
in this little thatched rental.

167
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,197
How can you stop a child
from snuggling into its mother?

168
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,784
What if I take her in?
Will we raise her instead of cows?

169
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,286
Or make her look after her stepsiblings?

170
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,455
Blood is thicker than water.

171
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,502
You insist on staying here
so you can see your precious daughter.

172
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,005
And that kid walks all the way here
every chance she gets.

173
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,301
She's dying to see her mom.
What good is keeping her registered there?

174
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,054
It's just making you both suffer.

175
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,431
At least they have money.

176
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,599
She can finish her studies there.

177
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,476
Why make a girl study?

178
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,186
It will only cause her more stress.

179
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,900
I heard that <i>haenyeo </i>start learning
how to dive in their early teens.

180
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,571
Would you say that about your daughter?
Would you make your daughter dive?

181
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,704
These damn island women
jump at every word that's said.

182
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,998
I will never let her dive.

183
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,042
It's better to be born a cow
than a <i>haenyeo.</i>

184
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,130
I slog my guts out all day
and still have nothing to show for it.

185
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,214
It's discouraging.

186
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,842
So what's the point
of coming to live here?

187
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,720
That kind kid would be nothing
but a maid here.

188
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,555
I'll throw this away.

189
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,851
Reading it will only hurt you.

190
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,729
Why are you folding it?

191
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,273
Why would you fold the runner-up's work?

192
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,947
It's best not to read it.

193
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,463
GYONGGI NOODLE

194
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,223
It's how you write "stupid idiot."

195
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,368
Does he wanna die or what?

196
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,919
I only bought five.

197
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,963
One of them is free.

198
00:13:59,046 --> 00:13:59,964
Did your mom say so?

199
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,094
Did she say that?

200
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,598
There are six people in the family,
but you only ever buy five.

201
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,017
Do you make a fortune selling fish?

202
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,519
Nosy little brat.

203
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,022
That little punk.

204
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,524
Look here!

205
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,281
Ae-sun,
you need to soak the cauldron first.

206
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,367
What? Why come here?

207
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,383
There! Damn croakers!

208
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
Look here! Are you out of your mind?

209
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,388
Where do you think you are?

210
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,598
Are you saving croakers?

211
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,599
What are you saying?

212
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,183
Making a fortune off croakers?

213
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,354
Mother, she's also a daughter
in the Oh family.

214
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,690
Surely, she resembles her father!

215
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,775
Don't be like that.

216
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,235
Please don't.

217
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,446
Your son!

218
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,450
Your big brother is shedding
tears of blood from his grave!

219
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,368
You're the bad luck that killed him!

220
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,746
How dare you mention my brother's name!

221
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,169
What's up with you?
Are you possessed or something?

222
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,547
Is it my fault
your brother lived a short life?

223
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:28,010
You ought to be sorry
for giving her a father with a short life.

224
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,432
My daughter! I'm taking her back.

225
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,355
Screw washing dishes.

226
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,982
Unbelievable!

227
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,505
I'm glad he didn't feed me any croakers.
Now I get to live with you.

228
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,924
Do you like me?

229
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,137
Why do you like me?

230
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,472
Because you're my mom.

231
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,974
Goodness.

232
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,103
I like you because you're my mom.
Isn't that obvious?

233
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,106
If you like me, then grow up fast.

234
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,441
Grow up fast

235
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,444
and give me 100 hwan every day.

236
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,904
You read it?

237
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>"Stupid Abalone"</i>

238
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,168
<i>by Oh Ae-sun from class 3-8.</i>

239
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,505
<i>Abalone every day.</i>

240
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,174
<i>Abalone when it's stormy and gray.</i>

241
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,885
<i>Abalone over her daughter I'd say.</i>

242
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,472
<i>I hope to see you come ashore soon.</i>

243
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,475
<i>Why don't I see you when I see the moon?</i>

244
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,854
<i>Are there no abalones about,</i>

245
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,314
<i>Are you out of breath</i>
<i>searching for abalones,</i>

246
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,984
<i>Your daughter worries, starts to fret.</i>

247
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,279
<i>Catching no abalones makes Mom sweat.</i>

248
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,701
<i>The 100 hwan she earns</i>
<i>from selling an abalone.</i>

249
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,579
<i>I want to pay it so I can buy her day.</i>

250
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,123
<i>My mom whose back aches,</i>

251
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,208
<i>my mom who coughs.</i>

252
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,088
<i>With 100 hwan every day,</i>
<i>I want to let her rest.</i>

253
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,559
Do you have one?

254
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,603
A daughter like this?

255
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,731
How did I get so lucky?

256
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,741
Good grief.

257
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:15,010
Give me 100 hwan every day
so I don't have to dive.

258
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,725
I also want to spend the whole day
looking at my precious child.

259
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,522
- It was good enough to come second, right?
- Those blind fools.

260
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:28,941
Was it that bad?

261
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,818
Second place for that?

262
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,986
It should've come first!

263
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,760
Don't mistreat her. If you do,
you'll be kicked out, not her.

264
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:01,056
You may not be lucky with husbands,
but it seems like you are with your child.

265
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,016
This little rascal.

266
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,269
She's the biggest rascal.

267
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,729
Where else would you find
a rascal like this?

268
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,440
I wouldn't mind a rascal like that.

269
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,156
My parents were deep in debt.

270
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,825
I had to nurse my first husband.

271
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,411
And the new one is a freeloader.

272
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,663
I was destined to be a porter.

273
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,167
Everyone just wants to ride on my back…

274
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,006
but this kid, as tiny as a bean,
keeps getting off my back.

275
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,134
and offering to help carry my load.

276
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,974
That's why she's a rascal.

277
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,853
She gets to me the most,
so she's a rascal.

278
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,479
Just wait and see.

279
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,359
That rascal will take care
of your ancestral rites after you're gone.

280
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,822
A shameless mother like me
couldn't possibly ask for such things.

281
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,495
I won't let my precious child
carry a funeral palanquin.

282
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,124
I'll see her
in a dignitary palanquin later.

283
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,464
Even Confucius
couldn't write as well as her.

284
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,299
Ae-sun

285
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,261
is sure to make it big one day.

286
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
THE FIFTH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION

287
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,611
Thanks to my daughter,
I get to hold a big title.

288
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,657
You're the vice president,
so I'm the vice president's mom.

289
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,784
Should I hand out rice cakes?

290
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,911
I don't wanna be the vice president!

291
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,996
The fishing co-op is the same.

292
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,666
The deputy chief
is just as important as the chief.

293
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,543
If everyone wants to be chief,
who will be deputy?

294
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,255
Normally, the deputy has more power
than the chief.

295
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,007
Who on earth wants to become a deputy?

296
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,635
I've never even had a chance
to be a group leader.

297
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,514
I want to write in the family records
that you were the vice president.

298
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,141
Don't write it down! Absolutely not!

299
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,520
Actually, Oh Ae-sun was supposed
to be the president.

300
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,563
Right. I'm sure you think she was.

301
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,899
You should at least treat her
like a president.

302
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,195
Oh Ae-sun got 37 votes,
and Lee Man-ki got 28 votes.

303
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,197
Why is Lee Man-ki the president?

304
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,201
Why am I the vice president?
Why did they steal my president role?

305
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,744
"Steal"?

306
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,331
CLASS PRESIDENT ELECTION
OH AE-SUN, LEE MAN-KI

307
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,334
Don't you think you're being selfish?

308
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,461
But I'm the one who got 37 votes.

309
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,466
You have some nerve keeping this up.

310
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,179
Didn't you eat the cream buns
Man-ki's father gave out?

311
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,018
Didn't you scrub the floor
with the wax he provided?

312
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,937
I'm still the one who got 37 votes.

313
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:01,069
Those 37 who took everything
but didn't vote for Man-ki are unethical.

314
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,740
But wherever it may be,
a person at the top

315
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,827
should be competent both mentally
and financially, you know?

316
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,079
I'm the one who got 37 votes.

317
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,706
So what if you got 37 votes?

318
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,708
Do your 37 votes matter now?

319
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,128
In real life,
37 votes don't mean anything!

320
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,838
Between you and Man-ki,

321
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,676
there's something that goes
beyond just nine votes, okay?

322
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,810
It looks bad to be dragged down,
but stepping down preserves your dignity.

323
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,896
Sacrifice for the greater good.

324
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,856
The one who loses wins.

325
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,195
The one who loses loses.

326
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,822
The one who loses just loses!

327
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,699
Why am I the vice president?

328
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,034
Why?

329
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,410
Hey, quit it!

330
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,287
Why did you run for something like this?

331
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,748
Haven't you seen
the election posters on the wall?

332
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,167
You could lose everything
if you love titles.

333
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,877
I should be the president!

334
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,338
Give it back to me!

335
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,614
You caused a scene and stormed off
as if you'd never see us again.

336
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,573
You know what?

337
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,409
I'm speaking honestly here.

338
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,702
I think this family needs to wake up.

339
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,457
You're a daughter-in-law, not a cow.
How will you plow this field alone?

340
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,042
I have no money.

341
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,757
You should leave. Go now!

342
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,177
If my mother-in-law finds out, I'm dead.

343
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,679
You can just run away,

344
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,391
but I have to stay with the Ohs
for the rest of my life.

345
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,269
I'll wrap this up quickly
and harvest the sesame for you.

346
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,979
I told you I have no money!

347
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,356
I have nothing.

348
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,859
Search me. See if I have anything.

349
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,485
No. You have something.

350
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,070
I know you do.

351
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,615
- Right?
- Just take me instead.

352
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,868
I'm dirt poor. I've got nothing at all.

353
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,786
No, I'm not talking about money.

354
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,330
You know,

355
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,374
what I want is…

356
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,419
that thing.

357
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,007
No. Not in a million years.

358
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,217
Will it wear out?

359
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,138
I'll plow the field
and harvest the sesame for you!

360
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,348
Can't you at least lend that to a servant?

361
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,351
Absolutely not!
I cherish it too much to use it myself.

362
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,315
I swear I will plow this whole field
in two days.

363
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,277
Think of it as borrowing a cow
to plow the field for a few days.

364
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:55,118
Who lends their wedding jewelry?
Why didn't you get one when you remarried?

365
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,621
Come on. You know me!

366
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,414
I can plow better than a cow.

367
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,109
STUPID ABALONE

368
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,529
THE LOYAL LEE FAMILY
BY LEE MAN-KI FROM CLASS 3-8

369
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,113
MY FATHER
IS LOYAL TO THE COUNTRY!

370
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,324
Loyalty, loyalty. What endless flattery!

371
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,076
A kid wrote this?

372
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,870
This homework is for kids,
not their parents.

373
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,540
Hey.

374
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,502
Isn't it obvious
that this one should be the winner?

375
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,880
So what if it's in a gold frame?

376
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,008
What's inside is on a different level.

377
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,636
I get it.

378
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,180
The general's son gets first place.

379
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,849
The general's son gets to be president.

380
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,102
How disgusting.

381
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,479
It's such a disgrace!

382
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,232
Do you happen to be

383
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,192
Ae-sun's aunt?

384
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,446
<i>Take a seat.</i>

385
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,364
Thank you.

386
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,000
MASTERMIND OF THE 3.15 ELECTION FRAUD

387
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,300
Actually,

388
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,094
I'm Ae-sun's mom,

389
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,804
not her aunt.

390
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,557
Right. I see.

391
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,810
Ae-sun has a mom too.

392
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,395
Sure.

393
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,566
I've been busy making ends meet,
so I couldn't visit you.

394
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,654
I brought some rice cakes
for you to share with the class.

395
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,033
Oh, there was no need.

396
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,994
Actually, I did need to.

397
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,122
PRESIDENT: MAN-KI
VICE PRESIDENT: AE-SUN

398
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,666
To celebrate my kid,
who deserves to be the president.

399
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,672
The runner-up
who deserved the first place.

400
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,011
What did he say?

401
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,055
Am I gonna be the president?

402
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,264
Do I get it back?

403
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,018
Did you get mad again?

404
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,562
Did you cause a scene again
like you did at Grandma's?

405
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,147
You bet I did.

406
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,900
I made sure to shut him up for good.

407
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,694
<i>All right, then.</i>

408
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,571
I'll have the rice cakes with the kids.

409
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,615
I left my child in your care,

410
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,951
but I was too busy making a living, so…

411
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,286
But you know,

412
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,080
there are 70 students in the class,

413
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,541
and every one of them eats like a pig.

414
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,169
I'm not sure
if there's enough to go around.

415
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:56,007
I'm sure all parents feels the same when
they leave their children with someone.

416
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,053
Please take good care of my daughter.

417
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,973
There's nothing much I can do.
It's all up to her.

418
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,935
The rice cakes might be a bit lacking,

419
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,648
but all parents want their children
to be loved more than anyone else.

420
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,026
If I could,

421
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,570
I'd have brought a whole cow.

422
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,322
These are just to…

423
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,118
keep your feet warm.

424
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,120
You didn't have to do this.

425
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,872
They are for keeping your feet warm.

426
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,085
They are made from nylon.

427
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,027
At least she's respectful.

428
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,363
THANK YOU ALWAYS
FROM OH AE-SUN'S MOTHER

429
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,369
This is making me uncomfortable.

430
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,330
Did she stop by the bank, or what?

431
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,166
Crisp new bills.

432
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,794
Why did you dress up like this?

433
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,463
I didn't want to reek of salt.

434
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,132
They say to show teachers
the utmost respect.

435
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,093
I couldn't bring rice cakes
while smelling so salty.

436
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,139
Make sure to listen to your teacher
so you become a good person.

437
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,477
It'd be nice to live like your teacher,
sitting at a desk and writing stuff.

438
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,396
He won't let me be president, will he?

439
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,025
Did he ask you to buy something?
Like a broom?

440
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,487
For mental and financial competence?

441
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,574
I tried it for a few days,
and vice president is better.

442
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,660
The only difference
is the "vice" in the front.

443
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,454
It's practically the same thing.

444
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:53,041
I can't lead the greeting to the teacher,
but it feels like I am.

445
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,293
When Lee Man-ki does it,

446
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,670
I also do it in my mind.

447
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,090
Vice president is just better.

448
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,512
Ae-sun.

449
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,766
I am the poor one, not you.

450
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,309
Don't hang back.

451
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,562
Live your life to the fullest.

452
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,399
You shouldn't hang back either.

453
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,820
When I grow up, the first thing I'll do…

454
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,831
- What's gotten into you?
- I want to live for a long time.

455
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,209
Our eldest daughter says
the first thing she'll do

456
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,711
is buy me a pearl necklace.

457
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,421
I need to try it on.

458
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,756
Oh dear.

459
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,174
In what lifetime?

460
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,510
Kids grow up in a heartbeat.

461
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,847
I'll put on the pearl necklace in no time.

462
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:53,393
Kids aren't the only ones growing quickly.
We'll grow old fast too.

463
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,436
I was watching the news earlier.

464
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,022
They say the average lifespan
in Korea is just 52.

465
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,774
I'm going to outlive that.

466
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,694
I'll keep enjoying my life
into my 60s and 70s.

467
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:07,574
When that time comes,
this hardship will seem like nothing.

468
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,909
Then I'll laugh it off.

469
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,963
I don't remember quitting smoking.

470
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,256
Quit starting today.

471
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,554
Hey, come on.

472
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,974
- Whoa.
- Damn it.

473
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,363
<i>Spring is just so short.</i>

474
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:52,660
<i>Just when I think it has arrived,</i>
<i>its blossom festival fades in an instant,</i>

475
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,751
<i>so heartlessly.</i>

476
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,023
Enough with your tenacity!

477
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,984
How can you keep diving
when you can barely breathe?

478
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,779
Don't say pointless things.

479
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,073
Let me live long enough
to need diapers again.

480
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,284
Your chest is so bad you reek of blood,
but you still dive?

481
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,203
You might as well dive with a coffin!

482
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,664
To die out here or in the water,
it's all the same.

483
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:41,709
Hey! Can't you see him standing there
waiting for you outside?

484
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,171
He's standing there in black
waiting for you.

485
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,089
Go into the water,

486
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,341
and the Grim Reaper over there

487
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,803
will stare down at you like this
in the water.

488
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,973
If I were scared of him,
I wouldn't have dived for a living.

489
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,933
A <i>haenyeo's </i>life depends on luck.

490
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,894
I've come close to death
in deep blue water countless times.

491
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,732
Are you doing this
because you might starve your kids?

492
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,152
Gwang-rye! <i>Haenyeo </i>live and die together.

493
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,279
We are going to feed you, so--

494
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,449
I'd rather die earning a penny
than die begging.

495
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,245
I can’t die until I leave
at least a penny more for my kids.

496
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,163
No, I won't.

497
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,332
It doesn't take much to turn into a ghost.

498
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,253
Your fear of regret makes you resentful.
Your willfulness will make you a ghost.

499
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,256
Ghosts don't scare me. My children do.

500
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,342
If I'm living on borrowed time,
I'll earn what I can until I die

501
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,386
to keep my kids fed in this world.

502
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,475
Way to go!
She can't dive without her diving suit!

503
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,687
That rascal.
I shouldn't have brought her back.

504
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,197
OH AE-SUN IS YANG GWAN-SIK'S WIFE
AE-SUN IS GETTING MARRIED

505
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,287
Am I a beggar?

506
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,414
Am I?

507
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,806
Leave my mom alone!

508
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,309
At least leave my mom alone!

509
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,978
Why are you doing this?

510
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,190
Why do you take innocent people
whenever you want?

511
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,820
You should go easy!

512
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,364
You should go easy!

513
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,950
You should go easy on Mom!

514
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,412
She's spent her whole life working hard

515
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,540
and has never been on a plane.

516
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,251
I was going to get her

517
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,754
a pearl necklace

518
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,882
and fly her on a plane.

519
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,176
Why?

520
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,930
Why?

521
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,184
Why?

522
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,732
Cat got your tongue?

523
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,528
You're as quiet as a mouse!
Why aren't you saying anything?

524
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,655
What is it this time?

525
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,532
What?

526
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,200
Show me!

527
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,245
- Can I come closer?
- Come here!

528
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,087
You think I wouldn't be able to eat
croakers or mackerels without you?

529
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,633
It's meat, not fish.

530
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,719
People don't even share
precious meat with their in-laws.

531
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,681
Are you dumb?

532
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,267
Is there something wrong with you?

533
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,269
If you cry, you'll be hungry.

534
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,937
Are you pitying me?

535
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,606
Is that why you keep bringing me food?

536
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,276
If it was out of pity, I'd feed a beggar.

537
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,696
You little punk.

538
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,740
I am

539
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,160
older than you.

540
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,756
Bring me beef
instead of chicken every day.

541
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,758
I still won't marry you.

542
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,343
I didn't ask you to.

543
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,322
Please, God, she must live on.

544
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,409
How could you take her away from her kids?

545
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:48,998
Mother.

546
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,044
Mother.

547
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,888
Could you please come with me?

548
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,349
I'm scared to go on my own.

549
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,699
What is it?

550
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,038
Is that you, Mom?

551
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,273
I feel like I got a golden axe
instead of my own.

552
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,442
Am I just an iron axe, then?

553
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,697
Did you go somewhere?

554
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,783
You could've given them to me tomorrow.

555
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,327
Your siblings would
take them all tomorrow.

556
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,163
You can sell them for 100 hwan each.

557
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,419
It's worth 1,000 hwan if you eat them.

558
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,346
Ae-sun.

559
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,890
As soon as I die…

560
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,561
leave this place.

561
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,023
Go to your uncle and beg for your life.

562
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,318
Don't stay here
and be a maid for the Yeoms.

563
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,739
Leave this place, no matter what.

564
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,324
Promise me.

565
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,367
I won't promise.

566
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,328
Stop talking.

567
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,917
Live with your uncle,
and have him walk you down the aisle.

568
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,880
If you get married
without a father figure, I will cry.

569
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,466
I said I wouldn't promise.
Why are you still talking?

570
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,762
I won't rest unless you promise.

571
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,222
Dad died.

572
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,224
You're dying too.

573
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,769
Why is everyone dying?

574
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,689
Then why did you give birth to me?

575
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,609
Ae-sun.

576
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,696
In the end,
we all end up living as orphans.

577
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,282
Even though parents die first,

578
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,534
their children carry on.

579
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,869
Life goes on and on.

580
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,247
There will be tougher days in your life.

581
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,959
One day, life might get so tough

582
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,879
that you feel like you can't go on--

583
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,547
I told you to stop talking!

584
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,091
I won't promise.

585
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,885
I'm not going to eat abalone.

586
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,434
My precious little one.

587
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,771
When will you grow up?

588
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,777
<i>The eldest daughter</i>
<i>heard her mom's last words</i>

589
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,612
<i>at the age of ten.</i>

590
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,658
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>

591
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,285
<i>Rock to sleep</i>

592
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:18,374
<i>Sleep, sleep, rock to sleep</i>

593
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:23,796
<i>My baby sleeps well</i>

594
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,091
<i>Sleep quickly</i>

595
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,301
<i>Sleep quickly</i>

596
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,641
<i>A black dog walks away</i>

597
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,729
<i>A black dog walks this way</i>

598
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:47,445
<i>Come help my baby sleep</i>

599
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:52,324
<i>Then I'll help your pups sleep</i>

600
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,704
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>…

601
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,165
<i>She left behind her three children</i>…

602
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,920
<i>at the age of 29.</i>

603
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,749
If you cry, you'll be hungry.

604
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,083
So eat while you cry.

605
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,258
What should I do now?

606
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,928
What should I do?

607
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,764
This morning,

608
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,600
my mom

609
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,644
passed away.

610
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,188
But…

611
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,774
but…

612
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,823
I miss her already.

613
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,203
I miss my mom already.

614
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,165
I…

615
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,459
I miss her so much.

616
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,549
Mom.

617
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,095
Mom.

618
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,397
Ae-sun, Sun-nam, and Sun-bong.

619
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,900
Think about it.
You all have "sun" in your names.

620
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,402
You are connected by blood.

621
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,905
Look at you.

622
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,699
A scruffy dog might ask to marry you.

623
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,327
I have no choice.
It's yellowtail season now.

624
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,706
I need to go on the boat
to feed your younger siblings.

625
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,421
If you go to your uncle's,
you'll just end up being a maid.

626
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:16,677
A maid who takes care of her siblings is
more fulfilled than one caring for others.

627
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,928
I won't be a maid.

628
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,807
Mom told me not to live like that.

629
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,601
Hey, Ae-sun.

630
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,271
Your mom can't rest in peace
if your siblings live like beggars.

631
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,692
Just during yellowtail season.

632
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,111
Okay?

633
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,072
Are you going to just let this field rot?

634
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,991
Why waste perfectly fine land?

635
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,672
<i>Just until Sun-bong</i>
<i>is out of diapers, okay?</i>

636
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,225
Let's go.

637
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,232
<i>Just until Sun-nam starts</i>
<i>elementary school, okay?</i>

638
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,862
<i>Just wait and see.</i>

639
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,657
<i>As the flower dye fades</i>
<i>from your fingernails,</i>

640
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,867
<i>the living will forget and carry on.</i>

641
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,749
<i>Life goes on and on.</i>

642
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,043
<i>Just as fingernails grow,</i>

643
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,295
<i>new days rush in.</i>

644
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,547
<i>How could you not forget?</i>

645
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,305
Did your business go under?
How do you always have leftover fish?

646
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,749
I'm leaving home.

647
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,917
POEMS OF YU CHI-HWAN

648
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,464
Just until this upcoming trip, okay?

649
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,010
A few more deep-sea fishing trips,
and we can find a way to survive.

650
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,808
Other kids are taking private lessons
while I'm farming and cooking.

651
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,601
I want to get first place too.

652
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,603
And I want to…

653
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,983
Just forget it.

654
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,363
What, a Korean literature major?

655
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,615
Is that all you want?
A Korean literature major?

656
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,993
A poet. That's right.

657
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,412
You said you wanted to be a poet,
didn't you?

658
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,789
That would be wonderful. A poet--

659
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:59,173
Yi Sang, Kim So-wol, and Yun Dong-ju
all majored in Korean literature, right?

660
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,300
"If you choose to leave,

661
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,051
weary at the sight of me,

662
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,554
tread gently as you go."

663
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,724
I'll lay down money before you

664
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,352
until you become
a Korean literature major.

665
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,270
Okay?

666
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,861
Anyway, who paid all
of your monthly school fees?

667
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,571
Am I just some random man?

668
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,241
I'm like a father figure
to you now, aren't I?

669
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,703
I'm telling you, I'll make money
and send you to college.

670
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,291
Your uncle won't send you to college.

671
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,795
If that family wanted to take care of you,
they would've--

672
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,631
To the mainland, okay?

673
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,634
To the mainland.
A college on the mainland.

674
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,344
You swear on Sun-nam and Sun-bong?

675
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,972
I swear on Jeon Gwang-rye!

676
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,851
If I forget everything you've done for us,
your mom will kill me.

677
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,481
<i>There's an active campaign to promote</i>
<i>a simple and practical lifestyle</i>

678
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,442
<i>by encouraging the public</i>
<i>to wear simplified clothing.</i>

679
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,611
<i>When you're at your busiest and in a rush,</i>

680
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,490
<i>wearing a long traditional skirt</i>
<i>is simply cumbersome and uncomfortable.</i>

681
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:12,079

Would you like some?

686
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,752
No, I want cabbages.

687
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,630
Exactly. Do you want some cabbages?

688
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,842
Do you also sell cabbages?

689
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,427
Well, they are sweet.

690
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,263
Her cabbages.

691
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,764
They are sweet.

Please stop by!

697
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,615
Fresh sea squirt, abalone, and conch!
At an unbeatable price!

698
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,408
Why worry about Gwang-rye's daughter?

699
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,993
She has Steelheart by her side.

700
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,277
They are sweet. Would you like some?

701
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:08,820
Would you like some?

702
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,740
<i>Gwan-sik sells</i>
<i>all of Ae-sun's cabbages for her.</i>

703
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,869
<i>The bold shortening of skirts</i>
<i>is promoting a decadent trend.</i>

704
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,080
These cabbages are sweet.
Would you like some?

705
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:21,208
<i>In Myeong-dong, Seoul,</i>
<i>women can be seen waltzing around</i>

706
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,335
<i>with their thighs fully exposed.</i>

707
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:29,174
<i>Now you could say</i>
<i>that Gwan-sik is raising Ae-sun.</i>

708
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:36,139
<i>Now there are calls for strict measures</i>
<i>to combat the decadent trend.</i>

709
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:40,435
<i>"First, they said to wear shorter clothes,</i>
<i>and now they're complaining!"</i>

710
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,397
<i>Arguing like this will only make</i>
<i>our testing lives even harder.</i>

711
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,356
CREATION AND CRITICISM

712
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,649
Would you like some?

713
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,736
The cabbages are sweet,
especially the ones over there.

714
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,030
I'm sure everything is sweet to you.

715
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:56,118
Looks like you'll have to serve
both mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

716
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,536
Gosh, it's just my luck.

717
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,163
How much are the cabbages?

718
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,707
Fifty won each, 150 for three.

719
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,333
What kind of absurd deal is that?

720
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,086
If one is 50 won,
then three should be 150 won.

721
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,464
OH AE-SUN

722
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,590
That's justice.

723
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,927
Hey, who talks about justice
when buying cabbages?

724
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,013
Did I even ask for the price of three?

725
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,057
I make peanuts selling cabbages,

726
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,643
but everyone wants to haggle
over the price.

727
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,228
I wanted to raise awareness--

728
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,605
Who cares about awareness
when buying cabbages?

729
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,525
- Well…
- There he goes!

730
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,570
- Do you want some?
- He won't allow a second complaint.

731
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,946
I gave birth to a fool.

732
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,033
Give me one. Just one.

733
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,038
Doesn't Ae-sun have hands or something?

734
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,664
I didn't make him do it.

735
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,833
He's doing it because he likes it.

736
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,043
She's not making me.

737
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,131
I should've raised a stray dog
instead of him.

738
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:55,260
You'll wish you were dead
if you get caught hanging out together.

739
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,679
They have the exuberance
and fearlessness of youth.

740
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,431
As if they'd be scared of a granny.

741
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,936
Oh no.

742
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,861
- Out of the way!
- Grandma!

743
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:20,494
Haven't I told you
not to let her open the stall next to him?

744
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,662
Why do you keep coming all the way here?

745
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,665
Haven't you heard
daughters inherit their mothers' fate?

746
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,710
Her mom's spirit is still lingering
to protect her.

747
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,047
Why would you let her stay
next to my grandson?

748
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,507
That hag needs a baptism.

749
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,550
Barnacles and whelks are no different!

750
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,804
Ae-sun, that brat!

751
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:39,805
You brat!

752
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,766
I don't even want him.
Yang Gwan-sik? No, thank you!

753
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,601
No, thank you!

754
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,936
This is insane.

755
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,395
- Ae-sun, that brat!
- Mother.

756
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,481
Ae-sun, that brat!

757
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,872
<i>Some faced the "No, thank you days"</i>

758
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,042
<i>and did not back down.</i>

759
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:59,337
"THE SAME SKY, THE SAME STARS,
ETCHED IN THE SAME HEARTS."

760
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,014
