1
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES

2
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,741
THE BLAZING SUMMER SUNSHINE

3
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,995
The sun is so bright. It's blazing.

4
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,540
It's the perfect weather
to torment your daughter-in-law.

5
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,795
Just 108 prostrations should be enough.

6
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,884
If it was, it would've worked by now.
Instead, she's wasted five years.

7
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,261
Even Buddha would get tired
of 3,000 prostrations.

8
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,724
Pain brings out devotion.

9
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,184
You're so heartless.

10
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,772
How can a mother-in-law be so harsh
and still expect more children?

11
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,233
To put it bluntly,
not all children survive.

12
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,568
You might give birth to eight,
but two could die.

13
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,612
She married into a family
that values sons.

14
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,322
She should fulfill her duties.

15
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,908
How could she expect everything for free?

16
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,453
She didn't bring us anything,
not even a silver spoon.

17
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,621
What about you?

18
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,042
Did you bring a silver spoon?
Is that why you only had two kids?

19
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,797
You can't stand me,
so she's precious to you, right?

20
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,342
Ae-sun, let's go.

21
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,818
If you made her do 3,000 prostrations,

22
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,696
she'd be too tired
to perform her wifely duties.

23
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,906
Oh, and she's doing such a good job.

24
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,409
Make sure you tell him before bed.

25
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,995
Tell your husband
I made you do 3,000 prostrations.

26
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,455
Gwan-sik may side with you for now,

27
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,375
but no man likes a wife
who talks badly about his mother.

28
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,170
Even the worst son in the world

29
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,507
wants his wife to be
the most devoted daughter-in-law.

30
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,342
So watch what you say.

31
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,304
Did you say that for my benefit?

32
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,430
I won't tell him.

33
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,890
Yeah, right.

34
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,226
He groans in pain every night.

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,729
How could I give him
more reasons to suffer?

36
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,315
Oh yeah, 'cause you're so great.

37
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,652
They say a man stays
with the wife he loves,

38
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,738
even if he hates her family.

39
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,907
It's the same for me.

40
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,033
You little…

41
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,869
Serves you right.

42
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,498
Your daughter-in-law is a cut above mine.

43
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,336
She's so annoying.
Should I teach her a lesson?

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,923
Hey! Why'd you smack the <i>hareubang's </i>nose?

45
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,633
Why? Hey!

46
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,260
Why did you smack its nose?

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:41,888
I'm so sorry.

48
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,473
Stop right there!

49
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,437
YEOM SUN-NAM, YEOM SUN-BONG

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,232
Even the government says
having only one child is patriotic.

51
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,359
They go on and on about sons.

52
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,819
What's the point of raising them?

53
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,864
What did they get out of raising Gwan-sik?

54
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,283
All that work just to give him to me.

55
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,453
Why does she keep throwing
red beans at me?

56
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,290
So what if my mom's spirit is with me?

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,461
My mom misses me,
so she wants to see me. So what?

58
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,900
I guess I can't visit your house anymore.

59
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,739
That's not fair.

60
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,743
I miss you even more
now that I'm a mom too.

61
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,747
I miss you even more.

62
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,010
Not being able to come here anymore
must be driving you crazy, huh?

63
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,073
You can bring her all you like,
but we aren't going to accept her.

64
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,158
We're not taking in new members.

65
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,744
Why keep bringing her? She's so young.

66
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,789
Every master <i>haenyeo </i>starts diving
at the age of six or seven.

67
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,999
Who on earth starts diving
at six or seven?

68
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,668
They just gather kelp
in the shallow waters for fun.

69
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,670
Exactly. That's what I mean.

70
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,715
I heard that spot is for beginners.

71
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,176
She has to play in the water
so she won't be scared.

72
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,594
Is she your daughter?

73
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,473
I really don't want to talk to her at all.

74
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,851
Does Ae-sun know?
Did she give her permission?

75
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,563
Why do I need her permission?
She's not the boss of me!

76
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,650
Both people and horses
must prove their worth to make a living.

77
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,570
That's why we want her to learn a skill.
Why stand in the way?

78
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,863
Listen, Mak-cheon.

79
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,119
Every single day before we dive,
we pray that we'll make it out alive.

80
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,414
Gwang-rye used to tell Ae-sun every day,

81
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,124
"Don't dive."

82
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,792
"Don't even learn how to dive."

83
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,711
Gwang-rye didn't want
her daughter to do it.

84
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,880
Why would she want her granddaughter to?

85
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,715
Will Geum-myeong be your breadwinner?

86
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,551
Enough! Just let her dive!

87
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,220
You <i>haenyeo </i>are so damn nosy!

88
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,181
Gosh!

89
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,145
- Give it!
- Goodness!

90
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,606
Let's go!

91
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,275
Let's go.

92
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,526
Seriously!

93
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,905
Whatever!

94
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,037
Who else can you blame
that you're born to be a maid?

95
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,206
The move is in two weeks,

96
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,542
so why are you packing for the kids?

97
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,169
Don't they have hands?

98
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,964
How will you manage
without those brats to clean up after?

99
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,091
They're not brats.

100
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,719
And I have a temper.

101
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,513
- Also, my in-laws--
- Yeah, I know.

102
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,267
They have a relative high up
in the Jeju provincial office.

103
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,521
How many times have you told me
your in-laws are well-connected?

104
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,650
But does their influence reach
all the way to the mainland?

105
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,528
Those kids have got me.

106
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,866
Don't be mean to Sun-nam and Sun-bong.
Make sure they get plenty of food.

107
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,411
I'm gonna be mean to them. So what?

108
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,208
I want to be mean to them once in a while,
but it's not easy.

109
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,961
How can I be mean to them
when they cuddle me and call me "Mom"?

110
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,672
If you raise kids
in your home for ten years,

111
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,634
they become your own,
no matter where they came from.

112
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,596
The heart matters
more than blood, you know.

113
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,892
Really? You can't even do that?

114
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,771
Give it to me.

115
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,160
You must have

116
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,539
a lot to vent about but no one to talk to.

117
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,165
Call me.

118
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,086
You can bitch to me about
the bean-throwing hag.

119
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,754
I'm a good listener.

120
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,425
You know our relationship
is ridiculous, right?

121
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,529
Frankly, I wasn't a mistress.
It wasn't an affair or anything.

122
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,991
I lived with him
almost ten years after she passed.

123
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,076
There's no need for us to be hostile.

124
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,245
Still, we're just too different.

125
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,832
Is that why you stole my yellow dress
and ran away at night?

126
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,418
Too different.

127
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,090
I admire you.

128
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,514
Now that I've been part of this family,

129
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,600
I really admire you.

130
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,893
It's not your fate to be a maid.

131
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,146
You just have the caring heart of one.

132
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,523
So,

133
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,734
just keep it up.

134
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,529
They say being good will pay off.

135
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,831
Then, please…

136
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,251
What?

137
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,170
Please…

138
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,547
Please…

139
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,883
What?

140
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,428
- Say it.
- Please look after them.

141
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,139
My siblings.

142
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,644
Please let them finish school.

143
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,647
Stop worrying about my children.

144
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,362
Still, I'm not like someone
who only bought four ice pops.

145
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,031
If I bring corn cobs, I always bring five.

146
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm giving you this tricycle
instead of ice pops.

147
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,289
Just think of this tricycle

148
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,542
as a kind of moral scholarship

149
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,421
that I am giving to Geum-myeong.

150
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,634
Who gives a used tricycle
for a scholarship?

151
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,892
After all you did for this family,
you're only stealing the tricycle?

152
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,770
What do you mean "stealing"?

153
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,230
You told me to take it!

154
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,487
<i>One well-raised daughter</i>
<i>is better than ten sons.</i>

155
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,202
<i>Korea Family Planning Association.</i>

156
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,123
Gosh!

157
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,961
She took corn to them again today.

158
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,922
This time, I actually counted
how many we had.

159
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,677
We barely have enough for ourselves,
yet there's a thief in our home.

160
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,263
If she had a proper family,
she'd be bringing us things.

161
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,932
But instead,
she's taking everything we have

162
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,476
and giving it to people
who are barely family.

163
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,894
There's a tilefish inside.

164
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,272
There's a tilefish?

165
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,984
Let's just say I bought the corn
with the tilefish.

166
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,611
Is your wife all you care about now?

167
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:22,450
Who's going to be on my side
if my only son takes his wife's side?

168
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,702
Dad's supposed to take your side.

169
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,455
What?

170
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,041
- I can't look at my own husband?
- No.

171
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,919
I should've just raised dogs.

172
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,340
Hey, you stole the corn from the pot!

173
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,509
Ae-sun, are you fleeing as a refugee?

174
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,138
I gave them five corn cobs
and brought all of these back.

175
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,725
Look.

176
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,820
Is this real?

177
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,292
Why the hell did you bring this?
Planning to go back to Busan in it?

178
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,711
Throw red beans at it.

179
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,382
Some of their old clothes
are almost like new.

180
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,845
Honestly, she could've kept the tricycle
to give to her own baby,

181
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,973
but she chose to give it to Geum-myeong.

182
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,103
Throw the tricycle away.
Girls shouldn't ride tricycles.

183
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,941
My husband would've hit you on the head
with his pipe if he were alive.

184
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,902
We'll trade it for candy
with the junk dealer.

185
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,200
Geum-myeong, did you go play
by the sea again today?

186
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,743
Geum-myeong, let's go to bed.

187
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,704
Are you going to bed already?

188
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,376
Sleep early.

189
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,090
Good night.

190
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,758
Good night.

191
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,385
Sleep well.

192
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,512
Then you won't be so cranky.

193
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,989
COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM
PREPARATION WORKBOOK 1

194
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,628
OH AE-SUN

195
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,720
GENERAL EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA
NAME: OH AE-SUN

196
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,905
Where have you been?

197
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,995
I just love red beans so damn much.

198
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,591
Is it hard for you?

199
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,302
Should I just keep my mouth shut?

200
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,889
If the young master says something,
they won't just hate me.

201
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,807
They'll want to kill me.

202
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,643
Then what do I do?

203
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,029
If you let me,
I'll be or do whatever you want me to.

204
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,952
The tricycle.

205
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,622
Let Geum-myeong ride the tricycle.

206
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,458
I really want her to ride it,
no matter what.

207
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:02,962
No matter what?

208
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,463
If she can't even ride that,

209
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,674
she'll spend her whole life
in the kitchen.

210
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,053
I want her to have everything.

211
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,639
And I want her to do everything,

212
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,849
every single thing she wants.

213
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,812
I don't want her to set the table.

214
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,356
I want her to be the one to flip it.

215
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,819
You flip it too.

216
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,239
If you flip it,
I'll take care of the rest.

217
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,869
Stop making me cry.

218
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,834
You can flip or break it.
Just say "Ready, go" before you do.

219
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,003
I'll be the one they take it out on.

220
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,213
I know where I stand and what I'll do.

221
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,048
I stole their fish for you, didn't I?

222
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,299
- I was a bad son--
- Go.

223
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,261
- What?
- Ready, go.

224
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,182
I said, "Go."

225
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,126
Grant her a son. Please bless her.

226
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,629
Please bless her with a boy.

227
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,718
Please grant her a son, I beg you.

228
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,261
I beg you.

229
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:35,763
Get down.

230
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,640
You'd better not tell Gwan-sik

231
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,727
that I've been throwing red beans at you
first thing every morning.

232
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,521
A woman who talks too much
is good for nothing.

233
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,071
A lazy woman who talks too much
is a complete waste of space.

234
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,994
Watch it!

235
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,456
I've told you a million times
not to mix the beans!

236
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,083
Unbelievable.

237
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,125
<i>"Ready, go."</i>

238
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,587
<i>Mom's day started the same every day.</i>

239
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,467
<i>Even though she was confined to</i>
<i>a small treadwheel,</i>

240
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,844
<i>she still managed to find</i>…

241
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,851
<i>small joys in life every day.</i>

242
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,399
I paid 2,000 won for it.

243
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,693
Swap it for 2,000 won worth
of candy if you like.

244
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,532
Are you smiling?

245
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,743
Peas, I want some peas.

246
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,246
Peas, here are your peas.

247
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,707
Peas, I want some peas.

248
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,461
Where are the peas? Where are they?

249
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,148
- I'll eat at this table from now on.
- Why?

250
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,860
Why? You punk!

251
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,237
I also

252
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,865
want to eat with you, Mom.

253
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,911
Dogs are better.

254
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,330
Peas, I want some peas.

255
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,797
CATCH A SPY
BRING HONOR TO THE FAMILY

256
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,678
Why don't you just carry her
in a dignitary palanquin?

257
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,849
All that fuss for a girl,
treating her like a prince.

258
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,727
- I'm off.
- Be careful by the sea.

259
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,953
<i>Always smiling brightly,</i>

260
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,542
<i>Ae-sun spent her entire twenties</i>
<i>in that cramped kitchen.</i>

261
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,631
<i>If she can't even ride that,</i>

262
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,050
<i>she'll spend her whole life</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

263
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,641
<i>I want her to have everything.</i>

264
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,185
<i>And I want her to do everything,</i>

265
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,354
<i>every single thing she wants.</i>

266
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,244
Oh dear.

267
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,998
What are you, a centipede?

268
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,881
Goodness, you'll never get a chance
to wear all of these.

269
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,970
When will she ever get to wear
all of these?

270
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,683
Are you going to run a shoe store?

271
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,769
So just live with your mom.

272
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,022
Your mom and her indoor plants.

273
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,329
Your parents must've worked so hard
to send you to school

274
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,832
with what little they had.

275
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,337
They must be thrilled
that you're dating Yeong-beom.

276
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,463
Yes.

277
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,925
- They're happy about it.
- I'm sure they are.

278
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,095
Why wouldn't they be?

279
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,890
So, you just got a job?

280
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,600
Yes.

281
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,481
Actually, I tend to hear
a lot of nice things at work.

282
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,026
They say I'll be promoted very quickly.

283
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,736
You're gonna keep working?

284
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,070
Sorry?

285
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,905
You're gonna keep working after marriage?

286
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,574
Well…

287
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,451
We…

288
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,747
I mean, Yeong-beom
and I have already talked about it.

289
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,748
Don't you think

290
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,461
too much greed can stem
from some kind of emptiness?

291
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,714
That kind of emptiness can lead to vanity.

292
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,467
Sudden wealth
often leads people to show off.

293
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,887
It's funny to see
poor women who marry into wealth

294
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,388
start to love luxury brands.

295
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,727
What? Have I offended you again?

296
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,106
Then let me be frank.

297
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,610
Wouldn't you rather be
the next vice minister's daughter-in-law

298
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,362
than get promoted to manager?

299
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,366
Yeong-beom is our eldest son,
and he's talented.

300
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,159
So why would his wife

301
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:53,080
need to be out working
instead of supporting him as a housewife?

302
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,664
Put yourself in my shoes.

303
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,625
Wouldn't you be angry?

304
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,379
The thing is…

305
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,174
I don't want Geum-myeong
to ever feel inferior to anyone, anywhere.

306
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,306
I'm just as capable as Yeong-beom.

307
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,684
I'm also the eldest in my family.

308
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,938
I want to support my family
with my own money.

309
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,773
Also…

310
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,984
I feel quite empty,

311
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,696
so getting hired isn't enough for me.

312
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,992
I want to do it all. Be the manager,
supervisor, and even the CEO.

313
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,622
That's nothing to be ashamed of, is it?

314
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,917
You're right.

315
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,211
They say

316
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:47,968
good looks come with a good heart,
and indoor plants are not as twisted.

317
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,392
So, you're not…

318
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,396
an indoor plant either?

319
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,491
What can I do?

320
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,036
I'm not pretty,
and I'm the twisted eldest daughter.

321
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,748
I've had enough, okay?

322
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,669
It's not like I can't live without you,
or I'm dying to get married.

323
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:42,898
Good grief.

324
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,903
There are more shoes here
than I've ever worn in my life.

325
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,656
Is this how you spend your entire salary?

326
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,160
I never asked you to clean my place.
It's so cold, so why do you keep…

327
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,870
These are all cheap.

328
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,956
They aren't even proper shoes.
Goodness gracious.

329
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,005
Why are you so obsessed with shoes?

330
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,886
This is all vanity and a waste of money.

331
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,058
I heard vanity stems from emptiness.

332
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,227
What did you say?

333
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,811
Maybe I want to buy so much

334
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,023
because I grew up poor.

335
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,323
Maybe it's a deeply rooted issue.

336
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,743
For field trips,

337
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,956
you made me beg for three days
just to get new clothes.

338
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,334
I wanted things, but we had no money.

339
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,963
I grew up yearning for so many things
I could never have.

340
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,007
So now, I don't hold back at all.

341
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,302
They're nothing but cheap shoes,

342
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,596
but I buy them anyway.

343
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,478
It's not like I bought what I wanted

344
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,648
and didn't get you what you wanted.

345
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,485
I still gave you
the best food and clothes I could

346
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,903
with what we had.

347
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,073
Is poverty something to flaunt?
Should being pitiful be praised?

348
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,874
Is something wrong?

349
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,501
Is it your work?

350
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,169
Damn it.

351
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,380
Is someone bothering you?

352
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,340
What would you know anyway?

353
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,510
If you're burned out, take a break.

354
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,053
Take some leave if you can.

355
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,390
Try working at a company.
You can't rest, no matter how bad it gets.

356
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,642
If it's that bad,
just quit and get married--

357
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,311
And what?

358
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,895
Should I live like you?

359
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,356
Marry into another poor family
with the bare minimum

360
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,566
and spend my whole life…

361
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,779
<i>Breaking Mom's heart</i>

362
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,658
<i>makes my own heart break as well.</i>

363
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,202
You're right.

364
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,539
You're right. Don't live the life I lived.

365
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,084
But you know…

366
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,840
<i>I found happiness in my own way.</i>

367
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,303
<i>There was sunshine in my life too.</i>

368
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,515
<i>I've had so many picture-perfect moments.</i>

369
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:33,068
I just want you to acknowledge
that my life was worthwhile too.

370
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,076
<i>It's an odd thing.</i>

371
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,621
I'll just take the whole box.

372
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,705
Sure.

373
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,501
<i>Parents dwell on what they couldn't give.</i>

374
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,380
<i>And children dwell on</i>
<i>what they couldn't get.</i>

375
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,385
Ae-sun, pay your respects.

376
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,178
Who? Me?

377
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,139
<i>So I had no idea</i>

378
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,226
<i>that my impoverished childhood…</i>

379
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,480
I may be a shaman,
but a mother's blessings are unmatched.

380
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,109
Nothing surpasses
a mother's devotion to her child.

381
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,653
<i>…that even that humble childhood</i>

382
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:21,157
<i>was only possible</i>
<i>because they built such a sturdy fortress.</i>

383
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,495
There's no better job in Jeju
than a <i>haenyeo.</i>

384
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,874
If we have one in the family,
she'll be our pillar.

385
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,045
She'll be able to make enough on her own
and won't need to ask anyone for help.

386
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:38,216
As the eldest daughter, she can fulfill
her duties as the breadwinner.

387
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,356
You can't expect a girl
to become a president,

388
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,400
let alone a judge or an attorney.

389
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,154
There's no better job than a <i>haenyeo.</i>

390
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,075
You!

391
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,035
What are you doing?

392
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,495
Oh my. That girl…

393
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,122
- What in the…
- How dare you.

394
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,707
She's my daughter!

395
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,335
She's my daughter,
not the breadwinner of the house!

396
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,297
My daughter won't be a <i>haenyeo.</i>

397
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,632
I won't let her be!

398
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,718
You…

399
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,180
Have you lost your mind?
Where are you taking her?

400
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,768
My mom died young
from a breathing illness caused by diving.

401
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,355
Until her last breath,
she told me not to dive or live as a maid.

402
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,736
But just because I'm living like a maid,
that doesn't mean my daughter--

403
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,987
What? "Maid"?

404
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,990
Is that what you call
supporting your in-laws and our ancestors?

405
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,411
I won't let her live
like me and my mother.

406
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,997
Not my daughter, no.

407
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,876
You can go if you want,
but you're not taking a Yang's daughter!

408
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,419
She's my daughter! Mine!

409
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,798
If you want a <i>haenyeo </i>so badly,
make your daughter do it, not mine!

410
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,969
Hey, she's lost her mind.

411
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,680
How dare you glare at me
and raise your voice!

412
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,641
"Make your daughter do it"?

413
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,726
Oh, Guardian God, Dragon King.

414
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,687
Please watch over us.

415
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,317
"Make your daughter do it"?

416
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,695
How dare you run your damn mouth
so recklessly!

417
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,783
I told you! Her mother's spirit is in her.

418
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,995
Her spirit has possessed that girl.
That's why she's gone mad!

419
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,706
It's so obvious! Why wouldn't it be?

420
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,417
It's obvious she didn't have much
to look up to growing up!

421
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,755
You grew up in a messed-up family,
raised by lowlifes.

422
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,924
How dare you do this
in this honorable household!

423
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,926
Please watch over us.

424
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,010
Hey, Gwan-sik.

425
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,974
Did you see what she was doing?
She says Geum-myeong isn't my grandchild.

426
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,976
She disrespected our ancestors.

427
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,479
She just glared at me
and kept yelling at me!

428
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,731
Say no more. Kick her out.

429
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:03,444
Kicking her out is the only thing
the ancestors would accept!

430
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,697
Grandma, you've been throwing
red beans at her?

431
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,534
Kick her out!

432
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,161
I've never hit her before today.

433
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,206
Good grief. This is just unbelievable.

434
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,418
I don't think I can breathe properly.

435
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,338
Oh no. You're giving her a heart attack!

436
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,298
Oh dear.

437
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,674
Mom, Grandma.

438
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,344
Ae-sun came to live with me,
not to be your daughter-in-law.

439
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,096
What?

440
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,055
You will

441
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,516
never see Ae-sun again.

442
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,728
I won't let her live here.

443
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,443
How could he?

444
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,571
Kick her out!

445
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,455
Why don't you wear them?

446
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,124
It seems like they were made for you.

447
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,879
They do fit me very well.

448
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,675
You should've married a rich guy.

449
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,971
Then you could always be covered
in the floral patterns you love so much.

450
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,557
Tell the truth,
you must regret it a little?

451
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,019
If you told me to go back

452
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,855
and marry your father again--

453
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,440
Of course you wouldn't.

454
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,108
I would.

455
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,820
I'd do it again.

456
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,490
Geum-myeong.

457
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:32,951
What's this?

458
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,744
Goodness.

459
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,414
I told you not to buy two bags, didn't I?

460
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,000
It's not like she can't buy her own peas.

461
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,586
How much were they?
Did they rip you off again?

462
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,296
I brought this whistle too.

463
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,341
- Don't!
- It's a scary world out there.

464
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,385
Look at these. Aren't they pretty?

465
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,386
They look good.

466
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,681
- They fit perfectly.
- They look good.

467
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,226
DODONG-RI VARIETY SHOP

468
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,937
ONE ROOM, ONE KITCHEN
MONTHLY RENT, NO DEPOSIT NEEDED

469
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,127
GA, NA, DA, RA…

470
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,967
Geum-myeong, you want some peas?

471
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,093
I want some peas.

472
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,098
- One more time, here are some peas!
- Here are some peas!

473
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,058
Yes. Good girl.

474
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,227
One more time.

475
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,396
- You want some peas?
- I want some peas.

476
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,313
Well done!

477
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,859
- Squid.
- Squid?

478
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,610
You want some squid?

479
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,778
Squid!

480
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,075
Squid.

481
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,411
- Good girl.
- Is it good?

482
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,749
The landlord!

483
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,261
It's fine.
The aunties gave us the abalones.

484
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,389
You think he'll ask why we're eating them
when we can't pay rent?

485
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,312
Yes, sir!

486
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,942
Sir, well,

487
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,653
I'm looking for new fishing jobs here.

488
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,242
Could we pay the rent
at the end of the month?

489
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,244
Why not just pay me in the fall?

490
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,790
No, sir. I'm not saying
we're trying to get away with it.

491
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,502
I'll watch your store more often, and--

492
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:52,256
Someone came by earlier and paid
three months' rent. You didn't know?

493
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,051
Pardon? Who did?

494
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,345
Someone paid for three months' rent?

495
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,807
Is there someone named Mo in your family?

496
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,851
We have a relative named Mo?

497
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,395
Someone from the Mo family paid it.

498
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,856
If you pay the rent on time,

499
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,234
I'll even give you some pork.

500
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,243
MO O-RAN SCHOLARSHIP
AMOUNT: 10,000 WON

501
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,255
Why do you keep glaring at me?

502
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:33,965
Who is she?

503
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,843
- What?
- Who is O-ran?

504
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,929
I've been by your side since you were ten.

505
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,472
Come on. O-ran?

506
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,561
You're right.
Yeah, no one ever had a crush on you.

507
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,146
How can you be so sure?

508
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,774
I don't know anyone from the Mo family.

509
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,278
It's not your grandma?

510
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,447
My grandma's name is Kim Chun-ok.

511
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,199
My aunt's name is Hyeon Yi-suk.

512
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,368
Besides, my grandma is broke.

513
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,124
My grandmother is Park Mak-cheon.
My mom is Kwon Gye-ok.

514
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,418
Maybe it's my mom.

515
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,090
Maybe my mom entered
the body of a rich woman

516
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,426
and stole her family's bankbook, then…

517
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,291
What in the…

518
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,584
Come on now!

519
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,631
Now they're going too far, aren't they?

520
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,510
<i>Your landlady said, "They get busy</i>
<i>as soon as the clock strikes nine."</i>

521
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,806
I guess you kids are quite diligent, huh?

522
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,644
You're so diligent
about turning off the light at night.

523
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,647
How could the goddess of fertility
not come and bless you?

524
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,816
Look how the baby came
after she left the in-laws.

525
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,153
Your body and mind
must be at ease to conceive.

526
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,281
Say her husband comes home
after the in-laws tormented her all day.

527
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,159
She wouldn't wanna talk
to her mother-in-law's son,

528
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,410
let alone… you know.

529
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,205
Who'd wanna do it
with their mother-in-law's son?

530
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,456
It's morally wrong.

531
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,294
Diligence is one thing,
but what's impressive is…

532
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,048
Let's just say
Geum-myeong is a good daughter.

533
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,050
Look at this tiny room.

534
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,678
Goodness gracious.

535
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,472
If they are determined,

536
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,308
people can have six kids
in a one-room house.

537
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,978
Goodness me.

538
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,730
Isn't she just like Gwang-rye now?

539
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,358
The Literary Girl has gotten rather bold.

540
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,320
If you lived close,
we'd see you as often as we saw Gwang-rye.

541
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,740
The rent might be cheap,
but why come all the way here?

542
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,783
Leave her alone.

543
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,911
If she lived nearby,
her mother-in-law would visit a lot.

544
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,872
Still, it's easier to make a living
if you know people.

545
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,958
Island folk don't take kindly
to newcomers.

546
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,214
Hey, how's Gwan-sik's fishing job?

547
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,591
He's hard-working, you know.

548
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,554
He hasn't told you
what it is he does, has he?

549
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,222
You and your big mouth!

550
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,099
She deserves to know.

551
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,643
Why? What is it?

552
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,023
Do you know who Gwan-sik is working for?

553
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,777
Oh my, what's wrong with his hand?

554
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,073
Oh no!

555
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,663
What is this?

556
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,666
- What happened to your hand?
- It's fine.

557
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,503
<i>You should've come</i>
<i>as soon as you got hurt.</i>

558
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,465
<i>If you hesitate too long,</i>
<i>your finger will heal crooked.</i>

559
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,219
Are you a fool? Can't you speak?

560
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,222
If you were hurt, you should've asked them
to turn back to shore.

561
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,766
What's so glorious about fishing

562
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,060
that you'd pull the net
until your finger breaks?

563
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,648
You're as quiet as a mouse!

564
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:26,113
Life itself isn't evil, but money is.

565
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:30,242
It's hard to farm without renting a plot
from a rich landowner.

566
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:34,413
And it's hard to fish in Dodong-ri without
working on one of that family's boats.

567
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,416
Still, how could he go on that boat?

568
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,335
Don't act like you know.

569
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,963
He's young, but he's trying his best
as the head of his family.

570
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,298
Honey!

571
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,679
Honey.

572
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,475
Can't you hear me?

573
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,561
Help me carry the table.

574
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,775
You're sleeping without eating again.

575
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,622
Dad's a baby. He sleeps all day.

576
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,624
Honey.

577
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:03,919
Oh my.

578
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,464
It's hot.

579
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,049
You should get changed, okay?

580
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,099
You keep sleeping in long sleeves.

581
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,186
Anchovies.

582
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,440
Fresh anchovies for sale.

583
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,027
Anchovies.

584
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,946
Fresh anchovies for sale.

585
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,741
Anchovies.

586
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,995
Anchovies for sale.

587
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,096
Do you need to be
on that squid-fishing boat?

588
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,516
A person needs sleep to live.

589
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,268
Dad, bring us a hundred squids.

590
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,396
Dad doesn't have to bring squids with him.

591
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,485
I'll bring you heaps of squid.

592
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,919
Honey!

593
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,468
Catch a lot of fish!

594
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,013
Catch a lot of squids!

595
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,444
- Go.
- Go.

596
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,264
It looks yummy.

597
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,810
CREAMER - INSTANT COFFEE

598
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,736
You only get four for free.

599
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,285
I'll just buy another can of sugar.

600
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,455
Goddamn it!

601
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,041
- Die!
- Why would I die?

602
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,752
Goddamn it!

603
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,879
You dare mess with your older brother?

604
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,964
Goddamn it!

605
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,217
You really want to fight me?

606
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,264
I couldn't come to help
with your move or to make kimchi.

607
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,767
I still haven't said hello, so…

608
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,771
Is his finger all right?

609
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,314
Did it heal?

610
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,650
Yes, well,

611
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,985
he's getting acupuncture.

612
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,322
Actually, I told my husband off.

613
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,283
If a man was hurt,
he should've turned the boat back.

614
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,411
As if squids are more important.

615
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,540
Mr. Kim and Mr. Park asked him
to turn the boat around.

616
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,042
They just happened to have
full nets that day.

617
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,087
So I guess that's why
my husband got a bit greedy.

618
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,592
But Mr. Yang is something else.

619
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,637
How did he stay on that boat all night
with his finger like that?

620
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,599
If it were me,
I'd be rolling on the floor in pain.

621
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,727
The captain

622
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,187
didn't turn the boat around?

623
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,689
Sorry?

624
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,650
He didn't turn the boat around?

625
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,614
My husband
still can't open his hand all the way.

626
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,287
He spends every night moaning in pain.

627
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,372
Please don't worry about that.

628
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,543
I asked my husband multiple times
not to lay a hand on Mr. Yang.

629
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,212
He says he has stopped beating him up.

630
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,550
I don't understand
why he's only mean to Mr. Yang.

631
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,930
My husband can be hotheaded,

632
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,557
but he's not a bad person.

633
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,641
Goddamn it!

634
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,938
You wanna mess with me?
I'll knock some sense into you!

635
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,650
Goddamn it!

636
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,738
Goddamn it!

637
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,240
Goddamn it!

638
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,243
You wanna mess with me?

639
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,581
Why do you always leave so early?
Who do you think you are?

640
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,459
That man has someone precious at home.

641
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,047
You always bring a packed lunch.
What the hell is in there?

642
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,758
- Goodbye now.
- Hey, you bastard!

643
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:49,973
You'll drive today.

644
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,393
Come on, Captain.
Have you got a crush on Gwan-sik?

645
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,979
Why do you always stop him
when he's about to go home?

646
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,398
I'm going to drink
a whole crate of alcohol.

647
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,359
Stand by and drive me home.

648
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,070
But Captain, you live nearby.

649
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:03,987
Listen!

650
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:09,326
No one gets off the boat
until the captain does!

651
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,621
Catering to the captain's needs
is part of the job!

652
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,622
Got it?

653
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,415
What would you know?

654
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,003
All right, let's get to work.

655
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,465
Let's get to work now. Here.

656
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,136
You don't want to?

657
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,142
You wanna mess with me?
Speak up if you don't want to.

658
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,645
Speak up, and you can get your own boat.

659
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,397
What?

660
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,150
Why don't you say,
"Shut it, mister" again?

661
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,662
But when something isn't right,
it isn't right, ma'am.

662
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,666
Life can take cruel turns,

663
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,501
but I believe

664
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,170
what isn't right isn't right.

665
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,841
Come on, speak up if you don't want to.

666
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,968
You can't do it, can you?

667
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,638
Is that because you don't have a boat?

668
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,557
All right.

669
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,773
You're right. I don't want to.

670
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,027
I can't lie.

671
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,573
Hey!

672
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,789
But…

673
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,344
<i>Got someone precious at home?</i>

674
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,303
Answer me!

675
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,725
Why are you taking my squid?

676
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,895
You can't take anything unless I let you.

677
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,438
Got a boat?

678
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,192
Take these if I let you,
and stay if I say so.

679
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,693
Why do you always run off?

680
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,737
You actually like your wife that much?

681
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,739
What's so great about her?

682
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,075
Come on, say something.

683
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,952
Are you crazy about her?

684
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,871
Are you two hot every night?

685
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,540
Do you love her that damn much?

686
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,292
Yes!

687
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,086
I love her that damn much.

688
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,713
What?

689
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,969
You pair of losers.

690
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,972
Little punk, what the hell do you know?

691
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,182
Goddamn it! I should just…

692
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,352
Captain, why don't you ever
want to go home?

693
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,312
- What, you punk?
- Why?

694
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,606
Are you lonely at home?

695
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,567
Are you not respected there either?

696
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,821
Goddamn it!

697
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,036
Seriously?

698
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,166
Son of a bitch.

699
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,510
You punks need a beating
to knock some sense into you.

700
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,761
What did you say to me?

701
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:19,975
You son of a bitch!

702
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,101
Son of a bitch!

703
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,777
Son of a bitch!

704
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:40,704
Hey, you son of a bitch!

705
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,456
Son of a bitch!

706
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,668
<i>Dad used to say</i>

707
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,423
<i>that Mom was more like a whistle</i>
<i>than a cosmos flower.</i>

708
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,101
My husband

709
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,188
won't be working for you anymore.

710
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,107
He won't be working for you!

711
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,363
Fine. Then don't. Please don't.

712
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,116
You know my brother
is the fishing co-op chief, right?

713
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,911
Don't even think about
getting on a boat in Dodong-ri again!

714
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,955
I almost stepped in dog crap.
"Son of a bitch"?

715
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,292
Goddamn it! You shameless brat!

716
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,504
Like husband, like wife, huh?

717
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,140
"A beating knocks some sense into you"?

718
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,142
You little…

719
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,644
You damned…

720
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,561
You!

721
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,606
How about you come to your senses first?

722
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,443
Then we'll see who's really dog crap!

723
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,569
Goddamn it!

724
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,073
You!

725
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,618
Goddamn it!

726
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:07,082
We need to change Shit-gil's nickname
to "Dodong-ri's son of a bitch."

727
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,001
"Son of a bitch."

728
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,630
Oh man.

729
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,674
It hurts so much.

730
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,140
You're a whistle.

731
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,308
A human whistle.

732
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,565
You kicked him. Why are you crying?

733
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,375
Rice cake for sale!

734
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,919
Buckwheat jelly for sale!

735
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,797
She's got a boiler that doesn't
run on coal, so that's good.

736
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,925
But are there any drafts?

737
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,345
I heard you told Geum-myeong

738
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,515
you'd marry me again if you were asked to.

739
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,643
<i>Mom used to say…</i>

740
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,604
Would you?

741
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,105
Why would I?

742
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,899
It'd be tiresome.

743
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,944
<i>…she felt even sorrier for Dad</i>
<i>than she did for us.</i>

744
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,447
Steel wears out, too, doesn't it?

745
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,490
Why is your body already breaking down?

746
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,783
It's scaring me.

747
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,411
Oh my.

748
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,835
You've been carrying a heavy burden
since you were ten.

749
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,754
No wonder you're worn out.

750
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,341
Don't worry. I'll live longer than you.

751
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,178
Why? You want a new wife after I die?

752
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,021
Do you want a new wife?

753
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,607
How could I leave you behind?

754
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,984
I'd feel better

755
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,196
if I gave you a good send-off first

756
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,823
and followed afterward.

757
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:59,791
"THE SAME SKY, THE SAME STARS,
ETCHED IN THE SAME HEARTS."

758
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,925
