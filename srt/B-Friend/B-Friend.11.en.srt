1
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:45,709
Whoa… the CCTV footage is solid.

2
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,709
Jin, Tuk—get the livestream gear ready.

3
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,834
Dalan, forget the apology script. We’re not using it.

4
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,334
At this point, we have to say we’ve got the CCTV footage.

5
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:00,167
It shows that the customer bring the hair and put it in the cake.

6
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,000
Can you teach me how to make this?

7
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:37,792
You’re awake?

8
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,042
I’m gonna make you a matcha honey lemon drink.

9
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:49,459
You know how to make that?

10
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:54,292
Yes! Jin taught me.

11
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
I’ll go make it now.

12
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:06,167
Be right back.

13
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,999
Here’s your matcha honey lemon

14
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:44,334
Thanks, Dalan.

15
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,584
Why does it smell so good?

16
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,542
I’ll make this for you every single day.

17
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,667
Let me try it first.

18
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,959
Hmm… this is good.

19
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:16,834
You really like it?

20
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,626
It’s actually good.

21
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,459
Yay!

22
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,667
Oh, why isn’t the door locked?

23
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,083
Do anything go missing?

24
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,626
The cake fridge light’s still on too.

25
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,375
Should we go check over there?

26
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:42,959
The lights haven’t even been turned off.

27
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,292
Oh—Lalin?

28
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:54,167
Did you work so late you didn’t even go home?

29
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,667
Uh… yeah.

30
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:07,083
Matcha honey lemon? I thought you don’t know how to make that.

31
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:13,500
Well… there are tutorials online. It’s not that hard.

32
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,125
Alright, I’m gonna get the shop ready.

33
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:21,626
I go with you

34
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,292
Thanks for helping me set things up.

35
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,417
It’s almost time to open and no one else is here.

36
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,000
I can’t let you handle it alone.

37
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,292
Where’s Dalan anyway?

38
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,500
Why isn’t she at work yet?

39
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:23,042
It’s just starting and she come late

40
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,209
She’s just moved here—probably still not getting used to things.

41
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,125
She might’ve had trouble sleeping

42
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:33,417
and went to bed around dawn. She’ll be here.

43
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,918
Responsibility matters, Jin.

44
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:39,250
Yes, sir, Miss Manager.

45
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,083
Here, have a drink—don’t get all grumpy.

46
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:43,959
Thanks.

47
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,209
Do I interrupt something?

48
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:15,167
Interrupt what, Dalan? And why are you late?

49
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,542
I’m sorry.

50
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,334
If you’re late again tomorrow, I’ll have to dock your pay.

51
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:23,292
Wasn’t that my line, Jin?

52
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,167
Oops, forgot my place.

53
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:28,876
Get to work, Dalan.

54
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:44,999
Is there anything I can help with?

55
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:50,459
Jin already set everything up. Just don’t be late next time.

56
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:55,500
This is work, Dalan. You need to be responsible.

57
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,792
You’ve got to manage your time and take your duties seriously.

58
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,751
I’m not going to scold you this time but don’t let it happen again.

59
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:04,876
Consider this your warning.

60
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:08,918
Yes, Kanit. I’m really sorry for being late.

61
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:14,000
Go get ready. And do you remember what I taught you yesterday?

62
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,667
First customer is coming.

63
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,626
No need to make matcha honey lemon today—Khun Lalin already had one.

64
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:24,918
I already make it.

65
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:34,792
I mean… from now on, I’ll be the one making it for Lalin every day.

66
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:48,334
Lalin has to go pitch to a client outside today. I’m counting on you, Kanit.

67
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,999
Got it. No problem.

68
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,209
I’ll go with you!

69
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,000
Dalan.

70
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:01,209
I’m kidding! Want more matcha honey lemon?

71
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,209
No, it’s fine. You made it for...

72
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:10,500
Uh, I mean you can make it for Kanit and Jin.

73
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,375
Good practice for you.

74
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,834
Alright then, I’m heading out.

75
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,626
Dalan, the order is passion fruit soda

76
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,500
why do you make strawberry soda?

77
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,042
I’m sorry

78
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,334
It’s okay. Let me help.

79
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:24,751
Jin, let Dalan do it herself.

80
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:26,876
Make a new one, Dalan.

81
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,542
But if you mess it up again, I’ll have to dock your pay.

82
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:33,125
Get it.

83
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:40,459
Kanit, you’re kind of intense in this mode.

84
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:42,584
Not really.

85
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,250
If Dalan gets the hang of things,

86
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,459
You won’t have to do everything alone. You won’t be so tired.

87
00:14:58,584 --> 00:14:59,667
Here’s the drink.

88
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:10,334
I’m sorry! I’ll bring you a new one right away.

89
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:10,709
Thanks.

90
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:11,834
Sorry…

91
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:20,334
Dalan.

92
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,375
Are you okay? You seem kinda out of it today.

93
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:29,083
I’m fine, Jin.

94
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,000
If there’s anything I need to improve, just let me know.

95
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,792
I just want you to stay focused

96
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,626
so there won’t be so many mistakes.

97
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:41,375
Okay, Jin.

98
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,959
There’s nothing else for today. You can head home and rest.

99
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,751
I’ll just sit here for a bit before I go, if that’s okay.

100
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,250
Don’t get too lost in your thoughts and end up staying too late.

101
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:57,626
Okay, Jin.

102
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,083
Dalan, why aren’t you answering my calls?

103
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:37,167
Don’t think I don’t know what you’ve been up to.

104
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:54,626
Next time, don’t stay late waiting for me.

105
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,334
I just wanted to be with you.

106
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:06,626
Look, Guea have to drive you home. See?

107
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,876
Then next time I’ll just move closer so Guea doesn’t have to take me.

108
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:18,375
Hmm… Dalan.

109
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,083
We’ve arrived, Miss Lalin.

110
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,792
Thanks, P’Guea.

111
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,667
You can head back now

112
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:11,709
Dalan’s still asleep. She must’ve been exhausted from work.

113
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:18,167
Uh… it’s okay. I can drive myself home.

114
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:20,709
Alright then, Miss Lalin. See you tomorrow.

115
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:47,626
Are you awake already?

116
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,751
I don’t want to wake up yet.

117
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:58,125
I just want to stay like this with you, P’Lalin… all night long.

118
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:00,584
I think I’ll go back to sleep.

119
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:08,083
Hum, you’re such a little trickster. Go rest now.

120
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,876
Go on.

121
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:22,584
If you hit me again, I’m gonna kiss you.

122
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:25,959
You, huh…

123
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,709
I sent you to get a degree…

124
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,042
And you ended up working at a café?

125
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,042
If you don’t come home today,

126
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:23,918
then don’t bother coming home ever again.

127
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:01,292
Hey, Dalan, why the long face?

128
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:05,667
Come on, get ready—customers are about to come in.

129
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,000
I’m here to resign.

130
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:13,125
Huh? What happened?

131
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,709
Is something bothering you?

132
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:26,250
What’s wrong? You can talk to us.

133
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:31,918
Yeah, you just started! These things take time to learn.

134
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:37,209
I have to go back and work at home.

135
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:45,334
I’m sorry, P’Jin P’Kanit.

136
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,334
Goodbye.

137
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,292
I came to say goodbye.

138
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:35,209
What do you mean, Dalan?

139
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:40,000
You’re not gonna work with me anymore?

140
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:45,125
I have to go back and help out at home.

141
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:55,500
That’s okay. I understand.

142
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:00,000
But drop by and visit sometimes, alright?

143
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,375
Will you forget me?

144
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,375
I promise I won’t let you down.

145
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,459
But right now… you’re already did.

146
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,626
I’ve been waited for someone before.

147
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,667
I don’t want to put myself in that place again.

148
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,167
Please…

149
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:43,459
I don’t want to be hurt like that again.

150
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:49,834
I’m sorry…

151
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:21,542
Present

152
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,667
This is what cheapskates deserve.

153
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,375
That is way too much. This is a workplace, not your house.

154
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:32,083
I know, I’m not a kid.

155
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,292
Ugh, that felt so satisfying.

156
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:42,000
I’m heading out.

157
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,626
And don’t forget to transfer the money to me.

158
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,375
Jin.

159
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,918
Tuk, Som, get the shop back in order as quickly as you can.

160
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,042
Kanit, take Jin home first.

161
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,125
Got it.

162
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,250
Come on, Jin. Let’s go.

163
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,459
Som, Tuk, how are you guys holding up?

164
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:17,667
Whoa…

165
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,459
We’re fine, Khun Lalin.

166
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:26,751
I was with a customer—didn’t expect something this serious to happen.

167
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,000
It’s okay, Khun Lalin.

168
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:32,250
What about Jin and Kanit?

169
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,000
Khun Kanit took her home.

170
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:39,709
Just a little here… and here…

171
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:41,125
Are you sure you’re all okay?

172
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,834
Yes, totally fine. Just minor stuff.

173
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh, did it really have to go that far?

174
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,334
Just a little bit.

175
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,959
How’s everyone doing?

176
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,667
I and Lan rush over as soon as we found out.

177
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,500
Have you reported it to the police yet?

178
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,459
Not yet.

179
00:31:55,584 --> 00:32:00,751
Go file a report.. Head to the police station first—I'll go with you.

180
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,500
Dawan, wait in the room for now.

181
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:05,334
Okay.

182
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:11,375
I’ll leave the shop with you for a bit. I’ll go file the report and come right back.

183
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,959
You got it!

184
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,417
Go serve now.

185
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,751
Dawan, what would you like to have?

186
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:04,042
Umm… I’ll have the same as usual—iced cocoa, extra sweet.

187
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:07,500
Okay! One iced cocoa coming up.

188
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:18,500
P’Lan and Khun Lalin aren’t back yet?

189
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:21,584
Not yet, I think.

190
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,999
Tuk, where do I press for the iced cocoa, super sweet?

191
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,751
Here, I’ll do it. Let me see…

192
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:51,292
You all look really busy. Is there anything I can help with?

193
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,292
Huh? Dawan, are you really offering to help us?

194
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:58,709
Yes, I’m bored just sitting in the room.

195
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,751
I can help with anything—serving, taking orders, cleaning tables—whatever you need!

196
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:39,667
All done! Anything else I can help with?

197
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:12,626
Thanks for coming with me to report it to the police.

198
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:16,626
No problem, You're welcome

199
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,334
Ow!

200
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:23,709
What’s wrong? Do you need to go to toilet?

201
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,918
It’s not that…

202
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,042
I’m hungry.

203
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:31,417
Hungry?

204
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:36,999
Yeah, craving coffee. Can we stop for a bit?

205
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:39,751
Of course.

206
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,083
What are you doing?

207
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:55,876
Taking photos of you.

208
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,500
Let’s not. It might cause problems.

209
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:04,167
I don’t want to be the reason you end up unhappy.

210
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:13,042
Please, Let me at least keep something good between us.

211
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,500
Here, try this—it’s really good. I’ll cut it for you.

212
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:42,542
Do you still like chicken? You like frenchfries I remember.

213
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:44,792
Thank you.

214
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,375
Do you like it?

215
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:31,334
Love it.

216
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,667
If I buy you a bouquet, it’ll wither in a few days.

217
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:56,125
So… I’ll buy you a potted one instead, so it’ll last longer—stay with you.

218
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:01,083
Pick one. I’ll buy it for you.

219
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:22,417
Look, this purple one—it’s kind of unique.

220
00:38:26,626 --> 00:38:28,250
Or do you like this color more?

221
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:37,999
You like yellow?

222
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:42,626
This one’s cute too.

223
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:44,959
But not as cute as me.

224
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,459
The flowers we got from that shop are so pretty, Dr. Lan.

225
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:10,375
Yeah, they have tons of beautiful ones.

226
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,500
P’Lan, you’re back.

227
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:18,292
Yep, just got back. Took Khun Lalin to get flowers.

228
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:22,500
They’re really pretty, Khun Lalin.

229
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,209
Hey Dim!

230
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:54,459
Hey P'Dawan

231
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:56,584
What are you doing in the infirmary this early?

232
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:58,209
Are you not feeling well?

233
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:01,000
Not me. It’s Lun.

234
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:05,459
Ahh, even doctors can get sick too, huh?

235
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,125
Mmm.

236
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:12,375
So, are you the resort’s male nurse or what?

237
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:15,125
You’re juggling so many roles.

238
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:17,792
I came to get some medicine for Lalin too.

239
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:19,709
Ohh.

240
00:43:25,876 --> 00:43:26,834
Here it is. Got it.

241
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,999
And what are you looking for? Want me to help you find it?

242
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,918
Mmm, I’m looking for some cream for mosquito bites.

243
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:39,250
Ah, this one should work too.

244
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:42,999
Do you want it? I’ll grab another jar for you—there should be more.

245
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:43,626
Mmm.

246
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,626
So… what’s wrong with Lalin?

247
00:43:52,626 --> 00:43:53,918
I’m not really sure.

248
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:57,250
I see red bumps on her arms and face.

249
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,334
Probably mosquito bites.

250
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,083
Really?

251
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:12,876
Mmm.

252
00:44:34,751 --> 00:44:36,167
Come on in, Dim.

253
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:43,000
Oh

254
00:44:44,918 --> 00:44:46,209
Miss Dawan?

255
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,083
Just Dawan. Not that Miss Dawan.

256
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:52,834
Uh…

257
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,999
Come here, I’ll put some cream on you.

258
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:01,125
This morning I went to get medicine for P’Lun

259
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:03,542
and ran into Dim at the infirmary.

260
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:06,417
So I brought some extra for you too.

261
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:07,751
Here.

262
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,500
Does it itch?

263
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:20,334
Thanks.

264
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:30,417
Let me do the other arm.

265
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:39,250
Oh, you got bitten a lot.

266
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:40,959
Come on.

267
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:48,751
You know what?

268
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:51,250
You’re allergic to mosquito bites just like P’Lun.

269
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:59,042
When you get bitten, you have to blow on it like this—then it’ll feel better.

270
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:02,292
Really?

271
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:05,709
Mmm. I have the same thing.

272
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:10,959
When I was a kid, I’d swell up, get super itchy and red just like this.

273
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:13,834
P’Lun and Mom always had to blow on it for me.

274
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,626
You need to take good care of yourself, okay?

275
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,000
Okay.

276
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,375
Don’t let yourself get bitten like this again.

277
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:39,209
How’s the rice porridge?

278
00:46:40,459 --> 00:46:43,250
It’s good. Really good. I didn’t think you could cook this well.

279
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:47,125
Hey, Jin, how are you feeling?

280
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:49,375
I’m better now.

281
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,459
Honestly, you should’ve rested a bit more.

282
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,083
No need to rush back to work.

283
00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:55,459
Oh no no no—

284
00:46:56,876 --> 00:46:59,417
It’s good to be back at work! Keeps her mind from overthinking.

285
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:02,292
Right, Jin? Let’s just work on something we love.

286
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:04,626
Hey no

287
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,500
This one is mine.

288
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:15,375
And this one too.

289
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,250
Hmm, Kanit is acting kind of weird.

290
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,000
oh

291
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:30,542
What? How?

292
00:47:31,209 --> 00:47:34,417
Why? What? you are weird.

293
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:37,042
What is going on?

294
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,667
How long has it been…That you’ve remembered everything.

295
00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:28,918
From the first day until now.

296
00:48:31,584 --> 00:48:33,918
My feelings for you have never changed.

297
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,709
Whoa, Lun sings so beautifully.

298
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:50,375
Don’t you ever get tired of eating the same thing?

299
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:55,292
Nope. Lalin likes eating the same stuff over and over.

300
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:58,500
Because if I try something new, it might not be as good.

301
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:01,584
How have things been lately? Is school tiring?

302
00:49:02,918 --> 00:49:05,542
Not really. You must be more tired than me.

303
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:07,459
Med school sounds way tougher.

304
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:11,042
seeing you makes all the tiredness go away.
