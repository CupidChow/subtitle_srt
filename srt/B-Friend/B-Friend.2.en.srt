1
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,200
Dim, Arm, it’s been a while! How are you doing?

2
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
So where are you going?

3
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,360
Oh, we're going to harvest vegetables in the garden.

4
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,360
That’s good! I’m heading there as well.

5
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,080
So we can walk together.

6
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,520
Why are you here?

7
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,800
Shouldn’t you be at school?

8
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,640
Huh?

9
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,880
What?

10
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,560
He's on school break, so he came to help out at the resort.

11
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,800
That's good. Let's go.

12
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,080
Oh, Ms.Dawan.

13
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,840
What's that bruise on your arm?

14
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,920
I don't know either.

15
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,360
Maybe I just bumped into something.

16
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,760
You’re so clumsy!

17
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,880
Just a little.

18
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,800
You're so annoying! What's wrong?

19
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
It's nothing. Never mind.

20
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,880
Thianhom.

21
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,600
Gotcha!

22
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,840
Laughing at others so much, are you feeling chilly?

23
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,400
What kind of nonsense is this?

24
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
So you wanna play like this, huh?

25
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,880
Where are you trying to run away to?

26
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,120
No No.

27
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,320
How’s that? You’re really good at teasing me, huh?

28
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,760
Gotcha!

29
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,240
Stop!

30
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,240
Why didn't you tell me you were going to stop?

31
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,760
Dawan why did you stop?

32
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,080
Look over there.

33
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,240
See? They're playing so cutely.

34
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Are you tired?

35
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,560
They're so cute.

36
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
So what should we do? Should we just go to them?

37
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,800
Why would you interrupt them?

38
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Look, they are having fun.

39
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,480
Interrupting people who are having fun is a sin, you know?

40
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,920
Then we'll wait until they're done playing.

41
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,880
We can go sit and wait.

42
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,960
Hey everyone.

43
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,360
What are you doing over there?

44
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
Aren't you gonna pick the veggies?

45
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,280
The reason I woke you up early to harvest the vegetables is because

46
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,000
once you pick them, they won’t taste bitter.

47
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,880
Wait, is that even related?

48
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,320
Of course! The bitterness comes from the sap.

49
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,240
Vegetables release sap only when they get hot.

50
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
Sunlight heats them up.

51
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
And then they release sap to protect themselves.

52
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,000
So in the morning, when they’re still cool,

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,880
they don’t release the sap.

54
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,160
That’s why the taste isn’t bitter when you pick them early.

55
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,960
Mmm.

56
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,200
You're right.

57
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,000
Sweet, crisp, delicious.

58
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,120
Got it.

59
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,200
Tomorrow morning, I'll come pick some for salad rolls.

60
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,960
Tianhom

61
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,840
Let me change clothes first.

62
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,960
Okay

63
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Take your time.

64
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,720
Good morning!

65
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,800
Hello, everyone.

66
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,520
Hello.

67
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,600
Hello Mr.Tan and Mr.Ashi. You're up early!

68
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,760
Oh, but I was still behind everyone else.

69
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,680
Oh, that’s totally fine. You’re still on time.

70
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,920
So…we are on time, right?

71
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes, you're on time.

72
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,240
Mind if we join in picking vegetables too?

73
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,160
Sure! I will take you to get scissors and a basket.

74
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,560
Okay, thank you so much.

75
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,920
This way, please.

76
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,280
Hey Arm! Be careful.

77
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
I think...

78
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,880
I’ve found the one I love, bro.

79
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,840
Which one should I pick?

80
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,800
Can I pick?

81
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,440
Yes, sure.

82
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,680
Yeah, I got it.

83
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,520
Pretty, huh? Looks super yummy!

84
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,600
Is it okay to eat it now?

85
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,120
These veggies are really fresh!

86
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,240
Try it!

87
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,200
Just you wait!

88
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,840
You okay?

89
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,640
A little bit.

90
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,440
Wanna head out now?

91
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,400
Oh! Mr.Tan, Mr.Achi.

92
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,840
Hello, Miss Lalin.

93
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,160
Hello! Please make yourself at home.

94
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,400
Sure. Then if you’ll excuse me.

95
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,280
Yes.

96
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,240
Oh, Lalin. What are you doing here?

97
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,560
If you needed something, you could’ve just messaged me on Line.

98
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,680
Just had a little errand. Nothing important.

99
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,080
What’s up with her?

100
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
No idea, bro.

101
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,280
Hi, Dawan

102
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,360
You're up early.

103
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,880
Do you usually wake up this early every day?

104
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,840
Um… no.

105
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
I didn’t sleep well last night.

106
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,160
Oh? Why? Was the room not okay?

107
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,120
No, no, it’s not that.

108
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,640
Are you alright?

109
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,320
You don’t look so good… Are you feeling unwell?

110
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,200
I’m okay. It’s nothing.

111
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
How about this?

112
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
I'll help you to harvest the vegetables.

113
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,080
Oh, that’s alright.

114
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,000
- That’s alright.
- Come on, let me help.

115
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,040
It’s okay.

116
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,320
It’s really okay.

117
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,840
No, really.

118
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,680
It’s okay.

119
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,720
Miss…

120
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,000
Miss...

121
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,520
Miss?

122
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,920
What’s your name again?

123
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,160
Lalin.

124
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,440
Oh? Why do you look like that?

125
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,360
Didn’t enjoy picking vegetables?

126
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,920
Lan.

127
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,760
I just met a woman.

128
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,680
She said her name was...

129
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,760
Lalin.

130
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,080
She said her name is Lalin.

131
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,880
Really?

132
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,840
Yeah. Lalin.

133
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,480
Then she came and talked to me,

134
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,000
like she’s known me for a long time.

135
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,640
But the point is… I don’t remember her at all.

136
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,920
What should I do, Lan?

137
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,200
What about your notebook? Did you bring it with you?

138
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,600
It’s probably nothing.

139
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,920
Try looking through your notebook. Maybe you wrote something down.

140
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
I’ll leave you to wash the veggies, okay?

141
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,160
Lalin...

142
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,280
Long hair,

143
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,320
big eyes,

144
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,560
sharp nose...

145
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,200
She took me to get iced cocoa at the café,

146
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,280
then brought me back to my room.

147
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,800
Oh, Dawan...

148
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
So how did it go? Did you find anything?

149
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,320
Of course. I even found a picture.

150
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
Wow,

151
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,520
That’s something! You actually found a photo?

152
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,240
She once did something really kind for me.

153
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,840
So I wanted to keep it… didn’t want to forget.

154
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,880
But in the end, I still forgot...

155
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,600
Lan, can you help me think? What should I do?

156
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,040
Hmm… how about this? Let’s go eat at the cafeteria.

157
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,960
Why?

158
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,080
Well, most of the staff usually eat there.

159
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,520
So?

160
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,360
In case we get to see Lalin.

161
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,240
No,

162
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,560
I’m not ready to see her yet.

163
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,840
Come on, let’s go.

164
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,560
I’m not going.

165
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
Oh, come on.

166
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
You’ll have to face each other sooner or later anyway.

167
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,560
We’re staying here for a while anyway.

168
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,960
Let’s go.

169
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,200
No!

170
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,880
Weren't you going to make salad rolls?

171
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
Make some for her too.

172
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,920
You think that’s a good idea?

173
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,600
Of course!

174
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,760
Your salad rolls are the best I've ever had.

175
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,240
Lalin will calm down for sure.

176
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,640
Good girl.

177
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,960
Hey, look!

178
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,920
Dim and Arm are there too.

179
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,920
I see them.

180
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,000
Are you ready?

181
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,520
I’m ready.

182
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,920
Hey!

183
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,760
Over here!

184
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,680
Stay calm,

185
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,400
Take a breath.

186
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
Go when you’re ready.

187
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay.

188
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,640
Do you want some lime?

189
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,960
It's okay. It's sour.

190
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,800
Just a little.

191
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,080
Try adding it. Give it a try.

192
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,960
It's delicious.

193
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,360
I haven't had stir-fried noodles in a long time.

194
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,200
Here’s some shrimp. Eat a lot.

195
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,400
Why did you give him so much? Give it back.

196
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,680
- Just take the flowers.
- Stop teasing others.

197
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,000
That’s not edible. Just take it all away.

198
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,640
I haven’t had stir-fried noodles in a long time.

199
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,760
Hi, Dawan!

200
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,040
You're eating here today too?

201
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,920
It’s okay.

202
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,080
I came with Dr. Lun.

203
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
Over there.

204
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
Do you have a seat yet?

205
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,800
Why don't you join us?

206
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,680
I just happened to pass by and saw Dim, Arm, and Miss Lalin.

207
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,320
Lalin, what are you eating?

208
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,840
It looks delicious.

209
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,880
Maybe I’ll order the same.

210
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,040
Oh, this?

211
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,920
It’s seafood Pad Mee Korat.

212
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,600
It’s really good.

213
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,120
The noodles are organic—they’re from our resort.

214
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
Oh, that’s great!

215
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,040
Uh, this morning I went to pick some vegetables.

216
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,880
So I made some salad rolls with them.

217
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,840
I made some for Miss Lalin too.

218
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,200
Lalin.

219
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,040
And I made the salad dressing myself too.

220
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,600
It’s actually a secret recipe from my family.

221
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,560
But I’m not sure if you’ll like it.

222
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,960
Please give it a try.

223
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Wow, thank you so much, Dawan!

224
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,200
Hey, look! That looks really tasty.

225
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,720
Here,Lalin,

226
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,000
Eat this in the afternoon so you won’t be hungry.

227
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,400
I’m done eating.

228
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,360
I’ll get going to work now.

229
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,120
Huh? Where are you rushing off to, Lalin?

230
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,920
Take the salad rolls with you!

231
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,400
Dawan,

232
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,760
Don’t mind her.

233
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,240
Lalin’s always like this.

234
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,840
She’s getting old... forgetful.

235
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Right, Arm?

236
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,120
Yeah, that’s what happens when you get old.

237
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,400
Thanks, Dim, Arm.

238
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,840
I made some for you two as well.

239
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,960
Thank you so much!

240
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,760
Give it a try.

241
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,320
Hey, you’re eating all by yourself!

242
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,440
Of course!

243
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,240
Let me have some! Share it!

244
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,800
Here, take this one. I don’t feel like eating it anymore.

245
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,520
This one looks really good.

246
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,360
Give it here. Let’s share!

247
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,240
No.

248
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,640
Just one piece.

249
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,040
Look at the salad dressing—it looks so tasty!

250
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,440
Hey...

251
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,520
I was wondering who that was!

252
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,360
Have some noodles with me, will you?

253
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,560
Come!

254
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,360
Oh, thank you.

255
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,000
Chopsticks

256
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,360
Hmm... looks so delicious.

257
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,680
Smells amazing... it's pork bone broth.

258
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,240
Hurry,

259
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,880
I’m about to try it.

260
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,240
Try it!

261
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,480
Is it delicious?

262
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,800
Do you know?

263
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,160
This place is my go-to.

264
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,320
I've been eating here since it was 15 baht a bowl.

265
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,640
Now it’s almost 100 baht per bowl.

266
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,360
This one? Almost 100? Seriously?

267
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes.

268
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Next time, you don't have to buy it. I feel kinda bad.

269
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,000
Why?

270
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,560
Just look.

271
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,240
The noodles are handmade, and even the meatballs too.

272
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,680
They give us so much—it’s totally fair.

273
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,880
Hmm… still, I just feel bad anyway.

274
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,040
And what about that omelet rice you eat every day—aren’t you tired of it?

275
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,520
What do you mean “omelet every day”?

276
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,560
I’ve got boiled eggs, steamed eggs,

277
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,760
And instant cup noodles too!

278
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,920
You didn’t even see it.

279
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
You’re still bragging?

280
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, it's true. It's not like I have omelets every day.

281
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,600
Seriously? You’re still showing off!

282
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,200
Well, it's true. It's not like I have only omelets.

283
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,320
Fine, I’ll give you that.

284
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,920
But next time,

285
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,080
Jin, you have to wait for me to eat together.

286
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,600
Hmm...?

287
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,680
Don’t eat alone again, okay?

288
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,200
wait for me too.

289
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
And about the food…

290
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,960
next time, you don’t have to bring any. I’ll buy it myself.

291
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,120
Whoa,

292
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,800
Well, if you're going to buy it, I’ll chip in half.

293
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,120
No worries. It’s really nothing.

294
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,480
Still, I feel kind of bad.

295
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,760
Oops, I spilled it everywhere.

296
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,520
So, you're not going to eat at the cafeteria anymore?

297
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,720
Nope.

298
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,760
I’ll just stay here. It’s quiet.

299
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,880
Hurry and eat before the noodles get soggy.

300
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,560
Fine.

301
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,960
Is it good?

302
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,360
Hi! Mr. Than, Mr. Achi.

303
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,400
Are you on your way to the cafeteria?

304
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,720
Yes, we are.

305
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,080
Is everything okay here?

306
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,520
Oh, it’s great!

307
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,320
It looked beautiful in the reviews.

308
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,120
But seeing it in person,

309
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,040
It’s even more beautiful.

310
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
The atmosphere is lovely too.

311
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,120
And most importantly, the food is really delicious.

312
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,640
Exactly! And both of us love nature.

313
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,280
Seeing the trees and flowers like this…

314
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,600
We don’t even want to go back to Bangkok, right?

315
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
That’s so heartwarming to hear.

316
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,200
That kind of feedback makes all the effort worth it.

317
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,200
But... if there’s anything you'd like us to improve, please feel free to let me know.

318
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,760
Don’t hesitate.

319
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,480
Because everything we've created here is to ensure that every guest leaves with a memorable and positive experience.

320
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,440
We don’t want anyone to feel like their trip was wasted.

321
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,600
Everything’s perfect, Ms. Lalin.

322
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,440
We’ll definitely come back next time for sure.

323
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,080
Ooh,

324
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
What’s that over there?

325
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,000
Looks like salad rolls. Achi’s favorite, right?

326
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,640
Ohh… I was just craving them too!

327
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,640
- Just a moment, please.
- Whoa, they look delicious.

328
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,840
A client is calling.

329
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,960
This one’s a bit important.

330
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,400
Excuse me for a moment while I take the call.

331
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Yes...

332
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,880
Yes.

333
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,360
You’ll be arriving today, right?

334
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,840
Yes.

335
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,720
Hey, Dim.

336
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
What’s up with your sister today?

337
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,000
No idea. Isn’t she always moody like this?

338
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,840
You’re still not used to it?

339
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,320
Yeah, true.

340
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,760
But she only gets like this when something goes wrong with her work.

341
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,440
Right... that’s true.

342
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,320
Or maybe...

343
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,280
The chef made something she didn’t like?

344
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,320
Nah, if she didn’t like it, she would’ve complained right away.

345
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,800
Maybe...

346
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,920
It’s the heat.

347
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,680
Not enough sleep.

348
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,040
Or… maybe it’s her period.

349
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,120
Hey…

350
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,840
Or could it be Dawan?

351
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,240
I bet that’s it. It’s gotta be because of Dawan.

352
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,200
I’m a girl, I can tell. There’s something going on.

353
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,880
But no,

354
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,080
They were still talking fine, weren’t they?

355
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,000
What’s wrong with her?

356
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,800
Hey…

357
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,160
This morning she didn’t take the salad rolls from Dawan.

358
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,760
You saw it too.

359
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,000
Don’t tell me you still don’t know my sister.

360
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,480
She doesn’t take stuff from people randomly. She only eats what she trusts.

361
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,880
Hmm…

362
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,920
So wait,

363
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,760
That box of salad rolls ended up in the trash, huh?

364
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, obviously.

365
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,720
Wow… this is all your fault.

366
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,040
Why’d you shove it into her hand like that?

367
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,920
You could’ve just left it on the table—simple.

368
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,520
Why? You wanted it?

369
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,280
Hell yeah.

370
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,760
Didn’t you just eat? Still not full?

371
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,360
It was just so good, bro.

372
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,440
Ugh…

373
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,880
Go get to work already.

374
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,400
You though—I still want to eat it.

375
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,760
Lalin.

376
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,800
Yeah?

377
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,400
Why didn’t you check Line message?

378
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,960
I was busy. What’s up?

379
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,120
Can you come outside for a seccond?

380
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,440
Can it wait?

381
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,520
Nope.

382
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,720
Ugh… then they’ll have to wait.

383
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,320
Did you forget something, Lalin?

384
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,920
Did you have an appointment with someone?

385
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,720
Think carefully.

386
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,840
They’ve been waiting outside for 20 minutes now.

387
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,120
Oh no...

388
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,040
I totally forgot I had a meeting with a client!

389
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,040
Ugh, why didn’t you just tell me right away? Stop beating around the bush!

390
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,000
I did tell you! You just weren’t paying attention.

391
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
Okay, okay — I’m going now.

392
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,960
What are you doing?

393
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,840
I’m watching something amazing that’s about to happen in my life, bro.

394
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Oh wow, that big of a moment, huh?

395
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,840
Yes.

396
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Yeah, it’s eye-opening!

397
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,640
You mean Ashi and Tan?

398
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,680
Yes.

399
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,960
I really like them.

400
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,920
I like them too.

401
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,200
I love them, but they don't know.

402
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,840
Better than them knowing.

403
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,360
but not feeling the same.

404
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,040
The women at this resort,

405
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,600
really can't resist handsome guys.

406
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,800
Come on, you're no different. You can't resist pretty girls either.

407
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,880
I'm going back to work.

408
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,000
Hold up, I got something to say to you.

409
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,040
It was worth it, planting the seed of love.

410
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,240
Oops!

411
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,520
I planted vegetables!

412
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,520
Alright, back to my vegetable garden!

413
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,560
I wish we could stay like this forever.

414
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,600
You’re into nature too, huh?

415
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,800
I only ever saw you at bars.

416
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,760
Oh,

417
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,360
That was back then, wasn’t it?

418
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Nowadays, I barely go at all.

419
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,240
Ahh…

420
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,320
Then let's come back here again next holiday.

421
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,600
Of course.

422
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,840
We can come here again

423
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,560
Or anywhere else.

424
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,880
As long as you're with me.

425
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,560
No matter what it takes,

426
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,960
I’m always ready.

427
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,400
I’m not easy,

428
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,120
but I’m easily into you.

429
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,640
You're just too cute.

430
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,360
No wonder I can’t get away.

431
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Did you ever think about leaving me?

432
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,440
No,

433
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,920
but honestly,

434
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,360
there was a time... early in our relationship

435
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,000
When my family didn't approve.

436
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,840
I felt pressured.

437
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,160
I pitied you, Ashi.

438
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,680
I didn’t want you to struggle because of me.

439
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,160
I was really unsettled back then and ended up thinking some stupid things.

440
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,120
I'm sorry.

441
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,600
It’s okay.

442
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,040
That was a long time ago.

443
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,160
Right now,

444
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,680
Having you is all that matters.

445
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,040
As long as we keep loving each other every day, that’s enough.

446
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Thank you.

447
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,360
For being the peace in my life.

448
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,640
And I promise that

449
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,280
I’ll love you.

450
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,320
With all the love a man can give someone,

451
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,880
Forever.

452
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,160
What are you thinking?

453
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,520
Probably the same thing you are.

454
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Here? Seriously?

455
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,560
You’re crazy.

456
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,400
But there’s not really anyone around…

457
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,920
No.

458
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,680
One kiss, please!

459
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
Nobody

460
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,560
Do you think this kind of love is okay?

461
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Of course, bro.

462
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,560
Besides P’Than and P’Achi.

463
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,760
At our resort, there’s also P’Thian

464
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,080
And Peach.

465
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,400
Even though they don’t see each other every day,

466
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,600
They still love each other.

467
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,720
But I think this kind of love isn’t natural.

468
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,520
Then what kind of love do you think is natural?

469
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,720
A man and a woman falling in love, getting married,

470
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,760
Having kids, carrying on the family line — stuff like that.

471
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,680
You're so old-fashioned, bro.

472
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,640
This kind of love is even more natural

473
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,720
Loving without conditions.

474
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,600
I love you.

475
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,040
You love me.

476
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,360
It’s between two people. That’s all that matters.

477
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,320
But won’t a relationship like this fade quickly?

478
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,680
Like, together for a bit and then break up.

479
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,160
I think it depends on the individuals.

480
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,480
Some straight couples

481
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,760
Date for 10 years,

482
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,160
Have a dozen kids,

483
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,920
Fall out of love, can’t stand each other,

484
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,360
And end up breaking up anyway.

485
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,120
No matter what gender,

486
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,280
Disappointment or happiness in love —

487
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,280
It can happen at any age,

488
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Any situation, any social status. That’s just how it is.

489
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,120
If I had a choice,

490
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,160
I wouldn’t want anyone to go through something like this…

491
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,960
Especially not P’Lalin.

492
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,080
Come on,bro. You can’t stop this kind of thing.

493
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,920
Just let it be. Let it happen naturally.

494
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
There — you were asking about what’s natural.

495
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,760
This is it. This is nature.

496
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,480
It's so peaceful and shady here.

497
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,720
Yes, it is.

498
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,320
Thank you.

499
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,560
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

500
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,840
No worries at all, Khun Lalin.

501
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,040
This resort is absolutely beautiful.

502
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,160
It’s so serene and pleasant to walk around here.

503
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,600
Thank you so much.

504
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,680
The air is incredibly fresh.

505
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,880
Every guest who stays here gets to breathe in this fresh air

506
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,320
and truly relax — it feels just like home.

507
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,720
My parents put their heart into building this place.

508
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,640
They wanted to help develop the community and

509
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,480
help locals earn a living.

510
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,840
This way, please. I’ll take you on a tour.

511
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,720
Sure.

512
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,440
The entire resort area belongs to my family.

513
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,160
The locals around here mostly work in farming and gardening.

514
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,920
But my parents

515
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,440
developed it into organic farmland.

516
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Blending with traditional rural-style architecture.

517
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,520
Like bamboo walkways,

518
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,360
Thatch-roofed cottages,

519
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,160
We even dug natural canals.

520
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,760
This canal right here, we dug it ourselves.

521
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,840
It has a drainage system that flows into the main river,

522
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,600
So there’s no need to worry about flooding.

523
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,000
And the water in this canal comes purely from natural rainwater.

524
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,520
Can we paddle boats in the canal?

525
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,720
Yes, we have boats available — free of charge.

526
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,480
Wow, that’s wonderful.

527
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Alright, then. This way please—I'll take you to see more.

528
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,560
Yes.

529
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,160
This area here is our activity lawn.

530
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,280
We use it for seminars,

531
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,840
group talks, games, and sports.

532
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,360
I have to say — the lighting here in the evening is beautiful.

533
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,280
the lighting here in the evening is beautiful.

534
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,600
You can grill BBQ or even have a Thai-style mookata party.

535
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,800
It’s also a great spot for taking photos.

536
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,200
Next, I’ll take you to see the rooms.

537
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,520
What do you think of room number 3? Do you like it?

538
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,200
I really love it.

539
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,040
From the outside it looks small, but inside it’s actually really spacious.

540
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,480
Yes, we designed it with higher ceilings than usual house.

541
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,480
And we installed large glass walls on both sides to make it feel open and airy.

542
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,120
I really like the traditional Thai sleeveless blouse you provide here.

543
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,440
It’s really cute!

544
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,440
It’s basically a dress code around here!

545
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,160
There are more room like this. I’ll take you to see them too.

546
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,360
Okay, let’s go!

547
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,000
Peach, take these vegetables with you, okay?

548
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,240
Thank you.

549
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,040
Mmm… I don’t want to go back to Bangkok.

550
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,400
Just say you don’t want to go back to work.

551
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
No.

552
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,920
I don’t want to be in Bangkok alone… without you.

553
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,560
Really? You didn’t say that this morning.

554
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,560
Well, this morning I didn’t even want to wake up.

555
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,160
Then why don’t you quit your job and come work here with me?

556
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,600
Can I? really? Are you serious right now?

557
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,640
Let’s not… if you stay here, you wouldn’t be doing what you love.

558
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,120
But here, I have someone I love. Morning, noon, and night.

559
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,160
That's all right.

560
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,000
You’ll get bored of me eventually.

561
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,720
No! I’ve never been bored of you, not even once.

562
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,800
Either way, it still won’t work out.

563
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,640
You support me in doing what I loves here.

564
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,120
So why should I be selfish?

565
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,680
You deserve to do what you want.

566
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,080
Maybe someone around here will hire me to design something.

567
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,680
Oh really? You mean designing tractors

568
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,600
or farm tools now?

569
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,440
Korat’s not far from here—

570
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,520
If you’re missing me, swing by sometime.

571
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,360
Or maybe you want me to drive to visit you instead?

572
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,120
No need.

573
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,080
You're not great at driving—it’s dangerous.

574
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,640
I’ll drive to see you instead.

575
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,480
Mmm. Okay. Take care and do your best at work!

576
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,800
And you take care of your garden too.

577
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,560
Don’t worry about that. I’ve got it covered.

578
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,200
I’ve reserved you. No one else is allowed.

579
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,240
I know.

580
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,680
Now go! Get in the car. Go to work.

581
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,640
Okay, okay.

582
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,560
I’m leaving now.

583
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,840
Okay.

584
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,840
Wait.

585
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,680
I’m really letting you go.

586
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,800
Oh gosh,

587
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,680
That’s a lot of vegetables!

588
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,880
Bye bye.

589
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,880
Where's Tianhom?

590
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,360
Did she go shopping in town?

591
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,880
No.

592
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,520
I texted her by Line.

593
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,240
She said she's in the garden.

594
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,440
Feel free to come in.

595
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Really?

596
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
There she is!

597
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,640
There’s Tianhom!

598
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,280
Huh?

599
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,760
Why does she seem off?

600
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,400
Is she not feeling well?

601
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,600
I think we’d better go check on her quickly.

602
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,800
Tianhom!

603
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,080
What’s wrong, Thianhom?

604
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,040
Why are you crying, Thianhom?

605
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,720
It’s Peach…

606
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
What about Peach?

607
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,800
Did she cheat on you?

608
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,720
Tianhom, tell me.

609
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,400
I will handle it.

610
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,720
Just tell me.

611
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,080
Just tell me. Tianhom.

612
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,880
She cheated on you, didn’t she?

613
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,760
Tell me. I will handle it.

614
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,640
I’ll throw in some elbows,

615
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,520
knees.

616
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,960
Right hook, left hook, all of it!

617
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,240
Hey wait!.

618
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,120
It's me.

619
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,680
Oops!

620
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,160
I'm just sad, that’s all.

621
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,120
Why?

622
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,360
What?

623
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,760
Geez, you’ll message me on LINE later, okay?

624
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,000
Wait!

625
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,320
I’ll explain it to you myself.

626
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,800
It’s just that I’m sad because Peach went back to Bangkok.

627
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,480
I just miss her, that’s all.

628
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,360
Aww…Aww…

629
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,160
Deep breaths... Stay strong.

630
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,680
Aww…
