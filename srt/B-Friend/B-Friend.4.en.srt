1
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,400
Wait a sec.

2
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,040
How about we sit here and have a drink first, then head to the resort?

3
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,840
Come on,

4
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,960
Look! There’s a spot to sit right over there.

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,680
Alright.
Let’s go!

6
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,400
They don’t even have any desserts to sell.

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,880
Probably can’t sell anything.

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,080
Pathetic.

9
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,280
Can’t do the job but still wanna act like a boss.

10
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,040
Showing off just like her dad, no surprise there.

11
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,360
Yeah

12
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,000
If they had let us handle it from the start,

13
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,360
This wouldn’t even be a problem.

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,280
Right.

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,440
Acting all high and mighty.

16
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,200
Just wait, you’ll see.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,200
For posting times, just post three times a day.

18
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,640
In the morning: between 6:00 to 8:00 a.m.

19
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
At noon: between 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,680
In the evening: between 6:00 to 8:00 p.m.

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,680
Saturday and Sunday are rest days.

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,320
Customers can be on their phones anytime.

23
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,360
But the most important times are...

24
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,680
10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
It has to be useful.

26
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,240
Learn this so I can help Lalin.

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,440
Keep this in mind.

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,520
If we want our resort to look good,

29
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,880
we have to run it with warmth.

30
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,640
Because

31
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,280
we want everyone who stays here

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,720
to feel like they’re at home.

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,720
When they leave, what they should take with them is happiness.

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,680
The way we live happily at home

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,200
is the way we should treat our guests —

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
so they feel that same joy.

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,840
- Understand?
- I understand.

38
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,520
- Do you really understand?
- I really do.

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,200
No, you're just staring off into space. Look, Dad.

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,600
- I’m really listening!
- Yes,

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,760
And the trees need to be well taken care of too.

42
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,680
You have to fertilize them properly.

43
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,040
Do you understand?

44
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,840
But… how do we know what kind of fertilizer to use?

45
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,560
Well, we have to learn about it.

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,720
As we keep learning, I’ll teach you step by step.

47
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,520
We need to take care of the bridge too, make sure it’s strong.

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,640
If people walk back and forth on it, they could fall.

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,840
Do you understand?

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,480
Make sure no one falls off the bridge — unless it’s falling in love, it's okay!

51
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,720
Hey! He's still just kids!

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,800
And you too, Lin — don’t go “building bridges” for anyone just yet.

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,760
You need to choose these seats carefully, okay?

54
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,440
Dim, don’t go bringing anyone to sit here.

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,280
I saw it — not because I have four eyes, but because I’ve got security cameras.

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,520
So watch out.

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,880
Dad, I’ll help you keep an eye on him.

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,360
If Dim brings anyone here,

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,080
I’ll tell Dad.

60
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,720
And what about Lalin?

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,240
I’m watching the cameras for you too. Alright, let’s keep going.

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
You scared me — totally outsmarted your dad!

63
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,800
You were trying to prank me — but I knew it!

64
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,040
Caught you!

65
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,600
Anyway, it’s the same with these products.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,160
We have to make sure they’re good quality —

67
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,320
so our guests see the value in what we offer,

68
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,400
Got it?

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,720
Hello?
Hello, Lalin.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,080
Where are you, Dim?

71
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,600
I have no idea.

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,840
Have you seen Dad?

73
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,200
Can’t really see him… no clue what he’s doing.

74
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,480
Then where are you?

75
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,800
Right here!

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,400
Wow, Dad, you really played along.

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
This bag,

78
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,920
I actually designed it especially for you, Lalin.

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,040
Really?

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,760
Of course!

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,080
And we need to make sure it’s strong and durable, understand?

82
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,800
So that people who buy our products

83
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,720
won’t come back and complain.

84
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,720
It’s really pretty.

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,640
Yeah, rattan might look a little old-fashioned,

86
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,800
but it’s super durable.

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
Got it, Dad.

88
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,520
Bakery, we have to make them fresh every day, understand?

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,760
Oh, this is Kuea —

90
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,920
he’s our bakery master!

91
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,560
He’s especially good when the kitchen has a song.

92
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
Huh? What do you mean, Dad?

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,040
Get it? Croissant!

94
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,160
Dad...

95
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,560
Kuea is seriously talented.

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
Was that a joke? Not bad.

97
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,600
He’s top-notch. One hand makes pastries—

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,600
the other one wipes glasses.

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,160
Dad, I want to eat this one.

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,520
That one? You can eat it, sure — eat anything here.

101
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,280
But not today… if you eat one of these, we’ll lose all our profit!

102
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,240
Looks yummy, though. Let’s split it?

103
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,400
Yeah, we can share.

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,560
Bakery need to look good, you know why?

105
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
Because no matter what generation, people love taking photos.

106
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
So take good care of them — don’t let them go bad.

107
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,440
If they do, customers will complain about our shop.

108
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,840
Understand? We’ll suffer damage.

109
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,880
Yes, got it!

110
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
One piece for two. Share it.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,040
Fine… we’ll share.

112
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,960
Give you the bigger half, okay?

113
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,360
- Dad!
- Dad!

114
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,200
- Dad!
- Dad!

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,040
You should sit down.

116
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,880
Take a deep breath, okay?

117
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,920
Dad, please walk slowly.

118
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,200
Lean back a bit.

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,080
Take a deep breath.

120
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,880
Feeling any better now?

121
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,000
Thanks a lot, Kuea. If you need anything, just go on ahead.

122
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
How’s Dad doing?

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
Feeling a bit better now.

124
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,240
Why does Dad have to do everything by yourself?

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,480
We have staff, so why don’t we let them handle it?

126
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,240
They already have their own work to do.

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,720
Whatever we can help with, let’s just do it.

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,960
We have to show them that we love this place.

129
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,920
That way, they’ll love the resort just like we do.

130
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,000
But right now,

131
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,840
I think Dad needs to rest a bit.

132
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,200
If you don’t take care of yourself, everyone else will suffer too.

133
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Hmm, where did you get that stubbornness from?

134
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,000
From Mom.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,440
No, from Dad — he’s hardworking too.

136
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,840
Keep this in mind.

137
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,040
Everything in the resort,

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,000
whether it’s the plants and flowers,

139
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
or the people,

140
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,840
if we give our best,

141
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,200
they’ll be willing to stay with us.

142
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,960
Got it, Dad.

143
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,080
I love this place so much.

144
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,120
I built it because

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,040
I want it to be our future,

146
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,480
and a legacy for both of you.

147
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,000
No matter what happens,

148
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,800
Dim and Lin,

149
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,280
You two have to take care of it together.

150
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,720
You got it, Dad. Don’t worry.

151
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,200
I’ll take care of it with all I’ve got.

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
Me too.

153
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,520
Good, good. You’ve got to help her.

154
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,120
Yes, help me — no running around, okay?

155
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,080
A bit clingy.

156
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,280
Let me hug.

157
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,880
You really never let her win, do you?

158
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,400
Take a nice shot, Dim. I’m gonna post it on social media.

159
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,120
Got it.

160
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,160
Okay, that’s enough. Send it to me.

161
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
I’ll post it and help Dad with the marketing.

162
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,520
Sent!

163
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,760
Wow,

164
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
My kids working so hard,

165
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
I might not need to hire any staff!

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Stop everything you're doing—

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
and come enjoy something delicious made by Dad!

168
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,400
Yes.

169
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,480
Coming!

170
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,280
Did you wash your hands?

171
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,280
You were just outside, touching all sorts of stuff.

172
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,640
But I’m hungry! I’ve been working hard all day.

173
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,520
Can’t I just eat now?

174
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,640
Nope!

175
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,880
Alright, alright—no need to argue, my dear kids.

176
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,840
Delicious food doesn’t wait!

177
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,200
You’ve gotta eat it while it’s still hot!

178
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,160
So sit properly—Dad’s gonna feed you.

179
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
This is really yummy!

180
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,440
Smells so buttery!

181
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,960
What you just ate, by the way, is called salt bread.

182
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,240
It originally came from Austria—

183
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,920
also known as Salzstangerl.

184
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Later on, it became popular in Japan.

185
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,960
Wait, are we here to taste or take a history class, Dad?

186
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,920
Hey now, when you’re eating something this good,

187
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
you gotta know where it came from, Dim!

188
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,440
But it’s really delicious, Dad.

189
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,640
The buttery smell is amazing.

190
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,760
Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

191
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,440
And that little salty kick from the butter and salt,

192
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,880
From the outside, it just looks like a regular bread roll…

193
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,680
But once you bite into it, it’s so good.

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,280
If you have some free time, can you teach me how to make it, Dad?

195
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,080
Of course,

196
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,680
I made every part of this by myself.

197
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,480
It’s not something just anyone can make taste this good!

198
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,920
But if you really like it, I’ll feed you another bite!

199
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,680
Yes, please!

200
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,760
You raise your kids like this? No wonder they’ll end up helpless.

201
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,440
They’re grown, and you’re still feeding them?

202
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,720
You’ve come by so many times.

203
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,000
Can’t you just talk nicely for once?

204
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,240
Just one more thing,

205
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,000
Taking care of kids...

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,880
I don’t need parenting advice from anyone.

207
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,280
Now I’m the nosy one?

208
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,440
I don’t know.

209
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,960
Just saying.

210
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,360
Anyway, I’m here for my monthly income.

211
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,160
What monthly income.

212
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,880
The family business.

213
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,440
You make money—share it.

214
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,440
Lalin, Dim, go inside.

215
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,840
Actually, they’re all grown up now.

216
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,400
They should be able to understand things.

217
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,080
No need for them to go anywhere.

218
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,080
I don’t want my kids to lose their peace of mind

219
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,960
by having to listen to all the negativity from just one adult.

220
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,280
Alright, alright,

221
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,640
You don’t have to say anything.

222
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,200
Just give me the money.

223
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,040
I’ll be out of here quick.

224
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,520
I don’t want to stay here any longer.

225
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,720
When we inherited from Dad,

226
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,520
He already gave everything to you.

227
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,600
So what else are you asking for?

228
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,040
But you still got more than the others,

229
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,920
So you have to share with me.

230
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,040
I think I’ve said this many times.

231
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,600
When I got the inheritance from Dad,

232
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,080
I only received some land.

233
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,840
He gave you the land and the money.

234
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,720
So who really got more in the end?

235
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,200
This resort?

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
I built it myself.

237
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,000
Why should I share it?

238
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,280
Saying that,

239
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,920
I hope it fails.

240
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,840
Cheaters in the family never prosper.

241
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,640
I hope this resort goes bankrupt!

242
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,480
I’ve never cheated anyone.

243
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,160
Not even the slightest bit.

244
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,520
Remember that.

245
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,800
I’m watching.

246
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,120
Whether it's today or any other day,

247
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,360
There's just no way.

248
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,920
If it’s just this,

249
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,000
call next time. Don’t waste time.

250
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,520
I got accepted!

251
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,680
Congratulations, Lalin!

252
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,160
Can we see the results too?

253
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,240
We want to know if we got in or not.

254
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,080
Sure!

255
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,720
Jin, come here, come on!

256
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,480
Wait a sec,

257
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,920
I can't see it.

258
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,400
Hey, Jin’s name!

259
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,120
Jin got in!

260
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,280
Wow, Som’s name! Som got in too!

261
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,080
Keep it up!

262
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,160
Scroll down more.

263
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,720
Hey, what’s wrong?

264
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
Don't worry.

265
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,320
Last one.

266
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,480
Hey, got accepted!

267
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
We’ll be studying together now.

268
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,200
Yay, everyone got in!

269
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
Great job!

270
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
No worries,

271
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,280
Everyone got accepted!

272
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,520
But...

273
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,720
Even if we get accepted, is that all there is?

274
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,560
Our parents probably won’t send us off to Bangkok to study.

275
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,240
I got so excited, I didn’t even think about that part.

276
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,360
Looks like we can only dream for now.

277
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,840
Smart enough, but no money.

278
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
I was so freaking happy for nothing.

279
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,320
You're really smart, huh?

280
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,800
If you’re that smart,

281
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,680
I’ve actually got a scholarship for you.

282
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,840
Huh?

283
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,200
Wait,

284
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,360
Did I hear that right, Uncle?

285
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,120
Let’s see, let’s see.

286
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,520
Well… looks normal

287
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,120
Huh?

288
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,640
A scholarship, Uncle?

289
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,440
We're gonna study!

290
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,840
We're gonna study!

291
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
We're really gonna study!

292
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,040
Jin, you get to go to University!

293
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,920
Jin,

294
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,880
What’s wrong?

295
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,200
Aren’t you happy?

296
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,080
I am!

297
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,800
But...

298
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,240
I just... don’t wanna trouble you, Uncle.

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,720
Just promise me you’ll study hard. No skipping class,

300
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,680
Don’t let me down.

301
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,720
Thank you so much, Uncle.

302
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,840
If it’s okay,

303
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,800
I’d like to head home and tell my family right away.

304
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
Wait,

305
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Don’t you wanna stay and celebrate a bit?

306
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,720
We got accepted!

307
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,360
Can we do that another day?

308
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,000
I really wanna share the good news first.

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,280
Please, Lalin?

310
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,120
Alright, go ahead.

311
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,600
Thanks again, Uncle!

312
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,360
Let’s see…

313
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,160
that’s my name right there!

314
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,840
So proud of you.

315
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,280
Your mom would’ve been proud too.

316
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,960
If she were here, she’d be so happy.

317
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,480
I guess once you graduate,

318
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,240
I can finally let go, huh?

319
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,080
Dad!

320
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,440
I just got accepted, I haven’t even started yet.

321
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
Are you already trying to put me to work?

322
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,800
I’m just planning my retirement.

323
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
You’ve still got a lot to learn.

324
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,880
Got it!

325
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,640
I’ll study hard and help you run this place with everything I’ve got.

326
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,000
Good. And remember, never give up.

327
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,240
Now let’s see your friends’ names…

328
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
This one, right here.

329
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,080
The five of us just graduated today,

330
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,160
and we came back to surprise Dad.

331
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,640
From now on, we’ll take care of everything for you, Dad.

332
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

333
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,920
Where's Dad?

334
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,400
Inside, checking the work.

335
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,480
Dad.

336
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,760
Dad!

337
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,200
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

338
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,320
Dad!

339
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,000
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

340
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,840
Dad woke up and talked to me first.

341
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,400
Dad!

342
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

343
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,720
Dad, don’t mess around like that.

344
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,600
Dad!

345
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,600
Dad!

346
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,720
Dad!

347
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,800
Uncle, what’s wrong?

348
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,040
Take him to the hospital, please.

349
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Uncle.

350
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,880
Hello?

351
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,640
Someone fainted at Baannokkokna Resort.

352
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,440
Yes, thank you.

353
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,920
Who would have thought that this visit to Dad.

354
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,080
Would be the last time we'd see each other?

355
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,400
I never even got the chance to say goodbye.

356
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,680
I love you so much, Dad.

357
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,240
Dad!

358
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
Thank you so much, Uncle,

359
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,360
for giving me the chance to study at a good university with these friends.

360
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,160
I haven’t been able to repay you yet.

361
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,240
Why does it have to be like this?

362
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,240
I promise I’ll take care of the café you love.

363
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,720
Why do Mom and Dad have so little time for me and Dim?

364
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,120
I want to make you proud of me,

365
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,840
But now it feels like I won’t get that chance anymore.

366
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,840
All of this junk?Toss it out, everything.

367
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,640
This is destroying the energy of the place.

368
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,280
Hey!

369
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,320
I said get it out of here!

370
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,680
What, are you deaf? I said clear it out!

371
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,720
Letting a bunch of kids run a business.

372
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,080
No wonder it’s falling apart.

373
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Open the drawer.

374
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,520
I said open it!

375
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,000
Give me all the money inside.

376
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,000
Now.

377
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
And bring me a cup of tea.

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If it’s like this.

379
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,960
We’ll have to start over with a new system.

380
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Maybe start by tearing down your own twisted thinking

381
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,760
before you come barging in, acting like this place is yours.

382
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,800
Excuse me?

383
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
I’m your uncle.

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
Watch your tone.

385
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,560
Your father's gone now.

386
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,160
Is this what he left behind?

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,560
That mouth of yours, just like his.

388
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,560
Then maybe we should be kind to people who treat us with kindness. Don’t you think?

389
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,360
And what exactly did I do wrong?

390
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,160
Everything.

391
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,840
What kind of family walks in and demands what was never theirs to begin with?

392
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,200
Back when your father was alive, I never got a thing.

393
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,080
So now? I’m taking what’s mine, from your generation.

394
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,920
Lalin.

395
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,960
You really think you’re the only one with power here?

396
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,320
And if anyone dares to let this man pull something like this here again,

397
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,520
I swear, I’ll fire every last one of you!

398
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,360
I’m so full.

399
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,720
Was it good?

400
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,840
Yeah, it was delicious.

401
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,760
I’ll ask Mom to make it again next time.

402
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Why are you eating so late today?

403
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
Som's mother brought food for everyone.

404
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,400
There’s even a dish for Manager Kanit too.

405
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,640
Kanit, wanna eat first?

406
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,080
We can watch things here.

407
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,840
It’s okay, I’m not hungry yet.

408
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,800
Earlier, Lalin’s relatives came, and she got really mad.

409
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,120
She said if anyone lets them in again, she’ll fire all of us.

410
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,240
Wait—seriously? Fire us?

411
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,840
So what if they just walk in on their own?

412
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,600
Wouldn’t all four of us get fired anyway?

413
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
No idea…

414
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,760
I’ve never seen Lalin this angry before.

415
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,960
Whoa, that bad? Got a picture of them or anything?

416
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,520
Maybe we can help keep an eye out.

417
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,880
Nope, but if I spot them, I’ll let you all know right away.

418
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,240
Alright, let’s get back to work.

419
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,760
Okay

420
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
Kanit, are you okay?

421
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,160
You’re not too shaken, right?

422
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,960
I’m fine.

423
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Wanna eat first? I’ll handle things here.

424
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,320
No, really, I’m not hungry.

425
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,760
Just now, uncle Lalin came in and moved everything around.

426
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,680
Even messed with the money. Now I’ve got to go check the cash, too.

427
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Dad.

428
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,160
Mom.

429
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,480
I’ve been taking good care of the resort you both built.

430
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,760
Looking after my siblings and our staff like family.

431
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,120
Just like you always taught me.

432
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,600
Lalin, who are you talking to?

433
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,240
Talking to the guardian spirit.

434
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,400
Guardian spirit?

435
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,560
Just kidding.

436
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,760
I was...

437
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,600
just looking around the resort, getting lost in my thoughts.

438
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,680
It’s been a while,

439
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,040
Hasn’t it...

440
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Since Dad and Mom left us.

441
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,880
We’ve been doing everything they told us to.

442
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,080
Yeah…

443
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,640
It took a lot to take the resort and the café back.

444
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,360
It was tough… but hey,

445
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,760
let’s hope we never have to go through something like that again.

446
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,600
Exactly, said they’d take care of things, but they didn’t.

447
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,720
We nearly didn’t make it through all that.

448
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,880
But thanks to you, Dim, we pulled through.

449
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,080
It’s because of you, really.

450
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,720
I just followed your lead.

451
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,120
Then let’s say it’s because of both of us,

452
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,680
Deal?

453
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,200
Deal.

454
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,320
So, anything you need me to do today?

455
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,080
Nope.

456
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,320
Nope.

457
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,520
What do you want to eat? Hurry up and order quickly.

458
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,440
Or do you guys want delivery?

459
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,080
Just started, like, a minute ago.

460
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,600
Can called to order, I’ll deliver it myself so it doesn’t get hot.

461
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,120
Sound good.

462
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,480
Yes.

463
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,760
You can just go back to your room first, then call me anytime.

464
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,240
If you want anything, I’ll bring it right to your door.

465
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,800
You okay? Acting kinda weird today.

466
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,440
Nah, I’m fine.

467
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,960
Kanit,

468
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,920
Your staff’s acting strange, huh?

469
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,600
It’s normal.

470
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,000
Maybe cafe is too quiet, so everyone’s losing it a bit.

471
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,840
Lalin, I think we should back and watch the series in the room.

472
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,280
We can just call to order later.

473
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,280
Okay.

474
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,160
The staff here seem kind of crazy.

475
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,200
How did they even hire someone like this?

476
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,240
Oh my god!

477
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,760
Knew it!

478
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,360
What are you doing here?

479
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,000
I’ll tell you later.

480
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,840
I was...

481
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,280
just in the area,

482
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,000
thought I’d check on my brother’s business.

483
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,240
Can't I?

484
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,160
Sorry,

485
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,760
But my dad passed away long ago.

486
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,560
Looking for your brother, younger brother, or any other relatives?

487
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
No one considers you family anymore.

488
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,120
Watch your tone.

489
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,480
I’m still your uncle.

490
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,840
An uncle who shamelessly steals his own nephew’s money right into his own pocket?

491
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,000
Stole his niece’s business.

492
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,240
Better not have one at all.

493
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,200
We came here in peace today.

494
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,160
So why speak to your elders like that?

495
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,800
Where’s the respect?

496
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,640
Acting like someone with no manners at all.

497
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,560
I’m sorry,

498
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,440
But my parents pass away.

499
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,640
Experience has taught me to be kind only to those who are kind to me,

500
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,960
Not to those who would even dare to cheat their own niece.

501
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,720
Those who hurt his own brother,

502
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,960
Those who were good and kind to you all,

503
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,440
Always generous,

504
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,280
never refusing anyone’s request.

505
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,600
Why bring all that up again?

506
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,600
It’s been ages,

507
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,520
And you already got everything back, didn’t you?

508
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,800
So what’s the point of saying all this now?

509
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,920
To make you realize,

510
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Shouldn’t do something that awful to anyone ever again.

511
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,160
Lalin, you’re crossing the line now!

512
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,280
You think you’re all that now?

513
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,800
Talking back at us like a big shot.

514
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,360
And just look at you.

515
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,280
You don’t even look like someone who runs a resort.

516
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,480
Let me tell you something,

517
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,920
the only reason this place is still standing

518
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,360
is because your father built a solid foundation.

519
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,480
Without him?

520
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
I don’t even want to imagine.

521
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,560
Just wait and see,

522
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,360
It’s gonna fail.

523
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,440
Who really tanked this place?

524
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,160
Think hard.

525
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,120
Or is Alzheimer’s kicking in?

526
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,560
Need help? I can remind everyone here.

527
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,640
Who do you think you’re talking to, Dim?

528
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,160
You two.

529
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,600
You’re already going gray,

530
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,320
But still haven’t learned any humility.

531
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
Maybe it’s time to start going to the temple.

532
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,000
Dim, watch your mouth, you little punk!

533
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,520
Why?

534
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,960
Little punk, Why?

535
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,040
You wrecked this place. Not us.

536
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,760
Now, you can walk out,

537
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,840
Or I’ll call security. Your choice.

538
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,360
You’ll regret this.

539
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,440
This isn’t over.

540
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,600
Watch your back.

541
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,960
You okay, Lalin?

542
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,960
If I told you yes, that would be a lie.

543
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,720
I understand how you feel…

544
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,880
But don’t let what they said weigh on you. They’re not worth it.

545
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,440
Tell me honestly,

546
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,600
Dim…

547
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,960
Will the resort really survive? The way Mom and Dad hoped it would?

548
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,000
Hello, is this the bank?

549
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,480
I’m calling to ask if I could postpone this month’s payment…

550
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,920
I really need the money to renovate the resort.

551
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,920
It’s urgent. Honestly,

552
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,600
I don’t have enough to pay the bank right now.

553
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,520
But if things pick up, I promise I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.

554
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,520
You can check my record,

555
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,280
I’ve always paid on time. I’m a good borrower.

556
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,120
And it’s just two months left.

557
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,240
I’m only asking for this one installment. Please…

558
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,360
I hope you’ll consider it.

559
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,360
Here’s your water, Dad.

560
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,000
Thanks so much, sweetie.

561
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,760
You look a little stressed… Is something bothering you?

562
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,640
Oh, just work stuff. Nothing serious.

563
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,400
By the way, were things really that intense out there?

564
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,360
A little, yeah.

565
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,960
I overheard,

566
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,640
Dad...

567
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,880
talking on the phone.

568
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,160
You heard me talking on the phone?

569
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,200
Yes.

570
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,800
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to lie to you.

571
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,480
But sometimes,

572
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,040
Telling a small lie to keep someone from worrying...

573
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,560
I think it’s the right thing to do.

574
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,080
And besides, if I told you all my worries,

575
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,080
you’d just end up stressed too,

576
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,960
right?

577
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,000
I know,

578
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,320
but I just worry about you.

579
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,280
It’ll pass.

580
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,680
When you’re someone who fights through problems,

581
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,240
there’s nothing to be afraid of.

582
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,120
Just remember never give up. Ever.

583
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,800
Anyway, I invited Jin, Touk, and Som for dinner.

584
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,000
Let’s go cook something together.

585
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,320
Great!

586
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,240
Let me help you.

587
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,760
Food’s ready, drinks are ready...

588
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,880
Are we ready?

589
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,960
Ready!

590
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,760
Then let’s eat it!

591
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,680
Yayyy!

592
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,000
Jin,

593
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,280
Why aren’t you eating with us?

594
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,600
I…

595
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,640
You always feel like you're troubling me... you say this every time.

596
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,880
You’re never a bother, Jin. Eat up!

597
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,640
Once it's gone, I’m not making more.

598
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,800
Can I ask you something?

599
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,560
Why are you so kind to us?

600
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,280
We’re not your real kids...

601
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,640
not even your relatives.

602
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,440
Just eat. Don’t overthink it.

603
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,080
I do this because it makes me happy, and it doesn’t hurt anyone.

604
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,160
I live and work here.

605
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,720
I’ve seen you, Touk, and Som playing with Lin since you were little.

606
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,440
Even before this place was built.

607
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,720
Of course I love you like you’re my own.

608
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,480
Are you really happy?

609
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,920
Of course I am. Seeing you all get into university?

610
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,040
That’s all I ever wanted for you to have a bright future.

611
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,520
I just want to give you that chance.

612
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,120
Okay.

613
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,680
Eat as much as you want, alright? Dad made all this himself.

614
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,960
And if you’re still hungry, there’s plenty more in the fridge.

615
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,040
Wow, Who would’ve thought, huh?

616
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,480
That you’d all get accepted into university together.

617
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,920
Just kidding!

618
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,720
Eat up, don’t hold back.

619
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,040
No need to worry about getting chubby like the little piggies, haha.

620
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,440
It would’ve been nice if Mom could be here with us.

621
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,760
Then she’d see what Dad has done for all of us.

622
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,720
Yeah…

623
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,440
She’d see how well Dad has raised us.

624
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,480
He’s done everything for everyone for us,

625
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,520
for the staff, and for the kids around the resort.

626
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,240
You need to take better care of yourself, Dad.

627
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,920
Understood, Miss Lalin.

628
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,480
“Understood” isn’t enough.

629
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,800
You have to promise. And mean it.

630
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,720
Dim…

631
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,240
Just now, you were asking about Mom, weren’t you?

632
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,960
Yes.

633
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,320
You know…

634
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,720
It felt like there was this energy something that reminded me so much of her.

635
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,840
Don’t you think so, son?

636
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,840
I do.

637
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,000
Her words… the way she spoke… it was just like Mom.

638
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Don’t change the subject, Dad.

639
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,800
Promise me right here, right now.

640
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,120
I promise, Lalin

641
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,520
My daughter.

642
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,840
If you promise, then you have to keep it, okay?

643
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,640
I promise.

644
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,360
What are you doing sitting here?

645
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,480
Why aren’t you in bed?

646
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,960
Well, someone just made me promise I’d take it easy…

647
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,560
You will rest.

648
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Not stay up late working.

649
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,920
It’s the same old stuff, sweetie. Just a little more to finish.

650
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,720
Go on head to bed.

651
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,440
Dad, you have health issues.

652
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,320
And you keep pushing yourself like this...

653
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,720
I’m really worried about you.

654
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,440
Someday, you’ll understand.

655
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,840
I’ve spent my life building this place…

656
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,880
for the people I love.

657
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,120
This responsibility, this business, it’s not just work.

658
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,760
I’ve poured my heart into it,

659
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,440
to make it the best I can.

660
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,280
We’re responsible for so many lives here.

661
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,000
Our staff,

662
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,440
they take care of their families because of what we do.

663
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,320
If we do well,

664
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,520
they do well too.

665
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,440
But what about you?

666
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,320
Don’t you care about your well-being?

667
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Go to bed, honey. It’s late.

668
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
I’ll wrap up soon,

669
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,720
I promise.

670
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,880
Just a little more.

671
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,200
Okay… but don’t stay up too late, okay?

672
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,840
I’ll wrap up soon.

673
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,720
I promise.

674
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,000
Good night, Dad.

675
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,520
Sweet dreams.

676
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,840
Good night, Dad.

677
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,560
Dim… do you think I’m really cut out to run this resort?

678
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,880
Lalin...

679
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,840
Other than Dad, you’re the one who loves and understands this place the most.

680
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,200
Don’t forget you’re the one who stayed up countless nights.

681
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,040
The one who gave up your personal happiness.

682
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,880
The one who let go of your entire youth for this.

683
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,640
If it’s not you… then who else could it be?

684
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,240
But sometimes... it really does feel like it’s too much.

685
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,760
If there ever comes a day when it’s too heavy for you…

686
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,600
I’ll be right behind you.

687
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,600
You don’t have to carry it all alone.

688
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,120
That’s just cruel.

689
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,200
It really is.

690
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,880
How could they do that to their own niece?

691
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,760
No conscience at all,

692
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,520
Not even the decency of an aunt or uncle.

693
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,600
Right?

694
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,080
And do you know how hard it was for Lalin to get the resort back?

695
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,040
It was so bad she had to see a psychiatrist.

696
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,160
Seriously?

697
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,000
Poor Lalin...

698
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,080
I honestly don’t know…If I had to go through what Lalin did,

699
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,320
I don’t think I’d be as strong as her.

700
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,480
But just thinking about it makes me angry for her.

701
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,720
What was the point of even showing up?

702
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,040
And did you see her face when she spoke?

703
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,440
Not even a hint of guilt.

704
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,640
I don’t think she regrets anything.

705
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,400
But she hasn’t been around here in forever.

706
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,040
I don’t think this was just some random visit.

707
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I think she has a plan?

708
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,520
What's plan?

709
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,000
I don’t know… but it can’t be good.

710
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,640
Then let’s focus on fixing the situation ourselves.

711
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,560
How?

712
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,520
Moo-ka-ta.

713
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,800
Moo-ka-ta?

714
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,920
Moo-ka-ta will heal everything.

715
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,840
Go Go.

716
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,640
I have to herd the chickens into the coop for Mom.

717
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,680
Me too. Gotta help Som.

718
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,280
What a pity. No Moo-ka-ta for us… sad!

719
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,760
Let’s stay and eat Moo-ka-ta together.

720
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,480
Is that okay?

721
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,720
Sure.

722
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,200
Fresh vegetables are here, everyone!

723
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,320
Wow!

724
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,200
that’s a huge tray!

725
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,000
Here, put them down!

726
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,280
Oh my god!

727
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,400
So delicious-looking, absolutely amazing!

728
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,760
Is everyone ready?

729
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,080
And

730
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,960
Let’s go!

731
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,160
Yay yay!

732
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,040
Smells so good!

733
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,160
What about Peach, Tian Hom?”

734
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,120
Oh, Peach went back this morning.

735
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,560
She probably won’t be back here for another two days.

736
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,760
That’s sad.

737
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,800
Come here, I’ll feed you some crispy bacon to heal you.

738
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,440
Careful, it’s hot.

739
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,960
Is it tasty?

740
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,960
Delicious! Can I have more?

741
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,120
Sure! About grill the pork, I’m the best at it!

742
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,920
Hey, what about me?

743
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,200
I’m sad too, you know! I didn’t get any pork from you at all.

744
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,280
Here you go, this one’s crispy too.

745
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,800
I’ll feed you all night, Lalin.

746
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,440
Eat a lot, okay?

747
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,800
Thank you!

748
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,520
Hey,

749
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,560
why are you only eating veggies?

750
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,560
You're just gonna eat vegetables all night? Come on, try something else too!

751
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,640
Veggies are tasty! And the ones here are super good.

752
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,400
I really like them, you know?

753
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,480
Yeah, but we’re here for Moo-ka-ta not veggie.

754
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,200
Fine.

755
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,320
If you wanna eat veggies that bad, go pick some from the garden.

756
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,680
Take as much as you want, there's a ton out there.

757
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
Here, eat this some pork.

758
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,520
Wanna try some liver?

759
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,680
Sure.

760
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,360
Oh! Mr. Tan, Mr.Ashi.

761
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,720
Hello!

762
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,800
That’s enough, Achi.

763
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,160
Look, don’t drink anymore.

764
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,880
Everyone, if you don’t mind, we’ll excuse ourselves now.

765
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,240
Achi can't take it anymore.

766
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,240
Get back safe.

767
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,760
Bye-bye, everyone.

768
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,040
Good luck, everyone.

769
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,040
Sweet dreams.

770
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,480
Your room,

771
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
So cute.
