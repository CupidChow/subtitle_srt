1
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,000
Help! Help! Ms. Da Wan had fallen into the water.

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,920
Dawan

3
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,400
Dawan

4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
Dawan

5
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,640
Dawan, do you remember what happened?

6
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,720
No one can remember everything in this world.

7
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,840
It changes over time.

8
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,320
Everything must change.

9
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,480
But if you want to remember that,

10
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,120
What did you do today? Where did you go?

11
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Why don't you try saving it on your phone?

12
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Or

13
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,800
Maybe try writing it on a Post-it note.

14
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,000
Good point!

15
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,560
Okay, Mom.

16
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,120
Don’t worry.

17
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
I’ll look after her.

18
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,360
Hello.

19
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Yes,

20
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,640
I’ll be fine. I’ll take care of myself.

21
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,040
Not be a burden to Lan.

22
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,840
Make sure you take care of yourself too, Mom.

23
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,840
I’ll be back in just a few days.

24
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,560
It feels great to be out of the city and in Khao Yai. The weather’s awesome!

25
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,000
And it's just a short trip, not far at all.

26
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,480
How about we come to Khao Yai more often?

27
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,160
No…

28
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
We should just move here.

29
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,200
I’m just going to get a coffee. Want to come along?

30
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,680
I’d rather not.

31
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
I’ll just go to the restroom.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,200
Should I take you there?

33
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,880
It's okay. I'll just look at the sign and go by myself.

34
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,280
I’m going now.

35
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
Please wait a moment, I’ll call you in a minute.

36
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,480
It’s probably been about ten years.

37
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,800
Since Dawan lost her father.

38
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,480
Dawan also has symptoms of memory loss.

39
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,760
It makes me really worried about her a lot.

40
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,920
From then to now.

41
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,680
My concern.

42
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,440
Has turned into the love that I give.

43
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,840
I’ve never regretted taking care of her.

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,120
And I promised Dawan's father that I would stay by her side.

45
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,600
Until she recovers from...

46
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,080
Amnesia.

47
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,920
Here’s a sweet iced cocoa for you.

48
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,360
Thank you.

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,800
Ah, it’s served. You can drink it now.

50
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
Delicious.

51
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,160
Thank you.

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,200
My baby is the cutest.

53
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,240
All at once?

54
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
Hmm, wait until we get to Khao Yai.

55
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,320
I'll prepare a special set for you.

56
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,960
We've arrived.

57
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,560
Lan, I forgot to bring my medicines. What should I do?

58
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
Read it to me.

59
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,040
All of Dawan's medicines are in the shoulder bag.

60
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
Have I taken my medicines yet?

61
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,840
I don't want it anymore.

62
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,320
Read it out loud to me.

63
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,760
I already took my post-breakfast medicines at six o'clock.

64
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,520
So cute, How could I not love you?

65
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,120
Give me a little kiss?

66
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
Dr.Lan

67
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
Hello Dr.Lan.

68
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,960
Hello.

69
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,080
Oh, why are you here? Didn't you go to school?

70
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,920
I’m on school break, so I came to help out at the resort.

71
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
Good boy.

72
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,480
How many days did you book for this stay?

73
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,160
Are you staying until my school starts?

74
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,640
It's been that long.

75
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,920
Hey bro, I'll give you a special discount on the price.

76
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,560
Oh, hello Dawan.

77
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,960
Only Dawan will be staying long time.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I’ll be going back and forth because I still have to follow up with my patients.

79
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,800
Where is your girlfriend? Have you broken up?

80
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
No No

81
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,840
You guys haven't broken up yet.

82
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,360
Not yet!

83
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,840
You still love each other.

84
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
Please, let me finish talking first.

85
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,640
Arm is my friend.

86
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,200
We’ve known each other since we were kids.

87
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,920
If we were really in love.

88
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,200
Lightning would probably strike.

89
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,920
Arm looks so manly.

90
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,280
Let's not talk about this anymore.

91
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,720
By the way, are you staying at your old room, right?

92
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,680
I've already made a booking. I just booked through the website.

93
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,960
You can head to the room. The maid probably cleaned.

94
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,040
And left the keys for you.

95
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,920
Do you have anything, I can help take to your room?

96
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
Never mind.

97
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,240
Let me help you. I'm right here.

98
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Never mind.

99
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,920
Never mind.

100
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,440
It's okay, I'll help.

101
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,960
Never mind.

102
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,480
-Dim Dim
-It's okay.

103
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Never mind.

104
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,760
Let me help you.

105
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,840
Never mind.

106
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,600
Wow... Your room is so cute.

107
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
It's not like my room.

108
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,560
Take a picture for me. Take it there first.

109
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,880
OK 1..2..3..

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,240
Tilt a little, move a little.

111
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
1..2..3..

112
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,720
Is your double chin coming out?

113
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,840
Let me see.

114
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't see any double chin.

115
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,960
Kuea please.

116
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,840
Could you please check here to see if it's safe.

117
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,240
If it's safe when customers use it.

118
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,880
Please check it a little more often.

119
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,040
Keep an eye on it. Thank you.

120
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,000
Sure, Ms. Lalin. I'll take care of it for you.

121
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
Lan

122
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,160
It's been a long time since we've seen each other.

123
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,960
Yes

124
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
Long time no see.

125
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,760
Since I was a student, I think.

126
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,560
Uhm…

127
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,920
Thank you

128
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Thank you for always encouraging me.

129
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,680
Thank you for listening.

130
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,520
Thank you for always being there for me.

131
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,440
It's okay, I'm happy to do it.

132
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,480
Because, I'm...

133
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,680
That's what I thank you for.

134
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Uh.

135
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,440
Behind the university.

136
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,400
There's a new restaurant that's really delicious.

137
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,640
Really? Have you eaten yet?

138
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,720
Ever.

139
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
Never.

140
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,760
My friend from university told me it was really delicious.

141
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,720
Hey, I want to try it. Let's go eat.

142
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,680
OK.

143
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,120
Er...but next time.

144
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,920
Today I have an appointment with my family.

145
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,760
Lan, I have something to tell you.

146
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,840
It is....I

147
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,880
Hey....I have to hurry.

148
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,280
I’m going to be late.

149
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,680
I have to go now.

150
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,640
Sorry, I forgot my phone.

151
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,840
Lan, are you alright?

152
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm fine.

153
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,320
And you?

154
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,800
Are you alright?

155
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,440
I guess I should call you Dr. Lan.

156
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,320
I want to ask you, what are you doing here?

157
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,480
That is...

158
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,040
I came to travel and relax.

159
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,000
And what about Lalin? What are you doing here?

160
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,720
Well.

161
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,920
This resort is mine.

162
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,560
I’m here to look after the resort after my parents.

163
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, I just found out.

164
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,040
I've been here many times and I've never seen you.

165
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,560
I'm not usually here.

166
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,440
Hang on, I need to pick up the phone.

167
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,280
Yes, you will come to look here today, right?

168
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,160
Yes.

169
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,920
Confirm.

170
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,200
This is the first time we’ve met.

171
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,920
My heart, which had been still with love.

172
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,600
Is slowly starting to beat faster again.

173
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,320
Excuse me.

174
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,160
Excuse me.

175
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,320
Wait a minute.

176
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
A moment ago.

177
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm really sorry for being rude.

178
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,240
It's really fine.

179
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,680
I’m sorry again, I didn’t mean to peeking at you.

180
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,920
It's really fine.

181
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,640
What your name?

182
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,080
My name's Dawan.

183
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
You don't have to call Miss. You can just call me Dawan.

184
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
Okay, Ms. Dawan.

185
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,760
Just Dawan.

186
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,000
Sorry, you just said that you don't need to have "Ms" in front.

187
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,320
So just call Dawan.

188
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,600
Dawan.

189
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,320
And you, what your name?

190
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
Just Lalin too.

191
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,120
Lalin.

192
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,360
I'm looking for a way to get to the cafe.

193
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,760
Umm....this is my first time here.

194
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,200
Or I've been here many times.

195
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,120
Never mind.

196
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,040
Could you take me to a cafe?

197
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,120
I'm not sure where it is.

198
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,600
Sure.

199
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,640
I’ll take you there myself.

200
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,040
Really?

201
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,200
Thank you very much.

202
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,920
Ok, go that way.

203
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,520
Whoa!

204
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,960
Your mom is calling you many times. Is your phone going to break?

205
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,720
Jin, please pick up your phone.

206
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,280
It's okay, Kanit. You can leave my phone over there.

207
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,720
I'll call my mom back after I get off work.

208
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
It's okay. You go pick up the phone.

209
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,480
Your mother might have called because she had something important to do.

210
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,720
Otherwise she wouldn't have called so many times.

211
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,320
My mom always calls this much. It’s normal for her.

212
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,160
Fifty missed calls is still too little.

213
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,960
Also, my work isn't finished yet.

214
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,880
Let me finish my work first.

215
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,720
It's okay.

216
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,480
There are few customers today. I'll continue working for you.

217
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,640
Is it good?

218
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,040
That's good. Then you can sit and rest.

219
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,760
but...

220
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,240
No, hurry up.

221
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,040
I might change my mind.

222
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,720
Okay, thank you.

223
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,280
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

224
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,280
Hello, Mr. Than, Mr. Achi.

225
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,120
Please sit over there. Please wait a moment.

226
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,520
Is something wrong?

227
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,320
My Idol.

228
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,880
Oh, Mr. Than and Mr. Achi.

229
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,600
I really admire them.

230
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,200
I never thought I would meet them here. I am so lucky.

231
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,040
Umm, my staff at the resort seem unusually diligent these days.

232
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,640
No days off, no leave, no lateness at all.

233
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,760
Yes.

234
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,400
How can we not like them?

235
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,800
They are both cute.

236
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,880
And handsome.

237
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,520
They are the cutest couple in society.

238
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,920
If you like them that much, then why don't we go and meet them now?

239
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,280
No.

240
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,680
They traveled such a long way.

241
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,080
I think they just wants to be alone together.

242
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,760
Let's go.

243
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,080
Uhm…

244
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,560
What?

245
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,480
Your boss here!

246
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,960
Where did Jin go?

247
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
She just went to the restroom.

248
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
What would you like to drink?

249
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,360
uhm…

250
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,760
I'd want an iced-cocoa please.

251
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,000
Very sweet.

252
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes, Sir. An iced-cocoa very sweet one.

253
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,880
Yes, Sir.

254
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,320
What would you like to drink, Lalin?

255
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,080
No worries, feel free.

256
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,920
Order whatever you’d like. It’s on me.

257
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Consider it a reward for bringing me to the cafe.

258
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,840
It's really okay. You can got it.

259
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,440
Please order it. Please.

260
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,720
Then, would you like to order one sweet iced-cocoa.

261
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,160
And one matcha honey lemon to take away?

262
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,560
How do you know she'll order honey lemon.

263
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,640
Matcha honey lemon?

264
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,640
Because Ms. Lalin is the owner of the resort and my boss.

265
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,040
Yes.

266
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh.

267
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,680
Then why didn't you tell me know?

268
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,840
Well, I haven't had a chance to tell you.

269
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,560
Let us go and make an order for you.

270
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,560
Thank you very much, Lalin, for sending me off.

271
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,360
It's okay, I got matcha as a thank you from you.

272
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm going.

273
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,680
Wait a minute.

274
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,000
Waiting here ,please.

275
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,600
Done.

276
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,360
I won't forget you anymore.

277
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,840
Let me to see that.

278
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,840
No, I drew it for myself to see.

279
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,960
Hmm, I don't want to see it.

280
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,520
Are you upset?

281
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,640
No, I'm not mad.

282
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,640
Well, if Lalin sees this, you might not like it.

283
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,880
I'll show you ,next time.

284
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,760
Okay, I'm going now.

285
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Ok

286
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Bye Bye.

287
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,920
Thank you.

288
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,560
Do you know.

289
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,720
That every time you come here?

290
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,240
You'll always love to come and sit here.

291
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,800
Really?

292
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,720
That's right. If you don't believe me, just look at the pictures on your Instagram.

293
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,640
You're right!

294
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,240
Look!

295
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,600
So many pictures.

296
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,920
But it's not strange.

297
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
The flowers here.

298
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,840
Every time we come.

299
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,760
They’re always different and beautiful in their own way.

300
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,720
I'll take you to a special place.

301
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,760
Come on, come on.

302
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,880
Look here.

303
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
What?

304
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,400
Where is it?

305
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,920
I can't remember.

306
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,480
What are you looking for?

307
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,680
What are you looking for?

308
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,160
Where is it?

309
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,360
Are you hiding the treasure?

310
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,520
Who would hide the treasure here?

311
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,840
I found it!

312
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,080
Try reading this.

313
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,320
Wait, did I really plant this tree?

314
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,360
I don't believe it. It's so beautiful.

315
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,040
You planted it last time.

316
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,520
It's been several months now.

317
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,160
But this tree is the most resilient.

318
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,440
I wonder if the tree is waiting for its owner to come and see the results.

319
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,520
It must be right.

320
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,920
Let's take a picture and keep it.

321
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,960
Can you take a picture of me?

322
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,920
I'll take a picture for you.

323
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,840
Take like it.

324
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,160
Can we take a picture together?

325
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,000
Dr. Lan and Ms. Dawan, they are so cute.

326
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,320
Every time they come here, it's always like this. I'm so envious.

327
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,600
Dawan, she looks so cute.

328
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,440
She looks so full of energy.

329
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,440
When you talk about people with a lot of energy.

330
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,560
I miss Lalin from the past, you know?

331
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,360
Really?

332
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,760
True, before you looked exactly like Ms. Dawan.

333
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Bright and cute.

334
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,560
With a lot of energy, like someone who doesn't know the word "tired".

335
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,760
But other people, they're so tired that they just lie down on the floor.

336
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,360
In the past, I didn't have to carry such a heavy burden.

337
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,200
Now that you said it, I also miss the old days.

338
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,080
I want to go back to the way it was.

339
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,320
All I have to do is focus on my studies. No need to worry about anything else.

340
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,800
No matter how tired I am, I always have my parents to support me.

341
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,880
That’s life, Everyone has to grow up at some point.

342
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,480
That's true.

343
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,800
Have I changed a lot now?

344
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,720
Lalin?

345
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,240
Now Lalin is.

346
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,440
You're just as adorable as before.

347
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,720
But you seem more mature now.

348
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,400
You are strong.

349
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,720
Independent.

350
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,920
And full of self-confidence.

351
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,680
But.

352
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,040
sometimes.

353
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,760
You look too stressful.

354
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,840
I’m just worried your face might age faster than it should.

355
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,280
You can smile, like this.

356
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,160
Let go of what you can’t control.

357
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,040
And don’t sweat the things that don’t go your way.

358
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,320
OK, I'll try.

359
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,080
It's so strange to meet Dr. Lan again.

360
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,160
But the good feelings I had for Dr.Lan are still in my heart.

361
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,320
And I haven't told Dr.Lan yet.

362
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,920
Even though the person next to Dr.Lan is not me.

363
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,400
But today's feeling is very strange.

364
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,280
Why do I feel so good with her?

365
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,400
Wow.

366
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,480
So many vegies!

367
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,480
These greens look so fresh and tasty.

368
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,280
They’d be perfect for making a salad!

369
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,840
That's right!

370
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,680
If you want to harvest vegetables by yourself, you have to wake up early.

371
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,760
Because here, they let us harvest vegetables to eat ourselves.

372
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,240
Really?

373
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,560
Yes, I'll take you to ask Thianhom.

374
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,080
Be careful.

375
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,760
Hi ,Thianhom.

376
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Hello, Dr. Lan.

377
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,200
The vegetable garden here is absolutely stunning!

378
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,960
Woah, it took so much to get to this point. I almost gave up several times.

379
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,160
Oh, hello, Ms. Dawan.

380
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,800
The salad greens had fully grown and are ready to eat!

381
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,760
If you’d like to harvest some salad greens to eat, feel free to take them.

382
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,200
Ahh.

383
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,600
Thank you.

384
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,240
See? It’s the salad greens you love!

385
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,440
On our last visit, the salad greens wasn’t ready to harvest yet.

386
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,080
This time, I’m sure I’ll be having it every single day!

387
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,320
That's right, Dr.Lan.

388
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,720
If you’d like to harvest some salad greens to eat, feel free to take them.

389
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,560
Or you can place an order with the kitchen, and they’ll prepare it for you.

390
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,640
Don't you have an assistant today?

391
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,320
Hmm.

392
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,760
Normally when I work, I always work alone.

393
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,680
But once in a while, there are school kids or tourists who come for a tour like this.

394
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,720
So they get to help out a little.

395
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,480
But lately, it’s been a bit quiet and lonely.

396
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,240
because hardly anyone comes to tour the garden.

397
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,120
So, today, let's help Thianhom work.

398
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,400
What???

399
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,600
Then, why don’t we help her put some fertilizer on the vegetables?

400
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,480
No worries at all.

401
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,720
Ms. Dawan and Dr. Lan.

402
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,840
Your clothes might get stained, so I’ll do it myself. I can handle it.

403
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,720
It's okay.

404
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,560
So when we eat salad greens, we don't feel guilty.

405
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
Okay.

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,920
First, put on your gloves.

407
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,960
After putting on gloves, add a handful of fertilizer to the vegetables here.

408
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,960
I put it in as well.

409
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,400
Lan, bring your face here. I'll give you a facial mask. Here you go.

410
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,080
This is fertilizer made from cow dung. I just grabbed cow dung, and now I'm grabbing this.

411
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,360
I also caught it.

412
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,760
Why do you two have messy faces?

413
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,840
Look at your own face first.

414
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,440
Look at your own face first.

415
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,200
Dawan

416
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,680
Dawan

417
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,960
Dawan

418
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,200
Dawan

419
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,880
Dawan

420
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,000
Dawan

421
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,520
Dawan

422
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,400
What are you doing sitting here?

423
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,800
You're freezing cold.

424
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,120
I had a nightmare again.

425
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,120
I dreamed about my parents again.

426
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,280
Dawan.

427
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,840
Stay calm and composed first, okay?

428
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,960
Take it easy.

429
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,800
It’s only a dream.

430
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,800
I'm here.

431
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,720
You don't have to be afraid.

432
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,320
Now we are in Khao Yai.

433
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,680
The place you love very much.

434
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,600
Do you see it?

435
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,960
Do you see it?

436
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,240
I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.

437
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,120
Dawan don't have to be afraid.

438
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,520
Form now on, I will cuddle you every single night.

439
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,560
If the day comes when you.

440
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,720
Wake up startled.

441
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,800
Or feel unsafe.

442
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,200
Feel free to wake me up right away.

443
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,560
I promise.

444
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,000
That I will make it happen.

445
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,440
I will cure you.

446
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Until you recover from this disease.

447
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,040
Please trust me.

448
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,600
I don’t want to dream like this again.

449
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,560
It was really scary.

450
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,840
It was painful.

451
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,720
Today, everything is happening so fast.

452
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,680
I accidentally met Dr. Lan.

453
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
And then I met Dawan.

454
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,400
This heart of mine.

455
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,280
Even though it used to be cold.

456
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,800
Why today?

457
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,840
Beating so fast.

458
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,640
I’m confused and can’t quite explain it.

459
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,000
My face is strangely warming up.

460
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,680
And where did all my confidence go?

461
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,920
Everything I touch feels unfamiliar.

462
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,240
Words stuck right at the tip of my tongue.

463
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,680
My heart is pounding loudly.

464
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,400
What exactly am I...

465
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,720
Feeling right now?

466
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,080
What are you doing?

467
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,880
Morning’s here, time to open the curtains! How long do you plan to sleep?

468
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,000
I’m not ready to get up. Can I stay in bed for a few more hours?

469
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,960
No way.

470
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,520
Last night, I stayed up until 2 a.m.

471
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,040
Fixing the designs for the clients. My back’s totally killing me now!

472
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,840
Let me sleep a bit more, okay?

473
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,440
Poor you. Who said you had to do all that?

474
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,400
You brought it on yourself!

475
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,920
I accidentally opened the Line message from the client.

476
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,000
It’s not like I can skip it.

477
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,160
You don’t need to carry the charger next time.

478
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,840
Just leave it in the car.

479
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,080
Perfect excuse to tell the client, your phone died!

480
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,520
Can’t be reached.

481
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,280
Well, that's a good idea.

482
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,600
By the way.

483
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:52,120
How come I didn’t think of something this sneaky?

484
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,960
Hey, are you throwing shade at me?

485
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,280
Wake up now, my dear.

486
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,280
Give me a little kiss?

487
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,280
Now that we’re at Khao Yai.

488
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,720
Gotta take in all the fresh air we can.

489
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,600
I heard there’s a lot of pollution in Bangkok.

490
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,400
The oxygen here really helps clear out your lungs.

491
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,600
I don’t see what’s so great about it, It’s just trees everywhere.

492
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,600
It’s so quiet and boring, I’m dying of boredom.

493
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
What did you say?

494
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,800
No No, I didn't say anything.

495
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,360
I'm wake up! Already.

496
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,640
Let's go to out side.

497
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,480
We can go now.

498
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,080
Dim, Arm, it’s been a while! How are you doing?

499
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,680
So where are you going?

500
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,240
Oh, we're going to harvest vegetables in the garden.

501
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,240
That’s good! I’m heading there as well.

502
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,960
So we can walk together.

503
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,400
Why are you here?

504
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,680
Shouldn’t you be at school?

505
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,520
Huh?

506
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,760
What?

507
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,440
He's on school break, so he came to help out at the resort.

508
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,840
That's good. Let's go.

509
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,960
Oh, Ms.Dawan.

510
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,720
What's that bruise on your arm?

511
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,800
I don't know either.

512
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,240
Maybe I just bumped into something.

513
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,640
You’re so clumsy!

514
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,760
Just a little.

515
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,680
You're so annoying! What's wrong?

516
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
It's nothing. Never mind.

517
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,760
Thianhom.

518
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,480
Gotcha!

519
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,720
Laughing at others so much, are you feeling chilly?

520
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,280
What kind of nonsense is this?

521
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,760
So you wanna play like this, huh?

522
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,760
Where are you trying to run away to?

523
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,000
No No.

524
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,200
How’s that? You’re really good at teasing me, huh?

525
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,160
Gotcha!

526
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,400
Stop!

527
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,400
Why didn't you tell me you were going to stop?

528
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,920
Dawan why did you stop?

529
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,240
Look over there.

530
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,400
See? They're playing so cutely.

531
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,600
Are you tired?

532
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,720
They're so cute.

533
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,840
So what should we do? Should we just go to them?

534
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,960
Why would you interrupt them?

535
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,760
Look, they are having fun.

536
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,640
Interrupting people who are having fun is a sin, you know?

537
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,080
Then we'll wait until they're done playing.

538
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,040
We can go sit and wait.

539
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,120
Hey everyone.

540
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,520
What are you doing over there?

541
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,560
Aren't you gonna pick the veggies?

542
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,680
Dawan, are you okay?

543
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,280
You don’t look so well. Are you feeling sick? Is something wrong?

544
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,040
Okay, I'm fine.

545
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,240
How about this?

546
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,920
I'll help you to harvest the vegetables.

Oh, that's okay.

548
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,200

Miss?

551
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,240
What are you saying?

552
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,360
What is your name?

553
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,800
My Name is Lalin.

Dawan calmed down.

555
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,600
Thought things through slowly, and composed herself.
