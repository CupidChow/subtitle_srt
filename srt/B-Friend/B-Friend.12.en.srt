1
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:37,167
I just wanted to be with you.

2
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:43,167
Look, Guea have to drive you home. See?

3
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:47,500
Then next time I’ll just move closer so Guea doesn’t have to take me.

4
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,042
Go take some rest

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,083
If you hit me again, I’m gonna kiss you.

6
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,167
You, huh…

7
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:02,417
Will you forget me?

8
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,292
I promise I won’t let you down.

9
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,042
But right now… you’re already did.

10
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,042
How's the rice porridge?

11
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:30,250
It’s good. Really good. I didn’t think you could cook this well.

12
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:33,834
Hey, Jin, how are you feeling?

13
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,209
I’m better now.

14
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,834
Honestly, you should’ve rested a bit more. No need to rush back to work.

15
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:46,292
Oh no no no— It’s good to be back at work! Keeps her mind from overthinking.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,334
Right, Jin? Let’s just work on something we love.

17
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:50,626
It's weird.
Hey no

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,209
This one is mine.

19
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:02,125
And this one too.

20
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,417
Hmm, Kanit is acting kind of weird.

21
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,918
What? How? Why? What?

22
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,334
you are weird.

23
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,918
What?

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,792
Could I order a drink, please?

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,999
Uh… I’d like to order a drink, please.

26
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,000
Alright, back to work, everyone.

27
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:37,000
What would you like?

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,459
I’ll have an iced Americano, please.

29
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,500
Sure, just a moment.

30
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,626
Come on, Jin, let Kanit help you.

31
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,083
It’s fine, I can do it myself.

32
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,667
It’s okay, let me help.

33
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,250
It’s fine, I’ve been doing this. I’ll wash it myself.

34
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,125
Come on, I want to help.

35
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,167
No need, I’ll do it myself.

36
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,334
Give it to me.

37
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,667
You don’t have to, Kanit.

38
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:09,626
Come on, just give it to me.

39
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,000
No, I’ll handle it myself.

40
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,000
Don’t be stubborn, Jin.
Stop it.

41
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,999
Give it here, I’ll let Tuk put it away.

42
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,459
Huh? Uh… okay, I’ll put it away.

43
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,125
What’s with you two? Fighting over chores like little kids.

44
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,999
Hmm… acting kinda weird.

45
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:34,959
Where are you going?

46
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,209
Wrong way.

47
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,000
Just playing along with them?

48
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,000
2, 4, 5, 6, 7 — so we’ve got 7 loaves of bread left, right?

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,667
And then there are… mango sheet.

50
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,459
Check with the mango farm, because I think we might need to make more.

51
00:04:57,626 --> 00:04:58,834
The customers have been buying a lot.

52
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,250
Hello.

53
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,042
Hi.

54
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,834
This is a woven bag handmade by the villagers.

55
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:06,626
Oh, really?
Yes.

56
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,375
Oh! That’s that customer.

57
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,042
You know her?

58
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:15,999
Yeah, I’ve sold stuff to her before.

59
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:18,250
I see.

60
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,250
Alright, Lan, you wait here, I’ll go help Lalin.

61
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,375
Okay.

62
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,125
Hi.

63
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,500
Hi.

64
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:35,042
Do you remember me, Dawan? I sold you mango sheets last time.

65
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,792
Oh, I remember! You’re the one who gave me the mango sheets recipe, right?

66
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,751
Yes. How did it turn out?

67
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,250
P’Lan.

68
00:05:56,626 --> 00:06:01,042
Sorry, I was busy helping Lalin sell stuff and completely forgot about you.

69
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:07,417
And I sold 20 bags of riceberry rice!

70
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:12,209
There're more — hats, bags, and those sleeveless blouses.

71
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,209
Selling is so much fun, Lan.

72
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,042
And before I know it, it's already 1 p.m.

73
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:23,209
But I know you were waiting, so buy you food.

74
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,918
Are you okay?

75
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,999
I’m fine.

76
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:37,834
Then let’s eat together.

77
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:51,834
I was worried you’d be mad, so I buy your favorites. Eat lots, okay?

78
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,792
How long has it been since you remembered everything?

79
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:14,042
It’s alright, don’t be scared, I’m not mad.

80
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:25,334
Probably before I fell into the water.

81
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,000
That’s good.

82
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,751
Lan… I didn’t mean to keep it from you.

83
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:38,125
I just don't get the chance to tell you.

84
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,542
It’s okay, I understand.

85
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:45,999
But…

86
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,000
Let’s eat.

87
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,709
Hey, P’Tianhom.

88
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,250
Oh, Dim — here to get some veggies? Hold on a sec.

89
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,083
Nope, I actually come to talk to you.

90
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:18,999
Uh-huh?

91
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,167
So?

92
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,999
How have you been?

93
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,792
I’m doing fine. Why?

94
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,375
No reason, just asking.

95
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,667
You’re asking about Peach, aren’t you? “Just asking,” huh.

96
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,584
Something like that.

97
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,042
Well, if you're doing fine, that’s good then.

98
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,375
Honestly, I’ve already moved on from Peach.

99
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:51,459
I don’t want to waste time on someone who doesn’t care about me.

100
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,709
I’d rather spend my time taking care of my veggie plots.

101
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,083
When I sit and think about it…

102
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:05,000
The most important thing in my life is keeping my veggie plots beautiful and in top shape.

103
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:10,792
So that when people eat them, they all say the same thing — “Delicious, fresh, so good.”

104
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,417
Seeing you smile makes me happy too.

105
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,667
Anyway, what about you? How’s things with Arm?

106
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:23,042
Arm? Oh, don’t worry about him.

107
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:28,709
Once work at the resort slows down a bit, I’ll just bring him a piece or two of cake.

108
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,000
He’ll get over it.

109
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:36,667
Well, since you’re here, wanna help me with the veggie plots?

110
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,751
Sure! Which one?

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
Four rai

112
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,626
Four rai? For real?

113
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,334
Yeah, four rai.

114
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:51,250
Hey, where are you going? Didn’t you say you’d help?

115
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:53,709
Shouldn’t have said anything…

116
00:09:55,667 --> 00:10:00,083
Come on, come with me — it’s only four rai. Piece of cake. Just four rai.

117
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,542
Jin, wanna go for a walk before we head back?

118
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,751
Wow… I haven’t heard you say that in, what, three years?

119
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,375
You remember that clearly?

120
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,459
Of course I do.

121
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,999
We’ve known each other for 7 years, 4 months, and 9 days now.

122
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,292
Since when have you been keeping track?

123
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:01,918
Since the very first day we met.

124
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,000
Are you okay, Jin?

125
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,000
Kanit…

126
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:34,626
From the first day until today,

127
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,542
I’ve never felt any differently about you.

128
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,542
I’ve felt the same about you every single day.

129
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:53,459
But today…

130
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:58,751
I don’t want to keep these feelings anymore.

131
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,042
I love you, Kanit.

132
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:23,751
Will you give it a try with me?

133
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,042
I’ve been open to it for a long time…

134
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,083
Just no one ever asked.

135
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,626
I love you too, Jin.

136
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,334
Is something wrong?

137
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:40,500
If I said nothing’s wrong, I’d be lying.

138
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,626
About that thing we both did…

139
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,459
It wasn’t just Lalin’s fault.

140
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,834
Lan was wrong too.

141
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,792
I think your condition get much better.

142
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,999
We should probably head back to Bangkok.

143
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:26,459
You haven’t really been calling your mom while staying here, have you?

144
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,751
That’s true.

145
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:47,667
I think in the next two or three days, we should go back to Bangkok.

146
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,042
So you can go to the hospital.

147
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,459
To check and make sure you’re 100% recovered.

148
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:24,250
No one can remember everything in this world.

149
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,209
Things change with time.

150
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,709
Everything changes.

151
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,000
Lan

152
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,542
It’s been a long time, hasn’t it?

153
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,876
Yeah, really long — maybe since university

154
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:30,500
Matcha honey lemon.

155
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,500
How did you know I like that?

156
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:50,876
Wow....
Thanks, Lan.

157
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:53,125
You even know my name?

158
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,292
Mind if I sit with you?

159
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:35,000
Wow, Lan, you sing so beautifully.

160
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:39,584
I never thought a medical student would have such an artistic side.

161
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:46,292
I like singing and playing music… but I had to study medicine.

162
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,792
So you chose necessity over passion?

163
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,667
You make it sound like you had to give something up.

164
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,083
Can you tell me what it is?

165
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:17,876
You don’t have to if you don’t want to. It’s okay.

166
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,083
No.

167
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,584
So, what do you like, Lin?

168
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,459
What do I like?

169
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:36,999
I… honestly have no idea, Lan.

170
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,918
I’m not doing what I love.

171
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,292
But I hope that one day…

172
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,500
I’ll get to love the way my heart truly wants.

173
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:59,250
Lan… you’re talking kind of strange.

174
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,000
Is something wrong?

175
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:04,626
No, nothing.

176
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,000
How did we go from talking about music to this?

177
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,334
I promise you…

178
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,375
I’m going to make it happen.

179
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,500
I’ll cure you, Dawan.

180
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,167
I’ll make sure you get better from this illness.

181
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:35,918
I wants to say…
Let’s break up.

182
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,292
How long has it been since you remembered everything?

183
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,542
We can still be friends, right?

184
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,083
Of course, why not?

185
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,375
I’m sorry for everything that’s happened.

186
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,751
I’m sorry on Dawan’s behalf too.

187
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,667
It’s okay… I understand.

188
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,209
Eating the same dish all the time — don’t you ever get bored?

189
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:34,042
No, I actually like eating the same things over and over.

190
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,918
Because if you try something new, it might not be as good, right?

191
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,542
Yeah, it’s easy to remember.

192
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,500
So, how’s it been? Has studying been tiring?

193
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,584
Not really.

194
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,751
But you, Lan… studying medicine must be more exhausting.

195
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,999
Seeing you makes all the tiredness go away.

196
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:58,375
Are all medical students this sweet?

197
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,417
Not really.

198
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,083
Before this, I should apologize for not coming to see you.

199
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:08,959
It’s okay.

200
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:12,459
Just seeing you is enough to make me happy.

201
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,834
Aren’t you going to eat now?

202
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Yeah, let’s go.

203
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:20,334
Thank you.

204
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:22,792
You’re welcome.

205
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,876
Well, I’ll take my leave for now.

206
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,751
We can meet up another time when we’re free.

207
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:40,209
Can you not go yet? Can you tell me first?

208
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,834
Maybe it’ll make you feel better.

209
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,292
Um...

210
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:06,626
I’m really sorry, Lin… I can’t come see you today.

211
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:31,250
Why did you bring this? I’m not even crying.

212
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:35,042
I see you looking down…

213
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,042
It’s okay.

214
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:15,125
I really have to apologize again today. I’m really busy. Miss you.

215
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:47,042
Thanks.

216
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,876
Why didn’t the handsome come to see you?

217
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:55,250
I don’t know.

218
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,459
So, are you together yet?

219
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,626
Not yet.

220
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:10,626
Did he make you wait in vain again?

221
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:13,918
I come to wait for him myself.

222
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:18,626
Sorry if I’m intruding on your personal stuff.

223
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:21,834
It’s okay.

224
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:25,584
Don’t tell me your friend make you wait in vain again.

225
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:30,250
No. I just see you like to sit here waiting.

226
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:37,334
So I'm here to keep you company.

227
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,125
Lan…

228
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:55,500
After everything that happen, I’m sure now.

229
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:05,209
I want to say…

230
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,375
Let’s break up.

231
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:16,417
Break up?

232
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:24,876
What does that mean?

233
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:33,292
I’m being told to break up even though we haven’t even dated yet?

234
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:37,459
Let's be good friend.

235
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,083
I'm sorry.

236
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,709
I will be a good friend to you.

237
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,000
Thank you for understanding.

238
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:23,876
Why are you crying?

239
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,375
Why didn’t you pick up the phone?

240
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:41,584
I look for you all over campus.

241
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,042
Who make you cry?

242
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:01,334
You don’t have to answer me.

243
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:46,667
Can you look at me with your love just once?

244
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:53,000
I promise I won’t make you sad.

245
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:03,250
I…

246
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:06,876
You like me, right? what you want to say.

247
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:17,584
I’ve been liking you ever since the day you covered my skirt with your sweater.

248
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:20,250
From that day until today,

249
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,459
I’ve never stopped liking you.

250
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:29,876
But I only see you as a little sister.

251
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,584
Thank you for the kind feelings you have for me.

252
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,209
But soon I’ll have to go back home for work,

253
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,167
And we won’t see each other again.

254
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,000
We will.

255
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:53,042
I think we shouldn’t feel more than this.

256
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,751
I know you really like him.

257
00:32:57,918 --> 00:33:00,375
But can you open your heart to me just once?

258
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:06,999
I’ll stay by your side, and I’ll never make you sad.

259
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,334
P’Lalin…

260
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,876
One day, I’ll make you my girlfriend.

261
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:33,417
Oh, Dalan, what are you doing here?

262
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:37,000
I come to apply for a job, but all the positions are full.

263
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:39,999
So I wait to see you first, and then go home.

264
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:44,042
Som is taking care of her mom

265
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:46,751
Right? Looks like we might be short one staff member.

266
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:51,042
That’s fine, let Dalan fill in for Som for now.

267
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:53,959
But what will we do when Som comes back?

268
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,999
Then Dawan can start work tomorrow.

269
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:03,918
Work starts at 7 a.m. — no being late.

270
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,751
Thank you, Lalin.

271
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:11,209
Oh, why aren’t you leaving yet?

272
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,667
I want to stay and keep you company.

273
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:18,083
So, how was your first day at work? Fun?

274
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,459
It was really fun!

275
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:24,167
Thank you for letting me work here.

276
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:37,709
Can you teach me, please?

277
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:40,542
Already awake?

278
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,999
I don’t want to wake up yet.

279
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:50,999
I want to stay like this with you, Lalin… all night long.

280
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:53,709
I’ll just go back to sleep.

281
00:35:57,042 --> 00:36:01,083
You’re really sneaky… you can go rest now.

282
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,918
Go rest.

283
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:15,500
If you hit me one more time, I’ll kiss you.

284
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,000
You…

285
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:33,709
I’m leaving now.

286
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:40,918
What do you mean, Dalan?

287
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:45,209
You’re not going to work with me anymore?

288
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,918
I have to go back and work at home.

289
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:01,083
It’s okay, I understand.

290
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:05,500
But come see me whenever you can.

291
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,042
Will you forget me?

292
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:19,042
I promise I won’t make you sad.

293
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:24,792
But right now… you already did.

294
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,999
I once keep waiting for someone…

295
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,167
I don’t want to put myself back in that position again.

296
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:43,667
Please…

297
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:48,792
I don’t want to get hurt again.

298
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,459
I’m sorry.

299
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:23,999
Really? But I’m not really a singer.

300
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:28,292
Because I make a promise to someone…

301
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,167
And I have to fulfill that duty.

302
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:45,626
Then… whenever you want to sing again, you can sing for me.

303
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,250
I’m ready to listen to you sing every day.

304
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:52,876
Just don’t get tired of me, okay?

305
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:57,584
You must sing love songs like this for your girlfriend often, right?

306
00:38:58,792 --> 00:38:59,959
No.

307
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,125
Why not?

308
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:06,375
Maybe she weren’t into it.

309
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:10,876
Then… it’s okay.

310
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,167
Just think of me as your girlfriend.

311
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:22,292
And… you can sing to me until you’re satisfied.

312
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:25,417
As long as you don’t check out of the resort.

313
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:27,876
Really?

314
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:29,751
Yeah.

315
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,000
Dr. Lan…

316
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,375
I just want to sing love songs up close for my girlfriend.

317
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,417
Could you be my girlfriend oneday?

318
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:14,834
I’m sorry for everything.

319
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:19,167
I’m sorry on Dawan’s behalf too.

320
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:31,167
It’s alright. I understand.

321
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,334
What’s wrong, Lalin?

322
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,083
Kanit.

323
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,209
Dawan.

324
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:22,250
Dawan remembers everything before coming here.

325
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:49,042
Dawan came back here to make me feel the same way she once felt.

326
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,209
Kanit…

327
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:48,334
Hello, doctor.

328
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:51,292
Hello. How are you feeling?

329
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:54,918
Much better now. These days I can sleep well and even dream nicely.

330
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:59,999
Ever since you told me to eat healthy and exercise, I’ve been able to sleep.

331
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,751
That’s good.

332
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:06,292
You don’t look very okay though, doctor.

333
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,999
Too much work, money problems…

334
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:12,584
heartbreak?

335
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,500
Not really.

336
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:21,667
Doctor, if it’s about women, about heartbreak, you can consult me anytime.

337
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:27,167
So are you here to consult me or have me consult you?

338
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:31,751
Sometimes… I think you don’t need to do everything by the book.

339
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:36,375
It’s good to follow your heart sometimes.

340
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,417
How are you feeling? Is your condition better?

341
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:45,125
Yes, I’m feeling better now.

342
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,417
I’ll prescribe you some vitamins to boost your immune system.

343
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,459
That will also help you sleep better.

344
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:57,876
But if the insomnia comes back, come see me right away.

345
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,334
Okay. Arigato gozaimasu.

346
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:02,125
Thank you.

347
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,167
Dalan.

348
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:06,292
Have you forgotten me?

349
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:16,083
If you don’t answer, I’ll take it as you’ve never forgotten me.

350
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,042
Lalin.

351
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:40,500
I won’t ask if you love me.

352
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:49,834
I just want to tell you that I love you so much.

353
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,751
And I’ll stay right here…

354
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,334
until you love me.

355
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:05,083
Thank you, Dalan.

356
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:22,999
Thank you.
