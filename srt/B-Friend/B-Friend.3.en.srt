1
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,680
I’m done eating.

2
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,640
I’ll get going to work now.

3
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,400
Huh? Where are you rushing off to, Lalin?

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Take the salad rolls with you!

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,680
Dawan,

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,040
Don’t mind her.

7
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,520
Lalin’s always like this.

8
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,120
She’s getting old... forgetful.

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Right, Arm?

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah, that’s what happens when you get old.

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,680
Thanks, Dim, Arm.

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Lalin, Did you have an appointment with someone?

13
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,440
Think carefully.

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,600
They’ve been waiting outside for 20 minutes now.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,640
I totally forgot I had a meeting with a client!

16
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,640
Ugh, why didn’t you just tell me right away? Stop beating around the bush!

17
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,600
I did tell you! You just weren’t paying attention.

18
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, okay — I’m going now.

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,760
This way, please. I’ll take you on a tour.

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,880
Where's Tianhom?

21
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Did she go shopping in town?

22
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,880
No.

23
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,520
I texted her by Line.

24
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
She said she's in the garden.

25
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,440
Feel free to come in.

26
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Really?

27
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
There she is!

28
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,240
There’s Tianhom!

29
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,960
Huh?

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,440
Why does she seem off?

31
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,080
Is she not feeling well?

32
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
I think we’d better go check on her quickly.

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,560
Tianhom!

34
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,600
What’s wrong, Thianhom?

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
Why are you crying, Thianhom?

36
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,320
It’s Peach…

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
What about Peach?

38
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,720
Did she cheat on you?

39
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,640
Tianhom, tell me.

40
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,320
I will handle it.

41
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,480
Just tell me.

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,760
I’ll...

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
I’ll throw in some elbows,

44
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,480
knees.

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,120
Right hook, left hook.

46
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,920
Hey wait!.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,760
It's me.

48
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,280
Oops!

49
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm just sad, that’s all.

50
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
Why?

51
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,640
What?

52
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Geez, you’ll message me on LINE later, okay?

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,240
Wait!

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,000
It’s just that I’m sad because Peach went back to Bangkok.

55
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,840
I just miss her, that’s all.

56
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,520
Aww…Aww…

57
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,360
Deep breaths... Stay strong.

58
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,800
Aww…

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,600
Tianhom, are you feeling any better?

60
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,600
It's okay, you don’t have to worry about me.

61
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Every time Peach leaves,

62
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,840
I always ends up crying like this.

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,160
It’s not just you—I feels the same way too.

64
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,880
Huh? Why’s that?

65
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,280
Well,

66
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,160
Lan is going back to Bangkok again.

67
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,320
Why?

68
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,200
I’m tied up with a patient case.

69
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,680
It’s a regular patient who just got back from abroad.

70
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
I need to follow up with him a bit.

71
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,240
Lately, there have been a lot of patients with neurological conditions—

72
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,480
including migraines,

73
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,960
muscle inflammation, and muscle weakness.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
I guess that makes sense.

75
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,240
But will you be gone long?

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,920
Just two days.

77
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,360
Two days is already a long time.

78
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,320
Do you think you can wait?

79
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,280
Even if I can't, I’ll have to.

80
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,800
Well,

81
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
If you ever feel lonely being alone,

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,320
you’re welcome to spend some time with me in the garden.

83
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,720
Really?

84
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,520
Thanks, that means a lot.

85
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
I’d love that!

86
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,240
Oh,
Dr. Lunn?

87
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,200
Hmm?

88
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,080
Well, I always cries every time when Peach goes back to Bangkok.

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,160
Could that be related to a neurological condition?

90
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,280
I just can’t seem to stop it.

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,000
Nah, it’s not some nerve issue or anything…

92
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,720
it’s pure love, that’s all.

93
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,480
You’re just saying whatever.

94
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,640
Talking about?

95
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,720
Follow me, this way.

96
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,360
This here is the resort’s vegetable garden.

97
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,160
The garden might not be quite ready yet, let me show you another spot for now.

98
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,840
Fine.

99
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,600
Hey, Lalin.

100
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,320
Did you come to see me?

101
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,600
I did, but it looks like you're a little busy.

102
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,440
I’ll just go elsewhere for now.

103
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,560
Would you like me to talk to the guests about the garden?

104
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,880
Make yourself comfortable.

105
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,160
I just need to talk to a guest for a bit.

106
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,320
Hello and welcome!

107
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,600
I’m Tianhom.

108
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,520
I'm responsible for all the greenery and the garden here.

109
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,160
So this spot you're standing on is part of our resort’s vegetable garden.

110
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,320
Here, we grow a variety of lettuces—like red oak, green oak, and cos.

111
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,080
But there’s this one place I'd really love to recommend.

112
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,040
The flower garden is that way. Come on, I’ll show you.

113
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,880
Lalin,

114
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
How’s everything going?

115
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,200
It’s okay.

116
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,200
Do the guests seem to like it?

117
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,520
Yeah, they seem to.

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,080
Have you shown them around the whole place yet?

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,080
I think so…

120
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,680
Or maybe not? I’m not sure.

121
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
Is there anything I can help you with?

122
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,800
There is, but hang on a sec.

123
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,440
Everyone, let’s hurry up. The customer will be here in 20 minutes.

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Okay.

125
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,400
Looks great.

126
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,920
Is everyone done yet?

127
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,600
Great job.

128
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,840
Everything’s done. Everyone can take a 10-minute break.

129
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,480
Okay.

130
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,880
Got it.

131
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,440
You can take a break too.

132
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Jin

133
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,320
Sit down first.

134
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,520
Whoa, how much energy do you have?

135
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,760
Are you polishing it so hard that the numbers light up?

136
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Hey, wait—Kanit, what are you doing?

137
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,760
I’ll wipe it myself. You go sit down.

138
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,280
Well, you’re the one who won’t take a break.

139
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,080
I told you to go, but you wouldn’t listen.

140
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,560
When did you say that?

141
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,720
Just now. I kept saying it—didn’t you hear me?

142
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,680
Oh,

143
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,600
I thought you were talking to someone else, so I didn’t pay attention. Sorry.

144
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,680
Sorry.

145
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,560
Jin, go take a break. Everyone else is already on break.

146
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,080
I want this table to be clean and shiny.

147
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,440
So that customers will be inpressed when they come in.

148
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,720
But didn’t we have customers coming in all day today?

149
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,760
If your arms and legs could speak, they'd be crying for help because of you!

150
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,720
Go rest, please... if not for you, then for me.

151
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,000
If you get sick, it could get worse, you know.

152
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,080
Alright,

153
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,480
I’m going.

154
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,800
Oh! They're here!

155
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,280
Hello.

156
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,720
Hi there!

157
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,640
Huh?

158
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,320
Why did you come alone?

159
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,120
I’ve assigned Thianhom to take care of the customer already.

160
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,120
We spent so much time preparing.

161
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,440
You seem tired—how about taking a break?

162
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,200
Yeah,
That’s a good idea.

163
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,720
We really took a long time preparing this.

164
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,360
Yes.

165
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,960
How’s it going?

166
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,640
Were there many customers today?

167
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,320
Not really, just those two you see.

168
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,440
No,

169
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,320
I mean did the customers ask for anything? Anything like that?

170
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,360
No.

171
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,360
This group of customers is nice,

172
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
Not demanding at all.

173
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,240
Water and dessert, Ms.Lalin.

174
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,680
Thanks.

175
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
Oh, there are dessert too?

176
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,400
How did you manage to get it done in time?

177
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,040
Well, you ordered it, how could it not be ready on time?

178
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
And it’s not just two things,

179
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,960
I gave you four—lots of them!

180
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,040
Awesome, thanks a lot!

181
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,600
It looks delicious.

182
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,560
It’s already delicious.

183
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,800
It looks really good.

184
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,680
What?

185
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,080
Let me see.

186
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
Did you change your makeup color?

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,280
Why does it look strange?

188
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,600
Not really. Why?

189
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,960
It looks pale,

190
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
Washed out, like you’re sick.

191
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,200
Are you okay?

192
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,560
I probably didn’t sleep well last night.

193
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,240
And I woke up early to review a lot of documents.

194
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,560
In the afternoon, I took the customers to tour the resort.

195
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,520
Being out in the wind and sun made me feel a bit dizzy.

196
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,840
Hey, that’s not good at all.

197
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,320
After that, hurry back home and take your medicine to sleep.

198
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,680
Are you really going to be okay?

199
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,480
Having your butterfly pea drink made me feel better.

200
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,080
The souvenirs here are all really cute.

201
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,120
Yes, most of the products are all from the resort.

202
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,880
Please feel free to look around. I’ll excuse myself for now.

203
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,680
Okay.

204
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,320
Lalin.

205
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,160
Lalin.

206
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,760
Lalin.

207
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,320
Lalin.
Ms.Lalin.

208
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Lalin.
Lalin.

209
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,000
Jin, could you pass me the inhaler?

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,280
There’s no inhalant at all.

211
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,120
Jin, please ask Dr. Lan to come here.

212
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,400
Okay.

213
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,880
Kanit, please take care of the customers for me.

214
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,600
Got it.

215
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,840
Lalin.

216
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,520
Lalin.

217
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,720
I think we should take Ms.Lalin to her room first.

218
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,480
Lalin.

219
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,520
Please don’t move yet.

220
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
Give me two minutes.

221
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,600
For now, breathe through your nose and try not to breathe through your mouth.

222
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,320
Let me check your temperature for a moment.

223
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,360
Your temperature is normal, no fever detected.

224
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,280
Slowly get up.

225
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,960
Oh no, How’s the work going?

226
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,680
Don’t worry.

227
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
I heard Dim has taken care of everything.

228
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,640
Hearing that, I’m kinda relieved.

229
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,640
Have you been getting little rest lately?

230
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,160
Yes

231
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,360
Not much rest and I haven’t been sleeping well.

232
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,120
Is something stressing you out.

233
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,280
Or is work piling up?

234
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,440
Having a lot of work is normal for me.

235
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,400
And yes, there are some things stressing me out too.

236
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,360
But if I'm asking you to work less.

237
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
That’s probably not possible.

238
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,200
As a doctor,

239
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,320
I hope you’ll feel less stressed.

240
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
If work gets heavy,

241
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,800
just let someone you trust lend a hand.

242
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,000
Dr. Lan,

243
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,920
I have something I’d like to ask you.

244
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,880
Lately, my right eye has been twitching a lot.

245
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,920
Could it be related to me fainting today?

246
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,440
Right eye and the right side of your mouth are twitching.

247
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,600
you need to see a doctor immediately. It could be serious.

248
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,960
Well, Dr. Lan is right here!

249
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Just kidding.

250
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,160
Why do I need to see a doctor so urgently?

251
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,880
Because it could be a sign of a nerve disorder.

252
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
Please take a rest.

253
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,640
Excuse me, I’ll get going now.

254
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,360
It’s been a while...

255
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,360
Is Lalin going to be alright?

256
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,920
Don't worry, Dim.

257
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,800
Dr. Lan is with her, so no need to worry.

258
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,640
Has Lalin been feeling unwell lately?

259
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,160
I think so, yeah.

260
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,240
She’s the type to work a lot.

261
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,840
Even on days when everyone else gets a break, She still doesn’t take one.

262
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,240
No wonder I didn’t see her when I were here before.

263
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,440
Yes, she’d been flying around for work out of town quite a bit.

264
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,400
She doesn’t stay here often.

265
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,520
Just got back recently and then caught a sick.

266
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,520
Lalin must really have a deep love for this place, right?

267
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Absolutely,

268
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,120
Because it took a lot of effort and heart for her to finally manage this place herself.

269
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,280
Lalin’s had her fair share of hardships as well.

270
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,800
Lan,

271
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,320
How’s Lalin been?

272
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,120
She’s fine now.

273
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,120
The fainting was likely due to stress,

274
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,600
lack of rest,

275
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,240
taking clients into rooms where the temperature keeps changing from hot to cold.

276
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,720
So, her body just couldn’t keep up.

277
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
She’s fine now, so don’t worry.

278
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,480
I’ll leave some vitamins for Lalin, too.

279
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,320
Thanks a lot, Dr. Lan!

280
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,520
Lalin, slowly.

281
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
I’m feeling better now.

282
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,000
See? I told you to eat on time.

283
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,680
When it’s bedtime, you have to sleep right away.

284
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,960
What’s this? You’re still working even after going home?

285
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,200
Hey, keep it down a bit, okay?

286
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,920
Lan, does Lalin need to go to the hospital?

287
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,800
Keep an eye on the symptoms first. If any abnormal signs show up in 2-3 days.

288
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,160
Take her to the hospital right away.

289
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,440
I’m sorry for causing everyone to worry.

290
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,640
Have everyone eaten yet?

291
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,320
How about we go have a meal at the cafeteria?

292
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
Tonight, I'm treating.

293
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,440
Lalin!

294
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,520
I’ll help you.

295
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,160
Come on, I’ll help you.

296
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
Take it slow.

297
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,200
Arm, where the hell have you been?

298
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,960
I was just taking a nap behind the counter like usual.

299
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,560
With staff like this,

300
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
No wonder my sister has to work so hard.

301
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

302
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,840
I just took a quick nap, how was I supposed to know Lalin was gonna faint?

303
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,080
If I could do more work, my sister wouldn’t have to be so tired.

304
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,840
You can’t do more than this, bro, you’re already...

305
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,560
Why?

306
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,000
Why are you saying that?
Just listen to me first.

307
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,400
We’ve been friends for how long now?

308
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,760
Can you just listen to me?

309
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,920
Arm,

310
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,040
If you keep talking like that, just go wherever you want.

311
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Yeah,

312
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,680
I’m just saying what you’re doing every day is already enough.

313
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,840
You can’t push yourself any harder than this.

314
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,600
Lalin,

315
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,560
Eat a lot so you can get better soon.

316
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,920
Thanks.

317
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,960
Hey, there’s salad rolls too!

318
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,160
Let me try one. Is it as good as the ones Dahwan made?

319
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,560
Mmm, delicious!

320
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
My salad rolls are super yummy too.

321
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,240
Don’t you think, guys?

322
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,040
Dim,

323
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,560
Where’s Arm?

324
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,440
Arm?

325
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,760
I don't know.

326
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,320
Lalin,

327
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,400
what about my salad rolls?

328
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,080
Were they tasty?

329
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,320
That day, I put a lot of effort into making them.

330
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,640
From rolling them, adding the filling, even the dressing—I really put my heart into it.

331
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,520
It was really good!

332
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,440
I ate every last bite.

333
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,880
Seriously?

334
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,000
Especially that special salad dressing of yours,

335
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,160
It’s gotta be some secret recipe.

336
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,800
I’ve never had anything like it before.

337
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,600
By the way, do you sell the recipe?

338
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,560
I’d love to let my chef try making it.

339
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,320
No need for that, I’ll teach you myself.

340
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,080
Just let me know when you're free,

341
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,800
Then you can show your chef later.

342
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,320
Tomorrow would actually be great—since Ms.Lalin just got better.

343
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,520
Jumping right back into work might not be the best for your health.

344
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,320
But... work...

345
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,120
Dim, Dim can help, right? He’ll take care of it.

346
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,640
Yes, Dim handled everything really well today—

347
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,280
from checking the work to taking care of the customers.

348
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Think you can handle it?

349
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,360
Oh, totally. No problem at all.

350
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,000
Actually,

351
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,320
This is perfect—once I graduate, I can start working here right away.

352
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,880
No need to stress about job hunting elsewhere.

353
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,160
Exactly! Lalin, you should really make time to take care of yourself too.

354
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,240
Take a day off each week—just one day can make a difference.

355
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,840
And when you’re off, you have to really take a break. No thinking about work.

356
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,240
Okay!

357
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,720
Oh, it's nothing,

358
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,080
Just a notebook.

359
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,160
I don’t wanna be alone.

360
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,000
So finish checking the patients quick and hurry back to me, okay?

361
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,240
I’ll hurry back soon.

362
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,400
If you’re feeling lonely, just go stay with Tianhom.

363
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Go plant some veggies or throw some fertilizer around!

364
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,320
But you’ve got a date with Ms.Lalin.

365
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,600
Don’t forget!

366
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,720
Oh, right!

367
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,120
Ms.Lalin.

368
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,040
Wait, I mean Lalin,

369
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,880
The one who took me to buy cocoa at the café.

370
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Yeah, Ms.Lalin’s free today too.

371
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,120
If you’re free, you can stay with her.

372
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,360
I’ll hurry off to work and back to see you soon.

373
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,560
Okay.

374
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,840
Come on.

375
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,840
Drive safely, okay?

376
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,960
If you want anything, just call me or send me a message.

377
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,360
I’ll buy it and bring it back for you.

378
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,920
Let me know when you get there.

379
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,440
Okay.

380
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,640
Don’t forget, okay?

381
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,880
I won’t.

382
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I think it’s better to put the QR code over here—

383
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,160
it’ll be more convenient when customers walk in.

384
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:54,000
As for the keys, let’s keep them stored in the corner.

385
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,440
You should also find a small table to place in one of the corners,

386
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,320
and put the brochures there.

387
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,600
That way, our table will look much tidier.

388
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,800
Got it, Ms. Lalin.

389
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,920
Please take care of it.

390
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes, sir.

391
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,680
Hey,

392
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,240
Why are you still in your work clothes?

393
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,000
That’s not right!

394
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,200
Weren’t we supposed to go out today?

395
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,120
I thought you forgot!

396
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,600
How could I forget you?

397
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,840
What about Dr. Lan?

398
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
Isn’t she coming?

399
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,680
She went to Bangkok to check on patients at the hospital.

400
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,520
So, I get to spend a full 24 hours with you today!

401
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,520
Look, Dim and Tianhom are here!

402
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,960
Wow, so hardworking—showing up bright and early!

403
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,600
Gotta take care of the garden,

404
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,800
And Dim woke me up at 5 AM.

405
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,440
So here I am, helping out you at work.

406
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,680
So, what are you doing here so early?

407
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,080
Isn’t today your day off?

408
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,840
Don’t forget, I’m working for you today, Ms. Lalin.

409
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,880
I know, I know.

410
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,040
Please, go ahead and take a rest.

411
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,400
Please take care of the work, Dim, Tianhom.

412
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,600
You're welcome!

413
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,680
Come in, please.

414
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,520
Thank you.

415
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,840
I’d appreciate your help.

416
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,960
You're welcome!

417
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,640
What’s going on here?

418
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,320
You can’t dress like that on your day off!

419
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,520
Alright.

420
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,680
I’ll go change in my room real quick. I’ll be right back.

421
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,880
No need.

422
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,360
I’ll help you with that.

423
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,680
Swapping shirts and hairstyles should work perfectly!

424
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,320
Okay!

425
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Face ready, hair ready, outfit ready—

426
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,240
Let’s go grab something to eat!

427
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,560
Sure! Want me to call the café?

428
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,720
Nope, today’s our special day.

429
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,520
Let’s eat out instead!

430
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,160
Okay.

431
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,840
Yeah!

432
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,320
Wow!

433
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,360
Have you been to this place before?

434
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,000
Nope.

435
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,480
Well, while you were driving, I googled it.

436
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,640
Hmm.

437
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,400
So,

438
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,000
It’s good, right?

439
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Google says it’s great—

440
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
lots of 5-star reviews!

441
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,280
Are you hungry?

442
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,120
Don’t tell me you’ve never been here before!

443
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,040
Nope.

444
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,800
Let’s find something tasty to eat!

445
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,200
Thank you.

446
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,480
Lalin, Do you want some pizza?

447
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,320
Yes.

448
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,280
Here you go!

449
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,800
Dig in!

450
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,280
How is it?

451
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,440
So delicious!

452
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,920
You’re eating all messy like a kid!

453
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,560
Whoa, isn’t that a bit too sweet?

454
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,600
Well, it’s dessert—it’s supposed to be sweet!

455
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,200
We already had the savory part.

456
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,840
Now it’s dessert time—to finish it off properly!

457
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,640
Here.

458
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,760
Mmm…

459
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,280
Super sweet!

460
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,320
Wait a sec.

461
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,960
How about we sit here and have a drink first, then head to the resort?

462
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,760
Come on,

463
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,880
Look! There’s a spot to sit right over there.

464
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,600
Alright.
Let’s go!

465
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,520
Lalin, have you ever done something like this—

466
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,040
Just doing whatever you want?

467
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,200
Nope.

468
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,280
Really?

469
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,440
I used to do stuff like this all the time when I was a kid.

470
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,120
It feels so nice—to just do what you want,

471
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,600
with no rules or restrictions at all.

472
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,920
Let’s do something like this again next time.

473
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,000
Absolutely.

474
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,880
I really love lod chong ice cream—love it so much! It’s super delicious.

475
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
Especially with coconut milk on top!

476
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,840
Yeah... once they put the bread in, it was like... mmm...

477
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,560
Ta-da!

478
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,000
What’s that?

479
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,920
Since your heart is full, your face should be glowing too!

480
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,920
What is it…

481
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,480
A face mask?

482
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,560
You’ll see!

483
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,680
Whoa! That crazy thief—how could he do that?!

484
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,000
So mean! Watch this!

485
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,240
Hello! What can I get for you?

486
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,800
Can I have a strawberry frappe? No sugar.

487
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,880
And I'd like a caramel milk tea with less ice.

488
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,480
Ahh... One...

489
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,480
Tuk, could you help out at the counter?

490
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,520
Oh, sure!

491
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,600
Jin, you can help out in the back.

492
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,520
Okay.

493
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,000
Can I have a strawberry frappe? No sugar. One.

494
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,000
and I'd like a caramel milk tea, less ice, please.

495
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,800
Okay

496
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,400
Any less you need?

497
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,680
Oh, so delicious.

498
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,400
You need one?

499
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,840
Yes. Okay.

500
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,880
Hi

501
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,160
Hi, we need this one. And eat here.

502
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,080
Eat?

503
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,840
Eat…here.

504
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
And I need one.

505
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,960
One piece.
This one eats this.

506
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,200
This one eats this.

507
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,760
Okay? This one eats this.

508
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,680
Thank you so much.

509
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,400
We can sit there? Thank you.

510
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,640
Thank you.

511
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,400
No, that’s the wrong spot.

512
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,200
Wow,

513
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320
There are so many foreign customers today—like a record number!

514
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,560
Lucky to have these two helping out,

515
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,600
Otherwise I would’ve been overwhelmed in the first five minutes.

516
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,240
It’s no problem at all, I’ve worked in Bangkok before.

517
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,320
Foreign customers are super chill.

518
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,120
I’ve seen them so many times, it feels like we’re already friends.

519
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,720
I just fumbles through it, learning from YouTube.

520
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,600
Like saying, Hi

521
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,440
Eat

522
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,480
Okay

523
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,360
Thank you.

524
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,080
Good, there are so many foreign customers in Korat lately.

525
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,280
Helps us get better at communicating!

526
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,280
We just speak as best as we can.

527
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,040
Whether they understand or not, who knows?

528
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
As long as we get each other, that’s enough.

529
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,400
That works.

530
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,280
Okay, then let’s get back to baking.

531
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,640
I’ll excuse myself to go bake now.

532
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,560
Okay.

533
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,760
Thank you.

534
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,360
Thank you!

535
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,880
It feels kinda quiet, doesn’t it?

536
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,400
Yeah, it seems pretty empty. Let’s check inside.

537
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,360
Seems like it’s doomed for sure.

538
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,200
I was thinking the same thing—look, there’s no one here at all.

539
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,440
Hello!

540
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,680
Hey...

541
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,960
You must be the new staff, right?

542
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,560
I’ve seen you around before.

543
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,480
Yes,

544
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,200
What can I get you to drink?

545
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,400
I want...

546
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,800
One latte with less sugar, and one regular sweet lemon tea.

547
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,440
Yes, sir.

548
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,440
Oh my!

549
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,760
That’s all the desserts you’ve got?

550
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,800
Or maybe you made them but no one’s buying?

551
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,800
Well, you know how it is—put kids in charge and it’s doomed to fail.

552
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,840
Let’s go sit down.

553
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,120
Hurry up!

554
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,240
Jin, what did that woman just order? Why is it taking so long?

555
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,200
She didn’t order much, really.

556
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,240
She just came in, looked around, complained a bit, and then left.

557
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,360
But she seems familiar.

558
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,480
I just can’t place who she is.

559
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,920
Alright, I’ll go serve this order myself then.

560
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,840
Okay.

561
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,760
Just wait and see, it’s gonna fail.

562
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,040
How far can it really go?

563
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,720
Look at this café—

564
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,680
They don’t even have any desserts to sell.

565
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,160
Probably can’t sell anything.

566
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,360
Pathetic.

567
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,560
Can’t do the job but still wanna act like a boss.

568
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,320
Showing off just like her dad, no surprise there.

569
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,640
Yeah

570
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,280
If they had let us handle it from the start,

571
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,640
This wouldn’t even be a problem.

572
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,560
Right.

573
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,720
Acting all high and mighty.

574
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,480
Just wait, you’ll see.

575
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,880
What’s wrong? Is something the matter?

576
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,240
No, not at all. Please, make yourself comfortable.

577
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,080
Oh, I remember who it is now.

578
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,640
I know who it is.

579
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,520
Who? Who is it?

580
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,600
It’s...

581
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,040
It’s...

582
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,040
It’s...
It’s...

583
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,800
The one person Lalin absolutely shouldn’t run into right now.

584
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,880
What? Why?

585
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,960
It’s the relative Lalin hates the most.

586
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,040
If they meet now, the resort’s gonna burn down for sure!

587
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,720
Let’s hope Lalin doesn’t come in today.

588
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,760
Uh-oh, something’s up.

589
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,920
What’s wrong?

590
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
You look like you’ve seen a ghost.

591
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,920
What I’m dealing with right now is even worse than a ghost.

592
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,560
What are you talking about?

593
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,360
Nothing.

594
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,520
Just had a bunch of customers this morning, so I’m a little out of it.

595
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,640
Well, that’s good—it means we’ll get rich!

596
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,600
We need to block Ms.Lalin’s line of sight.

597
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,520
How?

598
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,760
I go wipe down the tables over there.

599
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,160
So Ms.Lalin won’t have to see those two relatives.

600
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,040
Okay, then I’ll go with you.

601
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,840
You're really tiny though—you won’t cover the view completely.

602
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,400
Alright, then stand side by side like a wall. I guarantee she won’t see a thing.

603
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,760
Okay, let’s go.

604
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,440
What are you doing here?

605
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,800
I was...

606
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,360
Just in the area,

607
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,080
Thought I’d check on my brother’s business.

608
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,600
Sorry,

609
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,240
But my dad passed away long ago.

610
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,600
No one considers you family anymore.

611
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,320
Watch your tone.

612
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,440
I’m still your uncle.

613
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,240
An uncle who stole his niece’s business?

614
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,480
Better not have one at all.
