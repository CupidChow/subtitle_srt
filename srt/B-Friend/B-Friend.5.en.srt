1
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,800
Where’s the respect?

2
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,640
Acting like someone with no manners at all.

3
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,560
I’m sorry,

4
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,440
But my parents pass away.

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,640
Experience has taught me to be kind only to those who are kind to me,

6
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,240
You heard me talking on the phone?

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,280
Yes.

8
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to lie to you.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,360
If there ever comes a day when it’s too heavy for you…

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,200
I’ll be right behind you.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,200
You don’t have to carry it all alone.

12
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,200
If I had to go through what Lalin did,

13
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,440
I don’t think I’d be as strong as her.

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,040
Moo-ka-ta will heal everything.

15
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,960
Go Go.

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
Oh! Mr. Tan, Mr.Ashi.

17
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,800
Hello!

18
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,200
It smells so good from afar.

19
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,480
Hurry up!

20
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Sure!

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm starving just in time.

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,600
Kanit is about to eat all the pork!

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,720
The grill is full of pork right now.

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,520
Which ones are cooked already?

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,720
Is there any left for me?

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,000
There's a whole pot full!

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,280
Go ahead.

28
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
Do you want anything?

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,320
Want some vegetables? Fresh veggies?

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,720
See? It's all veggies again.

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,720
Well, someone’s getting the VIP treatment!

32
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
It’s really delicious.

33
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,800
Lalin, I'm feeding you!

34
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
Dawan!

35
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,040
Oh, thank you.

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,920
Whoa! Why is this plate full of just vegetables?

37
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,200
Kanit, I have to head home now.

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,280
Why? You can stay a bit longer. You could even crash here.

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,880
No way. If my mom calls and finds out I'm eating stuff like this, she'll freak.

40
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,240
Wow,

41
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,240
Your family is really something else.

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Everyone, I'm heading home now.

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,320
Huh?

44
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Why so early? Are you really leaving already?

45
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,600
Kanit, you don’t have to go. I can go back alone. It’s fine.

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,640
Who said I’m leaving because of you?

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,680
I’m heading back because I want to sleep.

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Oh, really?

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,040
I’ll take you home first, then I’ll go. Okay?

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,520
See you all tomorrow. Bye!

51
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,360
Bye-bye. See you. Get home safe!

52
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,240
Weren’t we leaving together? Come on.

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
I'm heading off now, everyone. Bye-bye! See you soon!

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,760
Bye! See you tomorrow. See you, see you~

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,520
Bye~

56
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,880
Alright, now it’s just us. What should we do?

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,040
Should we keep going or call it a night?

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
If it’s more grilled pork, I’ll pass.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,120
I can't take it anymore, I'm about to burst!

60
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,800
This is basically an arsenal!

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,040
Honestly, there’s even more than this.

62
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,160
These are just for you to try, to see if you like them.

63
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
Are you serious right now?

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,680
I want to, but I just got started.

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,560
Huh?

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,240
Just started?

67
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,760
If this is just the beginning,

68
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,560
I can't imagine what it’ll be like when you get serious!

69
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,240
I just didn’t want to waste the berries,

70
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,880
They were growing like crazy.

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,160
I just couldn’t toss them.

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,240
So I searched online and tried fermenting them.

73
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,880
The taste turned out really good.

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Here, let me let you try some.

75
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,480
Mr.Tan should try it first.

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
So? Does it look good?

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,240
Thank you.

78
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,560
These berries are top quality.

79
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,320
Okay, go ahead and taste it, but...

80
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,880
Don’t drink too much, you’ll get tipsy.

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,800
It tastes really good!

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,920
This is seriously delicious.

83
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,040
It’s so good you could turn it into a brand and sell it.

84
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,120
Well, if everyone likes it...

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,200
Bottoms up!

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,920
Yeah!

87
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,760
Cheers!

88
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,160
That’s enough, Ashi. You can't take it anymore.

89
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,040
Alright everyone, we’ll get going now.

90
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,760
He’s had enough.

91
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,680
Get home safe!

92
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
Bye-bye, everyone!

93
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Keep fighting, guys!

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,360
Sweet dreams.

95
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,840
I'm going back too.

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,080
You can’t take it anymore.

97
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,520
I will walk you to your room.

98
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,320
Want me to help?

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,600
No, it’s okay.

100
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,720
Let’s keep going, Dim.

101
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,520
Yeah, let’s do it.
Cheers!

102
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,360
You okay?

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,320
I’m okay.

104
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,640
Take it slow.

105
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,600
The stairs.

106
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,080
Lalin, where are you taking Dahwan?

107
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,000
Taking her back to her room, of course.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,640
Let me see the key, is it in the bag?

109
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,000
And where will you sleep then, Lalin?

110
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,200
I’ll just walk her back, then head to my room.

111
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,480
Nope.

112
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,600
I’m not going back to my room.

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,080
I’m going to your room. What are you going back and forth for?

114
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,600
Are you serious?

115
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,720
Totally.

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,840
You’re really doing this, huh?

117
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,280
Lin, get up.

118
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,320
Be careful going down.

119
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,600
Help find my bag too, please.

120
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
I’ll look for it tomorrow.

121
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,120
Miss Dawan.

122
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
Where Miss Dawan?

123
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,400
I’m here.

124
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
Oh! There you are.

125
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
You forgot your bag.

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,480
Will you be okay getting back?

127
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,680
You alright, Tianhom?

128
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
Oh, I’m totally fine!

129
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
You sure?

130
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,160
Ooh, should we sleep under the stars together? They’re so pretty tonight.

131
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,640
Miss Dawan,

132
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,880
don’t go!

133
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,120
You’re leaving me alone again.

134
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,480
Lalin’s room.

135
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
So cute.

136
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,520
Lalin’s cute too.

137
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,720
Hello.

138
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,440
Hey, how are you? I called so many times and you didn’t pick up.

139
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,840
Oh,

140
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,360
I was with Tienhom.

141
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,480
My phone was in my bag, so I didn’t really hear it.

142
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,080
Sorry about that.

143
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,160
Oh, I see.

144
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,880
It’s okay. No need to apologize.

145
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,320
Now that I know you’re doing well and not lonely, I feel better.

146
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,680
Okay.

147
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,120
Mmm.

148
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,520
Why do you sound a little off?

149
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,600
Are you really okay?

150
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,920
Umm, maybe it’s just early. I just woke up.

151
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Once I shower, wash my face, and brush my teeth, I’ll feel better.

152
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay, I’m heading to do my ward rounds now.

153
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,120
I’ll hurry back to see you, alright?

154
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,440
Umm… when will you be back?

155
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,040
Please come back soon.

156
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
Hmm…

157
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,600
I was originally planning to come back tomorrow morning.

158
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,240
But if you’re saying it like that…

159
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,320
I’ll come back to see you this evening instead.

160
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,480
Do you want anything?

161
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,800
No. See you soon. Bye-bye.

162
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,880
Dawan.

163
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,680
Dawan.

164
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,360
It’s me, Lalin.

165
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,920
Dawan...

166
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,320
Alright then, I’ll come see you again when you're free.

167
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,120
Thank you.

168
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,040
Hello.

169
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,760
What seems to be the problem?

170
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,960
I’m a director.

171
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,320
Which police station?

172
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,280
I mean a TV series director.

173
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,840
Oh, I see. So what’s wrong?

174
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,040
I’m a director.

175
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,120
No, I mean your symptoms.

176
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,000
What brings you here today?

177
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,600
I can’t sleep. I don’t know why.

178
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,720
Even though I’m really tired, I just can’t fall asleep.

179
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,160
Are you under a lot of stress?

180
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,960
Yeah, kind of. Some work stuff.

181
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,360
Are you eating normally?

182
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,560
Yes, three meals a day.

183
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,440
Do you have headaches?

184
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, when I wake up.

185
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,080
Ah, morning headaches.

186
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Yes.

187
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,000
Do you get stressed on set with the actors?

188
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,800
Sometimes, yes.

189
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,040
Sometimes the actors do well, sometimes not so much.

190
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,920
So yeah, I get a little stressed.

191
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,600
Sounds like mild stress.

192
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,960
Right.

193
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,040
Do you normally like to exercise?

194
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,280
Not at all, doctor. I work every single day.

195
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,280
Okay, here’s what I’ll do, I’ll prescribe you some vitamins.

196
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,320
And a basic exercise plan.

197
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,600
Exercise helps your body and mind relax.

198
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,080
Make sure you get plenty of rest.

199
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,080
And come see me again next week.

200
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,840
I have to come back next week?

201
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,680
Come on,

202
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,400
I want to see you.

203
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,520
I’ll get going now, Thank you.

204
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,880
It’s probably nothing.

205
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,440
I hope you're right.

206
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,080
You saw what my relatives were like yesterday, didn’t you?

207
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,840
I’m afraid that if they find out about this…

208
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,640
Lalin might get dragged into trouble.

209
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,360
That day hasn’t come yet. Don’t overthink it.

210
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,560
You’ll just stress yourself out for nothing.

211
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,800
I can’t help it.

212
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,520
Lalin’s happiness…

213
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,480
I’m okay with anything, really.

214
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,440
You know, on the outside, Lalin might seem strong and capable…

215
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,280
But deep down, she’s really fragile.

216
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,680
They say people in love always look happy, right?

217
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,840
Whether it’s short-term or long-term, it’s happiness all the same.

218
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,400
Lalin’s super capable, she’ll find a way, no matter what.

219
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,360
You don’t need to worry, Dim.

220
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,880
Anyway, where’s that thing you wanted my help with?

221
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
Over there.

222
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,080
That way? Come on, let’s go.

223
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,840
You’re really hardworking, huh.

224
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,760
One of our most popular menu items is...

225
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,960
This one right here, our basque burnt cheesecake.

226
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,400
It's especially popular among cheesecake lovers.

227
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,040
It has a soft, smooth texture and a perfectly balanced flavor.

228
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,120
Oh! Lalin.

229
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,080
Another best-seller lately is...

230
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,160
It’s our seasonal fruit cake.

231
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,040
Specifically, it’s a marian plum cake.

232
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,800
It’s delicious too, really well-balanced in flavor.

233
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,040
Which one would you like to try?

234
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,120
How about the basque burnt cheesecake?

235
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,280
What? I haven’t even ordered yet.

236
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,480
For you, no need to order anymore, right?

237
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,000
I already know what you like and don’t like.

238
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,720
I can read you just by looking into your eyes,

239
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,400
Better than family even.

240
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
That’s impressive.

241
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,640
If you know me this well, why don’t we just date and be done with it?

242
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
If you had said that back then,

243
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,600
I would’ve jumped at the chance.

244
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,320
But now I'm all stuck-up!

245
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,080
No way!

246
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,640
Why? Do you have a sweetheart now?

247
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,720
You didn’t say anything.

248
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,120
No, I don’t.

249
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,680
But... come on, we’re way too close already.

250
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,760
If we really became a couple and ended up breaking up one day...

251
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,280
We’d lose all the good things we have now.

252
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,120
That’s true. But I really like what we have right now.

253
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,520
Like, whenever I’m upset,

254
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,000
you’re always there, my safe zone.

255
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,000
Without you, I’d have no one left.

256
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Don’t say that.

257
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
Everyone wants to talk to you.

258
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
You’re the one who won’t open up to them.

259
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,760
So... you came here because something’s bothering you, right?

260
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,160
I’m just a bit confused about my feelings.

261
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,240
Wait.

262
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,560
your feelings, or her feelings?

263
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,520
her feelings.

264
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,960
Why? Everything seemed fine yesterday, didn’t it?

265
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,720
Looked pretty happy.

266
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:04,560
Yeah, but today just feels different from yesterday.

267
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,520
Sometimes she acts like she doesn’t even know me.

268
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,600
Like we’ve never even talked.

269
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,800
But then later, she acts like nothing’s wrong again.

270
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,560
She starts being sweet again, just like before.

271
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,320
What’s going on, Kanit? I’m so confused.

272
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,800
I get it.

273
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,760
But...

274
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,760
Honestly, the only one who can sort this out is you, Lalin.

275
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,440
You have to ask yourself what you really feel.

276
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,520
No matter what, you’ve still got me.

277
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,920
You can always come talk to me.

278
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,560
For now, drink your matcha, alright?

279
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,920
Okay.

280
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,360
Kanit’s matcha.

281
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,280
It’s always good.

282
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,960
So refreshing, perfectly made for me.

283
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,040
Thank you.

284
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,560
Smile a little.

285
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,080
There it is.

286
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,440
Give me another one.

287
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,320
Just a cup of your matcha and I’m already smiling.

288
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,120
Kanit’s matcha.

289
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,320
Hey, Jin. You’ve got a call coming in.

290
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,680
It’s okay. Just leave it.

291
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,200
Hey, looks like they’re not gonna stop anytime soon.

292
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,840
Go on, Jin. There aren’t many customers right now.

293
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,880
Just take the call. It’s fine, really.

294
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
Don’t work too hard, Jin.

295
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,880
You’re already making me look bad, you know!

296
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,200
Jin.

297
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,040
Yes, Kuea?

298
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,800
Someone’s here to see you. He’s out front. Said his name is Jean.

299
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,920
What?! Oh no!

300
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,240
Som, can you cover for me for a bit? I’ll be right back.

301
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,480
Sure!

302
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,360
But who is it, Kuea?

303
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,680
No idea. Just know it’s a guy.

304
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,880
I knew it! Jin totally has a boyfriend!

305
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,480
So many calls just now, and she didn’t answer any of them.

306
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,760
Wow, got a boyfriend now and didn’t tell friends.

307
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,240
Is he handsome?

308
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,040
Nothing special.

309
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,840
I’m heading back to work.

310
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
Where are you right now?

311
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,760
Why didn’t you answer?

312
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,640
Whoa,

313
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,320
Jin! What the heck?

314
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,480
You just showed up out of nowhere, you scared me!

315
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,200
What are you doing here? Why didn’t you wait outside?

316
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,880
Come on, over here.

317
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,560
What? Why should I wait outside?

318
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,720
We can’t talk here.

319
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,400
No. I don’t want anyone to hear this.

320
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,880
You know I’m working right now, right?

321
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,320
So what?

322
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,040
I’ll be quick.

323
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,280
I’ll leave as soon as we’re done.

324
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,040
So why are you here?

325
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,760
Lend me some money.

326
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,960
Again? You’re asking for money again?

327
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,880
I just transferred money to Mom. Go ask her instead.

328
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,960
Mom told me to come ask you!

329
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,840
That’s why I rushed over here on my bike!

330
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,840
Just give it to me already.

331
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,200
Once I get it, I’ll be out of your way.

332
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,760
I’m not trying to mess with your work.

333
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,000
So how much do you want? If it’s too much, I don’t have it.

334
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,680
500 baht, right? If I give you that, you leave, deal?

335
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,040
I need to get back to work.

336
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,920
500? That’s nothing. I need 5,000.

337
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
I need to fix my motorbike.

338
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,520
I’ll use it to earn money with delivery apps.

339
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,040
5,000?! Are you crazy? Where am I supposed to get that kind of money?

340
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,120
I just sent Mom over 10,000 baht.

341
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,280
Ask her for it!

342
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,160
Are you not listening to me?

343
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,840
Mom said you’re the one to ask, okay?!

344
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
Don’t be stingy with your big brother.

345
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,680
You’re the only one in this family with a degree, a job, and money.

346
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,960
And now you’re living out here, all nice and comfy, on your own.

347
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,200
Look at you,

348
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,840
dressed better than anyone else in the family!

349
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,800
You really want me, Dad, and Mom to keep living like this, huh?!

350
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,280
Jean, you can’t say that.

351
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,320
You’re the one who didn’t go to school. Who are you blaming?

352
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,800
I got a higher education because I worked for it,

353
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,000
I paid for my own tuition.

354
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,320
- It had nothing to do with Mom or Dad.
- Isn’t that Jin?

355
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah.

356
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,720
And living out here on my own? It’s not easy for me.

357
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,200
Who’s that guy with her?

358
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,520
This doesn’t look good at all.

359
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,640
Let’s go get the others from the café to check on Jin.

360
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,920
Yeah, good idea. Let’s go.

361
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,000
So what more do you want from me?!

362
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Why are you talking so much? Just give me the money.

363
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,640
Come on, hand it over.

364
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
I don’t have any.

365
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
What do you mean you don’t have any?!

366
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,320
Jean.

367
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,000
Then where is it? Where’s the money?!

368
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,680
I told you, I don’t. Have. Any.

369
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,040
Hello, Mr.Tan, Mr. Achi.
Let’s put that aside for now.

370
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,680
There’s something I need Miss Kanit to check out.

371
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,040
What is it?

372
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,200
Tan and I saw Jin arguing with some guy.

373
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,920
And the situation didn’t look very good.

374
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,360
I think someone should go check on her.

375
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,040
Got it, thank you.

376
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,320
I’ll go myself, Kanit.

377
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
I’ll come too, just in case anything happens.

378
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,920
It’s okay, Took. You stay here and handle the orders.

379
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Som, you go with me.
Okay, sure.

380
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,600
Um, Mr.Tan, Mr.Achi, you can order your drinks while you wait.

381
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,440
Alright.

382
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,240
Give me the money.

383
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,560
- Ouch!
- I said give it to me.

384
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,520
Ouch! I don’t have as much as you’re asking for.

385
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,880
I’ve only got 2,000 baht on me. That’s it.

386
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,080
Take it or leave it. If not, just go back.

387
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,920
2,000? That’s nothing. It’s not enough!

388
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,080
I told you, I don’t have more!

389
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,360
Jean...

390
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,800
Hand it all over. Everything you’ve got.

391
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,200
Fine.

392
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,720
I’ll take it.

393
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,960
Now get out of here and don’t come back!

394
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,440
Jin, are you okay?

395
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,920
Are you hurt?

396
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,320
I’m fine.

397
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,560
I’m sorry for handling personal stuff during work hours.

398
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,440
Don’t worry about it.

399
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,560
Why aren’t you answering my calls?

400
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,800
Hello? Why did you just pick up now?

401
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,160
If you don’t even plan to answer or call me back...

402
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,440
If you really don’t have time for me at all…

403
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,920
Then maybe we should try taking a break.

404
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,120
Tianhom.

405
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,440
Tianhom!

406
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,320
Kuea, calm down, talk slowly.

407
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
The interpreter suddenly got food poisoning.

408
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,520
We don’t know what she ate. Dim’s taking her to the hospital right now.

409
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,640
What?!

410
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,680
Then I guess it’s time for me to bring out my skills.

411
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,000
I’m counting on you.

412
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,720
The customers are over there, right?

413
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,680
Yeah.

414
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,800
Okay.

415
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,480
Hello

416
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
My name is Tianhom.

417
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,000
Nice to meet you.

418
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,880
This place is called Baannok Kokna.

419
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,200
Can you speak Thai?

420
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,160
Yes, I can.

421
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,080
Whoa, you can speak Thai!

422
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,400
Um, here we grow organic vegetables.

423
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,200
We have green oak, red oak, and… an orange cat.

424
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,400
Uh… slower, please.

425
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,920
Slow down? Okay, sure.

426
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,640
We have green oak here…

427
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,840
…red oak…

428
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,000
…cos…

429
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,200
Too slow!

430
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,600
Too slow! Just speak normally.

431
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,480
Um, okay then, this way to the vegetable garden.

432
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,280
Follow me, follow me, come on.

433
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,720
Lan.

434
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,400
You’re in the room too?

435
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,240
Of course. Where else would I be?

436
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,400
Why are you back so late? Traffic?

437
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,480
A bit. I left the hospital late too.

438
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,560
Oh, here.

439
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
I saw Miss Lalin left this hanging on the door.

440
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
And she knocked just now too. You didn’t hear it?

441
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,520
Nope, didn’t hear.

442
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,360
I was in the restroom, so I couldn’t get to the door in time.

443
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,360
Oh, then maybe give her a call?

444
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,280
No need.

445
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,080
I’ll see her tomorrow. I’ll tell her then.

446
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,000
Have you eaten yet?

447
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,880
Not yet.

448
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,920
I was going to grab something from the cafeteria. Wanna come?

449
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,000
Nah, I feel sticky.

450
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,000
I’m gonna shower first.

452
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,360

453
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,320

461
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,080
What’s that sound?

462
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,400
Who’s crying here?

463
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,440
Lalin?

464
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,360
You go ahead, Miss Lalin. I’ll take a look at it first.

465
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,040
Hah, you all go ahead. I’ll take care of it myself.

466
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,320
I just want to review what we learned earlier, that’s all.

467
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,640
Oh, okay. Let’s go.

468
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,320
You can borrow mine.

469
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,160
It’s okay, don’t worry about it.

470
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Then I’ll just give it to you.

471
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,200
I was going to say, I actually have another one.

472
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,920
Is anyone sitting here? Mind if I join you?

473
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,520
Um…

474
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,120
my friend’s sitting here.

475
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,640
Okay, I’ll go then.

476
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,680
Oho! Who was that, Miss Lalin?

477
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,040
What?

478
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,040
Just… someone.

479
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,640
She gave me a pen to borrow, that’s all.

480
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,160
Oh, “just someone” huh?

481
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,400
Sorry.

482
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,640
It’s okay.

483
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,400
Do you like this book too?

484
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,960
Yes, but it’s okay, you can read it first.

485
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,360
Oh! Jin!

486
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,440
Oh, Kanit!

487
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,960
Oh, you two already know each other?

488
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,400
Where were you this morning? Why didn’t you come to class?

489
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,080
I had some errands with my family.

490
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,840
Are you friends with Lalin?

491
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,320
Yeah, I’m Lalin’s friend.

492
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,160
I’m Kanit.

493
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,200
I’m Took.

494
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,280
I’m Som.

495
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,920
And I’m…

496
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,000
Jin. I’ve heard about you from Touk and Som.

497
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,800
That’s me.

498
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,920
Matcha honey lemon.

499
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
How did you know I like that?

500
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,520
Thanks, Lan!

501
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,920
You even know my name?

502
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,920
Mind if I sit here?

503
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,240
Did you just finish class?

504
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,640
Have you been waiting long?

505
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,240
Not long. Today I’ll take you to try some delicious food.

506
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,600
Let’s go!

507
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,080
No wonder Miss Lalin didn’t want to go to the market with us.

508
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,760
She ditched us, huh?

509
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,560
Yeah.

510
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,400
Then let’s go to the market so we’re not just being a bother.

511
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,800
Aren’t we going to eat?

512
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,440
Yeah, let’s go!

513
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,760
Are you okay?

514
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,160
Yeah, I guess I’m okay.

515
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,640
Knowing you’re okay makes me feel better.

516
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,800
I’ll go now.

517
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,440
Thanks.

518
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,800
No need to thank me.

519
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,280
Sweet dreams.

520
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,120
Who’s out here in the vegetable garden so early?

521
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,400
Oh, it’s Miss Lalin.

522
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,680
She seem really happy today.

523
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,040
Are you picking the vegetables yourself?

524
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Have you not been feeling well lately?

525
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,960
I haven’t been sleeping well these past 2-3 days.

526
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,640
So I’ve been a little tired.

527
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,400
Are you feeling okay?
