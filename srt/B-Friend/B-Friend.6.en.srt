1
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,200
So how much do you want? If it’s too much, I don’t have it.

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,880
500 baht, right? If I give you that, you leave, deal?

3
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
I need to get back to work.

4
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,120
500? That’s nothing. I need 5,000.

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,760
Jin, are you okay?

6
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,960
Are you hurt?

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,440
♪ Will I lose you?

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,160
♪ I’ve been wishing on the stars, Can this "us" become something real?

9
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,960
No wonder Miss Lalin didn’t want to go to the market with us.

10
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,280
She ditched us, huh?

11
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,080
♪ I don’t think I can just be your friend anymore.

12
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,000
♪ My heart’s already thinking further ahead,

13
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,280
Looking good!

14
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,200
Cut it nice and close.

15
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,960
Who’s out here in the vegetable garden so early?

16
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,240
Oh, it’s Miss Lalin.

17
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,520
She seem really happy today.

18
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,800
These veggies look amazing today!

19
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,400
She might like this.

20
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,320
Are you picking the vegetables yourself?

21
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,560
What made you decide to eat here?

22
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
Nothing.

23
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,680
I was just too lazy to walk to the cafeteria.

24
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Why?

25
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,440
Nope.

26
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,640
You always eat in the cafeteria, so I was curious.

27
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,840
There’s nothing going on.

28
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,720
Yesterday, I came to sit here for a bit.

29
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,200
The weather was so nice,

30
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,840
I thought I’d invite you to sit here today.

31
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,280
So, what do you think? Is the weather nice?

32
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,000
It’s nice.

33
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,760
I like it. It’s so quiet here.

34
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,920
Why do you look so tired?

35
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,520
Are you still not feeling better?

36
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,200
Or do you have a headache?

37
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
Do you feel achy and feverish?

38
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,720
Not really.

39
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,760
Does my face really look that bad?

40
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
Do I really look that unwell?

41
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
Not that bad.

42
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,840
You still look cute.

43
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,600
It’s just that you look a bit tired.

44
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,840
Well, that’s a relief.

45
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,000
So, what was wrong yesterday?

46
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,600
Just feeling a bit down.

47
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,400
Then how about we go out today?

48
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,680
Sure!

49
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,440
We’ve been here for several days now.

50
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,880
We haven’t gone out together yet.

51
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
Yay!

52
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,920
After we finish eating, let’s go.

53
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,880
Here you go.

54
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,920
What made you pick vegetables so early?

55
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Take all with you.

56
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,560
Let’s see what you can make with them.

57
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,960
Bringing them to me, are you trying to flirt with me?

58
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,520
Oh, come on!

59
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,080
Just teasing you a little.

60
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,160
Wow, that’s a lot of vegetables!

61
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,560
Tian Hom is really good at growing vegetables.

62
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,560
Wow,

63
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,840
Who in my family can grow vegetables this well?

64
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,720
They call it having a green thumb.

65
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,920
Try some!

66
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,760
Wow, they’re really crispy and fresh!

67
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,720
Eat up, have some more.

68
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,480
Right?

69
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,160
Hmm, I’m not sure if they’ve been washed yet though.

70
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,960
Try some.

71
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,400
What’s this drink?

72
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,080
It’s the kale Dim gave me this morning.

73
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,200
Huh?

74
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,080
You can blend it into a drink?

75
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,000
Of course!

76
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,480
It must be so bitter. It smells kind of grassy and weird.

77
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,280
It’s not bitter at all. I added pineapple and honey.

78
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,800
I promise it’s delicious.

79
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,200
But I’ve never had a drink like this before.

80
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,800
I don’t even know how to tell if it’s good or not.

81
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,280
Have you tried it yet?

82
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,200
Not yet.

83
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
So you haven’t even tried it, and you want me to try it first?

84
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,560
Yeah,

85
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,480
You should try it.

86
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,640
If I taste it first, I’ll be biased

87
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,440
and won’t know if it’s really good or not.

88
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,720
Just try it, okay?

89
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,800
Blended kale juice is super healthy, you know.

90
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,920
It’s high in fiber,

91
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,040
low in calories,

92
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,040
full of vitamins,

93
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,560
and it even has anti-cancer properties.

94
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,680
With how much you work,

95
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,480
you should definitely drink it.

96
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,640
But it smells so green.

97
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,800
Well, it’s a vegetable smoothie,

98
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,000
of course it’s going to smell like that.

99
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
But I promise it’s delicious.

100
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,920
Come on, just take a deep breath and drink it. Drink up!

101
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,000
Huh…

102
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
It’s not bad.

103
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,280
It’s not as bitter as I thought.

104
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,640
It’s actually good.

105
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,480
See? I told you!

106
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,280
Mmm,

107
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,360
It’s really good.

108
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,560
You should add this to the café menu.

109
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,760
Customers would probably love it.

110
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,920
Really?

111
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,000
It’s delicious.

112
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,080
I’ll just drink it all myself, okay? Do you want some?

113
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,320
No, you go ahead.

114
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,600
No way, let’s drink it together.

115
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,240
It’s fine.

116
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,920
Drink it together!

117
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,840
See?

118
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,360
It’s good.

119
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,960
See? I told you it’s good.

120
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,320
What made you think of blending this?

121
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,600
Well, Dim gave it for me.

122
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,640
Did they mention our resort?

123
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,520
Hey, Dim.

124
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,080
What?

125
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,200
Look at this.

126
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
What is it?

127
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,240
Someone’s trying to discredit our resort.

128
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,080
You’re right.

129
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
There are three accounts doing it,

130
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,840
and all their profile pictures are cartoons.

131
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,640
These people, seriously. Nothing better to do,

132
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,920
unloved by their parents, no real identity,

133
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,240
yet they still post nasty comments.

134
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,160
So what did you reply?

135
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,760
I went and checked everything to see

136
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,800
if our resort actually did any of those things.

137
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,960
And now? Silence.

138
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,920
That’s good, then.

139
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,880
But…

140
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,040
This kind of thing isn’t good for our resort’s reputation.

141
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,360
Should we tell Lalin about it?

142
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,280
Let’s not. Anything we can handle ourselves,

143
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,800
we should.

144
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,360
Lalin’s been looking exhausted lately,

145
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,600
I don’t want to give her more stress.

146
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,440
Then what should we do?

147
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,480
Eventually, Lalin will see the posts anyway.

148
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,760
I think…

149
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,600
The ones who post stuff like this

150
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,720
must be those power-hungry old ladies.

151
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Just wait, if I find any proof,

152
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,480
I’ll sue them big time.

153
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,560
Good. Serves them right.

154
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,520
But honestly,

155
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,800
just posting stuff like that won’t do much.

156
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,840
Nowadays, customers are smart.

157
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,680
True.

158
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,200
I saw one comment saying

159
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,040
our resort staff gave terrible service.

160
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,720
But luckily,

161
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,320
some of our regular customers replied to defend us.

162
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,520
I’m really grateful to them.

163
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,360
And as for those accounts?

164
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,520
They’ve all disappeared now.

165
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
Oh, Lalin!

166
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,760
Dim.

167
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,520
I saw…

168
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,880
a lot of negative comments about our resort.

169
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
I’ll take care of it.

170
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,880
Don’t worry.

171
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,920
Thank you. I’ll leave it to you.

172
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,920
Where are you heading now?

173
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,720
I’m going to the restaurant.

174
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,480
I asked the chef to work on a new menu,

175
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
it’s a special menu for next month.

176
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,880
It should be ready by now.

177
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,360
Are you okay?

178
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,040
Do you want me to take you there?

179
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,640
It’s fine.

180
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,320
I’m off now.

181
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,920
I’ll leave it to you.

182
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,800
Ms. Lalin?

183
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,200
Ms. Lalin?

184
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,800
Yes?

185
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
These are the dishes we’d like to introduce today.

186
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,080
This first dish is,

187
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
young coconut and butterfly pea cake.

188
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,120
Recently, we’ve had a lot of butterfly pea flowers at the resort, which we dried.

189
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,960
So we created this young coconut and butterfly pea cake.

190
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,560
Umm.

191
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,040
The second dish is...

192
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,440
rice noodles with snapper curry,

193
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,560
made with organic vegetables grown here at our resort.

194
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,560
The third dish is belly pork wraps

195
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,800
served with our own special seafood sauce recipe.

196
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,440
Ms. Lalin?

197
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,960
Ms. Lalin?

198
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,400
Sorry.

199
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,760
Are you feeling unwell these days?

200
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,320
I just haven’t been sleeping well the past couple of nights,

201
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,720
so I’m a bit tired.

202
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,560
Would you like to rest first

203
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,120
and come back later to taste the dishes we prepared?

204
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,720
It’s okay.

205
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,960
Today’s fine.

206
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,520
Are you sure you’re okay, Ms. Lalin?

207
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,920
I’m okay.

208
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,640
Alright then, please taste the dishes.

209
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,000
This is really pretty.

210
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,000
You’re quite the shopper too, aren’t you?

211
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,960
But do you actually like this kind of pattern?

212
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah, I do.

213
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,320
But even if I buy it, I probably won’t use it.

214
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,040
I don’t even know why I’d buy it.

215
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,600
Then just buy it and keep it.

216
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,320
Oh,

217
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
By the way, the other day,

218
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,080
I saw Lalin hanging a bag in front of your room.

219
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,120
Did you thank her yet?

220
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,600
Uh…

221
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,400
Not yet.

222
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,760
Then why don’t you buy a bag

223
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,360
to give her as a thank you gift?

224
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,080
Do you think that’s a good idea?

225
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,040
Of course! It’s beautiful.

226
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,560
Alright then.

227
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,360
Let’s go.

228
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Today was so much fun, Lan.

229
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,960
Everyone,

230
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,120
I’ve already sent our grades to my father.

231
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,240
What?!

232
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,600
Did your father say anything about us?

233
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,680
He’s definitely going to scold us.

234
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,000
Please apologize to him for us, Ms. Lalin.

235
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,000
Apologize for what?

236
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
He hasn’t said anything.

237
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,200
ctually, he told me to tell you all

238
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Don’t give up.

239
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,480
It’s okay, I’ll help tutor you.

240
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,160
What’s that supposed to mean, Ms. Kanit?

241
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,760
Are you only going to tutor Jin?

242
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,480
Yeah, tutor both of us too!

243
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,840
Please?

244
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,040
Fine.

245
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,080
But if you keep calling me “Ms. Kanit,” I won’t tutor you at all.

246
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,960
Okay… Ms. Kanit.

247
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,040
Don’t call “Ms.”!

248
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,680
It is based on three principles:

249
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,720
universality,

250
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,880
expecting no return, and non-discrimination.

251
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
Jin.

252
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,360
Jin.

253
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,400
Are you even listening to me?

254
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,760
I’m listening!

255
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,760
Yes, I’m listening!

256
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Do you find it?

257
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,640
How’s it going?

258
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,440
The special privileges system for…

259
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,240
Not there yet!

260
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,880
Thank you.

261
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,440
It’s no problem.

262
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,040
Um, I’ll return the shirt to you later, okay?

263
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,160
Can I get your contact info first?

264
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Of course.

265
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Your name is Lalin, right?

266
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,120
Yes.

267
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,720
My name’s Dalan.

268
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I’ll bring the shirt back soon.

269
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,080
I’ll get going now.

270
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,040
What are you looking at?

271
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,120
Nothing.

272
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,200
Let’s go to a café today.

273
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Let’s go.

274
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,480
Matcha honey lemon.

275
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,280
Thank you.

276
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,280
Lan, is something wrong?

277
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,720
You look worried.

278
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,920
I just have a lot on my mind.

279
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,440
You can talk to me.

280
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,360
I’m here to listen to anything you need to share.

281
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
It’s okay.

282
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,480
I don’t want you to worry too.

283
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,160
Up to you.

284
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Do you have something urgent to do today?

285
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,320
If you’re busy, you can go ahead.

286
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,960
I can get home by myself.

287
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400
I’ll head off now.

288
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,200
Let’s meet up again when we’re free.

289
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,240
Could you stay a bit longer?

290
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,640
Can you tell me what’s on your mind?

291
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
Maybe you’ll feel better.

292
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,720
Well, here’s what happened…

293
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,040
I washed it and brought it back.

294
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,640
Thank you so much, Lalin.

295
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,040
It was nothing, really. Don’t worry about it.

296
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,080
Can I treat you to a meal to say thank you?

297
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
It’s okay.

298
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
I’m going to meet a friend now.

299
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
If you’re free sometime,

300
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,440
I’d really like to treat you to a meal as thanks.

301
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,920
Alright,

302
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,880
I’ll get going now.

303
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Okay.

304
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,800
Bye-bye!

305
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,840
What?

306
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,480
Who were you just talking to?

307
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,800
Just a junior student.

308
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,200
She borrowed a shirt from me, and she just returned it.

309
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,360
Wait, how come I didn’t know anything about this?

310
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,680
Yeah, I didn’t know either.

311
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,640
Are we missing something here?

312
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,320
Missing what?

313
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,880
I just let him borrow a shirt, that’s all.

314
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,880
Just a shirt… or was there something else?

315
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,200
Som!

316
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,040
Just teasing you, Ms.Lalin.

317
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,160
Have you eaten yet, Ms.Lalin?

318
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,520
Should I go buy you something?

319
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,880
It’s okay, I’m not hungry yet.

320
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,000
What are you all staring at?

321
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,480
So suspicious.

322
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,640
You’re all being ridiculous.

323
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,440
What do you think of me?

324
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,080
I said there’s nothing going on, and there really isn’t.

325
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,640
Got it?

326
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,160
♪ No matter what happens,

327
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,240

328

00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,280

00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,480
♪ Love doesn’t need a definition,

331
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,680
♪ all you know is I’ll do everything for you.

332
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,920
♪ Though time may change,

333
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,440

♪ This one word, love.

335
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,240
♪ I give to you with all my heart.

336
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,120
Are you okay?

337
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,840
Yes.

338
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,400
Can I ask you something?

339
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,880
Were you the person from yesterday?

340
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,560
Yes.

341
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,720
That’s a relief.

342
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,080
Do you come here often?

343
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,120
I do.

344
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,680
I like the atmosphere here.

345
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,920
It’s quiet and peaceful.

346
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,640
It makes me feel at ease.

347
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,720
Everyone who comes here likes it for the same reasons.

348
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,720
But I just got here.

349
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,040
The moment I arrived,

350
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,640
I fell in love with this place.

351
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,240
Really?

352
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,720
I come here a lot too,

353
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,240
but every time I do…

354
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,720
I end up crying.

355
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,320
I don’t know why.

356
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,280
I don’t even understand myself.

357
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,160
Maybe...

358
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,320
you have something weighing on your mind?

359
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,560
Yes.

360
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,080
This place is so calm and quiet…

361
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,920
whenever I come, everything just bursts out.

362
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,600
I think I should get going now.

363
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,120
If you’re still here,

364
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,680
we’ll probably talk again.

365
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,920
We’ll definitely talk again.

366
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,600
Good night.

367
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,160
I’m sorry, Dawan.

368
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,040
So, how’s everything going today?

369
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,040
There haven’t been many guests checking in lately.

370
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,280
But we’re still getting online bookings.

371
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,400
And on weekends, we have a lot of customers.

372
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,280
Alright, then please help me check the rooms as well.

373
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,640
Sure, will do.

374
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
By the way,

375
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,120
You’ve been here since this morning, right?

376
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,280
Have you seen Lalin come in for work yet?

377
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,520
Oh, she just arrived a moment ago.

378
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,240
Normally, she’s never this late.

379
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,800
It’s really unusual.

380
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,400
She always comes in early.

381
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,040
Sometimes, she even gets here before the other staff.

382
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,400
Mr. Dim is here.

383
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,480
Dim.

384
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,480
Yes.

385
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,400
The weather’s nice today. Could I get a picnic set?

386
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,720
Of course.

387
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,680
I’ll have the staff prepare it for you.

388
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,640
In the meantime, you can wait at the pier.

389
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,240
Okay.

390
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,480
Great, thanks a lot.

391
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,320
I’m counting on you.

392
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,840
- Of course.
- Thanks so much.

393
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,480
These two are really sweet together.

394
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,640
Oh! That flower is so pretty.

395
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,360
The yellow one.

396
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,040
This one?

397
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,200
How did you get it?

398
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Well?

399
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,680
It’s adorable.

400
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,120
Here’s your drink, Mr. Tan, Mr. Achi.

401
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,480
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

402
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,520
Thank you so much, Tianhom.

403
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,480
Wow.

404
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,480
And here’s your cake.

405
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,160
Oh, thank you!

406
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,240
Enjoy your meal.

407
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,600
Will do!

408
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,760
Let’s go.

409
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,840
Mr. Tan and Mr. Achi are so cute together.

410
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,280
I wonder when I’ll ever be lucky enough to sit with someone I love like that.

411
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,120
Well, you don’t have to actually be dating, right?

412
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,960
There are so many staff members here,

413
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,840
why don’t you ask someone to join you?

414
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,120
Ugh, that would totally kill the vibe.

415
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,440
what bad luck!

416
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,320
Hello! Welcome!

417
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,520
Hello.

418
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,400
I booking my room on email already.

419
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,960
Yes. Yes.

420
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,920
Can I go inside?

421
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,120
Inside.

422
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,480
- Yes.
- Check in.

423
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,200
Yes.

424
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,160
Can I go inside?

425
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,200
inside?

426
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,960
- Come on, let me help you.
- Boss boss boss.

427
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,800
Good afternoon.

428
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,560
welcome to the resort.

429
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,040
Have you book the room yet?

430
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,280
Yes,

431
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,560
I book already.

432
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,640
Do you have any replying email?

433
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,000
Oh yes we have.

434
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,160
May I take a look.

435
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,400
Sure.

436
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,400
The weather is so hot here.

437
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,880
Would you like to have any drink?

438
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,680
Yes. Yes.

439
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,000
Have Thai tea?

440
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,280
Yes, we have.

441
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,360
Two Thai teas, L size less sweet.

442
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,960
Two Thai teas, L size less sweet.

443
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,760
Yes.

444
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,920
Som, I’d like two Thai teas, please.

445
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,240
L Size, less sweet.

446
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,160
Thai tea, oh! Thai tea, okay, Thai tea.

447
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,880
- Oh, okay, okay.
- Here it is.

448
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,360
Well, you like it, don’t you?

449
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,640
Thank you.

450
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,400
My booking.

451
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,080
Lan, did you know?

452
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,680
I've been here lots of times already,

453
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,880
but I've never sat by the pier before.

454
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,400
Why’s that?

455
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,880
I used to think it would be way too hot

456
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,480
if I went outside the room.

457
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,480
So why did you want to come today?

458
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,120
The weather’s nice,

459
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,640
so I wanted to try playing in the water.

460
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,880
You’re crazy.

461
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,560
Where is it allowed to play in the water here?

462
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,840
Even if it’s allowed, I still wouldn’t join you.

463
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,480
I’m not a good swimmer.

464
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,560
Come on, let’s go.

465
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,120
Be careful, walk slowly.

466
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,760
Don’t run, don’t run!

467
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,360
Mr. Tan and Mr. Achi, Lan.

468
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,520
They are really sweet.

469
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,120
Come, have a seat.

470
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,640
Oh, Ms. Dawan!

471
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,160
Hello.

472
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
Feel free to relax.

473
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,400
Yes.

474
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,160
Sit down.

475
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,680
Sit carefully, watch you don’t fall.

476
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,480
I’ll just go talk about some work for a moment.

477
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,440
Hello.

478
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,400
Just that day.

479
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,080
So beautiful!

480
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,240
Better take a photo to keep.

481
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,760
Forgot again!

482
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,560
Oh no!

483
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,760
Dawan!

484
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,480
Dawan fell into the water!

485
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,360
Help! Dawan fell into the water!

486
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,600
Help!

487
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,520
Someone, please help!
Dawan!

488
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,640
Help me! Help me!

489
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,880
Dawan!

490
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,320
Dawan!

491
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,680
Dawan!

492
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,320
Dawan!

493
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,880
Dawan!

494
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,800
Dawan, come back to us!

495
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,720
Dawan, please be alright.

496
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,800
Dawan, do you hear me?

497
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,840
Dawan!

498
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,040
Dawan, come back to us!

499
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,320
Dawan!

500
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,560
Dawan!

501
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,480
Dawan!

502
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,800
Dawan, do you hear me?

503
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Dawan!

504
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,120
Dawan!

505
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,160
Come back to us!

506
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,680
Dawan!

507
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,240
Dawan!
Dawan!

508
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,120
Dawan!

509
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,160
Dawan!

510
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,240
It’s okay now.

511
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,600
It’s alright now.

512
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,680
It’s all good now.

513
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,320
Dawan, go back to your room first.

514
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,280
Come, let me help you.
Be careful.

515
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,720
Ms. Lalin.

516
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,680
Are you okay?

517
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Yes, I’m fine.

518
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,200
Then maybe you should hurry and go change first.

519
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,920
Don’t want you to get sick too.

520
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,440
Lalin, about Dawan…

521
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,960
I can tell.

522
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,240
I think something’s not right.

523
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,080
I know what I’m doing,

524
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
but if you want to talk about it, I’m not going to, Dim.

525
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,600
This is my problem, and I’ll handle it myself.

526
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,280
If you could handle it yourself,

527
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,600
you probably wouldn’t be sitting here like this.

528
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,560
This is my life.

529
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,400
I think if you say things like that,

530
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,440
But you’re hurting others.

531
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,080
Why are you talking to me like this?

532
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,520
I’m worried about you.

533
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,560
You’re the only one I’ve got.

534
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,480
I really sympathize with Ms.Dawan.

535
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,960
She must be hurt and really scared.

536
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,600
No, no, the shocking part isn’t that.

537
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,240
Because the person who jumped right in to help,

538
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,560
It wasn’t Doctor Lan.

539
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,680
But that person was

540
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,440
Ms. Lalin.

541
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,920
Huh?
