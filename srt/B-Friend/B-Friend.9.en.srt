1
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,709
Shopping’s all done?

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,042
Yeah.

3
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,626
Didn’t you say you were happy?

4
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,250
Why are you sitting here like this then?

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,918
Falling for someone who’s already taken

6
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:54,626
It's going to be sad like this.

7
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:57,250
Will you be my girlfriend for a day?

8
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,125
I’m gonna head out now.

9
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,876
Jin'll head back into the shop first.

10
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,459
Alright

11
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,209
So what’s going on? Spill it.

12
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:53,125
Let me shower first, then I’ll tell you.

13
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,918
Uh… Khun Lalin?

14
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:26,167
Where’s Kanit?

15
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,834
I’ll go get her.

16
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,918
Kanit! Kanit!

17
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,876
It’s Khun Lalin—Khun Lalin!

18
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,375
Huh? She’s here to see Kanit?

19
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,542
Yeah, hurry up.

20
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,959
Take care of this for me.

21
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,709
Huh? How could you drink this?

22
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,459
What happened?

23
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,834
What?

24
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:23,500
Hey! Don’t play dumb.

25
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,000
Why were you walking around together so early in the morning?

26
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,999
Don’t tell me that…

27
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,751
You knew?

28
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:36,125
Just guessed. So what?

29
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,918
Seriously, Lalin?

30
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,500
Keep your voice down.

31
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,667
Don’t want the whole world to hear, do you?

32
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,792
Lalin…

33
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:00,876
What’s going on between you and Dr. Lan? I don’t get it.

34
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,417
I don’t know…

35
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:14,250
it’s like…

36
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,500
some deep feeling.

37
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,751
I haven’t felt like this in a long time.

38
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,834
Come on…

39
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:32,250
You’re just looking for heartbreak, Lalin.

40
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:35,334
What are you gonna do now?

41
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,125
I don’t know.

42
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,834
Let me ask you straight

43
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,209
Do you have feelings for Dr. Lan?

44
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:52,751
Ugh, this is driving me nuts.

45
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,292
And Kanit?

46
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,959
Why you living with Jin? Are you dating?

47
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:09,500
No.

48
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,751
She had some issues with her place

49
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,209
So she’s staying with me for now.

50
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,125
She could stay in the staff dorm.

51
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,042
It’s fine. Better she stays with Kanit.

52
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:31,125
That girl’s super clueless.

53
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:33,042
She might cause problems for the resort.

54
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,667
She’s Kanit’s staff. I can take care of her.

55
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,834
That’s odd.

56
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:50,709
Kanit’s super possessive of your place— didn’t even let me in.

57
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,000
Kinda sus.

58
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:58,250
It’s not like that!

59
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,959
Just don’t tell anyone, alright?

60
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,375
Yeah

61
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,542
Lalin's is the same.

62
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,500
Tell Jin too

63
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,667
don’t spread this around. Got it?

64
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:10,751
okay

65
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,959
But...

66
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,876
If it gets too much, just walk away.

67
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,959
I’m saying this as a friend.

68
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,999
What’re you looking at?

69
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:17,334
Sigh Life.

70
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:26,834
P’Thienhom.

71
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,292
P’Thienhom.

72
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:40,292
Yes, so the renovation will follow the specs I mentioned.

73
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,500
Ah, I have a meeting. Will call you back later.

74
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,250
Is something wrong?

75
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,626
No.

76
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,500
P’Thienhom

77
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,918
I come to pick up the veggies. Are you done cutting them?

78
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,250
Not yet. Hang on a bit.

79
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,125
How’re you doing with P’Peach?

80
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:49,375
Still not great.

81
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,000
Still feeling pretty down.

82
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,500
What about you and Arm?

83
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,334
Made up yet?

84
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:01,250
Not yet. I haven’t had the chance to talk to her.

85
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,125
That’s okay.

86
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,834
You too.

87
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,999
Why are you lay on the table?

88
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,250
It's not your business.

89
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,584
I’ll go get the veggies. Just wait here.

90
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:15,417
What’s with you?

91
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,334
Doesn’t look comfortable at all. Why’ are you laying here?

92
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,999
Here, let me help.

93
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,876
It’s okay, Kanit.

94
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,709
It's okay. I want to help.

95
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,876
You done with the bills?

96
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:07,209
All done. Of course—Kanit’s not slow like Jin.

97
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:14,167
Come on, I’ll go instead.

98
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,292
But…

99
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,083
You go clean that table.

100
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,459
Fine.

101
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,667
You free?

102
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:38,959
Careful, that might break.

103
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,999
I’m telling you, I’m a pro at dishwashing.

104
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,792
Are you bragging?

105
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,999
It’s true!

106
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,542
Jin

107
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,876
someone’s here to see you.

108
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:56,000
Who is it?

109
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,417
No idea. Go check.

110
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,292
Okay, thanks.

111
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,125
Be right back.

112
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,459
P’Jean? What are you doing here again?

113
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:25,626
Mom told me to come get some money.

114
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:29,042
You don’t transfer money to Mom anymore, huh?

115
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,250
Can you go back for now?

116
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,500
I’ll handle it today.

117
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
This is my workplace—I don’t want to cause a scene.

118
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,500
Why be embarrassed?

119
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,918
I work too, you know.

120
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:44,792
How many times have you lied to me that you’d handle it?

121
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:48,042
Ever picked up the phone? I’ve called you like a hundred times!

122
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,959
I said I’d handle it today.

123
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,000
The customers are watching.

124
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,375
Let them watch.

125
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,792
They should know you’re an ungrateful daughter.

126
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,500
Mom asks for a little help and you never give it.

127
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,834
Never?

128
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,417
I just gave her 10,000 baht.

129
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,918
And when you asked, I gave you 2,000.

130
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:10,792
Now what more do you want from me?

131
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,876
I don't know

132
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,959
I want 5,000.

133
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,918
Get it for me and I’ll leave.

134
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,500
It’s mid-month.

135
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,542
Where am I supposed to get that?

136
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh perfect—your boss is here.

137
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,500
I’ll just ask for an advance.

138
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:37,542
Madam, my sister wants to get a 5,000 baht cash advance.

139
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,375
Cash only, no transfers.

140
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,584
Hey, that’s crossing the line.

141
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:45,876
You know saying that not only gets you no money

142
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,584
Jin also won't get a job.

143
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:48,751
So what?

144
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,083
I want 5,000.

145
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,459
You get it for me

146
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,667
I’ll leave. I don’t even wanna be here long.

147
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,375
Jin doesn’t have it.

148
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,918
Just go.

149
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:04,000
You gonna walk out peacefully or should I call security?

150
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,834
Fine.

151
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,334
I knew you wouldn’t give it to me.

152
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,959
Hey, Jin.

153
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,375
So stingy.

154
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,375
Stingy people deserve this.

155
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,751
You’re going too far!

156
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,334
This is a workplace, not your house!

157
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,542
I know, I’m not a kid.

158
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,417
I got my revenge.

159
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,542
I’m out.

160
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,209
And don’t forget to transfer me the money!

161
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:23,792
Jin…

162
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:28,959
Tuk, Som, please help get the place back in order ASAP.

163
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,792
I'll take you home?

164
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:31,876
Okay.

165
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,709
Come on, Jin. Let’s go home.

166
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,667
Ignore the others. Let’s head to the car.

167
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,125
Thanks.

168
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,167
Let’s hurry and clean up the shop.

169
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:25,834
Som, Tuk, are you okay?

170
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,584
We’re fine, Khun Lalin.

171
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:36,626
I was with a customer—didn’t think it’d turn into such a big deal.

172
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,083
It’s okay, Khun Lalin

173
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,167
What about Jin and Kanit?

174
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,000
Kanit took her home.

175
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,083
Just a little bit here

176
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,542
Hmm, just a little bit more.

177
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,042
Here, let me wipe it for you.

178
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,125
You’re all okay, right?

179
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,792
we are alright.

180
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,626
That was intense.

181
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,209
Just a little bit.

182
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,999
How’s everyone doing?

183
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,918
Dawan and Dr. Lan rushed over when we heard.

184
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,250
Have you reported to the police yet?

185
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,542
Not yet.

186
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,959
Should I go and report it to the police first?

187
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,167
Lalin, go to the police station first. Lan will go with you.

188
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,667
Dawan, wait for me at the room, okay?

189
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:15,042
Sure.

190
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,959
Wait, Lalin asked me to look at the shop for a moment.

191
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,292
Go report it to the police first and then come back.

192
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,167
Got it.

193
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,959
Go take a shower, alright?

194
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,999
Thanks.

195
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,042
Don’t overthink things.

196
00:21:56,667 --> 00:22:01,292
Jin! Jin!

197
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,626
Jin!

198
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,626
Jin!

199
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,792
Why’d you do that?

200
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:07,584
Why would you try something like that?

201
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,999
I was just… sad.

202
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,209
Don’t ever think like that again.

203
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,459
I wasn’t trying suicide.

204
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:47,751
I just wanted to go into the water, clear my head.

205
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,209
Well, I’m here now.

206
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,918
Jin, anything from class you didn’t get today?

207
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,876
You can ask me.

208
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:47,999
I got it.

209
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:51,667
You sure “got it” means you really got it?

210
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:54,334
Yeah, really.

211
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:58,209
Thanks for always helping me review stuff.

212
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:01,500
My grades have been improving all because of you.

213
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:06,584
So… have you thought about what you’ll do after graduation?

214
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:11,209
Probably go back and work with Khun Lalin.

215
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,709
It’s close to home, and also…

216
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,500
I want to repay her family.

217
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,876
They helped me so much—supported my studies and everything.

218
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:24,083
What about you? Where will you work after graduation?

219
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:28,042
Probably here in Bangkok.

220
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:31,834
we’ll still see each other?

221
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,999
Of course. Bangkok and Khao Yai aren’t far at all.

222
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,542
Let’s go for a walk.

223
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:43,667
Bright?

224
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:46,000
Kanit?

225
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:49,542
You study here?

226
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:53,292
Yeah, almost done. Just met you here

227
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,792
But at least we ran into each other.

228
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,083
Where’re you going?

229
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,999
Just for a walk.

230
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:05,042
But never mind that—wanna grab a bite and catch up?

231
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:06,500
Sure.

232
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:16,417
I think she probably forgot she made plans with you.

233
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,083
No way, she didn’t forget.

234
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,918
P’Lalin never goes back on her word.

235
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,375
Never in the past

236
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,584
It doesn't mean that you won't break your promise.

237
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:29,083
Are you gonna contradict me on everything?

238
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:29,999
No.

239
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,250
If you’d stay in reality, I wouldn’t have to.

240
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:37,834
But seriously… it’s been 3 years. Are you crazy?

241
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,667
You’ve liked her all on your own this whole time.

242
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,375
How can you put up with that? I don’t get you at all.

243
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:46,542
You wouldn’t get it. You’ve never been in love.

244
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,999
Who says? Who says I’ve never been in love?

245
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:53,375
I’ve been hurt by love so bad, I don’t want it anymore.

246
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:58,334
I just don’t want you to get hurt the way I did.

247
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:02,125
Okay… but then why don’t you try to find someone new?

248
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:06,125
No. I don’t want to go through that again.

249
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:13,584
You’re scared of getting hurt, so you don’t let anyone in.

250
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:16,999
Come on, Linlin. You’re super cute.

251
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:19,709
Just try falling in love again.

252
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:23,334
I’m not ready. I’m good like this.

253
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:25,542
Sure.

254
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,626
Go home? are you gonna wait till the library close?

255
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,334
I can wait. You can go ahead.

256
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:37,083
Thanks for staying with me.

257
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,626
Yes, P’Lalin.

258
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,959
Dalan

259
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:53,709
I can’t make it today.

260
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:55,834
I’m really sorry.

261
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,000
Is something wrong, P’Lalin?

262
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,500
Where are you right now?

263
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,792
Do you want me to come see you?

264
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:18,626
Linlin, I’m heading out.

265
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:21,834
Why are you crying?

266
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:36,125
Why didn’t you pick up your phone?

267
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,417
I’ve looked all over campus for you.

268
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,667
Who made you cry?

269
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:58,834
You don’t have to tell me.

270
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:44,999
Can you look at me with love in your eyes just once… ?

271
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:50,834
I promise I won’t ever hurt you.

272
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,209
What’s your name?

273
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,876
Jin.

274
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:19,584
Jin

275
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:21,334
do you want something to eat? I’ll order for you.

276
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:23,751
Anything’s fine.

277
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:29,876
This is the hardest answer to give.

278
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:32,626
Because we don't know what the respondent wants.

279
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:35,000
It’s fine, I’ll just order.

280
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,792
Then I’ll get—

281
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,167
You don’t have to order for yourself.

282
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:41,042
I already know. I’ll go order now.

283
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:48,751
I think I should head home now.

284
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:53,209
What? Jin! Then who’s gonna go home with me?

285
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:54,292
Well…

286
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:56,375
I know you feel bad

287
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:59,042
but we’re going home together no matter what.

288
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,250
Alright?

289
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:02,542
Okay.

290
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:11,584
Red velvet, and Thai tea with less sugar for you.

291
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:13,500
This is your orange cake, Jin.

292
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:15,083
Thanks.

293
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:20,751
Bright, you’re amazing. You still remember what Kanit likes.

294
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,375
Of course. I remembers everything.

295
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:35,083
Jin, eat. Bright bought it just for you.

296
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:41,500
And Kanit, you better finish everything.

297
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,792
If you don’t, I’m not letting you go home.

298
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,792
If I gain weight, I’m blaming you.

299
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,167
Blame away!

300
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,834
It’s been forever since we’ve seen each other.

301
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:54,626
You can punish me however you want—I’ll take it.

302
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,751
I’m heading home now, Kanit.

303
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:03,292
What? Jin, who’s gonna go home with me then?

304
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,209
Then… can I bring you home, Kanit?

305
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:10,417
Jin, you can go first. I’ll take care of Kanit.

306
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:14,125
See you, Kanit. Thanks, Bright.

307
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:13,209
Basic factors include natural resources

308
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:16,000
climate, location, and population.

309
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:21,125
Advanced factors include transportation, infrastructure,

310
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:25,709
skilled labor, and R&D efficiency, etc.

311
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:32,417
Jin, were you listening to what I was reviewing just now?

312
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,792
Yeah, listening.

313
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:42,959
Okay, It's enough for today

314
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:54,083
You’ve been off all day.

315
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,667
Is something wrong?

316
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:58,209
Nothing,

317
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:07,459
Kanit…

318
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:11,959
You going anywhere after class?

319
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,209
Wanna grab dinner with me?

320
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:16,292
Not today, I have to head home. Next time

321
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:21,125
Aww, come on. Please? go eat with me

322
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:24,292
I’ve gotta go eat dinner with my mom.

323
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,584
then I’ll head out.

324
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,250
Hey—Jin, where you going?

325
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,542
Ditching me again?

326
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:33,334
Okay fine, no dinner.

327
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:36,417
But at least let me walk you to your car.

328
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,667
Here’s your matcha honey lemon and pink milk.

329
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,709
Who said I want matcha honey lemon?

330
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:51,667
And who said I bought it for you?

331
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:56,834
Oh, I've never raised you with my friends.

332
00:35:56,834 --> 00:36:00,375
With him, you're such a spender.

333
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,209
Then what do you wanna drink?

334
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,042
Blueberry smoothie.

335
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:08,667
One blueberry smoothie, please

336
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,167
but paying for yourself.

337
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,959
Hey, I thought you were treating me.

338
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:19,459
already paid for 2 drinks

339
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,292
Don’t tell me to go home today.

340
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,709
Once I get my smoothie, I’m leaving anyway.

341
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:37,834
Are you mad?

342
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:40,918
I’ll treat you next time.

343
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,000
Mmm.

344
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,334
Hey, Dalan. Wait long?

345
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:08,250
I already ordered you a matcha honey lemon!

346
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,834
Show me the QR code, I’ll pay you back.

347
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,417
It’s okay, it’s on me.

348
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,792
No, I can’t let you pay for me.

349
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:21,375
It’s alright—I want to treat you.

350
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,500
Thanks.

351
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:29,125
Aren’t you let me tutor you today?

352
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:33,876
I actually understood today’s class, so I won’t bother you.

353
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:36,167
You deserve a break.

354
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,751
Drink your matcha honey lemon.

355
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,083
It’ll help you feel better.

356
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,876
Do I look that stressed?

357
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,792
Just a little.

358
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,292
Drink up, so you feel better. no worry

359
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:55,292
By the way, how’s your mom?

360
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,417
I haven’t seen her for so long.

361
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,918
Her spaghetti’s so good though.

362
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:03,876
She’s doing fine—still strict as ever.

363
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:06,709
Say the wrong thing and she’ll scold me

364
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:10,292
Can I come over for dinner at your home then?

365
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,584
What! Don't you see me?

366
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,542
Going to come over for dinner?

367
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,751
Oh, Jin. Why doesn't she go back?

368
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Is that Kanit’s friend? She seems a little odd.

369
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:59,209
Bright, don’t say that about Kanit’s friend.

370
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:02,167
I wasn’t. Why are you jumping to defend her?

371
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:15,125
Kanit, you’re still here? Where are you heading to?

372
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:17,751
Going home—promised my mom.

373
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:18,918
I’ll take you then.

374
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,000
It’s okay, I’ll take her.

375
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,125
Then I’ll go with you.

376
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:25,459
Stop arguing—my mom’s waiting.

377
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:26,042
Let’s go.

378
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,500
Are you going anywhere after this, Dalan?

379
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,918
If not, I’m heading back.

380
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:57,000
Not really.

381
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:59,667
Can I go with you?

382
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:02,709
I’m heading back to my condo.

383
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,626
Yes, I go with you.

384
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:06,667
Dalan!

385
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:22,000
What are you doing?

386
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:17,834
Dalan!

387
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:18,542
Dalan!

388
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,000
Sorry!

389
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:28,667
You’re like a little kid.

390
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:50,083
You got me soaked!

391
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,375
Thanks—but I’m not giving this sweater back!

392
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,417
We’re almost graduating…

393
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,167
I have something to say.

394
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:17,876
I like Kanit.

395
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,834
middle school student?

396
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:33,459
I think this necklace is super pretty. It’d look great on…

397
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,709
This necklace suits Kanit.

398
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:39,751
It’s cute—just like you.

399
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:42,292
Ughhh, that’s so cheesy.

400
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:58,209
Kanit is my first love.

401
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:01,918
The one and only in my heart.

402
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:08,584
My whole heart belongs to you, and no one else.

403
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:13,709
Ugh, ghoosebump.

404
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:29,792
just give it to you.

405
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:27,167
I really likes you, Kanit.

406
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:31,042
We’re about to graduate…

407
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,167
I scared of missing the chance again, like last time.

408
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:36,125
I’ve always wanted to see you again.

409
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,542
Where are you going, Jin?

410
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:49,417
What if I tell her and she rejects me? What do I do then?

411
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:51,334
Well, it’s better than not saying anything at all.

412
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:55,125
I really hope she accept your love.

413
00:48:56,751 --> 00:49:00,334
So… what you want to say is—You like me?.

414
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:08,209
I’ve been liked you since the day you covered my skirt with your sweather

415
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:11,459
Ever since that day

416
00:49:11,876 --> 00:49:14,876
I’ve never stopped liking you.
