1
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,208
<i>The essential oils we developed</i>

2
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,833
<i>are very comforting.</i>

3
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,500
<i>They are like someone you know,</i>

4
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,041
<i>and it's comforting and happy.</i>

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,500
<i>And even a bit shy.</i>

6
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,166
Digital lovers can be tall, slim,

7
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,125
strong with sharp facial features,

8
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,125
and smart, with a charming smile.

9
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,583
What? Who is it? Why should I tell you?

10
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,583
No way.

11
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,791
Why should I tell you?

12
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,416
Sure, I spray some before bed every night.

13
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,750
<i>To see if I'll meet him again.</i>

14
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,375
- Hello?
- <i>Xiaoxia, where are you?</i>

15
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,125
Working overtime.

16
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,250
<i>What? Still at work?</i>

17
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,833
<i>You remember I'm getting hitched tomorrow?</i>

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,541
I do.

19
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,375
<i>Will your boyfriend be there?</i>

20
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,625
He's not into it.

21
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,833
<i>I knew it.</i>

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,291
<i>By the way,</i>

23
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,708
<i>I've saved him a spot.</i>

24
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,875
Who?

25
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,041
<i>Him.</i>

26
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,583
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,166
WE SHOULD BREAK UP

28
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,083
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THAT INTO ME

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,625
<i>Maybe I'm better off single at the moment.</i>

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,625
<i>It's okay to live without romance.</i>

31
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,875
<i>It's been ten years.</i>

32
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,708
<i>This scent still reminds me</i>

33
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,958
<i>of him from time to time.</i>

34
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,666
<i>He was a part of my youth.</i>

35
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,125
<i>The brief time I'd spent with him</i>

36
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,750
<i>were the happiest moments of my life.</i>

37
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:23,833
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

38
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:29,458
<i>Whose heart, my heart pauses for you</i>

39
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:34,583
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

40
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,125
<i>As if you're…</i>

41
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,625
Hello?

42
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,583
Mom!

43
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,666
Why didn't you wake me up?

44
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,916
I didn't dare to.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,791
You'd have barked at me.

46
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,083
Wang Xiaoxia!

47
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,666
Steamed bun with egg is for Yuzu.

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,541
Don't nick it from him.

49
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,500
Got it!

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Xiaoxia is always such a brute.

51
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,000
So unladylike.

52
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,333
Since when do you fancy ladies?

53
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:21,875
Well…

54
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,333
No, don't. I'll be…

55
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,333
I'll be late for work. I'm serious.

56
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,500
Don't. Not now.

57
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,666
I'm running out of time.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,583
Late on the first day of school?

59
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,791
Not okay.

60
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,125
Wait up.

61
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
Is that my breakfast?

62
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,541
<i>This is Yang Zongyou,</i>

63
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,000
<i>aka Yuzu.</i>

64
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,208
<i>Because he had a chubby face, like a yuzu.</i>

65
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,333
<i>Jump.</i>

66
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,166
<i>He always gets teased by me.</i>

67
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,958
<i>Turn into a butterfly quickly.</i>

68
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,000
<i>Yuzu.</i>

69
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,041
<i>He became very vain once he grew up.</i>

70
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,041
<i>And quite touchy.</i>

71
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,375
<i>His sore spot is his childhood blunders.</i>

72
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,791
- I didn't put on weight.
- Get off!

73
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,666
Fine, pull over.

74
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,458
You can't even brake properly.

75
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,041
Good morning, sir.

76
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,041
The outcome of violating school rules

77
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,791
is to generate electricity for the school.

78
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,500
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

79
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,291
Button up properly.

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,333
Button up.

81
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,291
Why did you change my ringtone?

82
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,250
I wrote that song. Well?

83
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,250
- I don't think it's sung right.
- What then?

84
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,541
It should be like…

85
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,458
<i>I…</i>

86
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,791
- <i>I don't know why</i>
- The heck you understand.

87
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,500
- <i>I don't know why</i>
- <i>I don't know</i>

88
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,375
<i>I don't know why…</i>

89
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,541
Yang Zongyou.

90
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,875
<i>Xinghui,</i>

91
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,958
<i>the most gorgeous drummer</i>
<i>in the Pop Music Club</i>

92
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,750
<i>and every guy's goddess.</i>

93
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,500
Group practice after school
at the student club office.

94
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,000
And don't show off your work carelessly.

95
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,250
That's a spoiler for our concert.

96
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,208
The goddess smells so good.

97
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,291
You're such a pervert.

98
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,916
- Says the pervert.
- Yang Zongyou.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,125
Come here.

100
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,541
I'll give you the new lyrics.

101
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,833
Xinghui, did you alter a lot?

102
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,750
Sure did.

103
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,541
Sorry, Jialing.

104
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,375
I'm thankful that you like me.

105
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,250
But I already have a girlfriend.

106
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,208
Ray.

107
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,458
Next semester,

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,250
I'll seek you out again for sure.

109
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,125
Ray.

110
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,250
Jiang Jialing. Are you okay?

111
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,166
It's okay. The next one will be better.

112
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,875
But Ray has a girlfriend.

113
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:13,875
Why did you profess your love for him?

114
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,791
Because I borrowed $60 from him.

115
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,291
How is borrowing money

116
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,625
and professing your love related?

117
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,291
Look.

118
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,750
If I get rejected,

119
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,750
it would be awkward to meet,

120
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,791
but I won't have to pay
him back if we don't meet.

121
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,791
What if he wants to date you?

122
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,500
That's even better.

123
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,708
Would he ask his girlfriend to pay?

124
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,333
Jiang Jialing, you're so smart.

125
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,125
How about I do that for my class fees?

126
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,791
You can't use this trick.

127
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,250
You've got Yuzu.

128
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,750
No one would believe
your profession of love.

129
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,791
How many times have I told you?

130
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,166
We're not…

131
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,250
Fine! Don't even think about it.

132
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,291
But if a new classmate shows up,

133
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,041
he might fall for it.

134
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,875
A new classmate?

135
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,958
I overheard our teacher say

136
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,166
that a guy from Jianguo High School
is transferring here.

137
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,000
Jianguo High School?

138
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,666
Jianguo High School?

139
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,250
What's a guy
from Jianguo High School doing here?

140
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,458
His household address
is registered in our school district.

141
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,708
His grades must be so bad

142
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,833
that he had to transfer here?

143
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,708
No, he's the top student there.

144
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,541
Wow, Jianguo High School.

145
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,125
He sounds like
a smart, straight-A student.

146
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,291
He's not just smart,

147
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,708
he's a genius.

148
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,250
First place in class.

149
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,166
First place in school.

150
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,375
First place in Taipei City.

151
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,208
What is someone like him doing here?

152
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,500
Sorry.

153
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,083
You idiot, can't you aim at all?

154
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,666
What an idiot.

155
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,416
I'll stay wet and sticky all day.

156
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,875
About time to thrash that monkey.

157
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,625
Almost.

158
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,708
Hurry up. Get out of the way. Quickly.

159
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,083
The teacher is coming.

160
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,666
Pass the ball. One more.

161
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,958
Nice catch!

162
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:06,958
What are you doing?

163
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,458
Is the classroom a basketball court?

164
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,708
Look at what you did to my shirt.

165
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,291
How dare you keep going?

166
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,791
Your shirt…

167
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,208
It'll dry after one session.

168
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,333
BEHIND EVERY SUCCESSFUL MAN
THERE’S ALWAYS A SPINE

169
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,291
Xiaoxia, you're so mean!

170
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,250
You said it'll dry in one session.

171
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,333
A married couple shouldn't fight.

172
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,750
Shut up. Who said we're married?

173
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,000
You're so dead. I'll give you a chance.

174
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,291
You'd better apologize now,

175
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,250
or I'll be posting these photos

176
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,791
on the online class forum.

177
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,333
- I dare you.
- What's not to dare?

178
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,041
- Give it to me.
- No way.

179
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,458
This is my cell phone.

180
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,416
Yang Zongyou.

181
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,833
- Delete them!
- Apologize!

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,083
What should we do?

183
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,125
I'd better tell the teacher.

184
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,416
- Don't.
- Mr.…

185
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,666
I've been waiting so long

186
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,208
for such an epic scene.

187
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,500
Come on…

188
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,666
Place your bets…

189
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,625
The minimum bet

190
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,208
is a fried chicken cutlet for Xiaoxia

191
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,666
and fries for Yuzu.

192
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,375
MR. YUZU, FRIES, HE'LL LOSE
MRS. YUZU, FRIED CHICKEN CUTLET

193
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,958
The fight begins!

194
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,000
Mr. and Mrs. Yuzu

195
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,708
are finally fighting it out!

196
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,375
Let go!

197
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,041
I want to see blood splurt

198
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,500
and gush out.

199
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,666
- What the heck?
- In your dreams!

200
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,041
Get lost.

201
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,166
Place your bets…

202
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,625
Why is it just fries for Yuzu

203
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
but a whole chicken cutlet for Xiaoxia?

204
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,500
Are you stupid or what?
How can Yuzu defeat Xiaoxia?

205
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,458
Hang on. Yuzu is a buff dude.

206
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,708
But isn't Xiaoxia called Mrs. Yuzu?

207
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,041
What husband would dare hit his wife?

208
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,625
Get lost if you're not placing any bets.

209
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,250
Scram. The others can place your bets.

210
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,958
All in!

211
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,333
This is Shrimpy,

212
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,666
broadcasting live at the scene.

213
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,416
Xiaoxia is trying to break free from Yuzu.

214
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,166
Yuzu has used Crab Grapple.

215
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,750
He's actually used
Crab Grapple on a woman.

216
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,041
Can he call himself a man?

217
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,083
Hang on… Will Xiaoxia lose?

218
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,541
Xiaoxia is fighting back.

219
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,708
She's shredding Yuzu

220
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,541
like she would shred a real yuzu fruit.

221
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,000
I can hang in there.

222
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,291
You can? Let's see if you can handle this.

223
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,250
No tickling!

224
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,791
The two of them
are intertwined like snakes.

225
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,375
This also symbolizes that their love
will be intertwined for life.

226
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,833
Let go!

227
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,916
Xiaoxia seems to be losing. What now?

228
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,250
Plan B.

229
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,166
Okay.

230
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,958
The instructor is here!

231
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,458
Who cares!

232
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,541
Xiaoxia is in a daze
upon seeing Cheng Yih.

233
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,708
"Tall and lean,

234
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,791
with sharp and delicate facial features,

235
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,958
deep and powerful eyes."

236
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,416
Quoting from the original novel.

237
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,000
Class, open

238
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:44,000
to page 58. Today,
we’re covering <i>Waves of Sand</i>.

239
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:50,791
The first line, "Outside the curtain, rain
patters; spring is fading." What does…

240
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:51,791
What?

241
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,958
Just now, thanks.

242
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,041
Newbie.

243
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,166
You hit the instructor on your first day.

244
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,833
- So cocky.
- Shut up.

245
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,041
Still chatting on your time-out?

246
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,458
Are you that thrilled?

247
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,833
Stand apart from one another!

248
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,083
Alright, let’s focus on the first line.

249
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:28,625
"Spring is fading" means that
spring is nearing its end.

250
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,583
It carries a sense of melancholy…

251
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,666
What are you staring at? Eat.

252
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,083
They are both guys.

253
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,541
Why are they so different?

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,166
Why aren't you eating?

255
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,041
These are all his favorites.
What am I supposed to eat?

256
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,166
Yuzu is here for dinner.

257
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,875
I only made him
one or two of his favorites.

258
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:54,958
What's wrong with that?

259
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,750
One or two? One, two, three, four.

260
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,916
These are all tofu, his favorite.

261
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,541
Not true.

262
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,666
I like them too.

263
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,083
Go get that last dish in the kitchen.

264
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,166
Yes, it's in there.

265
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,708
Go get it.

266
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,125
Wang Xiaoxia.

267
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,000
He doesn't have a mom.

268
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,291
No, I mean, his dad is very busy.

269
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,875
So, he's entrusted him to us.

270
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,750
Why are you being so jealous?

271
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,291
Mr. Wang.

272
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,916
Can you discipline your daughter?

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,625
Stop playing on your phone.

274
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,666
- Eat up.
- Wang Xiaoxia.

275
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,833
You're so--

276
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,041
I'm what?

277
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,625
When exactly

278
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,000
are you and Yuzu getting married?

279
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm full.

280
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,166
And the summer
leading up to your junior year,

281
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,541
you should begin to apply to college.

282
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,375
You won't have any time to make friends.

283
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,041
Your studies must come first.

284
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,666
<i>When you go to college,</i>

285
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,958
- <i>you have to…</i>
- It's a very thin needle.

286
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,666
White shouldn't feel a thing.

287
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,583
But it's been unwell lately,

288
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,000
and its immunity is down.

289
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,250
Its eyes also deteriorated.

290
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,500
So, spend more time with White.

291
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,500
Okay, I got it.

292
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,333
White.

293
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,291
All done.

294
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,375
You did great.

295
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,041
I know you think I'm such a nag,

296
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,791
Young man.

297
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,750
When are you going

298
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,583
to let your mom know you're here?

299
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,125
We'll see.

300
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,875
I wonder who you took after.

301
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,875
Anyway, if she finds out,

302
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,666
I'll say that I was
instigated by you, young gun.

303
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,958
And I have your signature as proof.

304
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,625
Right, White?

305
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,125
Fine… Whatever.

306
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,750
I can't talk you out of it anyway.

307
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,083
Grandma.

308
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,500
Grandma.

309
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,708
I'm home.

310
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,375
Grandma?

311
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,375
Yao Zhen.

312
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,166
Cheng Yih is calling you.

313
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,166
Cheng Yih.

314
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,833
Yuanbin.

315
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,208
You're home.

316
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,291
Grandma, I'm Cheng Yih.

317
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,625
Here's Yuanbin.

318
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,875
I'm Yuanbin.

319
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,000
He's Cheng Yih, your grandson.

320
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,291
Here, have some.

321
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,958
Have some tea.

322
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,541
You're going after Cheng Yih?

323
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,333
Why are you saying it out loud?

324
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,416
Everyone, quiet. Get back in line.

325
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,791
Annoying!

326
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,333
Is Yuzu okay with that?

327
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,250
What has Yuzu got to do with this?

328
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,041
My target is Cheng Yih.

329
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,125
Yuzu hits the yellow zone.

330
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,666
- Yellow zone?
- Yuzu is awesome.

331
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,375
Yuzu…

332
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,875
Guys,

333
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,208
the last arrow
to represent our class's honor.

334
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,333
- Wow!
- Another hit!

335
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,500
Newbie.

336
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,458
Watch and learn.

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,416
He's so awesome.

338
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,416
I told you to hold it well
and practice hard.

339
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,541
This is what awesome truly means.

340
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,708
Yuzu.

341
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,125
Shut up.

342
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,416
I've scored plenty.

343
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,666
You can have the rest.

344
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,000
So arrogant.

345
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,458
What are you watching? Hurry up.

346
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,291
Gosh, isn't he

347
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,750
too cool to win over?

348
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,750
Exactly.

349
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,250
How to win over such a cool guy?

350
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,791
Bubble tea.

351
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,458
Who would say no to bubble tea?

352
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,083
I'll pay you for this later.

353
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,625
Cheng Yih. It's for you.

354
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,250
I don't like sweets, but thanks.

355
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,875
You can have them.

356
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,583
Why have you kept the bubble tea?

357
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,291
He said he doesn't like sweets.

358
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,291
But this is the yummiest in the world.

359
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,708
Who wouldn't like it?

360
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,583
How will you win him over?

361
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,166
That means,

362
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,500
ordinary tactics won't work on him.

363
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,333
But it works on me.

364
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,750
Why?

365
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,125
Did I say I wanted this?

366
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,375
Mom.

367
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,208
Do you always know what Dad wants?

368
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,291
I do.

369
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,500
Hang on. Dad,

370
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,500
did you eat that tofu
because Mom gave it to you

371
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,083
or because you wanted to eat it?

372
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,750
I'd wanted it.

373
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,291
No way. You guys didn't talk.

374
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,291
What's weird about this?

375
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,458
Eat.

376
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,208
This might be quantum entanglement.

377
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,666
Huh? What?

378
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,958
Our parents have been married for ages.

379
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,083
After all these years,

380
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,458
having the same food and water,

381
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,583
sleeping in the same bed,

382
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,916
gazing at each other's faces for decades,

383
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,208
it forms a natural entangled state,

384
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,291
affecting even their DNA.

385
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,666
That's what they call

386
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,375
matchy-matchy.

387
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,833
DNA quantum entanglement plan.

388
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:17,750
You don't want this, right?

389
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:20,666
Isn't it so scientific?

390
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,208
I think that makes sense.

391
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,708
- But--
- But what?

392
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,208
Something's off about it.

393
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,291
Like what? What seems off?

394
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,583
- What's so funny?
- This is so weird.

395
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,958
Yang Zongyou.

396
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:32,916
How long is it taking you?

397
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,125
You're already 15 minutes late.

398
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,833
Okay, I'm coming.

399
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,291
Don't you think

400
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,125
- Xinghui seeks out Yuzu too often?
- Yeah.

401
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,041
Do you reckon they are flirting?

402
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,416
It's great if anyone fancies him.

403
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,291
That stupid monkey is finally taken.

404
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,000
Perv.

405
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,875
Let's not talk about him.

406
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,500
<i>My focus is on Cheng Yih.</i>

407
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,000
Why do we have to swap seats?

408
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,125
Shut up. Just swap with me.

409
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,333
But I don't want to.

410
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,041
What's this?

411
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,041
Xinghui's used chopsticks.

412
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,708
I'll be sitting in front of you now.

413
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:16,750
If you need help, just ask me.

414
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,916
- Oh.
- Okay.

415
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,666
- Another angle BCE is equal to α.
- Any questions?

416
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,458
- Find cosα.
- Can you turn around?

417
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,125
Ms. Wang.

418
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,208
Can you turn and face the blackboard?

419
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:34,500
Alright, here, side C is opposite angle C.

420
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:40,666
Side a is opposite angle A, and side b
is opposite angle B. What’s the formula?

421
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,208
C squared is equal to a squared

422
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,833
plus b squared minus two times the cosine,

423
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,041
two times a times b times the cosine of θ.

424
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:53,458
This is the formula
for the Law of Cosines.

425
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,458
That guy behind her,

426
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,291
why are you sleeping in class?

427
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,958
Come and solve this question.

428
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,875
The teacher asked for you.

429
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,416
7/25 square root of 10.

430
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,791
He's so cool.

431
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,583
So awesome.

432
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,375
You already figured it out?

433
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,958
That's the answer.

434
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,541
7/25 square root of 10.

435
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,791
- Well, isn't he cool?
- 7/25

436
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,875
square root of 10.

437
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,333
Wang Xiaoxia.

438
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,083
Where are Yuzu's chopsticks?

439
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,416
No idea.

440
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,458
He probably ate them?

441
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,833
Was he that hungry?

442
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,041
I'd better pack more food for him.

443
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,958
What are you doing?

444
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,958
DNA entanglement requires having

445
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,666
the same water and food.

446
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,958
Are you sick?

447
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,000
Come on. Let's eat.

448
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,208
Don't touch it.

449
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,125
What?

450
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,791
I'm packing my lunch box.

451
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,666
Why are you taking it into your room?

452
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,375
My mom packed too much food.

453
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,291
Do you want some?

454
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,000
Are you eating enough?

455
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,333
I have carbs, fiber, and protein.

456
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:36,875
What else do you think I need?

457
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,583
You need…

458
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:41,541
Aren't you sick of sandwiches already?

459
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,541
How about we swap lunch?

460
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,041
What's in this?

461
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:05,458
Is it snot?

462
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,208
It's natto.

463
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,166
Have mine.

464
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,291
This is so gross.

465
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,500
This is what they call an indirect kiss.

466
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:15,791
Don't be stupid.

467
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,291
If this is an indirect kiss,

468
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,000
we've all kissed each other.

469
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:10,958
Let me practice first.

470
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,333
What a small world.

471
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:14,666
Are you walking your dog?

472
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,083
Should I sound more lively?

473
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,583
Okay.

474
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,583
What a small world.

475
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,000
Are you walking your dog?

476
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,375
Why are you so loud?

477
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:26,000
Sorry.

478
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,958
Who is this?

479
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,375
What's wrong with you?

480
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,625
Peeking at my phone.

481
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,166
You're so stern.

482
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,958
I only saw a silhouette.

483
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:46,916
Hello.

484
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,916
Hi.

485
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,875
You're so cute.

486
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,583
Stop licking me. That tickles.

487
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,000
It normally isn't so friendly.

488
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,416
Really?

489
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,125
So, you like me?

490
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,333
What's your name?

491
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,416
White.

492
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,291
White?

493
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,000
I think I named a dog White once.

494
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:11,958
Hello, White.

495
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,416
I'm Xiaoxia.

496
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,333
Wang Xiaoxia.

497
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,541
You're cute.

498
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:25,791
White!

499
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,125
White!

500
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,291
White!

501
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,208
White!

502
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:30,750
White!

503
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:31,916
Honey.

504
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,208
- Darling.
- Remember to buy milk when you get back.

505
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:44,875
Wang Xiaoxia!

506
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:46,625
White.

507
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,166
Are you okay?

508
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,791
Are you okay?

509
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,333
Are you hurt?

510
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,333
I'm fine.

511
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,458
Stay still.

512
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,083
Your ankle is all swollen.

513
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,791
It might be a fracture.
I'll call an ambulance.

514
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,458
I'm okay.
There's no need for an ambulance.

515
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,250
I can get myself to a hospital.

516
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,458
Stay still.

517
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,166
<i>I think I named a dog White once.</i>

518
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,666
Its name is White.

519
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:33,625
White?

520
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,666
Are you okay?

521
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,750
I'm fine.

522
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,166
But you seem…

523
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,375
I always got
all bruised in fights as a kid.

524
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,958
This really isn't a big deal.

525
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:16,916
I can walk.

526
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,166
Just stay still.

527
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,750
Or it'd hurt a lot.

528
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:23,791
Right.

529
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,833
<i>Cheng Yih is giving me a piggyback ride.</i>

530
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,000
<i>Does he like me?</i>

531
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:39,875
<i>Or is it because I'm hurt?</i>

532
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,625
<i>Cheng Yih's back</i>

533
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,375
<i>is so warm.</i>

534
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,291
<i>And there's a unique aroma.</i>

535
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,791
Wang Xiaoxia.

536
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,791
What's that scar on your forehead?

537
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:06,750
This?

538
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,875
I hurt my head in a fight.

539
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,166
So,

540
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,625
I've got a tiny bald spot here.

541
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:17,208
I cover it with some hair on the left.

542
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,041
Do you remember who you fought with?

543
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,291
I was just a kid. How could I remember?

544
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:24,041
My mom said

545
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,125
I had fever from the infection
and was hospitalized.

546
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,958
The doctor said I had a mild concussion.

547
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,875
Thanks for giving me a piggyback ride.

548
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,708
Why don't you speak Mandarin? Fake ABC.

549
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,666
What do you want from me?

550
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,375
Aren't you ashamed? So many against one.

551
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,000
Stay out of this!

552
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,125
I'm visiting my friend. Want to join me?

553
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:12,958
This is my friend.

554
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,916
I visit it every day.

555
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,750
Its name is White.

556
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,958
White?

557
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,791
It has white fur here,

558
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,666
so I call it White.

559
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,291
You should smile more.

560
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,916
You look great when you smile.

561
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:32,250
Like this… Smile.

562
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,416
PLEASE ADOPT IT

563
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,458
Sure.

564
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:44,083
What's the matter with you?

565
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,500
You've been quiet all day.

566
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,833
If a friend

567
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,125
has forgotten me,

568
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,041
are we still friends?

569
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,750
You have a friend here?

570
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,666
That's unusual.

571
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,833
Does this friend

572
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:07,958
mean a lot to you?

573
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,208
Since she's forgotten you,

574
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:14,833
so be it.

575
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:16,208
It's fine as long as you don't.

576
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,041
But if I'm the only one who remembers

577
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,500
the memories we shared,

578
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,166
isn't it weird for me
to tell her who I am?

579
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,333
Just come up with a way

580
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:30,916
to help her remember.

581
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,833
I'll teach you.

582
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,833
White.

583
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:48,041
Who dressed you up so cute?

584
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,041
Well?

585
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,250
Do I look okay?

586
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,041
Looks a bit tight.

587
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:12,250
I'm almost 70 years old.

588
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,250
I'm considered fit for my age.

589
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,000
Yuanbin.

590
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,208
This pastor is so handsome.

591
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,583
Take a good look.

592
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,708
I am better than him.

593
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,333
Yes.

594
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:39,416
You are.

595
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:43,833
Let's begin.

596
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,791
Ms. Yao Zhen.

597
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,666
Do you take Mr. Li Yuanbin
as your husband,

598
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,791
to have and to hold,

599
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,500
from this day forward,

600
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,416
for richer, for poorer,

601
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,041
till death do you part?

602
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,875
I do.

603
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:11,750
Mr. Li Yuanbin.

604
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:13,875
Do you take

605
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,875
Ms. Yao Zhen to have and to hold

606
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:19,000
till death do you part?

607
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,750
I do.

608
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,916
<i>This is the highlight</i>
<i>of your grandma's life.</i>

609
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:44,500
<i>She'll never forget this moment.</i>

610
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,833
<i>You and your friend</i>

611
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,666
<i>must also share such a moment?</i>

612
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,458
<i>Just remind her about it.</i>

613
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,791
<i>It's that simple.</i>

614
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:09,791
Xinghui.

615
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,375
I've changed the chorus a bit.

616
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:16,875
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

617
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,666
No. The original version is better.

618
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,666
Right?

619
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,916
I also prefer the original version.

620
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,416
It's better, right?

621
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,666
I don't mind either.

622
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,583
Don’t screw around with me.

623
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,291
Okay, I got to go. Bye.

624
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,583
Yang Zongyou.

625
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,000
I need to talk to you.

626
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,708
<i>You and your friend</i>

627
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:58,291
<i>must also share such a moment?</i>

628
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,166
Hey. Come on…

629
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,166
Here's a chance to do charity.

630
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,583
- Only once a year.
- Charity.

631
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:08,750
Donate.

632
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,041
Do you use the air-conditioner?

633
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:10,958
Yes.

634
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,333
That's like killing polar bears. Get it?

635
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,291
- <i>Just come up with a way</i>
- It's killing!

636
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,916
<i>to help her remember.</i>

637
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,375
The ozone layer will have a hole!

638
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,000
What can $2 do?

639
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,500
I can't even get a lollipop.

640
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,916
What are you staring at?

641
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:28,708
If you think not using
AC can save polar bears,

642
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,208
why don't you stop eating beef

643
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:32,875
or ask cows not to fart?

644
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:34,083
You want to get thrashed?

645
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,583
What's the rush?

646
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,166
What are you and Wang Xiaoxia?

647
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:49,250
Friends.

648
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:53,166
Do you like her?

649
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,375
It's yes if you don't answer me.

650
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,583
We grew up together.

651
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:01,208
I know all about her.

652
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,625
Do you?

653
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,625
Do you also know about this?

654
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,291
How long must we wait?

655
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,125
What?

656
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,958
Young man, you're a busybody.

657
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,208
Do you know what we're doing?

658
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,583
We're saving Earth.

659
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:20,791
Wait.

660
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,708
Just give me a second.

661
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,208
What?

662
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,958
Smells great.

663
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,333
- Should we get some drinks?
- Okay.

664
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,083
Come on.

665
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,541
What a busybody.

666
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,833
Polar bear!

667
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:36,500
Hey, Jiang Jialing.

668
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,083
Jiang Jialing, we're getting drinks.

669
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,000
Come on. Let's get bubble tea.

670
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:45,291
She said she wants to order
some new green tea jelly.

671
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,791
Fuck.

672
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,666
Hello? Yuzu!

673
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,166
Yang Zongyou, where to?

674
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,708
Newbie.

675
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,000
What's wrong with you?

676
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:24,750
Why did you hit them?

677
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,791
Darn, you got beaten up?

678
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,000
Who would dare to hit you besides me?

679
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,041
Can't you talk nicely?

680
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,458
I was in a fight,
but I didn't get beaten up.

681
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,083
- Who? You look terrible.
- Don't touch it.

682
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,291
It hurts.

683
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,458
Hello?

684
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,833
All of a sudden?

685
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:51,875
Okay, bye.

686
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,166
Come on. Class is starting.

687
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,083
You swapped out my song?

688
00:40:58,791 --> 00:40:59,958
I got something new for a change.

689
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,666
Come on. I'll carry you.

690
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:05,916
Don't be stupid.

691
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,791
What if someone sees us
and misunderstands?

692
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:09,791
Come on.

693
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,375
He can carry you, but I can't?

694
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,541
He carried me to the hospital.

695
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,333
Why are you raising your voice?

696
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:29,375
Weirdo.

697
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,500
Cheng Yih is absent today.

698
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,583
This test is very important.

699
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,791
Can anyone take this test paper to him?

700
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,208
Sir, I can.

701
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,000
It's on my way home.

702
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,958
What are you doing here?

703
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:07,333
Why were you absent today?

704
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:09,250
Our teacher said this test is important.

705
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,291
What's wrong with your face?

706
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:18,250
Grandma.

707
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,500
This is my classmate, Wang Xiaoxia.

708
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,541
She's brought me a test paper.

709
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,000
Hello. I'm Xiaoxia.

710
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:28,833
I'll leave the test paper here.

711
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:31,291
She…

712
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,416
My grandma has dementia.

713
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,625
Don't mind her.

714
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,666
So, were you absent today

715
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,583
because you were
looking after your grandma?

716
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:44,000
My grandpa
is getting her medicine in Taipei.

717
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:45,791
I can't let her stay home alone.

718
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:47,083
That could be dangerous.

719
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,416
Last time, she wandered off alone,

720
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,625
and the police
only found her after midnight.

721
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,458
Where's Yuanbin?

722
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,041
Why isn't Yuanbin home yet?

723
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:58,291
Grandpa will be home soon.

724
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,500
Who is she?

725
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,166
This is my classmate, Xiaoxia.

726
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,041
No, I mean Yuanbin.

727
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,416
- When will he be home?
- Yes, Grandma.

728
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,750
Yuanbin will be home soon.

729
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:08,791
When will Yuanbin be home?

730
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:11,583
Why isn't he home yet?

731
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:13,333
- It's okay… Don't be scared.
- Yuanbin.

732
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,916
How about you call your grandpa?

733
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,625
I already did, but it didn't help.

734
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:17,833
She is only at ease when she sees him.

735
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,083
Yuanbin!

736
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,833
Yuanbin!

737
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,041
Yuanbin!

738
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:22,958
Grandma, don't worry.

739
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,833
How about calling your grandpa on this?

740
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:28,583
<i>Yao Zhen, it's me.</i>

741
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:30,458
<i>It's me, Yuanbin.</i>

742
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,291
Yuanbin.

743
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,791
<i>Here I am.</i>

744
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,208
It's good that you're here.

745
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:41,708
Good. Good that you're here.

746
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,041
<i>Okay…</i>

747
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,125
<i>I saw how heavily burdened Cheng Yih is.</i>

748
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:35,041
<i>His mom is always abroad,</i>

749
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:39,541
<i>and his grandparents look after him.</i>

750
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:18,750
Cheng Yih, there's
a unique aroma in your home.

751
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,041
That's lemongrass.

752
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,500
My grandpa planted them.

753
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,875
What a special scent.

754
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:29,833
Xiaoxia.

755
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:33,541
You'll have to scrub White gently.

756
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:34,666
Right.

757
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,833
Because it's in a lot of pain,

758
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,625
it might not feel well.

759
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,708
Okay.

760
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,791
Did you take it to the vet?

761
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:44,875
The vet said

762
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,666
it's a bit complicated.

763
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,666
He can't treat White here.

764
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,541
He did advise me

765
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:53,041
to send White up north for treatment.

766
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,208
That might be better.

767
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,208
Are you going with White?

768
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:01,791
I'm actually in a dilemma.

769
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,708
If you can't go with White,

770
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,500
won't it be really scared?

771
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:10,291
It's sick and in pain,

772
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:12,541
but being with you makes it joyful.

773
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:18,666
Right?

774
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,125
Yes.

775
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,333
Well done, kid.

776
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,416
You brought a girl home

777
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,416
while I was out.

778
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,333
All because you were away.

779
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:41,000
I had to watch over Grandma,

780
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:43,041
so she had to come here instead.

781
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,166
She's…

782
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,000
that friend you told me about?

783
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,333
Does she remember you now?

784
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,916
If she doesn't, she doesn't.

785
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:05,291
Are you actually bothered

786
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,041
because she's forgotten you

787
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,000
but not that

788
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,375
she can't remember you?

789
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,750
It's like how
your grandma forgets everything,

790
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,708
but she likes the smell of lemongrass.

791
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:19,708
That's why I've planted them everywhere.

792
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,791
I'm content

793
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:24,250
as long as she's happy.

794
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:31,833
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

795
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,541
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

796
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:39,958
<i>Remembering your eyes, heedless</i>

797
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:43,083
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

798
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:45,500
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

799
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:50,333
<i>Wondering if you mean it, heedless</i>

800
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,166
<i>Heedless</i>

801
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,000
<i>Heedless</i>

802
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:01,541
<i>Falling for you</i>

803
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:06,583
Try this.

804
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:07,791
It's really good.

805
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,250
It gets better as you chew it.

806
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:13,958
<i>Since then,</i>

807
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:16,041
<i>Cheng Yih comes and have lunch with me.</i>

808
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,958
<i>We…</i>

809
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,708
<i>slowly grew closer.</i>

810
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,041
Hang in there.

811
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,708
<i>I didn't think he'd be so thoughtful.</i>

812
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,875
<i>He knows what I like.</i>

813
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:44,208
<i>And he surprises me often.</i>

814
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:46,458
<i>It seems like</i>

815
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:50,000
<i>our hearts are also growing closer.</i>

816
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:09,708
HOW ABOUT WE SHARE THIS ACCOUNT?

817
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:10,833
LET'S JUST NAME IT LEMONGRASS

818
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:11,958
THE PASSWORD IS "WHITE"

819
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:14,166
I DON'T USE THIS

820
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,000
You got it?

821
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,416
Got it.

822
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:35,291
3x minus 2y is…

823
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,833
Calculate it on your own.

824
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,583
- I have to?
- Yes.

825
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:42,958
Done.

826
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:49,458
If the y-intercept
of a straight line L is 2…

827
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,791
Can I talk to Xiaoxia?

828
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:04,000
And he broke up with me.

829
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,166
Host?

830
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,416
Look at her, all heartbroken and in tears.

831
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,041
How can she host the show?

832
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,125
He just left like that.

833
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,500
Just help us out.

834
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:16,250
Hang on. How can I help?

835
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,291
I've never hosted anything.

836
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:19,625
You did.

837
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:22,500
You demonstrated aerobics to the school.

838
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:24,833
- That was in elementary school, okay?
- You were great.

839
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:26,583
- How is that…
- You were full of life.

840
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:27,583
No.

841
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:30,791
Please? Please host our show.

842
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:32,208
I love him so much.

843
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,750
Wait. Xinghui.

844
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:36,125
You're super popular.
You can host the show.

845
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:37,250
Who do you think I am?

846
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,250
How can I sing and host at the same time?

847
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,958
I can't juggle both tasks, okay?

848
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,875
We've been working so hard

849
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,625
and so long for this. Look at my fingers.

850
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,208
I practiced till they bled.

851
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,083
Show me.

852
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:51,583
How can you bear

853
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:53,708
to let our show get canceled?

854
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,500
Shut up. Show me the program.

855
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:59,083
From 7:10 p.m. to 7:20 p.m.

856
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:00,875
"When You Left".

857
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,166
- He left just like that.
- 7:25 p.m. to 7:35 p.m.

858
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,333
"You Don't Love Me".

859
00:51:04,416 --> 00:51:06,458
- He doesn't love me.
- 7:40 p.m. to 7:50 p.m.

860
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,208
- "Can't Help Missing Him".
- I miss him.

861
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,333
7:55 p.m. to 8:05 p.m.

862
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:11,875
"Suddenly, I Miss You".

863
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,416
I miss him…

864
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,416
I'M HOSTING POP MUSIC CLUB'S CONCERT

865
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,791
TOMORROW NIGHT

866
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:22,291
CAN YOU COME?

867
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,041
WHITE NEEDS AN INJECTION

868
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:29,750
BUT I CAN COME AFTER THAT'S DONE

869
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:31,916
DON'T TEASE ME

870
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,375
IF I HOST POORLY

871
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:40,958
Hello, everybody.

872
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:45,583
This is Nanri High's
Rock Music Club concert.

873
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:48,583
We'll get to enjoy different performances.

874
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:51,291
Let's make some noise!

875
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,875
BEVERAGE SHOP, PICK-UP COUNTER

876
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,083
WHAT DRINK DO YOU WANT?

877
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:23,000
BUBBLE TEA WITH PUDDING
HERBAL JELLY AND COCONUT GEL

878
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,458
THAT’S A CALORIE BOMB

879
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,250
- Hello.
- Welcome to our store.

880
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,500
One bubble tea

881
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,625
with herbal jelly,
pudding, coconut jelly, and…

882
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:33,750
Got it.

883
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:36,708
Only Xiaoxia and her boyfriend
would order that.

884
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:38,125
If not, who else would?

885
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,791
This is for her, right?

886
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,208
I didn't think she was that popular.

887
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,208
Listen, if you want to date Xiaoxia,

888
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:46,375
you got to defeat Yuzu.

889
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,541
Newbie.

890
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,583
Why did you hit them?

891
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,791
She'll never like you.

892
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,666
What am I to her?

893
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,000
That's none of your business.

894
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:11,833
I know all about her.

895
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,208
She has bubble tea on a happy day

896
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,208
but also on a sad day.

897
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:22,625
She stands up for friends who are bullied.

898
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,458
Even if she's hurt in a fight,

899
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:25,875
she'll never back down.

900
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,250
Do you really think she likes you?

901
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,083
<i>The one who'll always be there for her</i>

902
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,250
<i>has to be me.</i>

903
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,416
We'll go get ready.

904
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,791
Encore…

905
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:56,833
Wasn't Distortion Theory awesome?

906
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:01,416
Next up

907
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,583
is our school's heavyweight band.

908
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:06,125
Lots of Xinghui's fans out there, right?

909
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,875
This band is led by Xinghui,

910
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,375
and here's our bassist, Concrete,

911
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:14,250
and our guitarist, Yuzu.

912
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,291
Yuzu.

913
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:18,125
Mrs. Yuzu…

914
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:19,750
No…

915
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,500
I'm serious. I think
a lot of you here will fall

916
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:23,333
for Yuzu after today's performance.

917
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:24,458
But we're not a couple.

918
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,583
You guys can do whatever you fancy.

919
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,750
Are there a lot of friends
who came for me?

920
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,041
My friends, make some noise!

921
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,041
She said you two aren't a couple.

922
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:39,541
What do you think?

923
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,833
You wrote "Heedless" for her.

924
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,875
Right? Answer me.

925
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,083
I like her.

926
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:02,500
I've liked her since elementary school.

927
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:06,291
I don't need to know
about their relationship.

928
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:09,833
That doesn't affect my feelings for her.

929
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:22,541
Xinghui, we're performing soon.

930
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,875
Shouldn't we get ready?

931
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:32,333
Okay. The Stars are now ready to perform.

932
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,750
Xinghui's and Yuzu's die-hard fans,

933
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,708
let's welcome them
with the loudest cheers.

934
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,375
I can’t handle it.

935
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,541
Don't go!

936
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,791
Xinghui!

937
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,125
Xinghui.

938
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:32,166
Xinghui…

939
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:39,000
Xinghui!

940
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:45,291
Xinghui…

941
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,000
Xinghui!

942
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:55,458
<i>Perhaps, it was the summer heat</i>

943
00:56:56,083 --> 00:57:00,125
<i>Perhaps, it was this simple melody</i>

944
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,458
Hurry up, snap out of it.

945
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:07,583
<i>Perhaps, it was that familiar smell</i>

946
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:09,958
<i>It reminded me of you</i>

947
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:12,500
<i>It reminded me of you</i>

948
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:17,250
<i>I didn't know about love then</i>

949
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,500
<i>So young and restless</i>

950
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:23,000
<i>Youth is now far behind us</i>

951
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,875
<i>But then, I didn't have the courage</i>

952
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:30,666
<i>I couldn't catch up with you</i>

953
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,541
<i>And tell you that I cared</i>

954
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:41,833
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

955
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:46,625
<i>Whose heart, my heart pauses for you</i>

956
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:47,916
Sing together.

957
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,791
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

958
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:58,291
<i>As if you're destined to be in my life</i>

959
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,625
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

960
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:03,416
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

961
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,875
<i>Remembering your eyes, heedless</i>

962
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:11,750
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

963
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,375
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

964
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:19,750
<i>Wondering if you mean it, heedless</i>

965
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,833
Mrs. Yuzu…

966
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,125
Make some noise!

967
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:39,708
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

968
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:44,791
<i>Whose heart, my heart pauses for you</i>

969
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:50,041
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

970
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:55,625
<i>As if you're destined to be in my life</i>

971
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:58,250
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

972
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,125
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

973
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:06,625
<i>Remembering your eyes, heedless</i>

974
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:09,125
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

975
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,708
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

976
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:17,000
<i>Wondering if you mean it, heedless</i>

977
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:20,208
<i>Heedless</i>

978
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,708
<i>Heedless</i>

979
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,333
<i>Falling for you</i>

980
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,041
Why didn't Xinghui sing?

981
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:41,708
How would I know?

982
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,541
Did you see the audience's reaction?

983
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:45,250
Their jaws dropped.

984
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,250
When you sang on stage,

985
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,041
every onlooker

986
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,625
became your fan.

987
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:52,166
I'm glad you came.

988
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,166
That's weird.

989
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,541
Cheng Yih didn't answer my messages.

990
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,583
He promised to be here.

991
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:02,666
What's odd about that?

992
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,958
That's what he's like.

993
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:05,625
What are you saying?

994
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,625
You think the world of him.

995
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:10,625
He even asked what drink I wanted.

996
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,416
Why ask if he's not going to show up?

997
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:15,458
Did he get into an accident?

998
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,333
What are you doing?

999
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,625
Why are you cycling so fast?

1000
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:24,333
CHENG YIH

1001
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,083
Cheng Yih.

1002
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,291
Did you see me host the show?

1003
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:32,916
Why didn't you answer my messages?

1004
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:36,333
Come with me.

1005
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,416
Cheng Yih.

1006
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,458
Did something happen to White or Grandma?

1007
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:50,333
I was so worried, I couldn't sleep.

1008
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:58,833
What's wrong?

1009
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:04,875
I apologize if I've given you

1010
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:06,208
the wrong idea.

1011
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,041
It's best to keep a distance between us.

1012
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,083
Keep a distance?

1013
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:16,750
I don't get it.

1014
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:17,875
What have I done?

1015
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:20,208
If you're seeing Yang Zongyou,

1016
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:22,916
you shouldn't get so close to others.

1017
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:26,333
That'll make you seem easy.

1018
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:30,833
Why are you talking like this?

1019
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:33,333
How have I offended you?

1020
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:35,875
What is it you know about me and Yuzu?

1021
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,291
Why did you say that about me?

1022
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:15,791
Newbie.

1023
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:18,541
Where's Xiaoxia?

1024
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:20,458
Why have you returned alone?

1025
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:23,708
Do you mean…

1026
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:28,500
Mrs. Yuzu?

1027
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,625
LEMONGRASS
ADD AN ACCOUNT, LOG OUT

1028
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:01,625
ANSTAGOOM, LOG IN

1029
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,208
REN'AI BUILDING

1030
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:26,208
Are you going to jump off now,

1031
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,583
or are you enjoying the view?

1032
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:30,875
What an idiot.

1033
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:32,875
My parents love me so much,

1034
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:35,000
and even if my brother is a bit annoying,

1035
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,125
I still love him.

1036
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:39,125
I won't do anything stupid for a lunatic.

1037
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,833
Bubble tea at this time of the day?

1038
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:49,041
Guess what?

1039
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,166
I ran 30 minutes to get it.

1040
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,000
Don't bother consoling me.

1041
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,208
I'm okay.

1042
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:01,250
Who's consoling you?

1043
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,291
That's not what we are.

1044
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,791
Then, what are we?

1045
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,541
Ha ha ha.

1046
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,083
Wang Xiaoxia,

1047
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:25,500
you got dumped?

1048
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:28,375
I'll never get my heart broken by a man.

1049
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:30,041
That's for silly women.

1050
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,375
If you are, you still have me.

1051
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:36,583
You?

1052
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,000
Me.

1053
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:42,125
I can cheer you up.

1054
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,375
Sure.

1055
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,791
Let's cheer up together.

1056
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:48,458
So, where are we off to?

1057
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,583
Can you even play it?

1058
01:04:57,666 --> 01:04:58,833
No, shoot at that.

1059
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,250
Over there.

1060
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,250
Over here.

1061
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,083
I'm going to die.

1062
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:09,791
I want to sing.

1063
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:18,125
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

1064
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:24,041
<i>As if you're destined to be in my life</i>

1065
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:27,500
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

1066
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,166
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

1067
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:35,666
<i>Remembering your eyes, heedless</i>

1068
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,291
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

1069
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:41,208
<i>Heedless</i>

1070
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,541
Xiaoxia, you're crying?

1071
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:53,833
So what? Can't I cry?

1072
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,125
Sure you can.

1073
01:06:57,666 --> 01:06:58,916
But just cry when you're with me.

1074
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,500
Don't cry in front of others.

1075
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,208
I have to cry at a certain time and place?

1076
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:07,083
That's because you're an ugly crier.

1077
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:08,500
You might scare the passers-by.

1078
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,833
I don't care.

1079
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:17,458
I just want to cry.

1080
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,541
He's really weird.

1081
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,416
Why did he study with me?

1082
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:32,416
Why did he have lunch with me?

1083
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,791
What have I done wrong?

1084
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:53,208
Can't it be me?

1085
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:58,833
We grew up together.

1086
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,000
Your emotions,

1087
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,333
your favorite foods,

1088
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:03,708
your wishes,

1089
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,625
your needs, I know them all.

1090
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:15,541
Can't you just be with me?

1091
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:32,875
Wang Xiaoxia.

1092
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:35,125
You've fallen asleep?

1093
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:36,500
So annoying.

1094
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:43,708
Didn't you hear a word I just said?

1095
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:53,875
What?

1096
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,416
Your mom said it's dinnertime.

1097
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,916
She's waiting for you at home.

1098
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:02,875
What about you?

1099
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:05,041
Should we save you some food?

1100
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,333
No, it's fine.

1101
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:07,291
Oh.

1102
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:09,541
Bye.

01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,083
<i>Since when did you start</i>

1107
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:29,041
<i>wanting to be…</i>

1108
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:33,416
<i>more than just friends?</i>

1109
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:44,541
<i>I don't know why</i>

1110
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:48,875
<i>I fell in love with you</i>

1111
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:54,416
<i>Jiang Jialing, they all knew.</i>

1112
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,416
<i>I'm the only fool.</i>

1113
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:02,333
<i>Perhaps I did know.</i>

1114
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:06,625
<i>But deep down, I refuse to acknowledge it.</i>

1115
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,166
Xiaoxia.

1116
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,500
Dinnertime.

1117
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,500
She's not coming.

1118
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,500
I have an idea.

1119
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,583
Didn't you get dumped?

1120
01:10:57,666 --> 01:11:00,083
You'll be fine after a few days.

1121
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:04,125
I'm heartbroken, so don't burst my bubble,

1122
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,208
even if you won't console me.

1123
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:07,750
You call this heartbroken?

1124
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:10,083
I don't think you even liked him.

1125
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:11,541
Listen.

1126
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:12,541
If you love someone,

1127
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:14,125
you have to give it your all.

1128
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:15,583
Don't just look so desperate

1129
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:16,958
when you run into hurdles.

1130
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,916
I'd say, you didn't really like him.

1131
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:19,833
What do you know?

1132
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:20,958
He called me easy.

1133
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:22,500
- Are you?
- Are you?

1134
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:24,250
Of course not!

1135
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,750
That's it then.

1136
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:27,416
Clear things up with him.

1137
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,875
What are you so afraid of?

1138
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:30,416
You're my daughter.

1139
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,625
How can you be so cowardly?

1140
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,291
It's never easy

1141
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:38,041
to like someone.

1142
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:40,166
You must put your heart into it,

1143
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,666
right?

1144
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,708
Yes.

1145
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,083
Right, Xiaoxia?

1146
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:51,208
Cheng Yih.

1147
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:54,958
Jialing.

1148
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,250
Zheng Rui.

1149
01:11:58,458 --> 01:11:59,791
Wang Xiaoxia.

1150
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,500
Xiaoxia?

1151
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:07,791
Zoned out.

1152
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:12,583
Idiot. What a stupid woman.

1153
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,458
Sir.

1154
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:21,125
That's irrelevant to her grades.

1155
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:24,416
What language is he speaking?

1156
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,541
That's name-calling.

1157
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:29,375
You'd better apologize now.

1158
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:32,041
Or I'll report you.

1159
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,541
Who is she to you?

1160
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,166
You don't have to stand up for her.

1161
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,500
What concerns her concerns me.

1162
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:42,291
Insulting her is insulting me.

1163
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:50,291
Are they arguing?

1164
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:54,625
Stupid arrogant pig with hero syndrome.

1165
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,250
Nothing more than just a brat.

1166
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:59,083
You're the arrogant one.

1167
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,666
Let's see if I'll sue you for slander.

1168
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,458
Or report you for verbal violence.

1169
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:13,750
Awesome!

1170
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:29,541
So what if you have good grades?

1171
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:31,666
How dare you threaten to report me?

1172
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,333
Just don't let me catch you.

1173
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,458
Max.

1174
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,041
Why are you so mad?

1175
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:39,208
It's that student.

1176
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,166
You know who it is.

1177
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,500
Are you referring

1178
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:44,708
to that problematic kid
from Jiangguo High School?

1179
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:46,375
That's right. Him.

1180
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:49,750
Don't worry. Leave him to me.

1181
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:51,000
I'll handle it.

1182
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:08,041
Fighting outside the campus?

1183
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:10,375
This can be quite serious.

1184
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:14,791
We can either inform your parents

1185
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:16,375
or expel you.

1186
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:17,916
But I know you're smart.

1187
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,125
So, I'm considering asking you to write

1188
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,833
a letter of repentance
and apologize to Max.

1189
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:22,583
If so, I'll overlook this matter.

1190
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,541
He's directed verbal violence
towards a student.

1191
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,041
Is that allowed?

1192
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:27,666
I'm being nice now.

1193
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,750
Don't make me do it the hard way.

1194
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:30,041
We can't settle it like this

1195
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:31,708
when the witnesses show up.

1196
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:35,625
You're doomed.

1197
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:37,250
I gave you a chance.

1198
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:38,291
You are so dead.

1199
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,208
- Come here.
- Sir, you asked to see me?

1200
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:42,125
Do you know him?

1201
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,250
I'm asking you a question.

1202
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:44,791
Answer me honestly. Don't be scared.

1203
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,875
Did he bully you
or use violence against you?

1204
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:48,916
Did he bully me?

1205
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,041
Exactly.

1206
01:14:58,291 --> 01:14:59,125
No.

1207
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:00,875
No?

1208
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,583
Hang on. You're probably confused.

1209
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,250
Just answer yes

1210
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:07,583
and you'll be off the hook.

1211
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:08,958
I'll just punish him.

1212
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:14,083
Did he bully you
and physically abuse you? Did he?

1213
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,041
No.

1214
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,000
I fought, but I wasn't bashed up.

1215
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:27,666
Sir.

1216
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:29,041
Cheng Yih has good grades.

1217
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,333
He can get our school to rank up.

1218
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:33,000
Don't end up making him leave.

1219
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,458
What are you staring at?

1220
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:41,541
Young guns,

1221
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:43,833
you've got too much energy in you.

1222
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:47,083
What a shame to waste
such stamina on fighting.

1223
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:49,208
Four hundred watts.

1224
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,500
You can leave after generating 400 watts.

1225
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:53,458
You, 500.

1226
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:56,000
Because you're loyal.

1227
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:57,375
Hundred more for loyalty.

1228
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,125
Hang in there.

1229
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:10,208
Why did you help me?

1230
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:12,083
Helped you?

1231
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:16,375
They all made it sound like
you bashed me up.

1232
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:18,375
We had a fight.

1233
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,625
I nearly defeated you.

1234
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,250
Thanks.

1235
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,250
What for?

1236
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:26,708
You stood up for Xiaoxia.

1237
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,083
You understood what I said?

1238
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,541
<i>What concerns her concerns me.</i>

1239
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,041
<i>Insulting her is insulting me.</i>

1240
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:39,458
I don't like to study.

1241
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:41,666
But I'm not dumb.

1242
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,291
I did that for myself,

1243
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:52,291
not for her.

1244
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:55,750
I failed.

1245
01:16:58,083 --> 01:17:00,041
I professed my love, but failed.

1246
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:02,541
Why are you telling me?

1247
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:03,458
I'm just reminding you

1248
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,041
that even if I failed this time,

1249
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,416
it doesn't mean I'll never win her over.

1250
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:15,125
And she's really sad

1251
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:17,791
that you called her easy.

1252
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:37,416
JIANG JIALING

1253
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,000
<i>You're leaving alone after school?</i>

1254
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:40,666
<i>Are you keeping to yourself?</i>

1255
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:45,958
<i>Cheng Yih actually cares about you.</i>

1256
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,791
<i>Just clear up the misunderstanding.</i>

1257
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,708
<i>Hey, answer me.</i>

1258
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,833
<i>"Read" means?</i>

1259
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,625
White is much better now.

1260
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:04,416
White seems healthier.

1261
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,875
How about this?

1262
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:06,791
Bring White here

1263
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:07,875
for a follow-up in two months.

1264
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:10,083
Okay. Thanks, Doctor.

1265
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,791
This is great, White.

1266
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:20,916
Good job.

1267
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:46,833
Can I celebrate your birthday with you?

1268
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:49,750
But it's not my birthday.

1269
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:53,500
It says on your student profile

1270
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:55,083
that today is your birthday.

1271
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,500
The date on my profile

1272
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,500
is the day I met White.

1273
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:07,458
Oh.

1274
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,416
Well,

1275
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,833
I already bought a cake.

1276
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:16,375
Why not just celebrate it anyway?

1277
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,000
Why is it suddenly raining?

1278
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:31,000
Over there.

1279
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:33,500
White.

1280
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,875
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1281
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,500
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1282
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:47,083
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1283
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:49,875
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1284
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,166
Make a wish.

1285
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:54,416
First wish.

1286
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,791
I hope that White can get better.

1287
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:05,083
Second wish?

1288
01:20:09,791 --> 01:20:10,625
I'm sorry.

1289
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:14,291
"I'm sorry"?

1290
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,625
What an odd wish.

1291
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:22,958
I want to apologize to you

1292
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:27,458
for calling you easy.

1293
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:32,416
You're actually apologizing to me.

1294
01:20:35,291 --> 01:20:37,083
White.

1295
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,958
You can't have this cake.

1296
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,125
When I've saved enough cash,

1297
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:44,125
I'll treat you to a doggy cake, okay?

1298
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:47,041
All right, let's eat.

1299
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:47,958
But you haven't--

1300
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:02,166
Was that by accident or on purpose?

1301
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:09,541
I do like you,

1302
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:11,375
but I am not easy.

1303
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,625
I'll give you five seconds.

1304
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,958
If you still deny it in five seconds,

1305
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,791
I'll say you harassed me.

1306
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,375
Five,

1307
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:22,208
four,

1308
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:23,750
three.

1309
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:25,500
I'm almost done counting.

1310
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:26,458
Two.

1311
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,375
- White.
- White.

1312
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:48,458
What's wrong with White?

1313
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:50,041
Why is it vomiting?

1314
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,416
Or maybe just call the vet?

1315
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,500
White, it's okay. White.

1316
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,791
- White.
- White, it's okay.

1317
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,541
- We're right here.
- Everything's okay.

1318
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:01,250
White.

1319
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:02,625
White.

1320
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:04,916
There's no time to lose.

1321
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,166
- We have to go now.
- Xiaoxia.

1322
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:07,958
- We got to go. Come on.
- Xiaoxia.

1323
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:09,541
We have to go. Come on.

1324
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,041
Over here.

1325
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:19,458
Anyone in?

1326
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:21,000
Anyone in?

1327
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,791
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

1328
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,458
Anyone in?

1329
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:30,375
Doctor.

1330
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:31,875
Is anyone in?

1331
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:33,333
Doctor.

1332
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:49,916
Yuzu.

1333
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,833
<i>Hello, Xiaoxia?</i>

1334
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:52,375
- <i>Did you run off to the States?</i>
- Help me.

1335
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:53,750
<i>Your mom made a pot of pig trotters.</i>

1336
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:55,541
Help me.

1337
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:04,291
Doctor.

1338
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:05,416
Hang on.

1339
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,666
Excuse me. We're closed.

1340
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:07,583
Come tomorrow.

1341
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:09,750
- Please help us. Our dog is dying.
- We're closed.

1342
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,166
Wait!

1343
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,750
Please help us.

1344
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:14,708
We don't take strays.

1345
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:18,041
It's not a stray!

1346
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,250
Whose dog is it?

1347
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:23,166
The dog of the guy
that the girl I like likes.

1348
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:27,250
Open up!

1349
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:28,708
Doctor.

1350
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,375
White.

1351
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,500
<i>White.</i>

1352
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:41,416
<i>White, you did great.</i>

1353
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:46,541
<i>White.</i>

1354
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:49,333
<i>White, shall we dance?</i>

1355
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:53,166
<i>White.</i>

1356
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:56,958
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

1357
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:02,666
<i>I'll always be with you.</i>

1358
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:42,458
Why don't we go to another vet?

1359
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:51,541
White…

1360
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:54,666
It’s gone.

1361
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,083
It's not breathing.

1362
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,666
Let's go to another vet.

1363
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,541
Give it to me.

1364
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:14,583
Hurry up!

1365
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:16,375
Kangding Animal Hospital is available.

1366
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:21,875
Hurry!

1367
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:37,166
Hey, Yuzu.

1368
01:25:40,625 --> 01:25:41,500
Thanks.

1369
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:43,625
Are you silly or what?

1370
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:45,000
What's there to thank?

1371
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:48,958
There's nothing I can do.

1372
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,375
You guys,

1373
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:52,875
you brought it here too late.

1374
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:30,333
Slow down.

1375
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:40,625
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

1376
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:45,750
<i>Whose heart, my heart pauses for you</i>

1377
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:51,791
<i>I don't know why I fell in love with you</i>

1378
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:57,125
<i>As if you're destined to be in my life</i>

1379
01:28:57,208 --> 01:29:00,166
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

1380
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,958
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

1381
01:29:03,041 --> 01:29:07,875
<i>Remembering your eyes, heedless</i>

1382
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,416
<i>I fell for you, heedless</i>

1383
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:14,291
<i>I'm in love with you, heedless</i>

1384
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:19,833
<i>Wondering if you mean it, heedless</i>

1385
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:08,041
Grandpa.

1386
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:09,458
I'm home.

1387
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:13,125
You're home?

1388
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:15,458
Why are you so drenched?

1389
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:18,083
What are you doing here?

1390
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:20,125
How can I not come here?

1391
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:28,250
Come with me to the States.

1392
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:29,416
No.

1393
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:32,750
He's doing quite well here.

1394
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:34,250
Why make him?

1395
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:35,625
You're soaked.

1396
01:30:35,708 --> 01:30:36,833
Go and dry yourself.

1397
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:38,458
Don't catch a cold.

1398
01:30:38,541 --> 01:30:39,750
Dad, stay out of this.

1399
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:43,000
I'm responsible for his life.

1400
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:48,291
Yuanbin.

1401
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:49,875
She…

1402
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:51,208
Who is she?

1403
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,208
That's our daughter, Vicky.

1404
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:55,500
Don't you remember her?

1405
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:57,250
It's okay. I'll talk to her.

1406
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:58,416
Mom.

1407
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,791
I'm Vicky.

1408
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:00,916
It's all right.

1409
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,041
Everything's okay.

1410
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,625
I really don't get it.

1411
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:08,166
Why won't you send Mom
to long-term care facility?

1412
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:09,625
They have professional caretakers.

1413
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:11,916
Isn't that better for her?

1414
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,958
I'm going to call Robert now.

1415
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,208
He can make arrangements tomorrow.

1416
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:19,208
That's enough!

1417
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:20,833
Dad, what are you doing?

1418
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:22,083
Who are you to preach to us

1419
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:23,541
the minute you get home?

1420
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:26,625
I've been with your mom for a lifetime.

1421
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:29,125
Don't I know how to care for her?

1422
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:30,833
Dad.

1423
01:31:30,916 --> 01:31:32,916
You're also getting older.

1424
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,916
Who knows which of you
would pass away first?

1425
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,416
That's right.

1426
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,875
If you keep stressing me out,

1427
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:39,750
I might just pass away in a day or two.

1428
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,625
I'm more devoted to her
than anyone else has ever been.

1429
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:44,208
No one should dare take her from me.

1430
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:46,291
Can you not misinterpret
my words all the time?

1431
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:47,916
Can you just stop arguing?

1432
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,375
I can leave with you,

1433
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:12,375
but you must promise

1434
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,791
to let Grandma and Grandpa

1435
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:16,500
stay together.

1436
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:45,708
Are you okay?

1437
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,541
Do you feel better?

1438
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:53,500
Where's your test paper from last week?

1439
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:56,000
Show me. I'll help you correct it.

1440
01:33:17,416 --> 01:33:18,250
I'm going back to the States.

1441
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:29,708
So suddenly?

1442
01:33:30,875 --> 01:33:32,375
You won't be returning?

1443
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:38,041
The plan…

1444
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:41,708
The plan was to finish high school here.

1445
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:46,000
But my family decided

1446
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,375
to set out this week.

1447
01:33:58,750 --> 01:33:59,666
But…

1448
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:03,583
We haven't celebrated Christmas

1449
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,541
or welcomed New Year's together.

1450
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:09,541
Or celebrated Valentine's Day.

1451
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,625
I like you.

1452
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,958
I really, really like you a lot.

1453
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:25,666
And I worked my ass off to win you over.

1454
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:28,791
I can't accept

1455
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,625
that it's coming to an end now.

1456
01:34:45,333 --> 01:34:47,583
Are you never coming back again?

1457
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:37,416
<i>Cheng Yih promised</i>
<i>we'll keep seeing each other.</i>

1458
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:39,208
<i>But we will just be a bit</i>

1459
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,708
<i>farther apart.</i>

1460
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:42,708
<i>We worked hard to keep it going.</i>

1461
01:35:42,791 --> 01:35:44,583
<i>We stayed in a relationship.</i>

1462
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,125
<i>I wonder</i>

1463
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,208
<i>if I'd done too much</i>
<i>to go after Cheng Yih.</i>

1464
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:52,333
<i>So much that I was 13 hours ahead.</i>

1465
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:55,083
<i>I became Cheng Yih's future,</i>

1466
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,958
<i>and he became my past.</i>

1467
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:01,666
I saw a dog that resembled White a lot.

1468
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:02,583
Look.

1469
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:04,458
- <i>How is it alike?</i>
- Which one should I get?

1470
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:05,750
It's brown.

1471
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:07,958
- <i>White was black.</i>
- I can't reach that.

1472
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:15,750
- I got it.
- <i>Good job.</i>

1473
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:16,958
- Look.
- <i>Very cute.</i>

1474
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:18,500
<i>Hello. How are you?</i>

1475
01:36:18,583 --> 01:36:19,583
<i>I'm Cheng Yih.</i>

1476
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:22,958
We finally got to see him.

1477
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:24,750
He's actually so-so in person.

1478
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:26,583
- Shut up.
- You are…

1479
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:28,791
Hello. I was her classmate.

1480
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,625
<i>I'll find time to fly back.</i>

1481
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:32,708
<i>Let's see if we go on a date</i>

1482
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:33,958
<i>or go on a trip somewhere.</i>

1483
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:36,500
- Sure.
- What are you gonna eat?

1484
01:36:39,041 --> 01:36:40,166
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

1485
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,250
<i>Make a wish.</i>

1486
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:45,125
I hope Cheng Yih is well in the States.

1487
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,666
Yuzu is so mean. Look.

1488
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:54,833
<i>It's okay.</i>

1489
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:56,583
<i>Just use it as a lotion.</i>

1490
01:36:56,666 --> 01:36:58,916
Wait a second. Come back.

1491
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,875
He's leaving tomorrow.

1492
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:02,041
I fell off my scooter avoiding a squirrel.

1493
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:03,000
<i>Don't worry about the scooter.</i>

1494
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,583
<i>It's great that you're okay.</i>

1495
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:06,666
What did you say? I can't hear you.

1496
01:37:10,333 --> 01:37:11,875
Go on.

1497
01:37:12,625 --> 01:37:13,875
They are calling you.

1498
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:22,041
You fell?

1499
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:23,125
Yes.

1500
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:26,041
Are you asking for help
with this attitude?

1501
01:37:26,125 --> 01:37:27,291
Okay, thanks.

1502
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:28,416
Thank you.

1503
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:32,791
CHENG YIH

1504
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:33,791
Cheng Yih.

1505
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:55,125
<i>No promise</i>

1506
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:57,458
<i>is as good as being physically together.</i>

1507
01:37:58,125 --> 01:37:59,791
<i>As time went by,</i>

1508
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:02,958
<i>I started to notice the distance.</i>

1509
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:04,333
Is he asleep?

1510
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:07,291
Marry him! Marry him!

1511
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:08,500
I do.

1512
01:38:15,333 --> 01:38:17,458
Kiss…

1513
01:38:21,583 --> 01:38:22,708
What are you busy with?

1514
01:38:22,791 --> 01:38:24,083
Why are you always away?

1515
01:38:26,458 --> 01:38:27,583
<i>Just a minute.</i>

1516
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:34,166
French kiss…

1517
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:38,333
<i>Our conversations became simpler</i>

1518
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:41,458
<i>and the content, uneventful.</i>

1519
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,875
<i>We still joked around sometimes,</i>

1520
01:38:47,458 --> 01:38:48,958
<i>until we both</i>

1521
01:38:49,041 --> 01:38:51,250
<i>faded out of each other's life.</i>

1522
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:55,666
<i>We didn't break up.</i>

1523
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,166
<i>Nor did we say our goodbyes.</i>

1524
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:58,791
<i>No tears were shed.</i>

1525
01:38:58,875 --> 01:39:00,041
<i>No arguments either.</i>

1526
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:03,083
<i>We didn't break up as others would.</i>

1527
01:39:03,916 --> 01:39:06,166
<i>It was as if</i>
<i>our relationship never started,</i>

1528
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:07,708
<i>nor truly ended.</i>

1529
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:21,500
You broke up again?

1530
01:39:21,583 --> 01:39:22,791
I can't help it.

1531
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,166
He won't answer my messages or calls.

1532
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:25,291
What am I to do?

1533
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:26,791
You won't do that

1534
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:28,125
or this with any boyfriends.

1535
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:29,291
Of course, you'd get dumped.

1536
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,666
Mom, look.

1537
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:31,666
Youyou.

1538
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:34,041
Stop nagging at me.

1539
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:36,791
Wang Xiaoxia.

1540
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:39,250
How on earth did you end up like this?

1541
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:42,750
Just end things the way they should.

1542
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,458
I even invited

1543
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,250
Cheng Yih to my wedding for you.

1544
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:49,208
Don't think any besties are like me.

1545
01:39:50,333 --> 01:39:52,666
So, just think about what to say to him.

1546
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:53,833
Okay?

1547
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:56,833
Answer me.

1548
01:39:56,916 --> 01:39:57,750
Every time, you…

1549
01:39:57,833 --> 01:39:58,833
This is from Yuzu.

1550
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:03,000
Good chap.

1551
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,541
All in such small notes?

1552
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:08,041
How poor is he?

1553
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:09,416
This is shocking.

1554
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:10,708
Really shocking.

1555
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:18,500
Looking good.

1556
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,625
Congratulations.

1557
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:22,666
Congratulations.

1558
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:24,541
Don't run off later.

1559
01:40:24,625 --> 01:40:25,750
Sure, we'll be waiting.

1560
01:40:26,625 --> 01:40:28,541
Knew it. He didn't show up.

1561
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:34,166
<i>It's good in a way.</i>

1562
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:38,291
<i>At least, he's vanished from your life.</i>

1563
01:40:39,416 --> 01:40:40,583
<i>Come on.</i>

1564
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:44,375
<i>You'd better forget all about him.</i>

1565
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:47,541
<i>Hurry up</i>

1566
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,250
<i>and start a new life.</i>

1567
01:41:25,958 --> 01:41:28,541
ANSTAGOOM, LOG IN

1568
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:37,500
<i>The starry sky in New York</i>
<i>is cold and distant.</i>

1569
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:41,416
<i>Like someone who is with me but isn't.</i>

1570
01:41:43,416 --> 01:41:45,500
<i>I saw a silhouette like yours,</i>

1571
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:47,833
<i>but I knew it wasn't you.</i>

1572
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:50,458
<i>But I'd hoped it was you.</i>

1573
01:41:52,375 --> 01:41:53,625
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

1574
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:55,583
<i>Happy Valentine's Day.</i>

1575
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:57,791
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

1576
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:03,958
<i>We were so far apart.</i>

1577
01:42:05,541 --> 01:42:08,583
<i>But you introduced me to your friends.</i>

1578
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:10,583
<i>That made me feel great.</i>

1579
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,625
<i>I was feeling terrible today,</i>

1580
01:42:15,583 --> 01:42:17,208
<i>but because of your laughter,</i>

1581
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:18,625
<i>I had to admit</i>

1582
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,291
<i>that I was weak.</i>

1583
01:42:22,458 --> 01:42:23,791
<i>What defeated me</i>

1584
01:42:25,041 --> 01:42:25,958
<i>were the memories of you.</i>

1585
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:29,166
<i>We didn't say goodbye.</i>

1586
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:31,541
<i>Is he taking good care of you?</i>

1587
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:33,583
<i>I thought I'd move on.</i>

1588
01:42:34,333 --> 01:42:36,250
<i>I wish you well.</i>

1589
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,041
<i>You finally have someone</i>

1590
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:39,708
<i>with you in your world.</i>

1591
01:42:40,416 --> 01:42:41,791
<i>I'm admiring from the outside,</i>

1592
01:42:41,875 --> 01:42:43,500
<i>unwilling to sabotage it.</i>

1593
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:46,333
<i>I haven't seen you for ages.</i>

1594
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,708
VET

1595
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:04,500
WHERE ARE YOU?

1596
01:44:24,083 --> 01:44:25,208
You came.

1597
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:28,291
Why didn't you come in?

1598
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:29,875
Didn't you know she's been waiting?

1599
01:44:32,791 --> 01:44:33,916
Where's her boyfriend?

1600
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:35,875
Why isn't he with her?

1601
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:39,208
They broke up.

1602
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,333
All because of someone.

1603
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,041
Go on.

1604
01:44:45,125 --> 01:44:46,166
Thank you.

1605
01:45:17,958 --> 01:45:19,125
Guess what?

1606
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:23,750
I've been waiting.

1607
01:45:25,416 --> 01:45:26,458
For what?

1608
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:58,750
The third wish.

1609
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:25,250
<i>Cheng Yih's third wish</i>

1610
01:46:25,916 --> 01:46:27,375
<i>is for us</i>

1611
01:46:27,458 --> 01:46:29,000
<i>to be together forever.</i>
