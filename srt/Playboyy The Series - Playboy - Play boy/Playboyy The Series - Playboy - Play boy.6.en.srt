1
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:18,417
(Previously) From now on,
you guys must help me find Nant,

2
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,737
who calls you family.

3
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:23,026
Do you know anyone else who knows Soong?

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,034
He was flirting with clients,
so he got complaints.

5
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:28,370
He's now a rider at OK Rider.

6
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,117
Damn it.

7
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:32,243
Your brother was a drug addict
before he met us.

8
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:34,804
He probably bought the drugs
from the guy he was hooking up with.

9
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:37,624
His name was...
Nuth? Something like that.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,617
Does the N on this necklace
stand for Nuth?

11
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:41,320
I found it on the kitchen floor.

12
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:42,695
Let's not waste time.

13
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:45,531
Get all the suspects together

14
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:47,054
and find out the truth.

15
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:51,845
The guy who reported to the police
about his loud neighbors was killed.

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,931
A partygoer got drunk
and shot his friend.

17
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:56,861
What's the craziest thing
you've done sexually?

18
00:00:57,126 --> 00:00:58,291
They tied me up.

19
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:01,861
Got me wearing ears and tail,
and had me meow like a cat.

20
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:02,947
Choking,

21
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:04,736
slapping, figging,

22
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:06,798
golden shower... You name it.

23
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,643
Leaked photos of elites
partying on a yacht

24
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:11,627
with drugs and women.

25
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:13,689
What wouldn't you do for money?

26
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:16,314
Violence. Say no to violence.

27
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:19,740
Nothing I wouldn't do,
if you pay me enough.

28
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:22,185
Now you two make love, not fuck.

29
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,685
Make love.
You take the bait, you get the bread.

30
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:11,508
I love you, mentor.

31
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:15,508
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,588
You want to be paid
even though you didn't deliver?

33
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,447
Hey.

34
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,673
What's the matter?

35
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,800
"Playboyy the Series"

36
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:27,968
To get all the suspects together
to find more information...

37
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:29,796
(Episode 6: There is truth in a glass of wine.)
I want you to make one suggestion each.

38
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,093
Start.

39
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:34,236
Invite everyone for a train ride

40
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:37,361
to Chiangmai and make the train
malfunction midway.

41
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,111
No one will be able to run away.

42
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:41,111
Get everyone to go to a private island

43
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,861
and solve the mystery
behind your brother's disappearance

44
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,447
before making someone disappear.

45
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,585
A Gothic castle on the hills
of Kanchanaburi.

46
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:52,102
No one can leave
because of the storm and landslide.

47
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,157
Ten people in a remote place.

48
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:58,297
Create a murder case to scare them
and make them confess.

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,797
You guys really like thrillers, huh?

50
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,439
Zouey.

51
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:08,775
Please.

52
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:10,439
Don't disappoint me.

53
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:19,908
I have no idea.

54
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,191
Maybe...

55
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:29,113
Why don't we host a party?

56
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:30,988
- Good.
- Good.

57
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:32,165
What about an animal theme?

58
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,282
- I'll be a cat.
- I'll be a dog.

59
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:34,573
- I'll be a mouse.
- Great.

60
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:36,933
- A lizard.
- What about food?

61
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,708
Slumber party. Sea bass?

62
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:39,607
That's a given.

63
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:40,903
- Yeah.
- Hey.

64
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,763
Can you guys take this seriously?

65
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:44,458
We are investigating.

66
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:50,677
Fine, a party.

67
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,748
The theme is sexy sleepwear.

68
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,139
What about this one?

69
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,701
Or...

70
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:09,133
This one?

71
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,648
I'll wear this. It's much cuter.

72
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,493
Why are you making it seem
like I'm forcing you?

73
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,532
I am forced.

74
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,040
How?

75
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,720
We agreed.

76
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:36,642
If you come to the party,

77
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,579
I'll let you fuck me.

78
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:40,182
It's a win-win situation.

79
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:44,853
Don't say that in public.

80
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:46,330
It's obscene.

81
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,744
Fine.

82
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:51,682
Then I'll just do it.

83
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:55,025
Do it with your boyfriend.

84
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:00,007
Fine, I get it.

85
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:03,374
You've been distant
because you think I have a boyfriend.

86
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:11,921
So which one are you choosing?

87
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:13,595
We have to get drinks.

88
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:20,774
Does this count as a drink?

89
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:25,848
Why don't you take a break?

90
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:27,489
I'll do it.

91
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:31,012
It's okay.

92
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:34,337
You are a guest.
Make yourself comfortable.

93
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:42,725
Come on.

94
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:44,921
What are you doing?

95
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,694
Someone might see us.

96
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:53,468
I don't want to carry chairs anymore.

97
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:55,890
I want to carry you.

98
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:47,704
I...

99
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:49,681
I will go get some booze.

100
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:10,503
Hello?

101
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:12,963
What is it?

102
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:22,956
Your service has not been
up to standard.

103
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:24,011
Why?

104
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:25,628
Do you want to cancel our agreement?

105
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:29,433
Let's cancel and you can
provide your service in jail.

106
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:32,269
No.

107
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:33,816
I'm sorry, boss.

108
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,958
Good, make yourself available tonight
and join a party with me.

109
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:42,466
But I...

110
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,123
What role do you want me to go as?

111
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,368
What are we?

112
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,328
You are my slave.

113
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,414
You will go as my slave.

114
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,674
(Do you want to meet tonight, Jump?)

115
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:15,799
(I want you to wash my car and fuck me)

116
00:12:15,824 --> 00:12:17,338
(I can't tonight, I'm sorry)

117
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:22,283
Hey.

118
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,963
Why have you been avoiding me?

119
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:29,986
I thought you could do anything
if you were paid enough.

120
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,267
Why can't you have sex like a couple?

121
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,588
You taught me how to feel.

122
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,513
So practice what you preach.

123
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,244
I don't have any feelings
for a kid like you.

124
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,055
I just can't do it.

125
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:46,743
Because you're not sexy enough.

126
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:53,563
Fine.

127
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,492
I will be better than you someday.

128
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:03,408
You taught me how to feel.

129
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,088
So practice what you preach.

130
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:07,908
I don't have any feelings
for a kid like you.

131
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:41,760
Do you think today's plan will work out?

132
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:46,245
I don't know.

133
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:53,261
Sometimes I feel like
I don't want to keep digging.

134
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:59,761
I haven't found anything much

135
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:03,889
except for the fact
that my brother isn't that innocent.

136
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,667
He had sadistic sex with you.

137
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,253
He was a drug addict.

138
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:10,831
He had sex with strangers.

139
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:13,081
He also took videos of himself.

140
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:15,415
I...

141
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,448
You are afraid
that you'll change if you keep digging.

142
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,473
Yeah.

143
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:25,262
When I had sadistic sex with you,

144
00:14:28,153 --> 00:14:29,520
I was afraid I would change.

145
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:36,106
Sex doesn't change anyone.

146
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:40,169
It just reveals who you are
on the inside.

147
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,130
And...

148
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,419
Is there anything you want to reveal?

149
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,552
They're here. Come in later.

150
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:53,868
I'm sick of you couples.

151
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:56,976
- Hey.
- Don't.

152
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,351
Don't, get out.

153
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:26,809
Come on.

154
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,379
Hello.

155
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,426
Cheers.

156
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,209
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

157
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,514
Cheers.

158
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:43,772
Let's start the game.

159
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,162
This game is called

160
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,483
Never Have I Ever.

161
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,878
Put your hands up.

162
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,034
Share something about yourself.

163
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,839
If you have done it, put a finger down.

164
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:56,354
Anyone who puts
all ten fingers down first

165
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:58,370
is the loser.

166
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,440
I hope you are not stupid.

167
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,386
Let's give a round of applause.

168
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:05,535
Come on.

169
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,402
Never have I ever lied to someone
that I had a boyfriend.

170
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,215
That's not fun.

171
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,715
Share something sexual.

172
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:21,302
Okay.

173
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:24,630
Never have I ever

174
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,481
- had sadistic sex.
- Fuck you.

175
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:29,122
You killed me.

176
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,060
Who did you do it with?

177
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,098
It was in the past and before I met you.

178
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:49,474
Never have I ever had sex

179
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:52,200
or tried to have sex
with more than one person here.

180
00:18:19,073 --> 00:18:21,190
Zouey. The birthday party.

181
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:23,541
I was the policeman.

182
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,167
Never have I ever had sex
wearing a mask.

183
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:39,441
Isn't that a little too specific?

184
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,224
Does Nant's twin know Prom?

185
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:13,199
This is so absurd.

186
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,980
Not as absurd as you hooking up
with Prom's brother.

187
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:18,073
Yeah, you're right.

188
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:19,909
My boss is Prom's brother?

189
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,238
- Didn't you know?
- Yeah.

190
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:22,448
My boss is loaded.

191
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:28,378
Why did you ask about my boyfriend?
Are you jealous?

192
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:30,388
Of course not.

193
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:32,833
I'm here so you can tell your friends
that I'm your boyfriend.

194
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,083
Hey.

195
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,716
You're here for sex.

196
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,583
I know you're into me.

197
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:40,513
By the way...

198
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:43,560
Why did you wear a mask?

199
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,514
Why don't you wear one when we do it?

200
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:10,243
Prom.

201
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:12,462
You never told me about your brother.

202
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:14,852
You never told me
that you had sex with him.

203
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:17,918
Leave him alone
if you don't want to get in trouble.

204
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,711
My father is very protective of him.

205
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,728
Are you sure this plan will work?

206
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,876
Yeah.

207
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:40,439
Why don't we just ask them?

208
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,149
Now we know that Jump, Prom, and Keen
like having sex wearing a mask.

209
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,868
I think it's sketchy.

210
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,385
If we play a few more games,
we'll definitely know.

211
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,929
Please don't do this.

212
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:15,398
I know you're mad, okay?

213
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:18,054
But can you let me explain?

214
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:19,773
Please.

215
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:21,187
You got it all wrong, babe.

216
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:22,977
Don't "babe" me.

217
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,828
I'm not going to hear
any single bullshit from you no more.

218
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:35,336
It started out like a fraud.

219
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:36,742
Yes.

220
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:39,923
But then I started...

221
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:42,173
You know,

222
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,774
feel things for you.

223
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:48,095
Oh.

224
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,649
What in a Nicholas Sparks movie
is this shit?

225
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:55,275
Make up on the rooftop?

226
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:57,369
Sorry, man.

227
00:21:58,557 --> 00:21:59,728
Just get out of my face.

228
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:05,635
All right.

229
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:08,041
Let's go inside.

230
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:10,535
We have so many more games for you.

231
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:34,996
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

232
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:35,816
Zouey.

233
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:38,402
Two people who are picked randomly
will enter the room.

234
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:40,808
They can do whatever they want.

235
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:43,332
Soong.

236
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:46,091
But they have to be done
in seven minutes.

237
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,856
After listening to your side
of the story, I kind of understand.

238
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,388
But...

239
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,638
You shouldn't have done that
to anyone in the first place.

240
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:12,942
I know.

241
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:15,341
I feel so guilty.

242
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,817
I've never felt this way about anyone.

243
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,060
I'm not blaming anyone.

244
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,506
But my childhood was like...

245
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:23,865
The worse you are, the colder you are,

246
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,256
the less sensitive you are,

247
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:27,349
the more aggressive you are,
the more masculine you are.

248
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,357
I shouldn't have done that.

249
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:41,147
You can explain yourself,

250
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:44,936
but that doesn't mean
what you did is not wrong.

251
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:48,585
You can choose to be
masculine but be awful,

252
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:50,580
or be a pussy

253
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:52,014
but not hurt anyone.

254
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:02,390
Are you close to First?

255
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:07,750
Tell me what I can do
to make it up to him.

256
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,641
You should first ask yourself.

257
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:19,493
You hurt him

258
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:23,313
and you're forcing him to not be
mad at you just to make you feel better.

259
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:24,987
Is it fair?

260
00:24:30,222 --> 00:24:31,636
Soong is messed up.

261
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:33,230
He talks to me all the time.

262
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,730
I understand why you're mad at him.

263
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,034
But I don't want you to think
that he can't change.

264
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:43,528
I understand.

265
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:46,215
But my feelings are valid too, right?

266
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:51,020
Why should I be the one
who misunderstood and overthought?

267
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:53,488
Isn't this gaslighting?

268
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,972
This game was designed for us
to fuck in seven minutes.

269
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:23,354
Why don't we give it a shot?

270
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:26,268
Play the game.

271
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:27,964
We're in here.

272
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:29,589
No one will see us.

273
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:36,496
Then...

274
00:25:38,894 --> 00:25:39,910
Do you want to fuck?

275
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,746
So we can make First jealous.

276
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:49,024
Come on.

277
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:55,470
Zouey has been seducing you
for a long time.

278
00:25:58,204 --> 00:25:59,251
Don't you want to let it out?

279
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:01,579
I don't know if he told you about this.

280
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:05,213
Teena

281
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:09,682
approached you because he wanted
to take your virginity.

282
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:13,088
You're hot and ripped.

283
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,018
Anyone would want you.

284
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:19,034
Zouey is so disrespectful to you

285
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:21,535
for letting you wait.

286
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:03,165
Captain

287
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,853
and

288
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:10,252
Keen.

289
00:27:58,573 --> 00:28:01,456
I did what you asked.
He didn't touch me at all.

290
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:04,464
Stop it.

291
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:07,230
I really love your friend.

292
00:28:13,496 --> 00:28:15,746
Do you think this will make you
forget about Soong?

293
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:19,035
Ask yourself.

294
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:23,629
You are very lucky.

295
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:25,920
He's a good person.

296
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:27,533
He really loves you.

297
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,197
I love him.

298
00:28:31,197 --> 00:28:32,963
No good will come of it.

299
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,002
If First finds out, he'll be more mad.

300
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,613
I can tell he wanted to have sex
with me to forget you.

301
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:44,762
He still has feelings for you, Soong.

302
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:55,301
Jump.

303
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:03,825
Nont.

304
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:15,770
You're good.

305
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:18,239
Twins

306
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:20,184
are so identical.

307
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,091
I'm more hardcore than Nant.

308
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,654
Tell me.

309
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:51,388
Did you wear a mask
when you had sex with my brother?

310
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:54,185
- Huh?
- Damn it.

311
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,209
What a party pooper.

312
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:58,678
Let me come first.

313
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:01,248
Ouch.

314
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:08,436
When you wore a mask,

315
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:10,397
who did you do it with?

316
00:30:11,147 --> 00:30:13,764
If you don't start talking,
it won't just be hot wax.

317
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:19,932
- Start talking.
- Okay.

318
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:21,533
I had sex with your brother.

319
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:22,651
Yes.

320
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:24,205
But the mask...

321
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:25,783
I tried it with someone else,

322
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,057
not your brother.

323
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:29,143
It wasn't me.

324
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:30,674
I have never met him before.

325
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,401
Then who?

326
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:33,994
Who?

327
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,313
It was a party.

328
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:36,939
A masked party.

329
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,471
At that party,

330
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,150
everyone was fucking.

331
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:41,744
I didn't know who was who.

332
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,393
Who hosted the party?

333
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:47,182
Tell me who hosted the party.

334
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:48,385
- Damn it.
- Fine.

335
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:52,854
I met him when I was doing webcam.

336
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:55,886
Nant took me there.

337
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:59,268
The host of the party
was the guy who sold drugs to him.

338
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,487
What's his name?

339
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,276
What does he look like?

340
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:08,372
Tell me.

341
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:09,794
I don't know.

342
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,388
Come on.

343
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:15,052
I heard Nant called him Nuth.

344
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:17,302
But I don't know how he looks like.

345
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,372
He wore a dog mask at the party.

346
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:25,631
Thank you, Nuth.

347
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:29,592
I have never seen myself
smile that widely.

348
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,021
Really?

349
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:37,256
Do you want to see your smile
on a big screen?

350
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:39,806
Are you crazy?

351
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:41,449
No.

352
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:44,040
But I would like to see

353
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,985
a movie directed
by Nuthakrit Warinwachararot.

354
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,633
Look at this.

355
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:55,860
I just got paid.

356
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:58,958
I used the money
to take clips like this.

357
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,302
When will I have any savings?

358
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:05,327
Nuth.

359
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:08,795
Let me know if you need my help.

360
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:11,717
I want to help you save money.

361
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:15,889
I want your dream to come true.

362
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,133
Thanks, Phop.

363
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:45,797
Should I remind you how much trouble
you'll get if Daddy finds out?

364
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:47,477
Don't make him find out.

365
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:50,360
He has men everywhere.
He will find out someday.

366
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,008
So what?

367
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:53,596
I don't care if he knows.

368
00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:54,940
He loves me.

369
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:56,604
He will understand.

370
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:57,885
Fuck you, Porche.

371
00:32:58,815 --> 00:32:59,862
What kind of love does he have for you?

372
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,502
How will he feel if he finds out

373
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:04,151
that his sugar baby is being
a sugar daddy to someone else?

374
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:05,619
You got beaten up
because you looked at another man.

375
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,588
Won't he kill you
for sleeping with Jump?

376
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,378
I give him my body
in exchange for his money.

377
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,019
But you never do anything.

378
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:16,878
He takes care of you
because you're my brother.

379
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:19,058
You're not even my real brother.

380
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:21,628
If he finds out
that you gave Nant his money,

381
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:23,511
he will kill both of you.

382
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,996
(Game over)

383
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,130
So, Nont?

384
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,653
You didn't get anything?

385
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:05,614
Of course not. He got the information
and had sex with Jump.

386
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:07,989
Go inside.

387
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:09,708
I have to clean up here.

388
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:02,460
You said I treated you the best.

389
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,968
You wanted to make my dream come true.

390
00:36:07,236 --> 00:36:08,400
You acted like you liked me.

391
00:36:09,228 --> 00:36:10,900
Why did you sleep with someone else?

392
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,205
(I wanted to kill again)

393
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:39,915
(But I should feel better
after taking my medication)

394
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,674
(I will release my frustration
online again)

395
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:49,731
He's online.

396
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:54,669
Nant.

397
00:36:55,224 --> 00:36:56,342
Help me be a good actor.

398
00:37:01,998 --> 00:37:03,498
Hello, what's your name?

399
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,779
I'm Captain.

400
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:08,794
Can you show me your face?

401
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:10,701
Of course,

402
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:12,044
if your show me yours first.

403
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:32,889
Hey.

404
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:34,499
You're so hot.

405
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:49,185
You like wearing a mask too.

406
00:37:50,622 --> 00:37:52,239
Is it big? Can I see it?

407
00:37:59,992 --> 00:38:00,914
Shit.

408
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:03,180
Hey.

409
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:04,586
Why did you turn the microphone off?

410
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:07,109
Come on, what now?

411
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:10,046
Get him to go to the window,
so we can see what's around.

412
00:38:10,695 --> 00:38:12,367
Why don't we just ask him directly?

413
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,059
I'm sorry.

414
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:17,125
My brother was snooping.

415
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:19,070
It's exciting, isn't it?

416
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:21,414
Have you ever felt this way before?

417
00:38:21,922 --> 00:38:23,664
Can you go to the window?

418
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,586
Let's see if someone will see you.

419
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:46,462
Shit, that's Soong's room.

420
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:47,578
Huh?

421
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,938
How do we know which room it is?

422
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:51,781
Get him to jerk off
in front of his room.

423
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,812
- Will he do it?
- A horny person will do anything.

424
00:38:54,837 --> 00:38:56,406
- I've done it before.
- Huh?

425
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:04,003
What are you doing? You seem distracted.

426
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,412
I'm sorry.

427
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:08,949
I was just checking
if my brother was still snooping.

428
00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:12,386
Do you want to get even more excited?

429
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:15,902
Can you jerk off in front of your room?

430
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:21,195
Of course,

431
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:23,218
if you take off your mask.

432
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:25,250
I will.

433
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:27,586
But you have to jerk off
in front of your room first.

434
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:07,984
I did what you asked.

435
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:10,361
Can you take more videos of me?

436
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,353
Then show your face.

437
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,782
Of course, Nuth.

438
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,048
Nuth.

439
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:19,572
Nuth.

440
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:22,188
I'm so horny, Nuth.

441
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:24,103
Hey.

442
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:25,599
Have I told you my name?

443
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:27,568
How did you know my name?

444
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:29,498
Who the hell are you?

445
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:44,095
Nuth.

446
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:45,822
My first time was exciting.

447
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:47,650
I met a policeman on the way.

448
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:51,806
I thought I would get caught
on my first time.

449
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:56,216
But when I got there,

450
00:40:56,617 --> 00:40:59,250
I felt like someone was snooping.

451
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:02,536
I was so scared.

452
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:06,458
But it was okay when I met the customer.
It was fast.

453
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,293
But there was an issue.

454
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:10,458
He asked me to give him a blowjob.

455
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:13,028
I was scared at first.

456
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:15,715
Because you asked me to sell drugs,

457
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:17,081
not my body.

458
00:41:18,995 --> 00:41:20,213
But I did it in the end.

459
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:21,917
So he would pay me more.

460
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:23,229
Here.

461
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:28,471
I bought this from the restaurant
you told me about the other day.

462
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:31,213
Here.

463
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:43,209
What's wrong, Nuth?

464
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:47,076
I'm sorry, Phop.

465
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,171
I followed you.

466
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,043
I saw what you did to the customer

467
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:53,972
and I was so mad at you.

468
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:55,277
- I thought you lied to me.
- I knew it.

469
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:56,925
I knew

470
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,807
that you would be mad at me.

471
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,980
I didn't want to do it at first.

472
00:42:03,852 --> 00:42:05,680
But I wanted you to eat good food.

473
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,773
But if you're not okay with it,

474
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:11,586
I will never sleep with anyone again.

475
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:13,945
I don't care if I get paid or not.

476
00:42:14,805 --> 00:42:15,727
Why?

477
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:18,109
Why are you such a good person?

478
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:20,698
Why do you have to say
the truth all the time?

479
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:23,083
You can lie to me.

480
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:30,533
You said you like me.

481
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:33,479
I must treat you well.

482
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:35,776
What about you?

483
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:38,026
Do you like me?

484
00:42:44,448 --> 00:42:45,675
I treat you well.

485
00:42:46,237 --> 00:42:47,612
Do you think I hate you?

486
00:42:54,997 --> 00:42:55,778
Phop.

487
00:42:57,904 --> 00:42:58,998
Do you want to try dating?

488
00:44:18,964 --> 00:44:19,871
If we date,

489
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:21,558
don't date anyone else.

490
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:23,676
Don't meet people online.

491
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:28,262
See you, Nuth.

492
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,551
Okay.

493
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:34,893
We know where Nuthyim is.

494
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:37,554
If you're concerned,

495
00:44:37,616 --> 00:44:39,030
we can go investigate with you.

496
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:44,576
When all of this is over,
what are you going to do next?

497
00:44:45,311 --> 00:44:46,788
I want revenge.

498
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,225
He killed Nant.

499
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:50,608
He must be killed.
