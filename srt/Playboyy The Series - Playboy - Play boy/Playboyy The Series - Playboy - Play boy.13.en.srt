1
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:18,164
(Previously)
Do you think a student who's a prostitute

2
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:21,303
should continue studying
in our prestigious school?

3
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:23,498
So what now? This must involve Aob.

4
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,820
Let me warn you
that being with me is dangerous.

5
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:27,662
Tell me everything.

6
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,358
Why did Jason Lee order you
to kill my brother?

7
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,149
Don't you think
you're taking this too far?

8
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:32,354
Stop.

9
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:34,947
Come on, Zouey.
Let's go get him with me.

10
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:36,393
- Hey.
- Hey.

11
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:37,307
Shit.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,685
We have to run.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,716
- Shit.
- Come on.

14
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,169
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

15
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,263
- Shit.
- Fuck this.

16
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,724
An ex-con has turned a new leaf
and has been released.

17
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:50,357
He will continue
to do community service.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,057
An 81-year old grandma
quit drinking because of a stranger.

19
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:57,501
Therapy is supported for
rehabilitation to create new lives.

20
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:00,674
- Shit.
- Fuck.

21
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:01,775
- Shit.
- Come on.

22
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:02,692
Hurry.

23
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:03,926
Shit.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,892
What now?

25
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,111
Are they going to follow us?

26
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:11,197
Why did you do this?

27
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:14,036
How are Teena and Soong involved?

28
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:16,629
Lower your voice, Zouey.

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,278
You're so loud.
Are you giving a public statement?

30
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,078
You too.

31
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,649
- Huh?
- Just because he stole your man?

32
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:30,153
Were you going to beat him to death?

33
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,825
Fuck you.

34
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:33,310
You're jumping to conclusions again.

35
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:37,350
I just tried to get the truth from him.

36
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:38,569
I didn't mean to beat him up.

37
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:43,151
You didn't mean to?

38
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:48,557
- Shit.
- You didn't even tell me about this.

39
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,214
Because you wanted to hurt Teena.

40
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,339
That was close.

41
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,198
Soong and I were about
to reach our happy ending.

42
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:58,692
If something happened to him,

43
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:01,012
I would never forgive you, Nont.

44
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:02,606
Damn you.

45
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:04,973
All you care about is your brother.

46
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:10,911
You think I'm that terrible?

47
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:14,442
I just wanted to find out
about my brother.

48
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,554
I didn't mean to beat them up to death.

49
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:18,687
I don't know who those men are.

50
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:25,015
You called me a friend, right?

51
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,312
But friends don't do this.

52
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,331
If your brother knew what you have done,

53
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:37,288
he would be so disappointed.

54
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,717
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

55
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:46,788
- Hey.
- Fuck this.

56
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:48,725
- Where are you going?
- Don't go.

57
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:51,155
Hey.

58
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:55,853
- Nont.
- Did you get shot?

59
00:02:58,298 --> 00:02:59,025
- Nont.
- Shit.

60
00:02:59,322 --> 00:02:59,806
- Hey.
- Shit.

61
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,158
Hey.

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,400
Are you okay?

63
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:05,150
I'll take care of this.

64
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:23,954
Do it.

65
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,735
- Shoot me.
- Hey.

66
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,719
- Shoot me, so everything ends.
- Nont, no.

67
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,168
I won't let you expose Daddy.

68
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,770
Holy shit.

69
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,153
Shit.

70
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:00,433
Hey.

71
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:03,105
- Shit.
- Fuck.

72
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:06,600
Damn, Porche.

73
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,486
- I thought...
- Never.

74
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:46,885
I love you.

75
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,291
Let's make the most of the time we have.

76
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:52,533
Right?

77
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,086
Cut!

78
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,953
That was so sweet.

79
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:12,953
But this isn't the time for that.

80
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,953
People are about to die.

81
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:16,570
We should go now.

82
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:25,925
- I sent an SOS to my father.
- Huh?

83
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,166
- His men are probably here.
- Okay.

84
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,909
If the police are here,
these men won't dare do anything.

85
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,706
- Let's go.
- Come on.

86
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:35,401
Hurry up. Let's move.

87
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:02,173
Let's run away
and not risk our lives again, Jump.

88
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,338
Stay strong.

89
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:06,541
Where to?

90
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,916
Are you hurt?

91
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:09,361
How are we going to make a living?

92
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:10,705
Just let me go.

93
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:14,150
- You shouldn't have fallen for me.
- But I already have.

94
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:17,643
But we can die any day.

95
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,182
Your father wants you
to stop pursuing this.

96
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:31,846
It's too big of a deal.

97
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:34,864
I can't clean your mess everytime.

98
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,942
Just like what we always do
in this country?

99
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,145
Sweep things under the rug.

100
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:45,067
Let things slide
even though they're wrong.

101
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,208
Please understand me, Mr. Nont.

102
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:49,739
What you are doing isn't right either.

103
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:52,015
Please excuse us.

104
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:57,140
Puen.

105
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,218
Are you okay?

106
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,508
Hold onto me.

107
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:05,156
Get up.

108
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,687
Get up.

109
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:10,601
Get up. Take it slow.

110
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:13,187
Take it slow.

111
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,628
I didn't see your brother at the hotel.

112
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:33,018
But my boss' men were able
to kidnap him.

113
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:35,386
I don't know the real reason

114
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:37,597
why my boss wanted to kill him.

115
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,964
But my drugs that he took

116
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:43,245
belonged to Mr. Lee.

117
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,303
Why

118
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,374
are you telling me this now?

119
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:52,928
I think it's better for us
to be on the same side.

120
00:07:58,796 --> 00:07:59,569
I have to go.

121
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:01,444
Wait.

122
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:05,470
After going to Harvey Hotel,

123
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,400
where did your men find him?

124
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:09,666
Around the master's house.

125
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,548
The house that is open for rent.

126
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:13,892
I have to go.

127
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,600
"Playboyy"

128
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,729
(Episode 13: New life)

129
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,704
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,189
Ever since I showed up,

131
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,743
I've put you guys in trouble.

132
00:10:58,345 --> 00:10:59,431
You guys fought

133
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,650
and risked your lives.

134
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,053
I won't ask you to forgive me.

135
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,264
I wouldn't have forgiven you anyway.

136
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:19,741
I saw someone dying

137
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:22,756
right in front of me.

138
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,712
It could have been Teena

139
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:29,126
or a friend.

140
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,337
It could have been you.

141
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,337
I understand.

142
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:37,478
That's why

143
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:41,439
I won't ask you guys
to risk your lives for me again.

144
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:50,727
I'm leaving.

145
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,856
Just forget this ever happened.

146
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:00,999
Come on, man.

147
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,860
You're just going to leave us like this?

148
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:07,743
We're all in together.

149
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,430
We're going to solve this case together.

150
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,688
Man.

151
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:17,180
It doesn't mean I forgive you though.

152
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:25,769
Let him go.

153
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,816
We have other things to do in life.

154
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:31,753
But he's our friend.

155
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,566
Are you just going to let him go?

156
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,818
He's not my friend.

157
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,975
My friend is dead.

158
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:51,857
The purpose of every game in this world,

159
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:56,685
no matter if it's a sports game,

160
00:13:58,552 --> 00:13:59,232
a sex game,

161
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,326
or a power game,

162
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:06,544
is to win.

163
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:10,258
Sometimes

164
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:14,243
the only way to beat a close competitor

165
00:14:18,063 --> 00:14:20,094
is to make them think that we're losing

166
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:24,250
and get back at them later.

167
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,941
Should we do one last role play?

168
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,402
Fuck the real coach

169
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:39,385
like you would fuck me.

170
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:43,589
Who would be horny after
being kicked out of the team?

171
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:47,201
I did that

172
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:51,162
to create false evidence
and mislead the principal

173
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:55,451
that Captain fucked the old coach.

174
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:02,459
Make him misunderstand Puen

175
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:05,057
while I send this clip

176
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:07,314
to the principal.

177
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:10,939
He changed his mind

178
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:12,596
from expulsion

179
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:14,728
to a 1-week suspension.

180
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:19,080
Loyalty can always refute a lawsuit

181
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,549
in this country.

182
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:52,625
I told you about a guy I dated
who was very jealous.

183
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,351
He's Jason Lee.

184
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,579
Now he's my boss.

185
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,563
I'm sorry, Puen.

186
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:04,602
You got in trouble because of me.

187
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,594
I almost died because of love.

188
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:15,188
What?

189
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:17,413
Did I mishear you?

190
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,080
I failed to do my job.

191
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:21,971
The boss will kill me.

192
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:24,072
You still want to love me?

193
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,322
Yeah.

194
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:28,283
I'm in love with you.

195
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:31,885
You are difficult to love,
so I'm giving it a shot.

196
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,572
You deserve to be loved, Aob.

197
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:39,848
We understand each other so well.

198
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:42,802
Fighting this alone is tiring.

199
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:45,606
But I am

200
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,614
like a bonus.

201
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,973
You're good with words.

202
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:57,484
What about you?

203
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,422
Are you good?

204
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:17,801
Does it hurt?

205
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,257
I saw the clip.

206
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:19,210
Why didn't you tell me?

207
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:31,458
That might be the real reason

208
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:36,810
that Nant is dead.

209
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,287
You're lucky

210
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:05,240
you're still alive.

211
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:08,240
You know god damn well.

212
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:10,342
I hate

213
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:11,920
repeating

214
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:14,372
my order, right?

215
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,263
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,330
I want the traitor,

217
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:30,509
the guy who slept with my son,

218
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:32,939
and the guy who dyed his hair

219
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:35,119
tomorrow.

220
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:38,005
I want their corpses beside my bed

221
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,832
by breakfast

222
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:42,926
tomorrow!

223
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:45,168
Okay?

224
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,418
Okay?

225
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:09,449
There must be a way

226
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:11,722
for us to love each other.

227
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:13,527
Like I said,

228
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:15,191
it's impossible.

229
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:17,061
You should get over it.

230
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:19,186
I don't love you.

231
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,771
If he's going to get killed anyway,

232
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:57,638
I will do it myself.

233
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:08,794
Happy now?

234
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:16,703
Why?

235
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,086
He's dead.

236
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:44,190
Come here.

237
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,307
Everything's going to be alright.

238
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:51,783
It's okay. I'm here.

239
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:55,393
It's okay.

240
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:57,455
Everything

241
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,408
is going to be alright.

242
00:23:37,912 --> 00:23:38,928
Are you happy now?

243
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:42,212
I'm left with no one.

244
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:45,938
You don't think
you're guilty at all, Nont?

245
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,797
I didn't mean to.

246
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:49,571
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

247
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:51,477
You told Captain to abuse Puen.

248
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:53,946
- Wasn't that hurting him?
- Fine.

249
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:55,836
I'm sorry.

250
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,555
But do you realize

251
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,047
that you're the reason I'm like this?

252
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:02,278
You sold drugs

253
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:03,408
and had sex with strangers.

254
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,742
Why did you go to the dark side?

255
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:06,305
Nont.

256
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:08,400
The world is dark.

257
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:12,677
It's dark even if you close
your eyes or turn away.

258
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,669
So what do you want me to do, Nant?

259
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:16,575
What do you want me to do?

260
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,028
Use your head.

261
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,341
Don't do what they did to me.

262
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,794
So tell me what happened.

263
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,320
Tell me everything, Nant.

264
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,578
Just tell me.

265
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,711
Tell me.

266
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:36,851
- Nant, tell me.
- Nont.

267
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,414
- Tell me.
- Nont.

268
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,851
- Pull yourself together, Nont.
- Tell me.

269
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,156
- Nant, tell me.
- Nont.

270
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,159
- Pull yourself together.
- Tell me.

271
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:48,831
Pull yourself together.

272
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,659
Okay?

273
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,495
Calm down.

274
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:21,759
Listen to me.

275
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:25,220
You can't go back
to your friends' place.

276
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,736
Okay.

277
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:36,830
His men saw me
at the abandoned building.

278
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:40,083
Jason must know

279
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:41,489
that I'm Nant's twin.

280
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:44,223
I've packed my things.

281
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,769
- Let me stay with you.
- No.

282
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:49,895
Daddy knows I helped you.

283
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:52,575
My house has been burned down.

284
00:25:58,843 --> 00:25:59,851
I'll hide at Harvey Hotel.

285
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:03,515
They wouldn't think
we would go back there.

286
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:06,374
Let's go there.

287
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:09,757
Be extra careful.

288
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:30,938
Wait for me there.

289
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:32,792
Enter through the back door

290
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:34,261
in case someone's at the front door.

291
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,058
Wait.

292
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:39,831
Where are you going?

293
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:40,823
To see Jump's mother.

294
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,964
She needs to run away.

295
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:48,870
Jump is dead.

296
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,175
Porche shot him,
so he wouldn't be stalked.

297
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:20,239
I saw someone dying

298
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,301
right in front of me.

299
00:27:25,497 --> 00:27:27,059
It could have been Teena

300
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:29,536
or a friend.

301
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:01,611
Want me to help clean up the mess?

302
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:05,262
No need.

303
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,911
I will get the body disposed myself.

304
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:39,382
(Where are you, Keen?)

305
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,000
(Why aren't you picking up my calls
or responding to my texts?

306
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:50,898
Holy shit!

307
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:53,453
Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:56,228
I didn't think you were here.

309
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:29,788
That's my boyfriend.

310
00:30:31,593 --> 00:30:33,569
Take it down a notch, bestie.

311
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:37,189
I'm sorry. I'm not used
to having men around the house.

312
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,088
Come on.

313
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,196
First and Porche used
to walk around naked.

314
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:02,521
Hey.

315
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:04,794
Are you sure about Nont?

316
00:31:11,922 --> 00:31:14,125
You should at least
ask First and Porche to come back.

317
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:16,453
I can't do that.

318
00:31:17,898 --> 00:31:19,258
Soong is Jason's driver.

319
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:22,281
First and Jump are escaping.

320
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:25,508
We should leave things like this,
so no one is in danger.

321
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:32,978
I know you miss your friends.

322
00:31:38,681 --> 00:31:41,181
- When this is over...
- Let's leave things like this, Captain.

323
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,595
First is letting Aob and Puen
move in here.

324
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:48,387
Huh?

325
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:03,489
The room is in the basement.

326
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,129
You need to walk upstairs
to use the bathroom.

327
00:32:07,835 --> 00:32:08,671
Will that be okay?

328
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:13,117
I've lived in worse places.

329
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:17,773
I plan to stay here temporarily
while I'm being hunted.

330
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,687
You didn't have
to do all of this, First.

331
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:24,140
No.

332
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:28,330
I got Aob and you in trouble.

333
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,753
Never mind.

334
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:35,643
I was wrong too.

335
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:40,471
Don't treat anyone like this again.

336
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:37,854
So what now?

337
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:40,607
Have you looked for a new lounge?

338
00:33:42,872 --> 00:33:43,911
I can't do that.

339
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,005
The boss knows every lounge.

340
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:49,591
You'll die the first day
you start working anywhere.

341
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:51,216
Shit.

342
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:55,411
So we're back to being
roadside prostitutes.

343
00:33:57,844 --> 00:33:58,672
That's too risky.

344
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:00,742
Let's find something else to do.

345
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,633
What are we going to do?

346
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:06,180
I only know how to play sports.

347
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:08,477
What about you?

348
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:13,336
Massaging, working out, and fucking.

349
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:17,300
I also make my own
chicken breast smoothie.

350
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:19,472
There.

351
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:20,964
What?

352
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,354
- Chicken breast.
- No.

353
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,448
Are you crazy?

354
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,526
I can't beat convenience stores
and big companies.

355
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,761
You should give it a shot.

356
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,477
We can't run away forever.

357
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:55,359
What's the matter with you?

358
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:02,648
Chicken breast

359
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,164
helps you work out better.

360
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:17,659
Do you want to see

361
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,362
how good your chicken breast is?

362
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:22,798
To Jump's dorm, sir?

363
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:30,746
No need to.

364
00:36:32,402 --> 00:36:33,738
Take me to massage parlor.

365
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,184
(Mr. Lee isn't going to your dorm)

366
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,262
(First: This is annoying)

367
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:13,137
(First: It's like it isn't over)

368
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,083
(Zouey: Let's make it over now)

369
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,132
(First: It's Nont's business,
let him handle it)

370
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:19,054
(Porche: But it involves my Daddy)

371
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:21,069
(Porche: So it involves me too)

372
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:24,131
(Zouey: You just like being detectives!)

373
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,030
(I'm expelled,
so I'll open a detective agency)

374
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:31,179
(I really need a good plot twist now)

375
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:42,923
I'm sorry.

376
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,887
Your punishment was less severe
because you led the team to victory.

377
00:38:13,473 --> 00:38:15,309
This university has double standards.

378
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:17,786
But good for you.

379
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:20,418
You shouldn't have been punished
in the first place.

380
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:23,886
I shouldn't have filmed you.

381
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,914
You were expelled instead.

382
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:35,453
I'm sorry.

383
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:40,188
It's over.

384
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,508
My dream of becoming
a professional athlete is over.

385
00:38:45,594 --> 00:38:46,500
Fuck, Puen.

386
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:48,078
That bastard.

387
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:55,796
It's not over.

388
00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:57,718
I'll help you.

389
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:02,632
I'll introduce you
to the association's team.

390
00:39:04,765 --> 00:39:07,265
Many professional athletes
didn't graduate from university.

391
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:12,385
You are...

392
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,174
You are so kind to me.

393
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,026
What would I do without you?

394
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,130
Can we still meet up?

395
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:52,130
I love you.

396
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,997
I don't want to be separated from you.

397
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:58,982
You are my boyfriend.

398
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:01,446
I won't let you go that easily.

399
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:26,782
Phop.

400
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,860
Are you still thinking about it?

401
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,277
Of course.

402
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:39,550
I think we should tell Nont
about that clip.

403
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,214
So this will all come to end.

404
00:40:43,894 --> 00:40:44,676
I'm done, Phop.

405
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:47,152
Ever since I met you,

406
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,465
I've turned a new leaf.

407
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:58,171
Mr. Lee called me last night.

408
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,651
He probably wants to send over
the last batch of drugs.

409
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:02,628
But I didn't pick up.

410
00:41:03,285 --> 00:41:04,207
I don't want to get involved anymore.

411
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:08,872
How are we going to make a living?

412
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:11,583
I don't want to be a prostitute anymore.

413
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,586
Let's find something else to do.

414
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:18,555
I have some savings.

415
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:23,167
What about your movie?

416
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:26,164
I read the script. It's really good.

417
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,156
I want your dream to come true.

418
00:41:31,437 --> 00:41:32,749
We can have many dreams.

419
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:35,304
One of my dreams has come true.

420
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:41,846
After this batch of drugs,

421
00:41:42,315 --> 00:41:43,158
let's stop doing this

422
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:45,630
and find something else to do.

423
00:41:53,516 --> 00:41:54,578
My movie can wait.

424
00:41:56,586 --> 00:41:58,242
But I don't want to lose you.

425
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:24,951
Let's grow up together.

426
00:43:06,573 --> 00:43:07,737
(Mr. Lee isn't going to your dorm)

427
00:43:13,854 --> 00:43:14,932
(Your plan worked)

428
00:43:26,695 --> 00:43:27,359
Thank you.

429
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:28,999
Daddy stopped hunting down Jump.

430
00:43:30,268 --> 00:43:30,877
I was shocked.

431
00:43:32,158 --> 00:43:33,151
You didn't tell me about this.

432
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,276
I had to do that

433
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:37,640
because you tortured Aob
without telling me.

434
00:43:40,198 --> 00:43:41,183
You're unbelievable.

435
00:43:41,566 --> 00:43:42,433
You're a journalist,

436
00:43:43,018 --> 00:43:44,612
but your special effects were amazing.

437
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,680
If he says he will send people over
to clean up the mess,

438
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:04,508
that means he doesn't believe you.

439
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,878
You have to keep acting.

440
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,561
Now we have to keep acting.

441
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,340
Thank you for helping us.

442
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,192
I was helping Jump, not you.

443
00:44:37,418 --> 00:44:38,364
But you are aware

444
00:44:39,491 --> 00:44:40,741
that you and I are over, right?

445
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:48,247
I'm sorry for being obsessed
about taking revenge on Porche

446
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,825
and almost getting you killed.

447
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:53,803
What about the boss?

448
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:58,373
All you figured out
was that he sells drugs as well?

449
00:45:00,005 --> 00:45:00,599
Yeah.

450
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:05,586
But that's all I need.

451
00:45:08,946 --> 00:45:10,930
Even though I don't know
what happened to my brother,

452
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:14,605
we know what a terrible man
Jason Lee is.

453
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:17,886
We must continue what Nant wanted to do.

454
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,206
We must expose him.

455
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,852
But I must be the one who covers this.

456
00:45:25,768 --> 00:45:27,112
So what now?

457
00:45:28,737 --> 00:45:30,893
Prom secretly installed a bug
before coming to help me.

458
00:45:32,057 --> 00:45:33,612
We will know his every move.

459
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:38,431
Once we get the evidence,
we must catch him red-handed.

460
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:02,935
Sir.

461
00:46:03,426 --> 00:46:04,161
Your pizza is here.

462
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:06,184
I have updates on Jason Lee.

463
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:08,551
Drug delivery tomorrow night

464
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:10,270
around the building
where Nant's body was found.

465
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,404
I heard you talking with
the guys from university.

466
00:46:12,582 --> 00:46:13,950
Why don't you find them suspicious?

467
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,098
Nuth didn't tell us everything.

468
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:19,895
Something happened to Nant
before he set up his own suicide

469
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,740
and sent the clip over.

470
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:24,234
Fuck.

471
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:27,063
What in a Jeffrey Dahmer series
is this shit?
