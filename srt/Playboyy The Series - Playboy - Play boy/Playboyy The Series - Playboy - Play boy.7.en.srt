1
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:18,194
(Previously) To get all the suspects
together to find more information...

2
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:19,764
I want you to make one suggestion each.

3
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:20,491
Why don't we host a party?

4
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,772
- Yes!
- Woo!

5
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:24,045
Never have I ever had sex
wearing a mask.

6
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:25,655
Are you sure this plan will work?

7
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,367
He still has feelings for you, Soong.

8
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:29,000
He's a good person.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,656
He really loves you.

10
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:32,672
Should I remind you how much trouble
you'll get if Daddy finds out?

11
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,484
He takes care of you
because you're my brother.

12
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,562
You're not even my real brother.

13
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:41,260
Tell me if there's anything
you want me to do, Nuth.

14
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:45,120
- Shit, that's Soong's room.
- Huh?

15
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:46,573
How do we know which room it is?

16
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,034
Get him to jerk off
in front of his room.

17
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,182
Nuth.

18
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:51,426
I'm so horny, Nuth.

19
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,536
Hey.

20
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,466
Have I told you my name?

21
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:01,559
The rapist has been caught.

22
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:03,724
His wife has taken revenge using glue.

23
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:05,791
She paid a fine of 200,000 baht.

24
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,972
He was taken to the hospital
in poor condition.

25
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:09,739
The police suspect it
to be a revenge attack.

26
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:12,958
Human relationships,

27
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:17,310
no matter how complicated,
can be explained

28
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,648
according to the principles of
ecological relationships of organisms.

29
00:01:28,492 --> 00:01:29,977
Mutualism

30
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:32,668
is when both parties give

31
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,082
and both parties receive.

32
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,061
Protocooperation

33
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:48,686
is when both parties
do not need to be together,

34
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:52,421
but it is better when they do.

35
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,267
Commensalism

36
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,595
is when only one party benefits

37
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,694
and the other party
doesn't benefit or lose anything.

38
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:15,334
Maybe?

39
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,560
Parasitism

40
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,176
is when one is taken advantage of

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,840
and the other party benefits
from the relationship.

42
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:38,411
(Come and see me) (Bring a
change of clothes to stay over)

43
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:52,785
Competition

44
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:56,277
is when both parties use
the same resources to survive.

45
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,598
This creates competition

46
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,975
and causes damages to both parties.

47
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:20,726
Lastly,

48
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,593
predation

49
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,101
is when the predator benefits

50
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:28,023
and the prey gets nothing

51
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:32,927
and loses benefits.

52
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:46,274
(Let me know when you arrive,
come find me later)

53
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,156
After I'm done with Prom...

54
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:49,321
(If you succeed, I'll reward you
If you don't, I'll console you)

55
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:50,414
I will have to let him go.

56
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:55,094
I don't care
if he'll be heartbroken or upset.

57
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:01,526
What about Nant's
relationship with Nuth?

58
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,128
Was Nant his prey?

59
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:06,956
We'll find out soon.

60
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,900
(Playboyy The Series)

61
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:33,440
This is the last time
I'm going to tell you, First.

62
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:36,526
All right. I'm going to tell you this
one last time too.

63
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:38,964
- Stop being dirty and clean your room.
- Stop being such a clean freak.

64
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:40,175
(Episode 7: Time for revenge)

65
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,214
Good job.

66
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:46,263
We're in the middle of the investigation
to find our missing friend.

67
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:49,076
But you're still having
these stupid fights.

68
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:50,787
Damn it.

69
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,045
I know you're heartbroken.

70
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,012
But your side of the bed

71
00:05:57,254 --> 00:05:59,012
has tissue papers, cum,

72
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,121
candy wrappers, snacks,

73
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,691
and your smelly unwashed clothes.

74
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,308
Don't you think it's too dirty?

75
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:10,613
I'm like sleeping at the community's
mushroom breeding center.

76
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:11,957
Come on, man.

77
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:13,399
No one is as clean as you.

78
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:16,149
No one wipes their fingerprints
from their phone's screen every day.

79
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:19,337
No one sprays sanitizer
into the air conditioner like you.

80
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,376
Does your father work
at the Department of Health?

81
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,329
This is hot.

82
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,137
This is really hot.

83
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:27,871
Your fight is fiery.

84
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:30,519
Wait.

85
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:32,621
Hey, it's burning.

86
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:33,793
- Hey.
- Shit.

87
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:36,051
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

88
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:38,457
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing?

89
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:41,230
- Hurry up.
- Get some water.

90
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:43,808
- Hurry up.
- You'll burn the house down.

91
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:39,356
What are you worried about?

92
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:42,051
We know where Nuthyim is.

93
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,273
Yeah.

94
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:47,266
But what if he didn't
make Nant disappear?

95
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:49,554
What if he killed Nant?

96
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:52,641
What will happen if I find him?

97
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:56,161
I'll ask my guy.

98
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:58,653
He went to a masked party
with Nuthyim.

99
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,989
He must know
what kind of a person Nuth is.

100
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:05,114
Yeah.

101
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:07,700
If you're concerned,

102
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,786
we can go investigate with you.

103
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,309
Thank you.

104
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:23,262
But it's okay.

105
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,601
Let Nant and I
be the only ones in trouble.

106
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:50,658
Calling it a masked party
is an overstatement.

107
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:53,491
It's just hooking up at the hotel room.

108
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:57,360
Nuth, who is the party host,
took video clips.

109
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,025
But he didn't post them anywhere.

110
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,517
What kind of a person is he?

111
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,353
He seemed polite

112
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:09,239
and well-mannered.

113
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:11,818
He seemed kind of mature.

114
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,521
He's an oldie like you, huh?

115
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:16,966
Ouch.

116
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:21,188
Did he seem sadistic?

117
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:24,293
Did he hurt anyone?

118
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,832
I don't know.

119
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,184
I didn't see him fucking anyone.

120
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:32,488
But everyone at the party
seemed sadistic.

121
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:35,976
I went there because I wanted to try.

122
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:38,894
But I didn't like it.

123
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,300
So I left early.

124
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:44,698
Really? So you didn't see anything else.

125
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:48,956
Who did you sleep with at the party?

126
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:56,670
What's up with all these questions?

127
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:58,139
Are you jealous?

128
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:00,920
Of course not.

129
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:02,631
We're not a couple.

130
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:05,876
But if you let me play
in the next match,

131
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:07,728
I'll let you call me baby.

132
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:37,749
Jump.

133
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:40,015
Jump.

134
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,187
Jump.

135
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:44,974
Jump.

136
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,491
Sorry, the number you have dialled...

137
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,740
Damn it. Fuck.

138
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:10,153
Who were you looking at?

139
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,333
I was looking for the one who poked me,
but I didn't find anyone.

140
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,029
What are you doing?

141
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:16,946
I'm fishing.

142
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,134
Did you get any?

143
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:19,384
Do you see any?

144
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:21,907
Nothing.

145
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,243
I'm so happy, Nuth.

146
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:42,147
I get to hang out outside.

147
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,688
I'm usually in my room.

148
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,133
I'm like a caveman.

149
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,142
I can't believe you.

150
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:02,648
You're cute and sexy at the same time.

151
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:09,398
Suck it properly
or I'll have you suck something else.

152
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,174
Wow.

153
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,635
That angle is great.

154
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,861

We can meet up sometimes)

155

Someone asked about you)

160

You're so mean.

161
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,421
You're going to make me
stand here and watch?

162
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:16,452
Just keep standing there.

163
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:17,898
It hasn't been an hour yet.

164
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,099
Is this how you take revenge?

165
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:23,532
I was wrong
for not telling you everything.

166
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:26,517
I was afraid you would get mad.

167
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:32,181
Don't you think I should be mad?

168
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,173
You said you were going
to tell me everything.

169
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:40,345
I had to hear that you tried to
take my virginity from someone else.

170
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:14,164
Take that.

171
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,498
Let's take a break.

172
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,201
I can't draw anymore.

173
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:13,443
The statue of David

174
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:15,717
doesn't have an erection.

175
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:25,808
Is this how you're going
to take revenge?

176
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:27,699
Wait for me.

177
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:32,430
Listen to me.

178
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,613
There's nothing going on between us.

179
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:38,420
You know that he's horny.

180
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,592
When a hot guy gets close to him,

181
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:44,053
his ass wiggles and he'll do anything.

182
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:52,474
I just wanted to make him fall for me

183
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,661
and trick him
into making me the starter.

184
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,435
If he does something to you,

185
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:01,815
I'll tell the professor about this
and he'll get kicked out.

186
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:04,987
I'm serious.

187
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,886
We're not dating.

188
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,862
Trust me.

189
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,706
I like girls.

190
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,396
Trust me.

191
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,521
You graduated from my faculty.

192
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,435
Why are you a model?

193
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:29,760
Don't you want to be an artist?

194
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:34,083
I don't get to "want" things in life.

195
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,615
I do things because I need to.

196
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:40,529
My father passed away when I graduated.

197
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,591
He left a massive debt that he didn't
tell anyone about, even my mother.

198
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:47,750
Our house and cars were taken away.

199
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:50,680
My mother and I ran away
from the creditors to another province.

200
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:53,883
It was like an action movie.

201
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:57,836
I'm sorry to hear that.

202
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:01,721
That's why you had to work at Playboyy.

203
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:04,972
Yeah.

204
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,019
But I don't regret it.

205
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:09,542
It's life.

206
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,739
We just have to do what we have to do.

207
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,559
My future doesn't seem so bright, huh?

208
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:19,504
You should have a crush on someone else.

209
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,543
Hey.

210
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,848
If you say that again,
I'll be so mad at you.

211
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:28,023
I...

212
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:30,077
I have everything in life,
except for love.

213
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:33,983
Don't hate me for saying this.

214
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:37,390
But when things are easy,

215
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,741
life seems a little meaningless.

216
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,458
"One Percent and One Three-angled Base"

217
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,231
sounds like a good movie name.

218
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,559
- Hey.
- Be careful.

219
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,482
Be careful.

220
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,404
Come on.

221
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:04,892
Why did you bump into them?

222
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,321
Apologize to them.

223
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,462
Hey.

224
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,845
Can you show me your face?

225
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,899
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

226
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,368
I'm fine. Just be more careful.

227
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,394
I apologize on behalf of my boyfriend.

228
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:21,496
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:23,746
- Apologize to them.
- I'm sorry.

230
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:49,075
Every warrior has wounds.

231
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:52,091
You don't need so many.

232
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:55,755
Your knee is bleeding.

233
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,477
Nuth.

234
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:11,766
Nuth.

235
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,988
I'm not dead yet.

236
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:15,370
You don't have to look so scared.

237
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:23,933
Are you high on drugs?

238
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,766
You should use less.

239
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,258
Were you mad at someone else
and took it out on me, Jump?

240
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:04,610
You were hardcore.

241
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:06,705
No.

242
00:21:07,103 --> 00:21:08,400
I just missed you.

243
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,474
I had to rush to work last night.

244
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:13,342
And...

245
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:15,997
Don't you have to work today?

246
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:19,560
Won't your boss be upset?

247
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:21,920
Fuck him.

248
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:24,298
I'm free now.

249
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:28,094
Do you want to go again?

250
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,126
Okay.

251
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:32,313
If it still hurts,

252
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,587
we don't have to do any penetration.

253
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:36,441
You think I can't take it?

254
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:39,277
Are you sure?

255
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:41,901
What do you think?

256
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:26,065
So?

257
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,112
That was a harsh punishment.

258
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:29,972
What did you do to upset Coach?

259
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:36,691
Nothing.

260
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:39,495
He was fine this morning.

261
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,886
I don't know what has gotten into him.

262
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:54,670
Did you give me a wipe?

263
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:56,475
Huh?

264
00:22:58,303 --> 00:22:59,163
No.

265
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:01,421
Probably the nurse.

266
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:06,374
Get some rest. Don't overthink it.

267
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:39,203
Nant never told me
about the guy called Nuth.

268
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,719
I don't know how he is.

269
00:23:44,438 --> 00:23:45,781
We shouldn't get involved.

270
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:47,734
Give the evidence to the police

271
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:49,893
and let them handle it.

272
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:53,128
I want revenge.

273
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,667
I don't just want him arrested.

274
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:00,268
If he killed Nant,

275
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:03,248
I want him dead.

276
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,219
Keep this.

277
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:37,446
Do you know how to use it?

278
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:40,219
Yes.

279
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:43,035
My dad taught me
when we were in Hawaii.

280
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:22,718
When all of this is over

281
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,648
and everything is cleared tonight,

282
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:27,953
what are you going to do next?

283
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,640
I will leave quietly

284
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,554
like how I arrived.

285
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:40,668
Can't you stay?

286
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:43,785
Stay with me.

287
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:46,972
You have new friends now

288
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:50,597
including me.

289
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:06,126
I can't.

290
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,743
I can't live like this anymore.

291
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:15,595
This is not my life.

292
00:26:17,974 --> 00:26:18,982
I'm not Nant.

293
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:11,953
Please don't go. Don't go. Please.

294
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:14,844
Let's talk it out.

295
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:17,110
What an improvement!

296
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:18,821
First a fraud.

297
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:21,731
- Now a catfish.
- Hey, I know I'm wrong.

298
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm totally wrong.

299
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:25,239
- But...
- Let me go.

300
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:29,192
I don't want to have
anything to do with you anymore.

301
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,239
I can't live without you.

302
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:34,476
Like...

303
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:37,734
How often do we find someone
who fits us like a glove?

304
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:41,460
And just the idea
of actually finding that person

305
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,835
but then letting him go,

306
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,777
aches me bad, man.

307
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:49,707
I can't let it happen.

308
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:51,964
First, please.

309
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:53,511
I want you back.

310
00:28:59,832 --> 00:29:00,645
Okay?

311
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:06,746
Where have you been?

312
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,551
Why didn't you respond?

313
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,059
I thought something bad happened.

314
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:11,671
You should leave.

315
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,067
- You looked through my phone.
- Why did you lie to me?

316
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,426
Your daddy's car.

317
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:18,528
Your daddy's shop.

318
00:29:19,168 --> 00:29:20,910
He's your sugar daddy.

319
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:23,340
How am I wrong?
I admit that I have a sugar daddy.

320
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:24,950
But I'm your sugar daddy.

321
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,132
- How is it different?
- I don't want any trouble.

322
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,646
I've been through this before.

323
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:31,989
Let me go.

324
00:29:38,455 --> 00:29:39,674
I can't live without you.

325
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:44,096
I know I treated you badly.

326
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,698
Yes, I'm a sugar baby.

327
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:49,526
I treated you how I was treated.

328
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:53,387
I was wrong for treating you
as if you had no feelings.

329
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:56,443
But now I want you.

330
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,825
I'm used to having you by my side.

331
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,396
Stay with me.

332
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:03,466
I will treat you well, Jump.

333
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,500
Please give me a chance.

334
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:07,177
Why did you do that?

335
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:10,667
You wanted to piss me off.

336
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:13,425
What was I doing?

337
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,160
I was just taking care of the client.

338
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,855
What's up with you?

339
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:20,863
You ignored the client
and he complained.

340
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,941
Why?

341
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:25,458
You have a crush

342
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:27,098
on a loser like me, huh?

343
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:30,786
- So you couldn't help yourself.
- This is how you pay me back?

344
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:32,973
Do it to me.

345
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:34,856
Don't do it in front of the client.

346
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,114
What's the matter with you?

347
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,090
Wow.

348
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,184
I was just messing with you.

349
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:42,458
You don't have to get so upset.

350
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:48,699
But I'm glad
that I'm that important to you.

351
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,991
Like I said,

352
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:56,811
I will be better than you someday.

353
00:31:58,514 --> 00:32:00,241
But that day came so quickly.

354
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:03,101
You lost.

355
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:20,818
(I practiced so hard I fainted)

356
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:21,794
(Get well soon)

357
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:22,810
(Get well soon? He's not sick)

358
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:23,678
(Thanks, First)

359
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,716
(To be an athlete, you must practice
Get well soon, son)

360
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:25,685
(Taiwanese rugby player)

361
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,747
(Lives in Taiwan)

362
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,591
What did I do wrong?

363
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:06,747
Why did you have to punish me hard?

364
00:33:07,974 --> 00:33:08,833
I didn't punish you.

365
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:11,377
You want to be a starter, don't you?

366
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:13,171
So you must practice hard.

367
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:18,468
So you don't have to sleep with me
in exchange for that position.

368
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,564
So this is your revenge.

369
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:37,689
I'm sorry.

370
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:44,193
You didn't respect me.

371
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:47,412
You said I was horny

372
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:48,919
and that my ass wiggled
when a guy came around.

373
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:50,708
What do you think of me?

374
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:57,524
You cared more about your appearance
than you cared about me.

375
00:33:58,141 --> 00:33:59,383
This is obvious enough.

376
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:02,211
You want me to say

377
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,334
that I like you and we're talking?

378
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:18,946
If we were in a world where there
was no discrimination among athletes,

379
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:21,715
I would have told
the whole team that I liked you.

380
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:33,221
Captain.

381
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:37,807
Before telling the whole team,

382
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,994
you should tell me first.

383
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,419
You caught me.

384
00:35:02,228 --> 00:35:03,283
I like you.

385
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:08,541
I've liked you since the first night.

386
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:53,614
First, please.

387
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:55,170
I want you back.

388
00:35:58,436 --> 00:35:59,623
I'll make up with you

389
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,639
on one condition.

390
00:36:04,506 --> 00:36:05,365
You are my slave.

391
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:08,438
Gonna take it

392
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:09,868
or leave it?

393
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,565
From now on,

394
00:36:25,698 --> 00:36:26,995
I am your master.

395
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,002
Revenge

396
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,634
is a dish best served cold.

397
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:48,312
Deeper.

398
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,624
What's wrong with you?
You like it, don't you?

399
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:04,697
And revenge

400
00:38:06,488 --> 00:38:08,746
is just so sweet.

401
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,137
I'm sorry.

402
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:04,754
It's my payback time.

403
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:55,855
(Hey) (Zouey, you always type
"hey" and don't say anything else)

404
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,222
(I saw Nuthyim while on a date
and working on my new project)

405
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:58,222
(Please get to the point)

406
00:40:00,455 --> 00:40:01,479
(He seems nice and has a boyfriend)

407
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:02,293
(He's too polite
to wear a mask and stab Nant)

408
00:40:18,842 --> 00:40:19,858
I couldn't tell

409
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,478
that you are emotionally unstable.

410
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:26,012
I'm much better
after taking my medication

411
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:27,895
and meeting you.

412
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,571
Will you be so mad that you beat me up?

413
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:41,805
No way.

414
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:43,328
I love you so much.

415
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,101
I've never met someone as nice as you.

416
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:49,397
Love you long time.

417
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:53,534
You always make it seem
like I'm going to die in front of you.

418
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,558
Did your ex-boyfriend die
in front of you?

419
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:17,806
Nuth.

420
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,626
Nuth.

421
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,907
I'm sorry.

422
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:33,340
Are you mad at me?

423
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:38,480
I'm sorry.

424
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:47,179
No, I'm not mad.

425
00:41:48,343 --> 00:41:49,179
Why would I be?

426
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:51,523
I have to go.

427
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:53,843
I'm meeting the client at 8 p.m.

428
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:56,690
Okay.

429
00:41:57,377 --> 00:41:58,330
Hurry back.

430
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:01,229
I can't live without you.

431
00:42:08,478 --> 00:42:10,681
You've been waiting for me
ever since the first day.

432
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,720
We haven't even kissed today.

433
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:14,704
But I'm so happy.

434
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,314
Not having sex can be joyful too.

435
00:42:27,824 --> 00:42:29,675
- You should go now.
- Okay.

436
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:31,910
- I'll go now.
- Okay.

437
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:04,134
Do you know

438
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:09,157
that you're the first person
I let into this room voluntarily?

439
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:13,267
This is my deepest secret.

440
00:43:21,512 --> 00:43:22,402
Zouey.

441
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:25,410
You have so many art pieces
you can have your own exhibition.

442
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:29,679
Who would let me do it?

443
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,124
They're all nude portraits.

444
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:37,725
There are exhibitions
for nude portraits.

445
00:43:40,272 --> 00:43:41,311
I think you're good.

446
00:43:42,558 --> 00:43:43,589
Very good.

447
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:53,120
Do you know what a muse is?

448
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:57,393
A god who inspires people
to make art

449
00:43:57,799 --> 00:43:58,979
in Greek mythology.

450
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,862
You are my muse.

451
00:44:11,842 --> 00:44:13,381
Ever since the first day we met,

452
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,217
I've drawn a picture of you every day.

453
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:19,295
I get so upset

454
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:22,248
because I can't make it look like you.

455
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:26,854
I've realized
that it will never look like you.

456
00:44:32,352 --> 00:44:35,001
Because the picture of you
that I see and remember

457
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:36,743
is better than who you are.

458
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:40,115
I thought too highly of you.

459
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:45,381
You are not perfect like my dream.

460
00:44:46,396 --> 00:44:47,865
But I still like you.

461
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,547
Zouey.

462
00:44:57,407 --> 00:44:58,727
You understand now

463
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:02,149
that even if you think
badly of yourself

464
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,152
and think you're imperfect,

465
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,378
I still see and remember
the better version of you.

466
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,136
Because I like you.

467
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:19,851
Yeah.

468
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:23,202
So...

469
00:45:25,648 --> 00:45:27,601
No matter if it's good or bad,

470
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:29,812
if I come fast or slow,

471
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:32,615
if I look more experienced or not,

472
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,322
I'm ready to be yours.

473
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:05,360
My favorite man.

474
00:47:34,135 --> 00:47:35,174
(Let me know when you arrive,
come find me later)

475
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:36,205
(If you succeed, I'll reward you
If you don't, I'll console you)

476
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:40,393
Nuth.

477
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,049
The client cancelled.

478
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:47,647
I was almost there when he cancelled.

479
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:50,850
Yeah.

480
00:47:51,686 --> 00:47:53,663
I went to buy some papaya salad for you.

481
00:47:55,147 --> 00:47:57,905
Yes, I asked them
not to add sugar for you.

482
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:02,338
Zouey.

483
00:48:03,471 --> 00:48:06,049
Do you think taking revenge

484
00:48:07,354 --> 00:48:09,018
really makes us happier, Zouey?

485
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:11,862
I don't know.

486
00:48:13,888 --> 00:48:16,099
Those who have done something wrong
should be punished.

487
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:20,677
I guess if it happens naturally,
it's fair.

488
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,037
We will never know

489
00:48:24,457 --> 00:48:26,004
if what we do

490
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:28,644
is much more than he deserves.

491
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:35,605
Yeah.

492
00:48:36,644 --> 00:48:38,073
You're right.

493
00:48:41,514 --> 00:48:43,779
If he gets punished accordingly,

494
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:47,451
what about our feelings?

495
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,623
Would we feel better?

496
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:02,079
Here's your papaya salad.

497
00:49:20,202 --> 00:49:22,389
What are you scared of?
We're just delivering the food.

498
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:26,882
If you don't let me in,
I'll give you another bloody dish.

499
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:40,603
Are you crazy?

500
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:42,306
What do you want from me?

501
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:44,345
Just say it.

502
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,897
- Why are you doing this?
- You should ask yourself.

503
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:49,892
- What did you do to deserve this?
- What did I do?

504
00:49:50,206 --> 00:49:51,448
What did I do to you, Nant?

505
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,659
You ruined my life.

506
00:49:54,183 --> 00:49:55,440
I have nothing left.

507
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:57,667
No money, no job.

508
00:49:58,222 --> 00:49:59,698
My life is ruined because of you.

509
00:50:00,351 --> 00:50:01,734
Just because I couldn't date you.

510
00:50:02,597 --> 00:50:03,925
You beat me up.

511
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:05,574
You manipulated me

512
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:08,074
and I had to see a therapist.

513
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:10,222
My life is getting better now.

514
00:50:10,918 --> 00:50:12,261
So why did you come back?

515
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:17,718
Honestly,

516
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,374
how did you come back?

517
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:21,499
Didn't you commit suicide?

518
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:25,897
Commit suicide?

519
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:28,688
You called me

520
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:30,535
saying you were going to kill yourself
to escape the creditors.

521
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:35,043
I don't remember.

522
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:37,308
Who are you?

523
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:38,918
Who are you?

524
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,637
Commit suicide?

525
00:50:41,051 --> 00:50:42,035
Say it.

526
00:50:42,724 --> 00:50:43,982
How did you know Nant?

527
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,419
What did you guys do?

528
00:50:45,653 --> 00:50:47,239
Why did he have to kill himself?

529
00:50:50,896 --> 00:50:52,091
Tell me.

530
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:54,857
If you don't, I'll shoot his brain out.

531
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:03,672
Don't.

532
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:07,359
Don't.

533
00:51:08,116 --> 00:51:09,178
Don't.

534
00:51:10,022 --> 00:51:10,959
Don't.

535
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:12,733
Phop.

536
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:14,889
Don't. Phop.

537
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:16,264
Don't.

538
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,365
Don't.

539
00:51:18,537 --> 00:51:19,920
Don't. Phop.

540
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,264
Don't, Nant. Don't do it.

541
00:51:22,536 --> 00:51:23,489
Phop.

542
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,950
Phop, no. I'm sorry.

543
00:51:26,411 --> 00:51:27,708
Phop, don't.

544
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,458
Don't.

545
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,067
Phop.

546
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:32,403
Phop.

547
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,020
Phop. I'm sorry.

548
00:51:35,398 --> 00:51:36,578
Phop, no.

549
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,200
Nant, no.

550
00:51:39,577 --> 00:51:40,616
Phop.

551
00:51:41,772 --> 00:51:42,662
(Next Episode)
Shit.

552
00:51:42,687 --> 00:51:44,733
Nant killed himself at a motel.

553
00:51:44,928 --> 00:51:48,271
If Nant really died,
who left his laptop near Soong's dorm?

554
00:51:48,514 --> 00:51:49,819
Do you want me to love you?

555
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:51,546
I do.

556
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,531
Thank you for making me the starter.

557
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:56,257
You are the most valuable player to me.

558
00:51:56,515 --> 00:51:58,601
Who wore the dog mask?

559
00:52:00,734 --> 00:52:01,835
Fuck me.

560
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:04,694
Think of me as Nant.
