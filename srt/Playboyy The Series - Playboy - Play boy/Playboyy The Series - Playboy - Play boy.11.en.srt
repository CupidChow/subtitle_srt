1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,479
(Previously)
You didn't pick me up at the airport.

2
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,495
Don't you miss me?

3
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,018
The only suspect is Nuth's boss.

4
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:23,534
But Nuth doesn't know him
and has never seen his face.

5
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:25,050
Hey.

6
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:28,396
Don't mess up like last time.

7
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:32,506
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,576
So Jason Lee adopted me.

9
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:36,131
But yeah.

10
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:39,490
He doesn't treat me like a son
like everyone thinks.

11
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:46,156
Jason Lee admits he's cooperating
with the Chinese PM to increase investment

12
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,235
in the hopes of boosting
the country's economy.

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,649
He will be donating to Aram Luang Temple
after the Jupiter retrograde.

14
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:03,480
Have you ever found yourself asking,
"Who am I?"

15
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:24,260
Please don't.

16
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:25,377
Please.

17
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:26,791
Please don't.

18
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:28,627
Please. Don't.

19
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,315
Me?

20
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:35,318
I'm just a normal, sentimental man

21
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:38,474
who always longed to be a father.

22
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:12,859
That's why I've been doing
the best I can

23
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:17,049
to treat everyone
at Playboyy like a son

24
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,401
or a lover.

25
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,560
I really loved him.

26
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:34,716
But one day he got sick of me.

27
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:37,818
He told me to work here

28
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,216
and he got himself a new sugar baby.

29
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:12,231
- Hello.
- Hello.

30
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:30,461
So Jason Lee adopted me.

31
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,157
But yeah.

32
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,508
He doesn't treat me like a son
like everyone thinks.

33
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:37,032
So you let him fuck you

34
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:39,464
and beat you up?

35
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,581
What happened?

36
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,089
Who was that?

37
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,589
I'm asking you.

38
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:47,277
What happened?

39
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,878
You're being accused.
I'll take care of this.

40
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:08,657
Hurry up.

41
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:12,915
Fuck.

42
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,600
"Playboyy"

43
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:42,540
(Episode 11: Kicking the Hornet's Nest)

44
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,610
Shit.

45
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,040
What happened, Porche?

46
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,463
What you said wasn't true, right?

47
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:54,583
Your adoptive father
doesn't sleep with you, right?

48
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:56,657
He doesn't hurt you, right?

49
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,039
Calm down, Porche.

50
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:02,219
Even though you are exposed,
your daddy can take care of it.

51
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:09,871
Shit.

52
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:12,559
Did Nant try to expose this about him?

53
00:07:14,324 --> 00:07:15,926
Hey! Not now, dude.

54
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:17,582
He's panicking.

55
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:26,676
Is there something else
we don't know about your daddy?

56
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:38,538
Hey.

57
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:41,553
What now?

58
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:44,233
What should we do now?

59
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:52,852
Come on, Zouey.

60
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:55,032
Next pose. Champagne Room.

61
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:58,899
Zouey, turn your face this way.

62
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:03,506
Good.

63
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:11,952
What's wrong, man?

64
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,436
This is a good idea.

65
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:16,353
Painting nudes from the Kama Sutra.

66
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,465
I think Mr. Lee will approve.

67
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:20,942
Look at his face.

68
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:22,911
He's not okay with this.

69
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:26,770
I'm worried about Porche and Jump.

70
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:29,629
Do you think they'll get beaten up?

71
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:33,898
No.

72
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:39,046
But they'll be killed.

73
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,749
- Soong, why the hell are you here?
- Wait.

74
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,084
Is he here?

75
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:49,326
Come on! Is Jump here?

76
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:53,474
Mr. Lee is coming.

77
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,929
He will definitely kill me.

78
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:01,359
You did what you were told
and secretly recorded me.

79
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:04,320
- I'm sorry, but I hated you then.
- Jump.

80
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,023
I told you to run away, asshole.

81
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:09,068
Not go on a honeymoon at St. Tropez.

82
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,077
I am in a hurry.

83
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,816
- I told you to stall him.
- I did.

84
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,636
You should be thankful I tricked him
into going to your dorm.

85
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,566
He's going to the car care place.
You should hurry up.

86
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:21,230
Who told him it was me?

87
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:22,657
I did.

88
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,141
- Hey.
- Calm down.

89
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:28,993
- First.
- Calm down.

90
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,641
- Calm down.
- First, calm down.

91
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,024
How could you do this to me?

92
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:33,258
What did I ever do to you?

93
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,538
If I didn't tell him,
he would have blown my brains out.

94
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:37,398
Why did you sleep with his son?

95
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,944
I didn't know who he was.

96
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,554
Why are you involved with him?

97
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,390
Stop blaming me and run away, okay?

98
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:45,663
He's coming.

99
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,494
You should calm down, Aob.

100
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,252
The security guard informed me
that there's a car coming in.

101
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:54,885
He's with the guard house now.

102
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,689
Huh?

103
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:18,885
All done.

104
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,784
This is fine tea my father bought.

105
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:23,792
So...

106
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:26,342
Any idea?

107
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:32,844
Do you know where my son is?

108
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:37,540
I'm just worried for him.

109
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,089
We can't reach him either.

110
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,886
It seems like he has been missing
ever since that incident.

111
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:54,538
You know what?

112
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,123
As a father,

113
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,998
I wish nothing out of a son

114
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,202
except for him to be safe

115
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:05,248
and happy.

116
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:06,478
Right?

117
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,887
I'm afraid that he might have
a conflict with someone.

118
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:25,343
So...

119
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:29,695
Let me know if you

120
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,648
know where he is, okay?

121
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,126
Let's talk about
your art exhibition tomorrow

122
00:11:51,704 --> 00:11:52,657
at my office.

123
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,260
The netizens are asking

124
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,237
at what age was Patchanon adopted
by Jason Lee.

125
00:12:25,718 --> 00:12:27,389
It has gone viral in a night.

126
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,865
I can't believe that one of Asia's
15 most generous businessmen

127
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,170
might be a pedophile

128
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:38,068
and show signs of child grooming.

129
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:52,116
So Jason Lee adopted me.

130
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,905
But yeah.

131
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,978
He doesn't treat me like a son
like everyone thinks.

132
00:12:57,002 --> 00:13:00,455
So you let him fuck you and beat you up?

133
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:04,447
As you just heard,

134
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:07,915
someone has accused me and my son

135
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,736
by using AI sound generator

136
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,509
to fake voices

137
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,416
and destroy our image.

138
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:17,556
Enough with the drama.

139
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,395
I have some good news.

140
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:21,305
I think

141
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,602
we should move on to something positive.

142
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:27,079
I have great news to share with
those who are watching this.

143
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:30,633
I will donate money
to the queer movement

144
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:34,355
that is demanding for same-sex marriage

145
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,373
for gender equality.

146
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:38,858
I believe that this is great news

147
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:41,615
and I'm sure you will all support this.

148
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:45,456
Thank you.

149
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:51,885
(Your clip is leaked,
so you're attacking others?)

150
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,823
(You're fired,
why are you still reporting?)

151
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:53,652
(You're good at faking your image,
are you a reporter or a photographer?)

152
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:56,019
You're fired,
so why are you still reporting?

153
00:13:58,662 --> 00:13:59,279
I...

154
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,459
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

155
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:04,178
I just

156
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:07,014
talked about the news I heard.

157
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:10,110
Why would I attack him?

158
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:11,682
How do I benefit from doing that?

159
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:13,362
I don't get anything.

160
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:18,768
(Let's talk)

161
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:37,425
Let's stop with all this revenge.

162
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:38,534
We're adults.

163
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:41,706
You change sides fast
like some political party.

164
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,839
Why didn't he have this mindset
when he leaked the clip?

165
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:48,611
Three million

166
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,438
to make up for your unemployment.

167
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:51,984
- Let's end things here.
- No.

168
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:54,651
You destroyed my future.

169
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:56,807
I will do the same to you.

170
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,284
Mr. Tutor.

171
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,120
Our futures are so bright
you can't manage to destroy them.

172
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,208
We're talking about Mr. Lee here.

173
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:10,309
What would you have to do
to destroy his future?

174
00:15:58,014 --> 00:15:58,827
What is this?

175
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:00,769
Where are you going?

176
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,475
You're just going to act
like you don't know?

177
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,983
I really have no clue. What happened?

178
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:13,608
I've been cut

179
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:16,399
from the team

180
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:18,649
and the university.

181
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,024
This dorm too.

182
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:24,853
I have to find a place to stay.

183
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:31,480
How did they find the clip?

184
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,371
I deleted everything.

185
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:41,107
They didn't.

186
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,350
Someone sent it to them.

187
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:46,124
You didn't do it, right?

188
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:48,077
Why would I?

189
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:49,764
I love you.

190
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:02,822
I approached you at first
because I wanted something.

191
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,924
Right.

192
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:08,202
But you showed me

193
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,928
that you love
and understand me the most.

194
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:20,522
I feel so guilty.

195
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:25,337
I shouldn't have done that.

196
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:29,954
Where are you going to stay?

197
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:33,884
I don't know.

198
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,652
I'll probably go home
until I can find a place to stay.

199
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:46,051
I'll make it up to you.

200
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:48,830
Tell me if you need anything.

201
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:53,025
If I didn't record you,

202
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,306
things wouldn't have
turned out this way.

203
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:58,188
He's your twin, right?

204
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,531
I thought I saw a ghost.

205
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,078
I'll get to the point.

206
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,073
I know you have an issue
with my friend Porche.

207
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:14,784
You want to expose Jason Lee, right?

208
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:18,456
Me too.

209
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:21,690
Jason Lee probably made
my brother go missing.

210
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:23,663
Maybe Jason killed him.

211
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:27,389
What do you want me to do?

212
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:29,249
Just tell me

213
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:32,561
if you know anything about Jason Lee
that was worth exposing.

214
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,260
If we find this out,

215
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,838
you'll get breaking news

216
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:46,526
that can be made into movies and series.

217
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,326
Jason Lee has issues with mobs.

218
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:55,318
He's also close to powerful people.

219
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:59,302
It's possible that he's behind
many shady businesses.

220
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,634
You don't have to wash my hair.

221
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:18,353
I don't want to be a burden.

222
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,259
Shut up.

223
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,501
The doctor said you can't
get your wound wet.

224
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:26,790
Don't worry.
I do this for the clients often.

225
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:29,426
Thank you.

226
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:31,973
If you just said
you wanted to do this for me,

227
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:33,543
it would've been very cute.

228
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,152
We must take care of each other.

229
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,507
Don't accept any clients at the moment.

230
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:45,116
Otherwise, it will get worse.

231
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:51,593
This sucks.

232
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:54,733
I was abused,
but I couldn't tell the boss.

233
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:58,487
If I report it to the police,
the boss will get in trouble.

234
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:01,042
The guilty one gets off scott free.

235
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,120
According to the law,

236
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:05,510
people like us don't even exist.

237
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,521
Lumpini Park doesn't have outdoors.

238
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,427
There are no prostitutes in Pattaya.

239
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,896
The government...

240
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:20,810
They don't even accept it.

241
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:24,032
Who's going to take care of us?

242
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:31,047
Me. At least I will.

243
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:35,957
Ever since you got hurt,

244
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,723
have you ejaculated?

245
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:46,332
The doctor said
that my wound cannot get wet.

246
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:52,024
So don't get it wet.

247
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:55,032
Come.

248
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:56,931
I'll take care of you.

249
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,119
Now I understand

250
00:22:58,775 --> 00:23:00,150
why clients call you Big Gun.

251
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:14,386
(What the hell did you do?)

252
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,654
I told you

253
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:20,017
First's dad doesn't want me
to be involved with First.

254
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:23,191
I'm not asking you to get involved.

255
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,121
I want you to talk to him.

256
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:32,129
He's telling Prom
to tell the boss to fire me.

257
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:36,406
Damn it.

258
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:39,961
Why is this more complicated
than the cables in Bangkok?

259
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,937
First must still be mad at me.

260
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:49,393
Do you think he'll listen to me?

261
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:53,909
Can you give it a shot?

262
00:23:55,924 --> 00:23:56,909
I'm fine.

263
00:23:58,081 --> 00:23:59,143
But I feel sorry for Puen.

264
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:02,373
If he leaves and works somewhere else,

265
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:04,670
it'll be worse for him.

266
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:08,459
Help me.

267
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:01,074
(I)

268
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:05,433
(am sorry)

269
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:10,217
(Let's make up)

270
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,467
(I love you)

271
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,517
My life is wonderful.

272
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:24,189
I've got my own soundtrack.

273
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:29,181
Is this a movie from the '80s?

274
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,111
You should leave.

275
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:32,565
I don't want to talk to you.

276
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:40,877
- So lame.
- Hey, wait.

277
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:50,825
I'm just

278
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:52,837
a boy,

279
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:55,556
standing in front of another boy...

280
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:57,337
Don't you understand what I said?

281
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:01,290
No matter how many more movies
you try to copy, I'm not talking to you.

282
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:03,454
You're horrible.

283
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:04,910
You lied to me.

284
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:06,004
Just leave.

285
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:08,449
Wait, you're going
to throw it at my face?

286
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,012
If you do,

287
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:11,637
I'll kiss you.

288
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,723
No.

289
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:23,963
You don't have to forgive me

290
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:26,573
or love me back.

291
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,037
But if you only have a few days left

292
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:38,373
and we really must separate,

293
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,823
I want to spend the time with you.

294
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,675
I'll help you investigate.

295
00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:58,704
I can be your driver or a listening ear.

296
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:01,790
No matter what happens,

297
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:04,813
you're an important person to me.

298
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:08,121
I want you in my life, Nont.

299
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:10,062
Let's go over this again.

300
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:11,375
Start.

301
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:13,461
You must go in and talk to Jason

302
00:28:13,795 --> 00:28:15,256
about your art exhibition.

303
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:18,191
First and I will find out what Nant
was trying to expose about him.

304
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:21,347
We'll stay on the call
and communicate through our earphones.

305
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:24,683
Asshole.

306
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:28,238
My life has turned into some MI7 shit!

307
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,593
Okay, check.

308
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:34,851
- Bastard.
- Asshole.

309
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:36,156
Fuck you.

310
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:37,859
I heard that clearly.

311
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:39,906
Enough.

312
00:28:40,374 --> 00:28:41,171
Go!

313
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:09,313
Soong.

314
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:31,517
What are you going to choose
between your task and your heart?

315
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,158
Of course.

316
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,522
You're going to choose the guy, First.

317
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:36,874
Fuck.

318
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,468
Okay.

319
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:42,678
Tell me what I'm supposed to look for.

320
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:48,561
I really don't know
what the fuck I'm doing.

321
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,575
Here you go.

322
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:07,911
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

323
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:16,021
I don't know if it's a coincidence
that he has a Playboyy card.

324
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:18,711
But I'll try to seduce him.

325
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,258
He'll fall for me

326
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:22,594
and tell me everything.

327
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:44,070
Do you want to be the model?

328
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:46,499
Well...

329
00:30:47,124 --> 00:30:48,046
I don't think so.

330
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:50,022
Because I'm the painter.

331
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:54,889
I might hire a model.

332
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,560
You have a nice body.

333
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:17,568
It would be a shame
if the world doesn't see it.

334
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:44,414
Just a moment.

335
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:49,734
Please.

336
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:12,625
Daddy.

337
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:15,539
A client at Playboyy
has an issue with our staff.

338
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:17,894
He wants them fired.

339
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:31,811
I hired you to be a manager

340
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:33,943
to handle everything for me,

341
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,326
not ask the owner to do
everything that you can't do. Fuck!

342
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:10,036
Wait.

343
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:22,540
If I report to the police

344
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:25,960
that you kidnapped my son,
what would happen?

345
00:33:27,362 --> 00:33:28,744
Stop messing with my kid.

346
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:32,362
Otherwise, this clip
will be sent to the police.

347
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:35,283
Between the director of a hospital

348
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:39,369
and the pizza delivery boy
who's also a prostitute,

349
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,247
who will the police believe?

350
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,771
You could have told me straight.

351
00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:45,185
Can you see

352
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:47,122
you're the one I wanted?

353
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:50,130
- You are my chosen family.
- Soong.

354
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,954
I heard what you did
at the Playboyy Club.

355
00:33:57,907 --> 00:33:59,165
It's all my fault, First.

356
00:34:00,478 --> 00:34:01,415
I left you.

357
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:02,915
I turned you into a monster.

358
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:05,478
No, Soong. It's all on me.

359
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,065
I am the one hurting them.

360
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:09,979
It's better this way.

361
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,861
Because I could have
hurt you even worse.

362
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,127
Can you do me a favor?

363
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,315
My mates, Aob and Puen.

364
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:20,817
I heard that you want
to have them fired.

365
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:23,107
Can you please

366
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:25,708
- change your mind?
- He beat me.

367
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,872
But you did it first.

368
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,630
Their lives are bad enough on their own.

369
00:34:32,632 --> 00:34:33,171
Babe.

370
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:37,155
Can you please forgive them just once?

371
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:40,546
Can you please?

372
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:46,603
I'll do

373
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:49,275
if you come back.

374
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:11,331
- Jason Lee owns Playboyy.
- Jason Lee owns Playboyy.

375
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,843
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

376
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:14,898
Prom told me.

377
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,109
What?

378
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,703
I heard Prom talking to Mr. Lee.

379
00:35:22,593 --> 00:35:23,828
This is my assumption.

380
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:26,399
What if Nant tried exposing

381
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,719
that he's behind Playboyy
and other shady businesses?

382
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,014
Maybe he tried
to blackmail Jason for cash

383
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:32,866
to pay back for the drugs he lost.

384
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:34,921
So Jason Lee took him

385
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,663
after he filmed the suicide clip.

386
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:38,975
Daddy has a VIP room at Playboyy.

387
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:40,164
I'll have a look.

388
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:41,836
No.

389
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:43,625
I still don't forgive you completely.

390
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:45,344
We'll go there tonight on our own.

391
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:49,711
Does anyone want to keep pretending
to be a young detective?

392
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:04,780
Let's eat.

393
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:06,475
We've been busy since last night.

394
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:11,600
Not sure if J. Lee Group's young master
can eat a simple meal like this.

395
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:13,069
So I got you this.

396
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:16,325
I only became a young master
when I was 16.

397
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:19,961
I was the son of a maid and a driver.

398
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:21,984
I can eat anything.

399
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,176
I'll feed you.

400
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:00,200
Is it good?

401
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:03,551
We've known each other for a long time.

402
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:05,614
But it feels like we don't know
each other at all.

403
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,731
You're right.

404
00:37:08,254 --> 00:37:09,340
You like stir-fried basil?

405
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:11,546
No.

406
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:13,171
But it's cheap and easy.

407
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:14,960
I just like it spicy.

408
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,812
What do you like to eat?

409
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:19,101
Honestly,

410
00:37:19,578 --> 00:37:20,703
rice with omelet.

411
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,078
Classic, right?

412
00:37:25,055 --> 00:37:26,578
Everyone likes rice with omelet.

413
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,148
Mountains or beaches?

414
00:37:32,773 --> 00:37:33,484
Guess.

415
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:36,586
Beaches?

416
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:34,064
I still remember
the first day we met here.

417
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,182
Honestly,

418
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:39,158
were you smelling my pants?

419
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:43,228
Yeah.

420
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:46,020
I liked you.

421
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:48,388
I liked you since the first time we met.

422
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:02,720
Huh?

423
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:04,798
Why do you have
the former coach's shirt?

424
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,095
Were you guys dating?

425
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:10,681
He gave it to me.

426
00:39:11,322 --> 00:39:12,784
So it looked like a uniform

427
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:15,602
and the team members wouldn't bully me.

428
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:20,204
The shirt is too bright.
I don't like wearing it.

429
00:39:53,503 --> 00:39:54,378
I see.

430
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,886
You put the cleaning sign
out front because...

431
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:00,558
Should we do one last role play?

432
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:42,414
Hey.

433
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:45,391
Hey.

434
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,508
The perverted client is back.

435
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,430
He's with the guy who smashed
the glass with a billiard stick.

436
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:52,898
What should we do?

437
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:54,769
Should we all pretend to be sick?

438
00:42:38,915 --> 00:42:39,735
I'll be back.

439
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:50,985
You guys can come out now.

440
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,602
Here.

441
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:54,204
You don't have to do anything today.

442
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,501
Just stay here until your time is over.

443
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:01,527
I have to go.

444
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:15,640
- Zouey!
- Zouey!

445
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:17,070
What the hell are you doing?

446
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:19,132
Are you drawing the prostitute again?

447
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:21,906
What do you think?

448
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:29,683
Okay, I'm sorry.

449
00:43:40,777 --> 00:43:41,433
- Captain!
- Captain!

450
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:42,667
- Stop being horny.
- Stop being horny.

451
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:45,300
I have to go now.

452
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:15,043
The sugar cane was in
the elephant's mouth.

453
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:17,172
But you opened the mouth
to remove the sugar cane.

454
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:18,540
Zip it, man.

455
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:20,072
We're on a mission.

456
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:24,838
I walked past this room a few times.

457
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:27,362
But I didn't realize
JL stands for Jason Lee.

458
00:44:28,354 --> 00:44:30,596
Nont, you're a normal person.

459
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:31,865
You're not Conan the Detective.

460
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:33,733
You don't have to know everything.

461
00:44:37,905 --> 00:44:40,210
I told you guys not to come back here.

462
00:44:56,604 --> 00:44:57,377
Fuck you.

463
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,541
Hey.

464
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:01,087
Hey.

465
00:45:02,455 --> 00:45:03,564
Don't hurt my friend.

466
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:06,556
What did First do to you?

467
00:45:07,752 --> 00:45:09,377
You got me and Puen fired.

468
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:11,202
But you were the one who hurt us first.

469
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:12,878
Hey.

470
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:22,662
Fuck you.

471
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:23,850
Stop.

472
00:45:24,217 --> 00:45:25,537
How could you do this to Keen?

473
00:45:26,104 --> 00:45:27,838
How could you send
the clip to the professor?

474
00:45:28,924 --> 00:45:30,643
Now he's expelled.

475
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:31,823
I didn't do it, asshole.

476
00:45:33,002 --> 00:45:35,034
I've been in bed for many days
from an injury your friend caused.

477
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:36,518
That can't compare to what you did.

478
00:45:37,184 --> 00:45:38,606
You like to be fucked, don't you?

479
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,351
You messed with my man first.

480
00:45:42,937 --> 00:45:44,890
You should be thankful
I didn't hire someone to beat you up.

481
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:56,182
What the hell is going on?

482
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:58,611
First promised he won't have you fired.

483
00:45:58,728 --> 00:45:59,822
Why did you punch him?

484
00:46:05,907 --> 00:46:06,602
Captain.

485
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:09,883
You told First to hurt other people?

486
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:20,741
If you want to do something, hurry up.

487
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,467
My man says Daddy is coming.

488
00:46:33,368 --> 00:46:34,298
Aob.

489
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:35,658
Puen.

490
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,197
First didn't do anything wrong.

491
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:40,220
The boss fired you guys.

492
00:47:13,562 --> 00:47:14,304
Hurry up.

493
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:30,078
Puen started it, Zouey.

494
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:32,539
What about?

495
00:47:34,507 --> 00:47:36,281
Did Puen physically abuse you, Captain?

496
00:47:38,468 --> 00:47:40,148
Did he ever do anything to you, First?

497
00:47:44,776 --> 00:47:47,018
- You guys are...
- He had sex with Keen.

498
00:47:52,874 --> 00:47:54,382
The day he found out
that I confessed my love to Keen.

499
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:57,218
I saw the text messages on his phone.

500
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:01,578
Damn it.

501
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:03,445
Why?

502
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:05,593
Why do I love him?

503
00:48:20,552 --> 00:48:21,818
Let's go practice.

504
00:48:23,516 --> 00:48:25,149
If you're not coming,
I'll go to the bathroom first.

505
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:53,923
(Especially...)

506
00:48:53,948 --> 00:48:54,588
(your Big Gun)

507
00:48:54,613 --> 00:48:55,447
(Are you coming tonight?)

508
00:48:55,472 --> 00:48:56,393
(If I go)

509
00:48:56,418 --> 00:48:57,150
(Will it be easier to join the team?)

510
00:48:57,175 --> 00:48:58,119
(If you come)

511
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,212
(You can enter anywhere you want to)

512
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:00,157
(I'll be entering every hole)

513
00:49:08,342 --> 00:49:09,990
Captain complained about Puen to me.

514
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:12,649
I accidentally met him here.

515
00:49:14,157 --> 00:49:16,609
Captain told me to take care of it,
so I did.

516
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,860
Puen consented.

517
00:49:19,828 --> 00:49:20,789
I paid him.

518
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:22,891
We had a talk about it.

519
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:25,702
- I can do whatever I want.
- Hey.

520
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:28,960
How could you say that?

521
00:49:30,952 --> 00:49:32,554
Your boyfriend was a prostitute before.

522
00:49:33,624 --> 00:49:34,335
Zouey.

523
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,041
You knew what Porche went through.

524
00:49:42,205 --> 00:49:44,471
You knew what I went through.

525
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:47,268
How could you do that?

526
00:49:49,561 --> 00:49:51,624
You can call me naive and immature.

527
00:49:53,634 --> 00:49:55,603
But if I have to be horrible,

528
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:58,775
perverted, and sadistic to be mature,
I'm willing to stay immature, assholes.

529
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,869
You and Nont are the best.

530
00:50:13,564 --> 00:50:14,619
Even when Nant was around.

531
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:17,650
You guys are the main characters.

532
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:20,458
First and I just play supporting roles
in your story.

533
00:50:24,578 --> 00:50:25,843
You think of us as clowns

534
00:50:26,562 --> 00:50:27,922
or people who make yourself
look like a better person.

535
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,265
I'm out.

536
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:34,322
You guys can continue investigating.

537
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:26,878
(Next Episode)
If you don't want to be fired,

538
00:51:27,457 --> 00:51:28,371
you must help me.

539
00:51:29,397 --> 00:51:30,952
How can I sleep with the former coach?

540
00:51:31,694 --> 00:51:32,827
Sign the resignation form.

541
00:51:33,342 --> 00:51:36,131
Pack your things and leave by tomorrow.

542
00:51:37,116 --> 00:51:39,561
Let me warn you
that being with me is dangerous.

543
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:41,202
Dangerous how?

544
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:43,548
You sound like you're a hitman.

545
00:51:45,986 --> 00:51:47,040
Are you not mad at me anymore?

546
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:48,251
No.

547
00:51:48,947 --> 00:51:50,470
But I can't reach Soong.

548
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,501
Teena too. Nont and Captain aren't home.
