1
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:16,848
(Previously)
You said my brother committed suicide.

2
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:17,942
I'm begging you.

3
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:19,270
Please tell me what happened.

4
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:21,153
I terminated the contract.

5
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:22,403
You are my slave.

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,840
You want me to love you?

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,340
I'm doing just that.

8
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,338
Do you have the clip
when Nant and Nuth had a call

9
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:29,487
before he committed suicide?

10
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:30,630
Who knows?

11
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:32,380
It could have been a setup.

12
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:33,856
Your brother might still be alive.

13
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:36,528
- You must continue searching.
- I won't.

14
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:38,677
If he's alive
and not telling me anything,

15
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,414
that means he doesn't want to be found.

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,093
It must be a big deal
for you to come see me now.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,922
Do you still have
the stuff I asked you to keep?

18
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:48,695
Good. Keep it well.

19
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,281
Don't throw it away.

20
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:51,601
Don't lose it.

21
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,599
Don't let anyone see it, Keen.

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,337
Embassy warns tourists going to Korea
about copycat crime.

23
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:00,435
Investigation on the drug case's
scapegoat is ongoing.

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,575
The culprit behind
the death of a saleswoman

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,960
shows signs of serial murder.

26
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,226
The housekeeper has been found guilty.

27
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,696
The police have found a naked John Doe

28
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:16,238
in the forest in Baan Bor Pae,

29
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:18,652
Tha Chang Subdistrict,
Bang Kalm District,

30
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,184
Songkhla province.

31
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,575
The police suspect...

32
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:50,159
Tha Chang Subdistrict,
Bang Kalm District,

33
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,784
Songkhla province.

34
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:53,878
The police suspect...

35
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:02,061
I've been having dreams about sleeping
with Nont and Nant at the same time.

36
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,181
The disturbing thing
isn't that I see Nant as Nont.

37
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,072
But I'm starting to forget Nant's face.

38
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:15,673
Because they're so alike
I can't tell them apart.

39
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,153
Right now I feel like

40
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:20,824
I like Nont more than Nant.

41
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,000
(Playboyy)

42
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,607
(Episode 9: The real person)

43
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,657
You're not so horrible after all.

44
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,446
You didn't have to act all cool.

45
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:09,891
You're lonely, aren't you?

46
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,512
You want to have friends, don't you?

47
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:15,146
Who said so?

48
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:19,372
I've been on my own for this long.

49
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:21,950
I'll keep living like this.

50
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:26,544
After working for a while,
you'll get it.

51
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:35,063
How long have you been working?

52
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,753
I started at 18.

53
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:42,386
Now I'm 34.

54
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,136
Do the math.

55
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:45,245
Shit.

56
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,112
You've been working for 16 years.

57
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,159
You'll be as old as my dad
in a few years.

58
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:55,888
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,053
Why do you do this job?

60
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,349
I grew up poor
and had to provide for myself.

61
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:04,560
I've done everything.

62
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:08,001
But after I gave this a try,
I started liking it.

63
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:09,438
So I never stopped.

64
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:12,110
What about you, Puen?

65
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:14,735
Why are you working at Playboyy?

66
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,251
I'm just like you.

67
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,253
I'm working to provide for myself.

68
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:23,777
But I'm not in it
for the long run like you.

69
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:27,550
I'll probably become
a professional athlete after graduating

70
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,691
and follow my dreams.

71
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,545
It's getting late.

72
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,493
Do you want to go to my place?

73
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:53,056
Let's drink.

(Private clips of athletes)

75
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:16,932
(A professional swimmer)

76
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:17,948
(Join the group now!
New clips every day)

77
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,206
(Hot, sweaty, ripped athletes!)

78
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,182
(250 baht for a lifetime subscription)

79
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,503
(Don't overthink it,
have some milk and go to bed)

80
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:31,763
(How do I subscribe to the group?)

81
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:32,662
(When are you posting a new clip?)

82
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:33,740
(I want to see his face clearly)

83
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:45,258
Captain.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,657
What are you doing?

85
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:51,575
Captain!

86
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,742
You made a mess. Zouey will nag you.

87
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:57,266
I know.

88
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:58,898
What is it?

89
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:02,055
Your private group
only has clips of athletes, right?

90
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,883
What if I have a clip of someone famous?

91
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:05,789
Can I sell it to you?

92
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:12,667
Is he an athlete?

93
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:14,425
If he isn't, I know some guys.

94
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,620
No.

95
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:17,768
But I want to create buzz for him.

96
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:19,745
Can you help me?

97
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,068
Huh?

98
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:22,193
Help me.

99

100

103
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:45,860
Puen.

104
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:47,579
Yeah?

105
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:51,891
I had a sugar daddy.

106
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,571
But he was so jealous.

107
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:01,113
I just looked at a person on the street.

108
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:04,371
He sent his guys to beat that man up.

109
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,043
So I couldn't have a crush on anyone.

110
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:14,803
That sucks.

111
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,600
So that's why you never
show your emotions.

112
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,095
I really loved him.

113
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,118
But he got sick of me one day.

114
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,017
He told me to work here

115
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,056
and he got himself a new sugar baby.

116
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:42,137
I was so heartbroken then.

117
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,168
Now I'm old.

118
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,062
It's too late to be in love.

119
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:21,453
Hey.

120
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:23,859
I'll just be blunt.

121
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,562
You couldn't have boyfriend sex with me

122
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:30,875
because you like me, right?

123
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,893
Then I'll be blunt too.

124
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,713
You're flirting with me

125
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,244
and making me jealous

126
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:48,202
because you like me, right?

127
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:53,873
Yes.

128
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:58,853
Because you took my virginity.

129
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,834
Who is the winged goddess
whose beheaded statue

130
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:47,365
is at the Louvre Museum in Paris?

131
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:48,646
A.

132
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:49,724
Nike.

133
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:51,037
B, Adidas.

134
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:52,678
C, Puma.

135
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:53,931
D, Reebok.

136
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:57,763
Why are you learning this for?

137
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:00,161
Nike.

138
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,372
The Goddess of Victory.

139
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:09,883
The substance in

140
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:13,945
arachidonic acid,

141
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:17,781
metabolite,

142
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:19,320
which one

143
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:20,961
acts as

144
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,315
a chemotactic

145
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:26,346
stimuli?

146
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:28,674
What is a stimuli?

147
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,838
Is this human language?

148
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:36,119
They're pronounced
metabolite and stimuli.

149
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:38,815
Fuck it.

150
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,619
I'm tired.

151
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:44,432
Zouey.

152
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:46,549
Why do you think we learn these things?

153
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:49,517
Like math,

154
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:51,088
we have calculators.

155
00:14:52,002 --> 00:14:53,080
-Like Thai,
-Like Thai,

156
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:55,369
- we already speak it.
- we already speak it.

157
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:06,434
Hey, Zouey.

158
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,168
If I go to the psychologist

159
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,067
and she says I'm a psycho,

160
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:15,375
what should I do?

161
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,094
Do you think Soong will dump me?

162
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,508
If he really loves you,

163
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,370
he'll stay with you

164
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,073
and help you get through it.

165
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,995
I went crazy last time.

166
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,417
What if he dumps me this time?

167
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:41,483
I don't know how fucked up I'll be.

168
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:52,413
What should I do?

169
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,364
Iced grande oat milk vanilla latte.

170
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:19,036
As usual, Tutor?

171
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:20,157
You remember.

172
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:22,524
I'll have that with two pumps of syrup.

173
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,368
Okay.

174
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:34,191
Iced grande americano.

175
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:35,746
Extra shot.

176
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:36,824
Dark roast.

177
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:37,824
No syrup.

178
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:40,918
Make it as bitter as my life.

179
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:46,311
The heir of Jeeli Group.

180
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:48,608
You're not as scary as I thought.

181
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,764
Why would I be scary around
a good person like you, Mr. Journalist?

182
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:55,467
I just want what's mine back.

183
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,341
Why would I have it?

184
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,657
Don't make me say it bluntly.

185
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,337
It might make the news.

186
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:06,860
Are you threatening me?

187
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,220
Try interpreting it.

188
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,130
I think a journalist
who promotes Thai culture

189
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,599
shouldn't be involved
with someone who's taken.

190
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:18,240
Don't you think so?

191
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:22,326
I think I'm doing a good job
preserving Thai culture.

192
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:24,149
Ramayana,

193
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:25,805
Khun Chang Khun Phaen,

194
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:27,326
Lilit Pralor,

195
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,943
and other pieces of Thai literature
always have characters stealing lovers.

196
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,802
How do those stories end?

197
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,263
Oh.

198
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:40,465
They all end in a war, don't they?

199
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:43,261
Return what's mine

200
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,698
or I'll jump to the end.

201
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,846
Look at the back.

202
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:43,940
Do you see something?

203
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:45,331
Here.

204
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:47,206
Shit.

205
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:48,331
It says room service.

206
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,042
Hello.

207
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,933
What hotel is this?

208
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:12,878
Okay, thank you.

209
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,243
Hello, Dad.

210
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:29,673
Can you contact the police for footages
from the CCTV at Harvey Hotel?

211
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,121
Yes, it's about Nant.

212
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:49,624
Why the long face?

213
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,038
Why are you being short with me?

214
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:57,185
Are you nervous?

215
00:19:57,771 --> 00:19:58,372
Yeah.

216
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,735
There's nothing to worry about.

217
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,680
I'll wait outside. Don't worry.

218
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,914
Come on. Let's make you more confident.

219
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:18,895
Spray it right here.

220
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,090
And here.

221
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:22,840
Go!

222
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:27,741
Wow.

223
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,773
- Smells good?
- Very good.

224
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:33,421
Hug me.

225
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:37,826
You smell so good.

226
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,989
I can live a normal life.

227
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:46,841
But when I have sex,
I lose self-control.

228
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,934
I don't know if this is because of
a past trauma

229
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:52,242
or the chemicals in my brain.

230
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,360
Come on, First.

231
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:56,266
I don't think
it's about a family trauma.

232
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:59,921
Professor Napadol is brilliant and kind.

233
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,109
I'll talk casually with you.

234
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:03,820
I think...

235
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,101
You might be putting yourself
too close to temptation.

236
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:10,012
So...

237
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:12,808
Do I need to take a test

238
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,996
- or get my blood tested to check?
- Of course not.

239
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,019
I've seen you since you were young.

240
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,590
I know who you really are.

241
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:24,194
You are just confused.

242
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:28,475
You might be stressed from school
and need to release that tension.

243
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:31,350
Avoid going out.

244
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:32,725
Avoid using the app.

245
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:36,073
Avoid meeting people you have sex with.

246
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:37,297
And...

247
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:41,336
Try playing sports and meditating.

248
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,598
(She's so fucked up, man!)

249
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:52,169
(She doesn't even work at a hospital)

250
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:53,497
(Her clinic is at her own house)

251
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:54,888
(She told me to meditate
when I'm turned on)

252
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:55,981
(Does she also work
at the Ministry of Education?)

253
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:57,286
(What if you are sexually turned on?)

254
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:58,590
(Play soccer!)

255
00:21:58,623 --> 00:22:01,417
(I play rugby all day,
but I have the energy to fuck my man)

256
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,084
Smile for your daddy.

257
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:28,657
Good.

258
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:29,985
Come on.

259
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:31,328
No.

260
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,031
I won't accept your cash
no matter how much it is.

261
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,578
How upset would First be
if he found out?

262
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,914
I'm not your father.

263
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:41,988
Do you know

264
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:44,893
how degenerate First will be

265
00:22:45,128 --> 00:22:46,152
if you still hang out with him?

266
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,980
If you're not doing this for the money,

267
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,292
then do it for First.

268
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:54,784
You've done things for First
your whole life.

269
00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:57,878
Take a look at how he grew up.

270
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:07,565
Wait.

271
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:12,474
What about this?

272
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:33,911
What's wrong with you?

273
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:36,365
You don't know
how to eat cheap food anymore?

274
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:38,993
No.

275
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:40,923
I just feel like...

276
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,790
Have you ever felt like sex is boring?

277
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,134
Rough sex is boring.

278
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:48,735
Vanilla sex is boring.

279
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:53,621
I feel like masturbating from porn
is more satisfying.

280
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:02,058
Aob, aren't you going to say hi?

281
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:05,303
Aob.

282
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:07,303
You're wearing yesterday's clothes.

283
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:09,178
Where have you been?

284
00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:14,147
Look at him.

285
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:16,675
Are you in love?

286
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:23,577
So, what's going on?

287
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,853
In love my ass.

288
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,783
How can Aob be in love?

289
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:41,783
He's always working.

290
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:43,943
If he's going to be in love,

291
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:47,718
it must be that boy Big Gun
who he's mentoring.

292
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:49,359
Big Gun?

293
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:50,726
Is that right, Aob?

294
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:51,828
- Really?
- So?

295
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:54,070
- Hey, is he good?
- Master.

296
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,765
- Is he good?
- Come on, I knew it.

297
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,959
- Aob, the Big Gun?
- Aob.

298
00:24:58,045 --> 00:24:59,811
- So?
- Tell us.

299
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:02,131
- What the hell?
- He took my cigarette.

300
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:04,076
- Huh?
- He won't say a word.

301
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:04,983
Damn it.

302
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:06,943
- Really?
- I knew it.

303
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:09,264
That boy must be good.

304
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:16,876
Soong.

305
00:25:18,032 --> 00:25:18,907
Did you have a fight with First?

306
00:25:22,936 --> 00:25:23,623
What the hell?

307
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:25,889
It must be serious this time.

308
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,623
He looks stressed.

309
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:47,109
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

310
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,409
Damn it.

311
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:52,729
I'm all alone.

312
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:53,987
I'm talking to myself.

313
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,362
Damn it.

314
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:58,386
I'll just eat this.

315
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:41,359
Damn it, Porche. If I get arrested,
come bail me out.

316
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:42,789
Shit.

317
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:17,317
This is great.

318
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:19,802
We usually only see
each other in the room.

319
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:22,013
You look more relaxed.

320
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,508
I get to see the sunlight.

321
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:31,156
Dad will send me
the CCTV footage to me soon.

322
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:34,265
So we'll find out

323
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:36,722
who the masked man is.

324
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:50,162
What's up with you and your dad?

325
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,188
Why do you have connections
with the police?

326
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:55,173
Why do you know how to use a gun?

327
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:59,860
I'll be shocked if you tell me you are
a mafia leader like in a series.

328
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:01,751
You'll be shocked.

329
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,673
Do you know who my mother is?

330
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:05,411
A Member of Parliament.

331
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:06,731
Right?

332
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:09,637
When Nant was first missing,
it was on the news everywhere.

333
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,129
My father was also
a Member of Parliament.

334
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:15,903
My parents were in opposing parties.

335
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:17,929
Mom was the one

336
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:20,188
who got him disqualified
as a Member of Parliament.

337
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:24,164
So this isn't a mafia series,

338
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:25,773
but it's a political series.

339
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:42,478
Why do you care about this mask?

340
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:46,817
It might not mean anything at all.

341
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:50,902
The suspect is Nuth's boss.

342
00:28:52,036 --> 00:28:53,075
Nant owes him money.

343
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,059
We can investigate both
at the same time.

344
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,281
The members of my dad's party
used to say,

345
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,729
"Structural issues and people issues
can be solved at the same time."

346
00:29:05,797 --> 00:29:06,836
Thank you so much

347
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:09,899
for being there for me

348
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:11,886
and everything is ending soon.

349
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:16,646
Without you,

350
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,888
I would have given up a long time ago.

351
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:27,016
Let's go.

352
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,730
Do you think the guy in front
was looking at me strangely?

353
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:09,628
(I had to hide under the bed
for hours until he left!)

354
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,150
(Think about it carefully, he's famous)
(You might get sued)

355
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:14,425
Did you forget to zip your pants?

356
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:15,395
(I've thought about it)

357
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,152
I didn't.

358
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:21,277
What's the matter?

359
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:22,425
You're late

360
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:23,894
and you look upset.

361
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:25,988
If you don't want to
walk with me, just tell me.

362
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:27,753
So we can walk separately.

363
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,881
No.

364
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:33,717
I want to walk with you.

365
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,436
But I'm just tired from walking.

366
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,131
Let me get something to drink.

367
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:49,259
Give it to me.

368
00:30:55,335 --> 00:30:56,249
Please.

369
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,912
(Judo - fucking hard
and loud in the gym)

370
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,216
First.

371
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:42,559
Come out.

372
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,997
You've been in there for an hour.

373
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:46,794
Yeah.

374
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:49,069
You don't even know
that he's really avoiding you.

375
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,021
Don't be so dramatic.

376
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,529
He won't reply to my texts.

377
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:57,146
He won't pick up.

378
00:31:58,357 --> 00:31:59,599
He's not at home.

379
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,006
Damn it.

380
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:02,920
He probably dumped me.

381
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:05,883
Why do I love him that much?

382
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:07,462
Come on, First.

383
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:09,243
Why would he dump you?

384
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,266
You have done nothing wrong.

385
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:16,599
He finds a psycho like me disgusting.

386
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,493
First.

387
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:29,039
Hey.

388
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,319
You're not a psycho, okay?

389
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:34,697
Why is your first thought

390
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:36,853
always him hating you?

391
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:40,377
What if he got into a car crash?

392
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,314
What if he's at some hospital?

393
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:44,955
You must find him.

394
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:47,387
Don't jump to conclusions.

395
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:09,132
You're right.

396
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:11,485
I have to find him.

397
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:13,033
Again.

398
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:20,649
Okay.

399
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:24,111
Good.

400
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,708
Stop being so negative about yourself.

401
00:33:39,022 --> 00:33:40,108
You are my friend.

402
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,850
You are a great friend.

403
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:48,006
I won't let anyone hurt you.

404
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:52,563
Especially you hurting yourself.

405
00:33:57,321 --> 00:33:58,415
Promise me.

406
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:12,403
Look at that. It looks so good.

407
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,341
Which one?

408
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:15,036
What about the macaron?

409
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:16,778
Sure.

410
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:20,531
This looks good too.

411
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:22,648
Wait.

412
00:34:22,673 --> 00:34:24,859
Hello, did we get a slot
for the interview?

413
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:27,648
Fired?

414
00:34:28,312 --> 00:34:29,226
What did I do wrong?

415
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:31,917
What clip?

416
00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:45,123
I'm meditating.

417
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,631
Did we get a slot for the interview?

418
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:01,768
Hello.

419
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:03,955
I'm free.

420
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:07,338
I'm meditating.

421
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,685
Did we get a slot for the interview?

422
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,500
Okay.

423
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:21,640
You're good at meditating.

424
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:23,583
Do you want to try me?

425
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:44,693
You're good at meditating.

426
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:46,896
Do you want to try me?

427
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:47,826
Turn it off!

428
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,193
Turn it off right now!

429
00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:52,884
Haven't you seen people fucking before?

430
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,682
Turn it off!

431
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,181
I crave the taste of your lips,

432
00:36:08,837 --> 00:36:09,720
your voice,

433
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:11,103
and your hair.

434
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,811
When I walk on the street, it's silent.

435
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,193
I'm craving.

436
00:36:21,076 --> 00:36:22,631
Food does not give me energy.

437
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:44,729
I crave you even more in the morning.

438
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:47,799
I want to eat you up.

439
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:50,182
You're like a smooth almond.

440
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:27,998
Baby.

441
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:30,810
Hey.

442
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,396
Why is that shirt so important?

443
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:36,828
Why don't you wear something else?

444
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:39,938
Coach got it screened for me.

445
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:42,032
He's leaving the hospital today.

446
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,914
If I wear this shirt to pick him up,

447
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:45,672
he'll be happy.

448
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:49,998
It's okay, there's no need to find it.

449
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:00,899
Oh.

450
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:03,042
You still have your school uniform?

451
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:04,573
Yeah.

452
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:08,424
When I like something, I try to keep it.

453
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,283
(I'd love to know
what you're going to do)

454
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:58,822
(Hello, are you Big Gun?)

455
00:39:58,847 --> 00:39:59,580
(Meet me at court today)

456
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:04,052
(Yesterday was hot)

457
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:05,130
(I want to eat you up)

458
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:06,091
(Especially...)

459
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:06,997
(your Big Gun)

460
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:07,879
(Are you coming tonight?)

461
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:11,049
(If I go)

462
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:12,471
(Will it be easier to join the team?)

463
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:15,242
You're flirting with me

464
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,234
and making me jealous

465
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:20,258
because you like me, right?

466
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:26,045
Yes.

467
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:27,706
(If you come, you can enter
anywhere you want to)

468
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:28,785
(I'll be entering every hole)

469
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,591
Because you took my virginity.

470
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:05,979
You're mean.

471
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:08,619
Why did you make me shower alone?

472
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:17,594
I love you.

473
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:19,859
You're the only one I love.

474
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:19,797
Nuth.

475
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:21,711
Have you seen this clip?

476
00:42:22,157 --> 00:42:23,000
Wait.

477
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:26,461
Nuth.

478
00:42:26,832 --> 00:42:28,066
Have you seen this clip?

479
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,119
What? Let me see.

480
00:42:47,112 --> 00:42:49,314
What is so important about this clip?

481
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:51,182
No.

482
00:42:52,432 --> 00:42:54,619
You've been typing the script
since this morning.

483
00:42:55,144 --> 00:42:56,480
You haven't paid any attention to me.

484
00:42:57,581 --> 00:42:58,620
I'm going to sulk.

485
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:04,980
Come on.

486
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:05,964
What clip?

487
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:08,542
What clip?

488
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,448
Show me.

489
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:21,584
Here.

490
00:43:22,493 --> 00:43:23,759
The famous journalist

491
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,465
that every girl is fangirling over.

492
00:43:27,562 --> 00:43:28,890
He was caught in a drama

493
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:30,328
and he might be banned

494
00:43:32,578 --> 00:43:34,031
and fired from the show.

495
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:40,665
They're going to ban him,
but still watch his clips?

496
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:42,275
What a phony.

497
00:43:45,048 --> 00:43:45,892
By the way,

498
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:47,837
have we tried this position before?

499
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:50,923
Are you nuts?

500
00:43:51,957 --> 00:43:53,293
I was just making a conversation.

501
00:43:54,277 --> 00:43:55,738
I wasn't trying to sleep with you.

502
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,520
Here.

503
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:05,921
This account has so many leaked clips.

504
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,562
Actors, models, and influencers.

505
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,819
They're not careful at all.

506
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:14,788
It's not fair to say that, Phop.

507
00:44:15,804 --> 00:44:16,773
They probably didn't know

508
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:20,045
that they would be betrayed.

509
00:44:22,147 --> 00:44:22,827
Also,

510
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:24,897
a lot of people secretly take
and sell these clips.

511
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:27,256
Those people should be criticized

512
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,678
for making a profit
from other people's privacy.

513
00:44:34,462 --> 00:44:35,259
Hey!

514
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:36,470
(Captain of the rugby team)

515
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:46,793
Hello, Keen.

516
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,598
I was about to call you.

517
00:44:50,332 --> 00:44:51,152
Huh?

518
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:53,801
I told you to keep it well.

519
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:57,882
Okay.

520
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,526
Saying goodbye is not
the hardest part of a break up.

521
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:20,964
It's leaving without
even saying anything.

522
00:45:22,276 --> 00:45:24,916
That hurts like a motherfucker.

523
00:45:34,053 --> 00:45:36,138
And what truly kills you inside

524
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:40,543
is when you have to leave
while you're still so deep in love.

525
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:02,324
And when it's not a fiction,
but it's your real life...

526
00:46:12,922 --> 00:46:15,477
No matter how badly you wish
for a plot twist,

527
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:23,253
you will never get one.

528
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:28,604
Just say it or we'll all get in trouble.

529
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:32,405
Okay.

530
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,319
I'm sorry about the mask, Nont.

531
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:41,858
You were sure
that the mask owner is the culprit.

532
00:47:43,923 --> 00:47:44,962
I don't have any evidence.

533
00:47:46,103 --> 00:47:46,970
No one would have believed me.

534
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:51,595
I know you're as worried
about Nant as I am.

535
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,056
Please do this for him.

536
00:48:02,942 --> 00:48:04,153
He gave me this mask

537
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:06,270
to wear to a party.

538
00:48:07,325 --> 00:48:08,083
That's it.

539
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,343
After that,

540
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:11,781
I left it with Keen

541
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:13,765
in case he wanted to use it.

542
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,632
I swear I never removed it
from the closet.

543
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,976
So who took it to film with Nant?

544
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:25,963
Is it possible
that there is more than one mask, Nont?

545
00:48:27,002 --> 00:48:28,768
I went to every place
that sells these things.

546
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:31,604
No one had it. It's custom made.

547
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:33,963
It's true,

548
00:48:35,075 --> 00:48:36,919
but what if they custom made
more than one?

549
00:48:48,548 --> 00:48:50,165
We'll get the CCTV footage
from the hotel soon.

550
00:48:51,853 --> 00:48:52,790
If you lie to me,

551
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,540
I'll kill you.

552
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,149
Keen.

553
00:49:20,964 --> 00:49:21,761
Why, Soong?

554
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,050
You were fine this morning.

555
00:49:27,025 --> 00:49:28,056
What did I do wrong this time?

556
00:49:29,848 --> 00:49:30,801
It's not your fault, First.

557
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:33,848
I...

558
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:36,348
I have a new sugar daddy.

559
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,749
If you're gonna lie,

560
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,812
at least look at my fucking face, Soong.

561
00:49:49,921 --> 00:49:51,359
Please tell me the truth.

562
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:54,046
It's for your own good, First.

563
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,377
It's about my behavior?

564
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,567
Isn't it?

565
00:50:10,896 --> 00:50:11,974
It's gonna get real dangerous.

566
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:14,192
We can't go on like this.

567
00:50:15,677 --> 00:50:17,239
Trust me, this is what's best for us.

568
00:50:18,388 --> 00:50:19,482
You fucking asshole.

569
00:50:20,414 --> 00:50:21,985
You promised me you'll be there for me.

570
00:50:22,977 --> 00:50:24,477
You said we will solve this together.

571
00:50:25,337 --> 00:50:26,712
We'll go through this together.

572
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,141
It's hurting me too, man.

573
00:50:32,024 --> 00:50:33,235
I don't want you to be this.

574
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:38,612
This monster... God damn it!

575
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:03,253
Will you hold me?

576
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,363
You love me, right?

577
00:51:11,105 --> 00:51:12,050
I still do.

578
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:16,536
Honestly, I won't be happier
with anyone but you.

579
00:51:17,379 --> 00:51:18,887
Yeah, you won't.

580
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:20,723
For sure.

581
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:22,980
You'll miss me. Please.

582
00:51:25,153 --> 00:51:25,926
Soong.

583
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:28,075
Don't go.

584
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:30,051
Please.

585
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,624
I hate hurting you, man.

586
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:35,156
So why are you then?

587
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:36,953
Why isn't love enough?

588
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:40,382
Huh?

589
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:46,854
Yeah.

590
00:51:47,432 --> 00:51:48,166
You're right.

591
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,939
Let's stop hurting each other.

592
00:51:51,627 --> 00:51:52,721
I won't let you leave me.

593
00:51:54,038 --> 00:51:55,010
I'll be the one who leaves.

594
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:36,796
The truth is

595
00:52:37,283 --> 00:52:38,588
everybody says,

596
00:52:39,476 --> 00:52:40,788
"Be true."

597
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,044
(Captain of the rugby team)

598
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:08,383
Fuck you, Captain.

599
00:53:09,211 --> 00:53:10,453
How could you do this to me?

600
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,704
I always knew you were horrible.

601
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:35,064
But I didn't think
you would be this horrible.

602
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:36,915
I can't help it.

603
00:53:37,939 --> 00:53:39,165
I already warned up.

604
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:45,481
The truth that even you yourself

605
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,493
is not good enough.

606
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:52,457
So you lie...

607
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:54,176
So you conceal yourself.

608
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,504
So you try to change.

609
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:10,952
Why?

610
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:12,999
Why?

611
00:54:16,948 --> 00:54:18,183
Why did you lie to me?

612
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:21,597
Why, Puen?

613
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:24,120
I don't...

614
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,143
You said you were going to be with me.
You lied, Puen.

615
00:54:30,287 --> 00:54:32,857
I just have sex with him, but I like you.

616
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,678
Why did you lie to me?

617
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:36,756
Why, Puen?

618
00:54:37,428 --> 00:54:38,951
Why did you lie to me?

619
00:54:39,974 --> 00:54:41,201
Why?

620
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:43,735
Why did you lie to me?

621
00:54:47,688 --> 00:54:48,875
I'm sorry.

622
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:51,477
But if changing
your true self doesn't help

623
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:09,988
and if my true self

624
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:11,491
is a monster,

625
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,486
it's time I unleash the monster.

626
00:55:33,275 --> 00:55:34,556
(It's not Nuth and not Captain's coach)

627
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:35,689
(Who is the masked man?)

628
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:41,739
(I got what you asked for)

629
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:42,559
(10th June night at the Harvey Hotel)

630
00:55:42,584 --> 00:55:43,497
(This is the clearest footage)

631
00:55:43,522 --> 00:55:44,340
(Nant is in it)

632
00:56:15,249 --> 00:56:16,015
Are you

633
00:56:17,163 --> 00:56:18,476
the man who wore the dog mask?

634
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:30,203
The police found him dead and naked

635
00:56:30,228 --> 00:56:32,273
in a forest near Rangsit.

636
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:34,125
Based on initial assumptions,

637
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:37,050
he has probably been dead for 48 hours.

638
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:03,864
(Man found dead)

639
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:11,617
(Next Episode)
Think about it.

640
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:13,765
Who would go do drugs in the forest?

641
00:57:13,906 --> 00:57:14,742
Also,

642
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,078
he was missing for months.

643
00:57:16,484 --> 00:57:17,140
Auntie.

644
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:18,671
Can I see the CCTV footage?

645
00:57:19,177 --> 00:57:21,209
My only suspect is Nuth's boss.

646
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:23,728
Tell me who did this to you, Puen.

647
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:25,564
How does that involve you?

648
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:27,291
Are you going to continue your search?

649
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,916
If Nant really died from his stupidity
like we're hearing on the news,

650
00:57:30,275 --> 00:57:31,767
then I'll hate him to the bone.

651
00:57:32,377 --> 00:57:33,322
But if someone killed him,

652
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:35,672
I'll take revenge for his death.
