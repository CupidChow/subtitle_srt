Fake.

2
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,549
regardless of rich and
poor , high class or low class

3
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,135
Everyone loves sex

4
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:49,715
Or do you not like it?

5
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:54,567
Research shows that we
think about sex 388 times a day.

6
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:56,599
Before you started
watching, you were thinking

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,629
too, weren't you? Or
were you actually doing it?

8
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,400
Some just love to film it or get filmed

9
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:10,281
If you want to see more,
then you must pay more.

10
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,982
(Let's do a private call.)(How much?)
(500.)(I'm not easy.)

11
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,546
Sex isn't just bumping into
each other and be done with it.

12
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:23,428
Sex has many forms and careers in
many places with many preferences.

13
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:27,778
Sometimes, sex can earn
you huge amount of money

14
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:33,196
Since sex is for everyone,
from commoners to the big guys.

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,184
It would be great if we could
stop faking it and be frank about it.

16
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:43,285
It's a shame that we can't
be that free in this country.

17
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:50,687
So sex isn't just sex, but it creates
problems. That's why I'm here.

18
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:55,207
Solve this and come help me in time, Zouey.

(Episode 1: Sex is about everyone)

21
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:23,179
- Damn it. I saw it.
- Who took it?

22
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:28,243
I don't know.

23
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:31,740
Zouey.

24
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:33,694
Happy birthday.

- Have a great one.
- Happy birthday.

00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,506
- Make a wish.
- Make a wish.

31
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,396
Yes!

32
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:11,440
What did you wish for?

33
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,592
For you to finally have sex?

34
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,515
Come on, bro.

35
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,314
You're 20 now.

36
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,504
Are you saving your virginity
to sell when you're older?

37
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,481
That's right.

38
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:25,289
- Damn it.
- Don't bully him, First.

39
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,073
(This video was one year ago)
So what did you wish for?

40
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:31,321
Why won't you tell us about your wish?

41
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:33,050
(Where are you?
Aren't you coming to class?

42
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:34,043
(Were you kidnapped?)

43
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:34,989
(I told you not to join the mob.
You did this to yourself.)

44
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:36,162
(When are the police going to find you?)

45
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,707
(I miss you. Come back, friend)

46
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,131
Hey, man.

47
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,026
Are you jerking off to anime again?

48
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:09,769
What were you doing?

49
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,679
Do you only think about masturbating?

50
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:15,948
Learn to have some manners.

51
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,466
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

52
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:21,078
It's normal. I get it.

53
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:23,279
Really? I don't get it, First.

54
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:26,375
He won't have sex with anyone
or jerk off to humans.

55
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,910
What's so sexy about a 2D image?

56
00:05:29,238 --> 00:05:33,039
You like to smell underwear,
but I never judge you.

57
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,100
What do you guys want?

58
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:41,674
So have you made up your mind
on which guy you like?

59
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:46,289
- I don't want anyone.
- For real?

60
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,738
Zouey.

61
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,281
- Porsche is hosting a party for you.
- Yeah.

62
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,142
I invited almost everyone at university.

63
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,880
You are losing your virginity this year.

64
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:57,803
- If Nun was still here...
- Hey.

65
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:01,748
I told you not
to talk about Nun, Captain.

66
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,290
He'll be depressed.

67
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,817
You guys should leave.

68
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:17,981
I told you.

69
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,591
Damn it.

70
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:45,884
You told me that sex is what
everyone has in common, Nun

71
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:50,595
Why are sex issues other people's business?

72
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:56,251
(Why have you left me here? / I'm worried
about you / Please come back / I miss you)

73
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,770
This is so good.

74
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,139
Zouey.

75
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:37,291
Where did Zouey go?

76
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:39,028
Zouey.

77
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,996
- Zouey.
- Hey.

78
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,021
Hey.

79
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,890
Damn it.

80
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:50,098
I spent so much money.
You can't just do nothing.

81
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:53,369
It's my dad's money.
It has nothing to do with you.

82
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:56,913
Fine, but the point is
Zouey must enjoy the party.

83
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:02,044
I'm serious. Nun read my text.

84
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,139
Where?

85
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,956
We shouldn't be partying.
We should go to the police.

86
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:22,934
I was informed
that there are drugs at this party.

87
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,797
Hold on. There are no drugs here.

88
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,229
Are you the host?

89
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:36,789
You're under arrest.

90
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,596
You must be punished.

91
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:03,269
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

92
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:13,611
We found the goods.

93
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:16,270
Let's go.

94
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,473
I'm so turned on.
If you aren't, you should be ordained.

95
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:54,327
Ouch.

96
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:12,544
You've never done it, right?

97
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,623
Lie down. I'll do it.

98
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:08,161
What?

99
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:10,939
Are you ticklish?
I can't even touch you.

100
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,382
What do you want? Just tell me.
I have to go somewhere else.

101
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:18,659
Anything I want?

102
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:21,299
Yeah.

103
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,927
Do this pose

104
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:57,746
Excuse me, my time is up.

105
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:10,875
You didn't want to have sex with me,
but you wanted to draw.

106
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:12,642
You're sick.

107
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,913
You're going to pay me
even though he didn't cum?

108
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:14,994
He didn't.

109
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,773
But I'm ready to cum.

110
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:52,188
Damn it. I can't believe
you guys would do this.

111
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,679
- Damn it.
- Zouey. First.

112
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,714
I didn't host a party
for you guys to jerk off.

113
00:18:58,132 --> 00:19:00,681
When are you guys going to grow up?

114
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:04,061
It has nothing to do with you.

115
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,137
If I didn't escape to jerk off,

116
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,640
- that policeman would have raped me.
- Come on.

117
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,776
You are exaggerating.

118
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,428
I am not.

119
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,948
I told you that I'm not into this.

120
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,809
- Do you want me to disappear like Nun?
- Zouey.

121
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:24,013
Enough.

122
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:27,443
- I told you not to talk about Nun.
- But I will.

123
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:37,105
We should admit that Nun disappeared

124
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:39,970
because he has bad friends
like you guys.

125
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:50,705
Now I understand you, Nun. Come back
and I won't let them pressure you again.

126
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,882
St. Paul University is the top
international university known

127
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:22,937
for its high tuition fees, great
connections, and prestige.

128
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:27,468
The students are from famous
families, businessmen and wealthy people.

129
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,228
The university has produced many
scholars, politicians, and athletes.

130
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,285
I'm sorry.

131
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:56,223
Except those damn scholarship students.
They're the flaws of our university.

132
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:02,372
After Zouey told the police
that someone read his text

133
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:05,500
to Nun, they came to
investigate at the university.

134
00:21:05,524 --> 00:21:10,423
It was scandalous. The dean was pissed
because he couldn't allow scandals here.

135
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:30,425
Hey, not here.

136
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:32,426
If you're so horny,
go home and jerk off.

137
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,451
Yeah, I will.

138
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:36,656
I don't have class later.

139
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,195
The new athlete student
on a scholarship?

140
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:42,018
I have to make it on the team.

141
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,763
You guys...

142
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:45,877
Stop harassing him.

143
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:49,028
Harassing? We're just discussing.
He can't hear us.

144
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,993
Excuse me, which building
is the Art Room 609?

145
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,906
This is our alumni Phee. He
will be the model for us today.

146
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,892
Ladies, don't drool and behave.

147
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:52,395
Come on, Professor. You should warn the
boys as well. We shouldn't be drooling too.

148
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:58,654
We are majoring in art
because we like beautiful things.

149
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,501
What else is more beautiful
than the human body?

150
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:13,778
Even though I'm a virgin,
I can be horny.

151
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:02,079
(The pizza is here.)

152
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,480
You must be hungry.

153
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,226
Enjoy your meal.

154
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,768
May I use the bathroom?

155
00:28:14,874 --> 00:28:15,656
Got a meal?

156
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,167
Yeah.

157
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:19,668
Come get it.

158
00:28:57,795 --> 00:28:59,007
Is your meal sweeter?

159
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:02,964
Go have a taste.

160
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:49,935
I'm sorry.

161
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:51,804
There's a new order.

162
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,165
If you're still into it,

163
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,427
you can make a new order.

164
00:29:58,444 --> 00:30:01,289
Write "come and taste it"
in the comment and I'll deliver it.

165
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,058
You couldn't restrain yourself, huh?

166
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,804
I'm sorry, bro.

167
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:45,715
I need to clean myself up. I'm so sorry.

168
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,288
Clean yourself?

169
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,508
I'll help you.

170
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,144
Bro.

171
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:12,477
I'm not handsome
and my body isn't ripped.

172
00:32:13,594 --> 00:32:14,728
I'm embarrassed.

173
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:18,513
Why?

174
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:20,710
You're cute.

175
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:25,160
Your scar and the fleck on your neck

176
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:27,489
are so attractive.

177
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,320
I told the professor
I would be 15 minutes late.

178
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:01,122
Will you be done in time?

179
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:03,437
I'm so sorry.

180
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:06,643
Let's go back to draw.

181
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:20,921
The brush is here.

182
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,136
Do you want a sip?

183
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:05,691
Don't say that here.

184
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:14,543
I can say it at your place.

185
00:35:18,262 --> 00:35:19,817
What do you mean?

186
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:24,229
Bro.

187
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:28,663
You like me, don't you?

188
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,467
You weren't drawing too well today.

189
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:37,463
I can give you a private lesson.

190
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:39,895
Do you want it?

191
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:42,763
You'll get even better.

192
00:36:04,276 --> 00:36:06,372
Make it intense like this cup of coffee.

193
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:03,465
First.

194
00:37:04,832 --> 00:37:06,397
What are you doing? It's so loud.

195
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,393
I'm watching an action movie.

196
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:12,200
It's late.

197
00:37:13,412 --> 00:37:14,483
Stop watching.

198
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:16,725
You'll be late for class tomorrow.

199
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,898
Come on, Dad.

200
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:20,752
I'm not a kid anymore.

201
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:22,534
You should go to bed.

202
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:26,797
I see.

203
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:29,524
- You're a repressed rich kid.
- Yeah.

204
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:32,042
I need to let it out.

205
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:34,584
I'm rich and loaded.

206
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:02,514
I'm sorry if I was too rough last time.

207
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:03,932
Why apologize?

208
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,576
I've been looking
for a hot guy like you.

209
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:11,500
Thank you for using my service.

210
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:12,886
You can call me again.

211
00:38:45,138 --> 00:38:47,376
The police interrogated
Nun's classmates in his drama class.

212
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:49,731
They don't know
if Nun has an issue with anyone.

213
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:51,240
Damn it.

214
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:53,239
I live with him and I don't even know.

215
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:56,203
Do you think Nun has gone missing
because of that?

216
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,279
Because of what?
He had many things going on.

217
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:15,033
The yellow motorcycle
we saw in the afternoon?

218
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,739
You are always so nosy, Captain.

219
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:23,463
You drove Nun away because of this.
Haven't you learned your lesson?

220
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:56,193
Just leave me.

221
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,052
You too, Nun.

222
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:10,893
You didn't go missing
because of me, right?

223
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:22,287
Shit.

224
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,265
He ate pizza on your body?

225
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:26,486
That's so dope.

226
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:29,809
Zouey.

227
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:31,622
Take a look at First.

228
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:33,905
He'll get some today.

229
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:36,619
Get what?

230
00:40:37,674 --> 00:40:38,543
Why do I know nothing about this?

231
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:41,217
I told you to move in with us.

232
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:42,850
You're always the last to know.

233
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,485
Zouey asked the model to come here.

234
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,136
Shit.

235
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,279
We had a guy come over for you,
but you didn't sleep with him.

236
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:52,257
So you went to call a guy over
on your own?

237
00:40:52,852 --> 00:40:53,728
That's because I'm picky.

238
00:40:59,652 --> 00:41:01,771
The model is here.

239
00:41:02,132 --> 00:41:03,720
Prepare your brush.

240
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:23,253
- Shit.
- Shit.

241
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:00,900
Why do you guys look like
you just saw a ghost?

242
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,183
You wanted me to come back, didn't you?

243
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:04,841
Friends.

244
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:11,386
Why did you start smoking?

245
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,857
- You used to scold me about it.
- I scolded you

246
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,039
because you wanted to be a doctor,
but kept doing unhealthy things.

247
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,031
I just grew up, okay?

248
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:24,804
You really did.
It's like you aged ten years.

249
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:27,431
You kept saying that I was childish.

250
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:32,350
Has your father stopped acting
like you're a child, First?

251
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:37,220
Where have you been, Nun?

252
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,145
The police interrogated us
like we murdered someone.

253
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:42,491
The reporters made it
a political matter.

254
00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:45,862
You didn't reply to our calls
or text messages.

255
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:49,489
Now why are you suddenly back?

256
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:51,202
What are you up to, Nun?

257
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,628
My mother died. I went to recover
with my brother and father.

258
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,050
I came back after I felt better.

259
00:43:00,938 --> 00:43:02,072
You probably don't get it, Porsche.

260
00:43:03,402 --> 00:43:04,864
- You don't have a mother.
- Fuck you.

261
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:05,810
- You asshole.
- Porsche.

262
00:43:07,053 --> 00:43:08,493
Why are you asking him
so many questions?

263
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,212
- Fuck it.
- Calm down.

264
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:13,934
We should be happy
that he's back and safe.

265
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:16,700
You should go unpack.

266
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:18,350
Let's talk later.

267
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:27,325
You always treat me the best, Zouey.

268
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,256
Calm down.

269
00:44:01,163 --> 00:44:01,743
(First: Dad treats me like a child.)

270
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:02,637
(Nun: You should make him
less worried. Don't smoke too

271
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:03,530
much. You're becoming a
doctor. You shouldn't smoke.)

272
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:04,167
(Captain: You act
like a child too, Nun.

273
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:04,997
When are you going to
have sex. Don't be a child.)

274
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:06,150
(Nun: I don't know how to start.
I don't know how to hit on someone.)

275
00:44:06,174 --> 00:44:07,277
(Porsche: Hit on someone? Just
use the app.) (Zouey: Don't pressure him.)

276
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:08,185
(Nun: Thanks, friend. You
always treat me the best.)

277
00:44:25,183 --> 00:44:26,639
This is my first day
at my brother's friend's house.

278
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:29,344
I played along
with what I found out from his chat.

279
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,340
No one knows that this is Non,
not their friend Nun.

280
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:36,576
Seems like Porsche does
not get along with Nun

281
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:38,824
The one named Captain loves
to encourage his friends to have sex

282
00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:41,299
He did this to Nun too

283
00:44:42,332 --> 00:44:43,347
Why does he have to do that?

284
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:17,967
If you like my service,
please give me five stars.

285
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:19,899
Can I give you more than that?

286
00:46:20,915 --> 00:46:22,416
I've called you here twice.

287
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:27,546
Will you be fired if the shop finds out?

288
00:46:28,146 --> 00:46:29,147
Of course.

289
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:33,801
Well... I'm not doing this with anybody.

290
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:36,757
So, why me then?

291
00:46:38,184 --> 00:46:40,077
I can just tell we both like it rough.

292
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:44,310
That's awesome.

293
00:46:45,209 --> 00:46:46,351
You're not scared of me.

294
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,177
Everyone thinks I'm perverted.

295
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:53,109
It's normal.

296
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,309
Don't do it with someone
who doesn't like it.

297
00:46:58,052 --> 00:47:00,710
Good, I will go even harder next time.

298
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:05,826
I'm joking, man.

299
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:16,225
Are you leaving?

300
00:47:19,165 --> 00:47:20,002
Well...

301
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:22,169
Will there be any day
that you can stay longer?

302
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:32,079
Just text and ask me.

303
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:34,825
Don't make an order.
I might get fired.

304
00:47:36,176 --> 00:47:37,889
You don't have to pay
to have sex with me anymore.

305
00:47:38,937 --> 00:47:39,922
I'm starting to like you.

306
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:48,664
You're Soong?

307
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:53,317
What a great name.

308
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:57,492
First class?

309
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:01,253
What a great name too.

310
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,647
You're the best.

311
00:49:42,894 --> 00:49:47,078
(Captain: He's already here.
Make it happen, Zouey.)

312
00:49:50,826 --> 00:49:51,592
Aren't you going to answer?

313
00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:54,531
I'm sore. I need to take a break.

314
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,972
You prefer oil painting, don't you?

315
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,170
It's much better than your drawing.

316
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:22,642
Bro.

317
00:50:23,533 --> 00:50:24,933
Don't put your lips on me.

318
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:27,053
It tickles.

319
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:28,654
Really?

320
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:32,064
Where should I put them on?

321
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:39,516
Here?

322
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,614
Come on.

323
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:46,684
Your dick is touching my arm.

324
00:52:31,654 --> 00:52:32,914
You like watching anime.

325
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:36,542
That's why you like to call me bro.

326
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:01,869
You...

327
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,560
You're so cute.
Why haven't you done it before?

328
00:53:07,325 --> 00:53:08,857
We're not at the university.

329
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:11,618
I'll give you a private lesson.

330
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,786
Why don't you like it
when someone touches you sexually?

331
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:29,046
I...

332
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,048
I'm ticklish.

333
00:56:34,411 --> 00:56:37,031
That's not true. You're fine now.

334
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,389
I almost had sex with someone.

335
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:47,227
But when he touched me...

336
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:55,163
I think sex is for everyone,
but it's not for me.

337
00:56:56,203 --> 00:56:58,111
I just don't want to look
like a loser to you.

338
00:57:00,176 --> 00:57:00,896
I think...

339
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,624
I really like you.

340
00:57:10,865 --> 00:57:11,608
Zouey.

341
00:57:12,531 --> 00:57:13,110
You know.

342
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:15,521
The first time I had sex...

343
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:17,866
I came before I put it in.

344
00:57:19,453 --> 00:57:21,065
No one is good right off the bat.

345
00:57:22,393 --> 00:57:24,544
Don't expect your parents
or your school to teach you.

346
00:57:25,202 --> 00:57:27,157
You can't even learn from porn.

347
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:30,410
You need to practice.

348
00:57:32,328 --> 00:57:36,066
You're right.
Porn stars start fucking from the start.

349
00:57:36,575 --> 00:57:37,685
They can do it for hours.

350
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:40,500
Sometimes it makes me feel like a loser.

351
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:42,894
That's why I turn to anime.

352
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:47,163
It's okay, Zouey.

353
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,822
Take it slow.

354
00:57:51,604 --> 00:57:53,912
I'll make you want to have sex with me.

355
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:00,064
I have to go.

356
00:58:39,695 --> 00:58:40,982
(Captain: Damn it. He's as hot as
a Greek statue, but you let him go?)

357
00:58:41,006 --> 00:58:42,416
(@First How are you?
Did you sleep with the pizza guy again?)

358
00:58:44,439 --> 00:58:46,468
(Captain: Awesome, friend.)

359
00:58:46,493 --> 00:58:47,409
Update.

360
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:50,462
First slept with a stranger
after Captain encouraged him.

361
00:58:51,346 --> 00:58:52,409
Maybe...

362
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:56,070
Nun slept with a stranger
just to prove himself to his friends

363
00:58:56,535 --> 00:58:58,256
and he was killed like Zouey said.

364
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:01,455
Captain might be the reason.

365
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,512
But don't worry, Dad.

366
00:59:04,262 --> 00:59:05,279
I'll be careful.

367
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:08,664
I'll find the person
who made Nun disappear.

368
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,689
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

369
00:59:18,148 --> 00:59:19,242
Guys.

370
00:59:20,135 --> 00:59:21,292
You don't work here.

371
00:59:21,887 --> 00:59:23,365
But you come back
to make me pay for your drinks.

372
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:25,828
I have an update.

373
00:59:27,236 --> 00:59:31,505
A client asked me to just lay there
and he drew me.

374
00:59:32,506 --> 00:59:33,538
I found an artist too.

375
00:59:34,055 --> 00:59:35,376
I hope it's not the same guy.

376
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,692
(Zouey : First just be careful when u hook up
with stranger , you could get killed and mugged)

377
00:59:51,716 --> 00:59:53,078
Captain: Don't overthink. A naive guy
like Nun also hooked up with stranger)

378
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:54,039
(Zouey : That's why he disappeared!)

379
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,637
(What are you doing?)

380
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:03,999
What's up with you guys?
Do you have a girlfriend?

381
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,239
Why would I do that?

382
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,577
I'm digging gold from a rich kid.

383
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:15,506
Look.

384
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:21,043
I'll get this assessed tomorrow.
It's brand name.

385
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:24,156
This behavior of yours
won't go away, huh?

386
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,566
I'm going to sleep with a virgin.

387
01:00:27,302 --> 01:00:28,514
He's so cute.

388
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:30,751
He must be rich too.

389
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:32,579
Rich, huh?

390
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:35,060
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

391
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:41,522
(Phee: I'll dream of you.
I hope you dream of me too.

392
01:00:43,772 --> 01:00:46,835
(Soong: I'm going to bed.
See you later, baby.)

393
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,372
Zouey is too scared.
You think I'll be tricked?

394
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:52,567
He likes me

395
01:01:01,065 --> 01:01:04,841
I thought sex is for
everyone but me, but if sex

396
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:08,641
and love come hand
in hand, I'll give it a shot.

397
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:15,139
(Next Episode) The police found out that
his signal was last tracked here.

398
01:01:15,164 --> 01:01:16,985
His signal was gone
when he went to sleep somewhere else.

399
01:01:17,321 --> 01:01:19,034
I think there must be something
on his phone.

400
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:21,273
Don't you want to continue?

401
01:01:22,056 --> 01:01:25,535
I think it might be fun
if I make you want me too.

402
01:01:25,872 --> 01:01:29,070
- Do you know the account Wash Your Sin?
- Car wash and sex.

403
01:01:29,344 --> 01:01:31,049
We can contact them.

404
01:01:31,463 --> 01:01:33,089
The only thing we can be sure of

405
01:01:33,535 --> 01:01:35,264
is that Nun isn't as
innocent as we thought.
