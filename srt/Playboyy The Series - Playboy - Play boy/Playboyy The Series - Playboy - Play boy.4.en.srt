00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:23,426
(Previously)
Is this the guy you owe money to, Nant?

2
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:26,488
How did you get this laptop?

3
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:30,834
The guy who had the laptop
said he found it at his dorm,

4
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,139
which is near Playboyy.

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,624
The person he was doing
a sex call with must be at that dorm.

6
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:41,436
He could be a host at Playboyy.

7
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:51,891
A no-name actor is exposed.

8
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,383
He has been having sex with strangers.

9
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:58,735
He has been having cybersex.

10
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:06,143
(Live video is starting soon)

11
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:07,652
I'm back.

12
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:12,808
First, I would like to thank
a generous fan who got me a new laptop.

13
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,907
The one I just bought broke after a day,
so I haven't been online.

14
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:19,814
Do you miss me?
If you do, send me a gift.

15
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:20,829
(Can you take off your pants?)

16
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:21,470
(I want you to stand)

17
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:22,470
(You're cute)

18
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:23,220
(Take it off)

19
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:26,056
Take it off.

20
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,199
Which one?

21
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:30,559
The top or the bottom?

22
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:39,683
(So horny)

23
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,659
(Can we meet?)

24
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,667
(Go lower)

25
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:43,292
Go lower.

26
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:45,948
Lower?

27
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:47,292
(Take it off)

28
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:47,816
(Take your pants off)

29
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,417
(I want to see more)

30
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,858
I need to see some cash

31
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:56,990
to be motivated to go lower.

32
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:04,188
(Is your new laptop good?)

33
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:11,266
Guys.

34
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:14,024
The donor just texted me.

35
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,914
He's so sweet.

36
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:17,711
(Let's do a private call
in case you want more)

37
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:21,398
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,430
I need to go.

39
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:27,668
If you miss me,
you can send me gifts.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,547
Bye.

41
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:42,921
(Nuthyyim91 is Calling)

42
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,018
Hello.

43
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,112
What's your name?

44
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:53,081
Nuth.

45
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:54,773
Are you Phop?

46
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,842
Yes, are you Nuth?

47
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:01,093
You bought me a new laptop.

48
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,757
You won't come online without a laptop.

49
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:07,533
I'm glad we finally get to talk.

50
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:09,564
We've been chatting for a long time.

51
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,720
Wow.

52
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:12,595
Do you like me that much?

53
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:17,517
Yeah, I haven't even seen your dick.
Is it huge?

54
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:36,445
Do you want to see it?

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,210
If you do...

56
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,339
Done.

57
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,729
I transferred via the app.

58
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,800
Let me see how much you shaved.

59
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,334
Show me your face too.

60
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:28,983
That's so hot.

61
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:30,702
So sexy.

62
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:32,866
Call my name.

63
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,271
Nuth.

64
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:42,712
Yes, Nuth.

65
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,915
That's so hot.

66
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,418
Hey.

67
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:04,232
(Lollipop69 blocked you)

68
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,735
(Successful money transfer)

69
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,670
(Mom, I got my bonus)

70
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,238
(I'll give it to you,
give some money to my siblings)

71
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:58,308
I'm not proud of myself.

72
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:00,651
Anyone would say it's disgraceful.

73
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:05,042
But I wasn't born rich.

74
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:07,401
This is the only way
to make my life better.

75
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:13,584
At least my mother and siblings
will have a good life.

77

(Episode 4: All about feelings)

78
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,214
Shit.

79
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,511
Captain.

80
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:34,553
This is so dope.

81
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,249
I respect you.

82
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:39,663
Your girlfriend is so hot.

83
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,905
Her boobs are bouncy.

84
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:44,858
Hey, that's his girlfriend.

85
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:49,381
From now on, we'll believe you entirely.

86
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:53,045
You are one of us.

87
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:56,670
I'll talk to Keen

88
00:08:56,962 --> 00:09:00,715
and ask him to make you a starter
and join the next match.

89
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,793
Her moves are sick. Look at her waist.

90
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:12,389
- So horny.
- Shit.

91
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:14,195
So hot.

92
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:16,289
His girlfriend is so fair.

93
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:18,148
Look at her boobs.

94
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:28,284
(Thank you, guys
I've completed my mission)

95
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,628
(I'm now a rugby player
for the university)

96
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:31,463
(Awesome)

97
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,261
(Amazing)

98
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:33,598
(Good job bro!)

99
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:46,168
(Hey, you've been quiet
How are you? Why won't you come home?)

100
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:48,873
Captain.

101
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:54,623
I need to talk to you.

102
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:57,991
How could you do that?

103
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:02,381
- Do what?
- The clip.

104
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,488
Does your girlfriend know
that you were filming?

105
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,910
What a stupid idiot.

106
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:16,965
I thought he found out that I was acting.

107
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:18,887
Of course.

108
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,605
The camera was so close.

109
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:25,674
Does she know
you showed it to your friends?

110
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:29,448
I knew it. She doesn't know.

111
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,229
You can't do that.

112
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:34,042
You're violating her rights.

113
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:35,512
Puen.

114
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:36,948
Why are you such a good person?

115
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:39,276
I just showed the seniors.

116
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,948
I didn't sell the clip.

117
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:44,018
I have to act like them
when I'm with them

118
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:46,933
or they'll think I'm a pussy like you.

119
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,999
If you know the real me,

120
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:01,522
you won't think I'm a pussy.

121
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,581
Be gentle. It hurts.

122
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:32,971
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

123
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:36,912
Do you want me to suck your nipples
so you can come faster?

124
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,350
That's enough. Let's just stop.

125
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,225
Okay then.

126
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:03,155
Honestly.

127
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,538
Am I that unfuckable?

128
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:10,459
No, I just need a little help.

129
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:13,469
If I don't take enough orders,
I don't get enough money.

130
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:14,623
If I take many orders,

131
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,420
then I run out of juice.

132
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:19,498
Let me ask you something.

133
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,483
Have you been hard with a client

134
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:24,538
without any help?

135
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:29,743
Well...

136
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,072
Sometimes.

137
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:32,892
It depends on how I feel.

138
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:35,665
Some guys are so handsome,
but I don't get turned on by them.

139
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:00,617
That's enough.

140
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,359
I didn't make you come.

141
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:05,934
I have to go.

Look at me.

I think...

155
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,772
What if he's not doing it for the money?

156
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,882
He doesn't have to like me.

157

What if he doesn't like sex with me?

Do you understand

that it's hard to find
another person who likes BDSM?

160
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:08,792
Yeah.

161
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:10,972
You have a point.

162
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:12,667
Keep talking.

00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:15,955
Well...

164
00:16:16,836 --> 00:16:20,445
When I wasn't living with him
and we didn't meet often,

165
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,610
I was excited.

166
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:23,696
But...

167
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,930
When I moved in with him

168
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,086
and we were together all the time,

169
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:29,647
I felt like

170
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,565
I got bored.

171
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,510
Do you think it's possible?

172
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:36,495
Yeah.

173
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,651
Of course.

174
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:43,443
I told you.

175
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,903
He might not be dating you
for your money.

176
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:47,591
Maybe he was...

177
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:49,786
You weren't exclusive.

178
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:51,849
Free sex.

179
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:53,966
Yeah.

180
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:03,664
Then what I said to him was mean.

181
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,289
Hey, wait.

182
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:10,558
Where are you going?

183
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,271
I'm going to do the right thing.

184
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,255
I'm going to apologize.

185
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,138
I'm going to tell him how I feel.

186
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,646
Looking like that?

187
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:26,993
Thank you.

188
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:28,946
I have to go.

189
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:31,672
- Wear some pants.
- Okay.

190
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,003
I really don't understand you guys.

191
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:45,308
- What's the first rule of this job?
- I know.

192
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,096
Don't fall in love with the client.

193
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,928
I don't know
if I think of him as a client.

194
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:58,365
Don't say "true love" and "soulmate."

195
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:05,415
It's not true love.

196
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,446
But we just get along.

197
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,610
Get along?

198
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,415
Like him?

199
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:14,899
You can get along with other people.

200
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:17,404
Not just the doctor's son.

201
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:21,005
Why don't you find someone
in the BDSM group?

202
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:27,990
I have something to tell you, Soong.

203
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,268
The guy I'm seeing

204
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,393
is friends with the doctor's son.

205
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:40,478
I heard him say
that he wanted to die because of you.

206
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,685
I don't care if you love him or not.

207
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:49,450
You can't just
be ignorant about it, right?

208
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,599
You should be responsible
for his feelings.

209
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:17,862
(I'm here, how should I start?)

210
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:20,425
(Just be true to your feelings)

211
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:42,336
What?

212
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,695
What happened?

213
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:45,930
First is coming.

214
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,094
I'm sure he's trying to make it up to me.

215
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:50,123
I'm going back to him.

216
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,502
Hold on, what for?

217
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,338
Get over him.

218
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,213
It's impossible.

219
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:02,908
Even though we're just sex buddies,

220
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:06,809
we can't be in
a monogamous relationship.

221
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,388
I think it's possible.

222
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,794
Try being in love.

223
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,099
What stupid love?

224
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:17,426
You first got a smart watch.

225
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:19,692
You sold the ring you stole.

226
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:22,543
You almost got him to buy an apartment.

227
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,708
You're just being a leech.

228
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,926
Don't overthink it.

229
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:31,618
If he's acting out or he's heartbroken,
just let him be.

230
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:32,637
Ignore him.

231
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,948
Find a new baby

232
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,268
and share your income with me.

233
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:29,295
Why did you do this?

234
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,178
Why did you do this?

235
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,396
Huh? Why did you lie to me?

236
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:38,323
Why?

237
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:42,917
Why did you do this?

238
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,073
You lied to me.

239
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:50,203
You lied.

240
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,047
You lied to me.

241
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,461
Why did you do this?

242
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,934
Why did you do this, Soong?

243
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:04,308
You lied to me.

244
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:08,090
You lied.

245
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,777
How could you do this?

246
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,683
Tell me, Soong.

247
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,453
Why did you do this?

248
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:19,648
How are you?

249
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:21,797
You've been here for days.

250
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:25,156
Yeah.

251
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,115
I still can't get over it.

252
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:31,380
It's such a big deal.

253
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:58,751
Why do you like wearing a mask?

254
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:04,743
So others don't see
my facial expressions.

255
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,457
It allows me to be who I truly am.

256
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:10,270
It's easier that way.

257
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:12,793
Really?

258
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:15,761
- You can be the sadist that you are.
- Yes.

259
00:23:17,082 --> 00:23:18,254
You like that, don't you?

260
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,085
Choose which one you want.

261
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,136
Don't you have the dog mask?

262
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:40,511
I'm not that kinky.

263
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:05,238
Even though he doesn't have the dog mask,
it isn't guaranteed

264
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,208
that he isn't Nuthyim91.

265
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:10,388
I must find out the truth.

266
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,809
Today...

267
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:15,143
Do you want to switch roles, Master?

268
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,169
Nant.

269
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,520
This isn't what we agreed on.

270
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:43,934
Really?

271
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,317
- Then why did you do it to me?
- I never did.

272
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:48,815
Nant, what the hell is wrong with you?

273
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:50,455
You're scaring me.

274
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:52,096
We don't use weapons.

275
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:54,518
- The contract is clear about that.
- What contract?

276
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:58,354
You drafted and signed it yourself.
How can you forget something like this?

277
00:25:58,711 --> 00:25:59,836
Who are you?

278
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:03,820
Tell me where the contract is.

279
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,656
Tell me or I'll slit your throat.

280
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:08,648
You know I'm not afraid to.

281
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:30,827
(Slave and Master Agreement)

282
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,197
Why do you not know about the contract?

283
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:46,658
Nant knows about it.

284
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:48,259
You're not him.

285
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:50,634
Tell me who you are
and what happened to Nant.

286
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:55,216
Are these the guys

287
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,255
Nant was involved with?

288
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:00,997
Yes, who should we start with?

289
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:18,266
They were hosts at the Playboyy.

290
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,238
These three guys

291
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:22,394
have resigned.

292
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:23,581
But they were hot for awhile.

293
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:26,222
That's why First got conned.

294
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:29,355
There's an old apartment building
behind the bar.

295
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,890
Aob, Teena, Soong, and Jump live there.

296
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:35,563
After your brother met Aob,

297
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:40,039
I saw him walking out of this building
with Teena, Soong, and Jump.

298
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,719
He knows all three of them.

299
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:44,146
So what?

300
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:47,240
Why do you think they're Nuthyim91?

301
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,451
I don't know if they are.

302
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:51,060
But your brother was a drug addict.

303
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:59,441
That's why he was in debt
and signed the contract with me.

304
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:00,918
So he would get cash for drugs.

305
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,057
I saw these three men doing drugs
in the bar's locker room.

306
00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:11,711
- Maybe...
- One of them sold drugs to him.

307
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:21,047
(I want to clear the air with you)

308
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:25,034
What are you going to do?

309
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:32,940
I'll do anything to find out the truth.

310
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,716
Do you want add-on services?

311
00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:50,208
If you rush it,
I'll only give you 500 baht.

312
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:11,346
Let me fuck you for 2,000 baht.

313
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:12,940
What?

314
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,299
Your dick is huge. I can't take it.

315
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,096
Let me fuck you.

316
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,393
Wait.

317
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,182
Do you have a condom?

318
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:23,994
I don't like wearing it.

319
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,401
Don't worry.

320
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,896
- I can come outside.
- Hey.

321
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:30,685
No, it's risky.

322
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:37,802
I don't care
if you like wearing it or not.

323
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:40,064
Sex workers

324
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:42,528
get diseases because of people like you.

325
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:46,911
I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood anymore.

326
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:53,706
I'm sorry. I can give you a handjob.

327
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,776
It's okay. Let's just stop.
Give me the QR code.

328
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:38,000
(I have to pay for your sibling's tuition)

329
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:43,724
Sex workers aren't the only ones
conning people.

330
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:48,196
Sometimes clients con us too.

331
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,141
We can't sue them.

332
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,837
We just have to accept it.

333
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,758
(This is Nuth,
I'm so upset that you blocked me)

334
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:25,808
(You don't realize
how long I've been watching you)

335
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,295
(I donated and sent gifts to you
and you make me so happy)

336
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,021
(Looking at you before bed
makes me sleep well)

337
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:33,852
(You must find it strange
that a stranger is so crazy about you)

338
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:36,391
(But it's how I feel)

339
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,033
(Let's talk, I have a job offer for you)

340
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,898
(I'm sorry, I didn't mean to block you)

341
00:34:03,572 --> 00:34:06,603
(I accidentally blocked you,
what's the job offer?)

342
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,892
(Shoot a movie with me as the director)

343
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,634
(If you're interested,
come to this location)

344
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,330
(Here is the deposit,
you'll get the rest after we're done)

345
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,148
(10,000 baht deposited)

346
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,423
I didn't think I'll meet you again.

347
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:17,720
How have you been?

348
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:19,994
I'm good.

349
00:35:21,142 --> 00:35:22,134
Excuse me.

350
00:35:22,673 --> 00:35:24,298
How did we meet?

351
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:25,577
Hey.

352
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:27,420
At the dorm.

353
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:29,973
- At Soong's place.
- Really?

354
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,489
How do I know Soong?

355
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,372
It's loud here.

356
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,200
We can't talk.

357
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:39,293
Let's go back to my place.

358
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,814
It's easier to talk.
I have a bed and other stuff.

359
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:47,064
I'm not drunk yet.

360
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,106
He knows Nant, but he isn't surprised.

361
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,942
That means he doesn't know
that Nant is missing.

362
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:37,622
He is probably not involved.

363
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,897
But he might know something.

364
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,326
I'm sorry, Zouey.

365
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,467
I have to do this.

366
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:51,443
I don't have feelings for him.

367
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:11,419
Hello, Zouey.

368
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:13,075
Come here now.

369
00:37:54,158 --> 00:37:55,518
If you don't do anything,

370
00:37:56,018 --> 00:37:57,651
your dream will just be an imagination.

371
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,246
But a fulfilled dream

372
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:17,189
is something only the rich can achieve.

373
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:28,845
Hello.

374
00:38:29,736 --> 00:38:30,712
It's Nuth.

375
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,009
I'm sorry. I need some money.

376
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,283
I didn't spend it on guys.

377
00:38:41,254 --> 00:38:42,004
Please.

378
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:44,309
Let me borrow one more time.

379
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,223
Then...

380
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,910
I'll sell you the stuff.

381
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:52,733
But...

382
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:55,889
Please give me more percentages.

383
00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:59,803
Of course. Thank you.

384
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:02,709
Send me the location.

385
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:05,470
Okay.

386
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:44,561
So?

387
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:46,204
Where is Nant?

388
00:39:48,665 --> 00:39:49,478
Huh?

389
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:50,853
Are you going to tell me or not?

390
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,337
Where is Nant?

391
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:58,122
Do you know Nant?

392
00:40:05,497 --> 00:40:06,411
You're here.

393
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,434
Figure it out.

394
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:21,665
Hey.

395
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:24,677
I know we didn't end on good terms.

396
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,896
Let's clear the air.

397
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:28,802
Let's not do this.

398
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:32,255
You started this mess.

399
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,482
You wouldn't have sex with me.

400
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:36,402
But you slept with someone else.

401
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,245
Huh?

402
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:40,643
Hold on.

403
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:42,573
Who did I sleep with?

404
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:45,933
I'm sad.

405
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,995
I think about you all day.

406
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,251
How could you do this to me?

407
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:52,512
You act like a virgin.

408
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:54,973
- But you are a whore.
- Hey.

409
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:57,043
You're not making any sense.

410
00:40:57,811 --> 00:40:59,215
You're high, aren't you?

411
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,901
I don't know what you're high on.

412
00:41:13,776 --> 00:41:15,401
But I never slept with anyone.

413
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:19,616
You can't get back at me
by making out with my friend.

414
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:21,905
I can make out with anyone.

415
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:24,030
We are not a couple.

416
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,812
You have no right to be jealous.

417
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:15,491
You know they're dangerous,
why did you get involved with them?

418
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:17,813
I tried to find out

419
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,652
- what they did to my brother.
- By making out with them?

420
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:23,317
Was it necessary?

421
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:29,012
Are you jealous?

422
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:31,790
No.

423
00:43:32,973 --> 00:43:34,137
Do you care about my brother?

424
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,035
No.

425
00:43:39,871 --> 00:43:40,668
I...

426
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:42,387
I'm worried about you.

427
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:44,215
I don't want you to be in danger.

428
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:45,508
That's not true.

429
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:47,805
Were you dating my brother?

430
00:43:48,446 --> 00:43:49,328
Did you like him?

431
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,827
You killed him
because he messed around with them?

432
00:43:52,852 --> 00:43:53,864
This isn't a thriller.

433
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:55,844
It was nothing.

434
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,461
I didn't like your brother.

435
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:59,813
I guess I was just protective of him.

436
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:03,672
Because I made a contract with him
to be his master.

437
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:05,633
I'm not your slave.

438
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:08,039
Even though my face looks like his

439
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:09,647
and my voice sounds like his,

440
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:11,210
I am not him.

441
00:44:13,327 --> 00:44:15,218
Feel free to help me find my brother.

442
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:17,530
But don't cross the line with me.

443
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:56,408
This is the last song.
Please leave after it's over.

444
00:44:58,143 --> 00:45:00,026
Everything comes to an end.

445
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:02,639
This song.

446
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:04,545
This bar.

447
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:06,694
My relationship.

448
00:45:07,678 --> 00:45:09,491
Your relationship
with the pizza delivery boy.

449
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:12,866
And everything

450
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,197
started because
Captain wanted us to have sex.

451
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:22,588
Why do you like having sex?

452
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,627
You were rough the first time.

453
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:29,049
You know.

454
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,008
I just wanted to be bad like in the movies
because my life sucked.

455
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:34,938
But after trying it,

456
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,922
I realized that
just watching isn't enough.

457
00:45:39,547 --> 00:45:40,368
What about you?

458
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:42,587
Why are you afraid to have sex?

459
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:48,082
You know.

460
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,714
But after meeting him,

461
00:45:53,027 --> 00:45:54,511
I feel like I want to have sex with him.

462
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,767
But sex isn't enough.

463
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:00,888
I want his love.

464
00:46:01,138 --> 00:46:02,138
Yeah.

465
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,169
I also want love.

466
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:09,059
In the end, it all comes down to love.

467
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:30,323
I'm sorry about your relationship.

468
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:32,862
He shouldn't have done that to you.

469
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,129
But I'm not sorry about yours.

470
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,649
He wouldn't have done that

471
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:42,134
if he didn't have any feelings for you.

472
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:48,336
I know consent is something

473
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:49,938
you're worried about.

474
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:53,638
I just think

475
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,084
that you guys

476
00:46:57,006 --> 00:46:58,099
just misunderstood each other.

477
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:03,029
Wait.

478
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:05,807
I never slept with anyone.

479
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,263
Why does he think differently?

480
00:47:10,716 --> 00:47:12,161
Think about it.

481
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:21,303
Shit.

482
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:23,132
Captain's clip.

483
00:47:24,491 --> 00:47:25,671
How did he see that?

484
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:30,210
You should ask him.

485
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:32,222
But I think that's the reason.

486
00:47:35,058 --> 00:47:36,066
Zouey.

487
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:38,871
My relationship is over.

488
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:42,082
But yours is still hopeful.

489
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:44,855
Let me ask you something.

490
00:47:47,102 --> 00:47:48,860
What's your feeling right now?

491
00:47:50,696 --> 00:47:51,750
I'm hot.

492
00:47:56,032 --> 00:47:57,180
I want him back.

493
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,916
Relax.

494
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,244
We'll just do some test shots today.

495
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:17,781
Tell me your name, age,
height, and weight.

496
00:49:20,422 --> 00:49:21,515
I'm Phop.

497
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:22,992
I'm 20 years old.

498
00:49:23,562 --> 00:49:24,758
I weigh 73 kilograms.

499
00:49:25,414 --> 00:49:26,672
My height is 182 centimeters.

500
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:41,244
Okay.

501
00:49:42,088 --> 00:49:43,369
Tell me about a sexual experience

502
00:49:43,487 --> 00:49:44,776
and jerk off.

503
00:49:46,643 --> 00:49:48,533
Are we shooting porn?

504
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:53,096
I've never had a boyfriend.

505
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:55,674
Let's just do it.

506
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,747
There are instructions

507
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:14,583
and prices on this board.

508
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:16,887
I'll show one at a time.

509
00:50:17,852 --> 00:50:18,868
If you let me do it,

510
00:50:19,774 --> 00:50:20,751
you'll get the money.

511
00:50:33,535 --> 00:50:35,019
(Licking nipples)

512
00:50:50,626 --> 00:50:53,055
(Sucking)

513
00:50:58,512 --> 00:50:59,301
(Licking ass)

514
00:50:59,326 --> 00:51:00,223
(Sucking until your eyes meet the camera)

515
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:04,481
(Kissing)

516
00:51:04,506 --> 00:51:07,913
(Penetration)

517
00:51:45,473 --> 00:51:46,684
Should we continue or not?

518
00:51:51,705 --> 00:51:53,017
Who's wearing the condom?

519
00:51:54,174 --> 00:51:55,033
Me.

520
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:39,624
Why? Are you scared?

521
00:52:41,968 --> 00:52:42,835
Of what?

522
00:52:45,182 --> 00:52:47,729
You were probably so drunk
you couldn't remember.

523
00:52:49,635 --> 00:52:50,885
You were wasted that night.

524
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:53,370
You were hallucinating
and sleeping on the ground.

525
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:55,792
Soong found you.

526
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,612
You went back to his place.

527
00:52:58,928 --> 00:53:00,514
So that's how we met.

528
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:04,905
I see.

529
00:53:06,952 --> 00:53:08,381
What about Jump?

530
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:10,592
What kind of person is he?

531
00:53:10,695 --> 00:53:11,648
What do you want?

532
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:13,718
Why are you asking about my friend?

533
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,867
Let's continue where we left off.

534
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,546
Tell me everything that happened.

535
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:29,213
Are you a friend of Zouey?

536
00:53:30,588 --> 00:53:31,753
What do you really want?

537
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:34,979
I'm sorry.

538
00:53:35,624 --> 00:53:36,937
I was wasted at the bar.

539
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:39,320
Now I can't do anything.

540
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,054
You should leave.

541
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:45,195
Hey.

542
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,265
You really want me to leave?

543
00:54:15,397 --> 00:54:16,873
Be mad at me.

544
00:54:17,002 --> 00:54:18,369
He already rejected me.

545
00:54:21,338 --> 00:54:22,791
I'll wait for you at home.

546
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:33,935
It's not like that, Zouey.

547
00:54:35,029 --> 00:54:37,669
He just wanted to have sex with me
because he wanted to know something.

548
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:39,834
- But I rejected.
- Shut up.

549
00:54:45,026 --> 00:54:46,878
Sex is so important to you, huh?

550
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:49,471
- It's not like that.
- Fine.

551
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,021
What are you doing?

552
00:54:56,404 --> 00:54:57,342
Come on.

553
00:54:57,803 --> 00:54:59,435
- What are you doing?
- You want sex, don't you?

554
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:00,662
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

555
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:03,279
- You want sex so badly, don't you?
- What are you doing?

556
00:55:04,115 --> 00:55:05,357
Come on.

557
00:55:05,688 --> 00:55:08,243
- Let me go.
- You want it, don't you?

558
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:09,642
- Come on.
- Zouey.

559
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,853
Let's do it.

560
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:17,080
Zouey.

561
00:55:17,298 --> 00:55:18,759
What are you doing?

562
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:20,080
Stop it.

563
00:55:20,105 --> 00:55:21,228
- You want it, don't you?
- Stop.

564
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:23,872
- Stop it.
- I'm going to sleep with you.

565
00:55:24,293 --> 00:55:25,208
Zouey.

566
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:26,887
It's so important, huh?

567
00:55:27,614 --> 00:55:29,137
Sex.

568
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,762
- Come on.
- No, Zouey.

569
00:55:31,794 --> 00:55:32,699
It's not like that.

570
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:34,931
- You want me, don't you?
- No, Zouey. I'm sorry.

571
00:55:35,106 --> 00:55:37,006
I'm sorry.

572
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:53,687
You are a terrible friend.

573
00:56:03,284 --> 00:56:04,182
You.

574
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:07,385
I've never judged who you slept with.

575
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:11,698
But you can't sleep
with your friend's boyfriend.

576
00:56:14,128 --> 00:56:15,143
I'm not your friend.

577
00:56:16,162 --> 00:56:18,201
What the hell did you say?

578
00:56:18,226 --> 00:56:20,146
- Hey.
- Calm down.

579
00:56:21,693 --> 00:56:23,498
- Calm down.
- Hey.

580
00:56:24,177 --> 00:56:25,451
How could you say that?

581
00:56:26,685 --> 00:56:28,560
It's true.

582
00:56:29,977 --> 00:56:31,922
Zouey, listen to me.

583
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:36,062
Thank you for thinking of me as a friend
and for caring about me.

584
00:56:37,992 --> 00:56:40,641
You said that I've changed
ever since I came back.

585
00:56:41,055 --> 00:56:43,102
I seem more mature and I smoke.

586
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:45,128
I cook and I don't drink beer.

587
00:56:47,323 --> 00:56:48,104
What?

588
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:50,464
What the hell are you talking about?

589
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:54,729
I'm actually not your friend.

590
00:56:55,857 --> 00:56:56,701
I'm not Nant.

591
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:59,053
I'm his twin brother.

592
00:57:02,342 --> 00:57:03,295
Nont.

593
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:21,796
What the hell?

594
00:57:52,962 --> 00:57:53,978
Feelings.

595
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:58,017
Feelings make us humans.

596
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:12,371
The feeling of disappointment.

597
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:23,249
The feeling of hopefulness.

598
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,640
Phop.

599
00:58:25,421 --> 00:58:26,757
Even though I don't have any money,

600
00:58:29,408 --> 00:58:30,416
I have stuff.

601
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,216
The feeling of expectation.

602
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:07,133
The feeling of hopefulness.

603
00:59:42,655 --> 00:59:46,014
But it doesn't matter
what feelings we have.

604
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,729
We should not feel hopeless.

605
00:59:56,815 --> 01:00:00,158
Especially when it comes to
feeling hopeless to humanity.

606
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:13,544
(Next Episode) Nant was involved
with three sex workers at Playboyy.

607
01:00:14,117 --> 01:00:16,297
One of them made him a drug addict
and had debts.

608
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:19,071
Are you sure you have no other secrets?

609
01:00:19,313 --> 01:00:21,992
Those three guys

610
01:00:23,711 --> 01:00:24,680
are your crush,

611
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:28,284
your pizza delivery boy,

612
01:00:29,081 --> 01:00:30,542
and your employee at the car wash shop.

613
01:00:31,113 --> 01:00:32,214
How did you get here?

614
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:33,534
Who the hell are you?

615
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:35,253
It's hot.

616
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:37,917
Let go of me!
