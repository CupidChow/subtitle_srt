(Previously)
What's so sexy about a 2D image?

2
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,161
You are so nosy you drove Nun away.

3
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:22,992
We shouldn't be partying.
We should go to the police.

4
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:25,072
I told you that I'm not into this.

5
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,213
Do you want me to disappear like Nun?

6
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:30,361
- Shit.
- Shit.

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,072
Where have you been, Nun?

8
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:34,072
Do you think Nun has gone missing
because of that?

9
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:36,713
Because of what?
He had many things going on.

10
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:38,642
Excuse me, which building
is the Art Room 609?

11
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:41,144
You're so cute.
Why haven't you done it before?

12
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:43,128
You must be hungry.

13
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:46,468
The police raided a beer bar.

14
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:50,099
Department of Health warns
about having sex with strangers.

15
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:53,592
Officials warn about having sex
during Valentine's Day.

16
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:55,336
Lawsuit against gay dating application.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,263
A police officer stole a woman's money
before moving on to his next target.

18
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:02,466
(Episode 2: Getting what you want)

19
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:06,443
(Last month)

20
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,419
Hello, who are you interested
in this evening?

21
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,662
What about the big guy with tattoos?

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,099
Oh, are you talking about Aob?

23
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:17,242
He's with a client.

24
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:41,605
Even though he isn't free,
let me introduce you to this.

25
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:45,159
Playboyy Lounge.

26
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:50,769
Aob isn't free, but we have so many guys
for you to choose from.

27
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:55,791
Everyone is handsome and buff.
We have so many to offer you.

28
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:58,050
They are available.

29
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,728
We have many guys
for you to choose from.

30
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,550
Which one do you like?

31
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,972
Let me tell you that everyone is very good.

32
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:08,242
(Soong: We're leaving)

33
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:11,898
(Teena: We're packing up
Jump: Good luck, see you later)

34
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:25,778
I need to use the bathroom.
I'll extend my service hours.

35
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:13,045
Are you guys sure about this?

36
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,561
Yeah.

37
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:16,597
Thank you for teaching us.

38
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,847
If you quit, what are you guys
going to do for a living?

39
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:20,886
We'll go back to doing what we did
before working here.

40
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:25,332
I don't care if we become poorer.
But the boss has gone too far.

41
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:30,636
I think this job isn't horrible
if we had signed up for it.

42
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:31,918
What do you mean?

43
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:35,030
The boss never forces anyone
to work here.

44
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:36,819
Really?

45
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,256
You should know better than we do.

46
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:42,655
Whatever, it doesn't matter now.

47
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,748
I won't change my mind.

48
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,842
Good luck to you then.

49
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,328
Don't come back and ask me for a drink.

50
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:56,010
There ain't no cliche reason
like oh, I don't have a choice.

51
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:59,378
I choose this job because
I like sex. Who doesn't?

52
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:03,503
But they don't pay you enough.
To be real, you only survive on tips.

53
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:07,643
So if you do this freelance,
you can get all the cash you earn.

54
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:10,221
And also, the customer gets to choose you.

55
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:12,893
Never use their rules,
I don't think it's fair.

56
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,706
They don't build this body
to fuck granddads and sluts.

57
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,534
It's time to choose some johns ourselves.

58
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:30,798
You can't cheat your way to number one.

59
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:35,642
You just have to make them go slower
and be behind you.

60
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,533
Without you guys,
I have sex four or five times a day.

61
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:41,650
Four or five times a day.

62
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:45,475
Is it worth
the 4,000-5,000 baht tip per day?

63
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:48,312
Are you nuts? Just 4,000-5,000 baht?

64
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:53,585
Jump, I make more than
ten thousand baht a day.

65
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,898
What?

66
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:58,031
- Damn.
- Don't underestimate me.

67
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:01,965
You can't make that much money
just by laying there.

68
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:05,343
You have to call them baby or babe.

69
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:09,187
Please them and make them feel special.

70
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:12,757
- Then the money will keep coming.
- Damn.

71
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:15,992
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,846
(Soong: I'm going to bed
See you, baby)

73
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,651
(Good night)

74
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,800
(Playboyy)

75
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:02,849
We lived together at my father's house.

76
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,357
We were in the same club
when we were freshmen.

77
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,865
We were very close then.

78
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:09,357
Nun is a good person.

79
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:12,649
But he's like a child
who doesn't know how to do anything.

80
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,938
He hires a housekeeper to do everything.

81
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,891
He is very introverted.

82
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:21,414
The only person who can enter his room
is the housekeeper.

83
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:24,219
We do not know for sure
when he started going missing.

84
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:27,438
He used to go sleep
somewhere else for days.

85
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,371
It's normal that we couldn't reach him.
He wasn't like that in the beginning.

86
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:34,941
When did he change?

87
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,066
Ever since Captain made him
have sex with someone from the website.

88
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:40,870
Problem?

89
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:46,866
Well... He wanted to borrow our money.

90
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,323
That's right.

91
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,624
His mother was a Member of Parliament.
It's odd that he's broke.

92
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,976
But his mother was very sick then.
I guess he needed the money.

93
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,404
We called his father
and found out that Nun wasn't with him.

94
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:03,420
So we went to the police.

95
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:07,149
I saw that he read my messages
a few days ago.

96
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:10,063
You must find my friend.

97
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:12,001
Please.

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,352
I'm begging you, sir.

99
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:18,899
That's what they told the police.
Why do you ask?

100
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:27,068
I was just curious.

101
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,530
If you guys made it a big deal,
I would get in trouble.

102
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:35,738
But why did you lie to us
that you were with your father?

103
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,941
You are the one
who almost made this a big deal.

104
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:44,522
I'm sorry. I found out
that my father had a mistress.

105
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:46,553
So I was avoiding him.

106
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:50,139
I went missing
because I needed to heal myself.

107
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,780
That's it. Eat up.

108
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,920
When did you learn how to cook?

109
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,009
You didn't even know how to fry an egg.

110
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,548
I had to take care of myself
when I was alone.

111
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:11,306
And... Have I returned you the money?

112
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:22,929
You can't. We didn't lend you any.

113
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,741
He didn't even remember
that we didn't lend him the money.

114
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,264
He hasn't told the police
that he's back.

115
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:46,311
Don't you think it's sketchy?

116
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,475
Are you saying he isn't Nun,

117
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,145
but Nun's twin
who's trying to get everything back?

118
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:53,997
Just because we bullied him about sex?

119
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:58,012
- This isn't a thriller fantasy movie.
- I know.

120
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:03,583
- He doesn't want to cause a scandal.
- We should be glad he's back.

121
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:05,872
I suck at everything.

122
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:11,622
He really is an athlete student
on a scholarship.

123
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:15,663
He's my competitor.
I will never make it on the team.

124
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:21,038
Stop daydreaming. You're tiny.
Why would they want you on the team?

125
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,882
Don't discourage him.

126
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:26,609
We must get what we want.

127
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:30,249
Just like how you want
to date that pizza delivery guy?

128
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,112
He called me baby.

129
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:40,557
First.

130
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,971
You don't even know who he is.

131
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:47,588
If your relationship started with sex,
just leave it at that.

132
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,933
I don't want you to get conned.

133
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,097
What's the matter with you, Zouey?

134
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,565
You've never had a boyfriend.
How dare you lecture me.

135
00:10:56,893 --> 00:11:00,261
Damn it. My dad already drives me crazy.

136
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,112
Stop acting like him.

137
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,704
Did it hurt?

138
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,696
Why didn't you say our safe word?

139
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,970
You know that I'll stop
if you say the word, right?

140
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:41,126
I know, but I like pain.

141
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:49,696
Why do you like pain that
much? Is your own life that boring?

142
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:59,180
Have you met my dad?
Fuck, I can't even move out.

143
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,020
Dad told me if I wanted to leave,
I had to make my own money.

144
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:07,473
I don't want to live in poverty.

145
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:12,077
I'm sorry.

146
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:17,155
Isn't there something else
you want to do?

147
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:19,233
I don't know how to do anything else.

148
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:21,132
I wasn't educated.

149
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:26,226
I've never had anything like this.
Is it good?

150
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:29,633
Do you want it?

151
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,360
- I'll buy you one.
- No, you don't have to.

152
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:42,319
I really like you, OK? People will
think I only do this for money. OK?

153
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:46,515
But I don't care about others. I trust you.

154
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:51,187
But, can we do cosplay sex in exchange?

155
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:56,577
Please? Please!

156
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:32,972
The police found out
that his signal was last tracked here.

157
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:35,316
His signal was gone
when he went to sleep somewhere else.

158
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:39,577
I think there must be something
on his phone, but I can't find it.

159
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:44,171
When I hid your things
when we were younger,

160
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,921
where did you find them?
They might be there.

161
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:51,117
Was it Nun that broke it?

162
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,739
Then he wasn't killed
after meeting a stranger.

163
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:32,463
(Relationship status: Single)

164
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:35,768
(Family members
Prompitch Ponglerd - Brother)

165
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,370
Thank you for volunteering
to take me home.

166
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,558
The professor asked us
to draw an abstract picture.

167
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:58,925
If you don't mind,
can you stay a while longer to help me?

168
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:11,249
If I help you, you must help me too.

169
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:21,303
The fleck on your neck is so charming.

170
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,179
You smell so good.

171
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,093
You smell like peonies.

172
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:00,914
There's also a light scent of tea.

173
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:03,473
What perfume are you wearing?

174
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:38,176
(*Horny Japanese*)

175
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:49,992
No one is good right off the bat.
You need to practice.

176
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,062
Don't you want to continue?

177
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:20,246
I want to make you want me.

178
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,449
I think that will be interesting.
Don't you think so?

179
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:42,396
What?

180
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:45,271
You can't force me to work here.

181
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:50,365
You must work here.
Hand in your resignation. Nun is back.

182
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:57,490
Why are you happy? Don't meet up
with him or we're all screwed.

183
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,079
Dad wants you to take care
of this place, so do it.

184
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,524
I won't resign. The Playboyy Club
is the best place to work.

185
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:27,818
Is it worth
the 4,000-5,000 baht tip per day?

186
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:31,545
You can't make that much money
just by laying there.

187
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:34,985
You have to call them baby or babe.

188
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,938
Please them and make them feel special.

189
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:43,102
- Then the money will keep coming.
- Damn.

190
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,430
You're going to pay me
even though he didn't come?

191
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:50,588
He didn't.

192
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:54,403
But I'm ready to come.

193
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:11,411
Like pictures?

194
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,833
Uh huh, I paid you, I will take shots.

195
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:32,255
Tell me, who is the boss.

196
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,209
Jump.

197
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:15,272
Jump, what are you daydreaming about?
You almost ran into Mr. Porsche.

198
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,569
I'm sorry.
I didn't get enough sleep last night.

199
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,186
Damn it. Go drink some coffee.

200
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,307
You haven't experienced it.
Mr. Porsche is very fierce.

201
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,385
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- All right?

202
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:42,514
Mr. Porsche, huh?

203
00:27:44,147 --> 00:27:45,303
He really is fierce.

204
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:01,961
This kid really surprises me.

205
00:28:12,618 --> 00:28:14,345
At first I only wanted
to take his virginity.

206
00:28:15,454 --> 00:28:16,837
But now I want more.

207
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:54,865
It's a shame. I tried to seduce him
to make him want me.

208
00:28:55,928 --> 00:28:57,491
But now I can't help myself.

209
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,030
Hey.

210
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:14,702
Do you want to try something fun
that isn't sex?

211
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:27,226
What surprises me most about that night

212
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:30,492
is that we didn't have sex,
but I was happy.

213
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,435
We have to get what we want, right?

214
00:31:59,943 --> 00:32:01,326
I want to be loved.

215
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,638
I want him,
but I want him to want me too.

216
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,131
He'll dump you
because you're playing hard to get.

217
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,477
Soy, take Nun as an example.
You went for what you wanted, right?

218
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,900
You went to have sex with strangers
like I advised you to

219
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:36,776
and you found yourself
and got a boyfriend.

220
00:32:38,576 --> 00:32:39,990
Where are you going at this hour, Nun?

221
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:42,498
To hunt.

222
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,029
We have to get what we want, right?

223
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:57,903
Can we just stay like this for a while?

224
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,872
Your dad might see us.

225
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:13,879
How long do we have to sneak around?

226
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:16,634
You wanted to be loud,
so we had to go to an old building.

227
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:18,681
You're covered in dust.

228
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:25,620
Should we rent an apartment?

229
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:31,393
If your relationship started with sex,
just leave it at that.

230
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:33,808
I don't want you to be conned.

231
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:38,190
Okay, I'll ask my father.

232
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:41,334
I have to go.

233
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:50,678
Bye.

234
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:20,605
Mr. Porsche.

235
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,512
Mr. Porsche.

236
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:54,273
I'm sorry. We're closed.

237
00:35:56,507 --> 00:35:59,328
What you were doing just now...
Is that an add-on service?

238
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,867
Nun.

239
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,728
We only have till 11 p.m.

240
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:21,228
We'll get many clients then.

241
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:22,892
He looks poorer than I thought.

242
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:25,821
How is he able to transfer
hundreds of thousands of baht to Nun?

243
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:28,868
I remember everything about you, Prom.

244
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:38,813
Where have you been?

245
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,027
I thought something bad happened.

246
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,504
What about your debt?

247
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:52,026
Are they still hunting you down?

248
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,014
Well...

249
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,799
I paid off some debt,
so they backed off.

250
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:12,846
Thank you for helping me.

251
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:23,122
Good.

252
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,903
I thought you were going to ask
for more money.

253
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:39,488
What if I want more?

254
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:42,473
What should I do?

255
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:04,695
Your friends wouldn't
lend you the money,

256
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:07,164
so you had to ask Prom.

257
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:11,674
Nun, who do you owe money to?
How did you meet Prom?

258
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:15,157
Is he your lover and boyfriend?
Did he pay off your debt?

259
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:45,274
I need to wash it.

260
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:47,986
If we want to have sex,

261
00:39:49,288 --> 00:39:50,530
I want you to be impressed.

262
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:55,819
I'll be back.

263
00:40:51,174 --> 00:40:54,026
He's dangerous. He can kill you, Nun.

264
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:59,370
If he made you go missing, he would've
been more surprised to see me.

265
00:41:04,034 --> 00:41:05,448
So you must be pretend to be me.

266
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:08,302
So he'll tell you more.

267
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:11,169
You can do it, Non.

268
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:15,107
And you'll discover
that you like it too.

269
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:36,181
Come on. I'm ready.

270
00:41:51,684 --> 00:41:55,559
Crawl here and sit on my lap.

271
00:41:57,824 --> 00:41:58,856
Naughty boy.

272
00:41:59,736 --> 00:42:02,400
You went missing without telling me.
How should I punish you?

273
00:42:03,927 --> 00:42:05,114
How should I punish you?

274
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:06,771
Punish?

275
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:09,216
You should smack me.

276
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:14,622
You had to do this for money, Nun?

277
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,107
You were right.

278
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:22,483
I really like it.

279
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:30,108
You were so aggressive earlier.
Now we're cuddling.

280
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:31,812
Don't you have to work?

281
00:42:34,665 --> 00:42:35,783
This is the after care.

282
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:38,744
You make it seem like
we've never done it before.

283
00:42:45,902 --> 00:42:46,715
Master.

284
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:50,145
Tell me.

285
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:54,754
So... What are we?

286
00:43:48,898 --> 00:43:51,093
(How to restore chat history)

287
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:27,946
(I transferred to the same account,
you can send me more clips)

288
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:40,830
(Thanks, I found myself because of you)

289
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:43,731
(I know what I want,
I'm not the same shy boy)

290
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:47,395
(If I go harder,
are you going to pay more?)

291
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:54,718
(If I go harder,
are you going to pay more?)

292
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:06,374
Captain didn't bully Nun
and made him commit suicide.

293
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:08,352
Who does he owe money to?

294
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:11,691
Why did he have to go this far
to earn money?

295
00:45:12,245 --> 00:45:14,269
What about Prom?
What's their relationship?

296
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:21,019
The only thing we can be sure of

297
00:45:23,503 --> 00:45:25,073
is that Nun isn't as innocent
as we thought.

298
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:37,170
Really? Wow.

299
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:39,475
I'll have to call you
Master First from now on.

300
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,772
Master? First.

301
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:43,545
I think it's too much.

302
00:45:44,043 --> 00:45:45,262
You got hurt.

303
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:47,167
If your father finds out,

304
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:51,055
- you'll get in trouble.
- Don't stop him, Soy. He likes it.

305
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,250
People who are into BDSM
always discuss boundaries first.

306
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:58,047
They're careful
not to accidentally kill someone.

307
00:45:58,891 --> 00:46:01,032
Good for you, First.
Send us a clip next time.

308
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:04,524
- Sure. I'll do it.
- Good.

309
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:07,971
Speaking of clips,
do you know the account Wash Your Sin?

310
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:09,814
No, I don't. Let me see it.

311
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:14,001
This. Have you seen it before?
Car wash and sex.

312
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:16,587
We can text him if we're interested.

313
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:19,033
That's so hot.

314
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:26,178
Let's try. Take your car, Nun.

315
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,889
The Prevention and Suppression
of Prostitution Act Article 7.

316
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:36,206
Any person who advertises
about prostitution

317
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:37,832
by means of printed materials
or distribution by any means

318
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:42,206
shall be liable to imprisonment
for a term of six months to two years

319
00:46:42,491 --> 00:46:44,553
or to a fine of ten thousand baht
to forty thousand baht

320
00:46:44,944 --> 00:46:47,522
or to both.

321
00:46:48,366 --> 00:46:53,819
Make a decision. Are you going
to pay the police or pay me?

322
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:00,197
Mr. Porsche.

323
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,764
Please don't report me to the police.
I don't have any money.

324
00:47:04,523 --> 00:47:08,678
I can't go to jail.
My mother is disabled.

325
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,178
I can reduce your sentence.

326
00:47:25,686 --> 00:47:29,663
You will only provide service to me.
Get rid of that account.

327
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:34,999
Be my slave or you'll be
providing your service in jail.

328
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,722
Mr. Porsche.

329
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:48,792
I have documents for you to sign.

330
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,060
Fine, leave them there.

331
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,857
- Get out.
- Is there anything I can help you with?

332
00:48:54,927 --> 00:48:56,662
Do you want to help me that badly?

333
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:58,927
I'm willing to help you.

334
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:02,263
- Fine, get out.
- I'll leave the documents here.

335
00:49:02,288 --> 00:49:03,263
Okay.

336
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:16,508
I'm begging you, Dad.
Don't say anything homophobic to me.

337
00:49:16,977 --> 00:49:17,946
I will not accept it.

338
00:49:19,118 --> 00:49:20,571
Did you use protection?

339
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:22,711
Come on, Dad.

340
00:49:23,456 --> 00:49:25,979
Of course. I use protection.

341
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:28,612
Even sixth graders do.

342
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:29,925
Good.

343
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:32,151
So you don't need to get tested.

344
00:49:32,956 --> 00:49:34,683
I got you an appointment
with a psychologist.

345
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:38,823
Consult with him
to find out if you're a sex addict.

346
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:45,270
Will your love for violence
turn into a personality disorder?

347
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:47,810
Dad.

348
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:50,794
I'm human.

349
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:53,966
I'm not a hospital you can manage.

350
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:57,091
I have a life. I have feelings.

351
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:01,033
I want to live my own life, Dad.

352
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:05,372
You might get diseases
from your lifestyle.

353
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:08,099
You might become a pervert too.

354
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:15,763
Dad, you're a doctor.

355
00:50:16,653 --> 00:50:18,521
You should know this well.

356
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:23,625
Based on what you just said,
I don't think we should live together.

357
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,570
Where are you going?

358
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,234
I'm asking you
not to cause any more trouble.

359
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,375
It doesn't matter where I go.

360
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:42,385
Don't you realize that no one wants
to be with you because of who you are?

361
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:46,761
Even Mom

362
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:49,409
escaped you by dying.

363
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:21,847
I ordered some fancy food for you

364
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,192
to thank you for making
my piece the best in class.

365
00:52:24,405 --> 00:52:26,264
So please behave.

366
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:29,562
Come on, I was joking.

367
00:52:30,206 --> 00:52:32,886
I'm used to eating cockles
on the street.

368
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:36,784
I have to take my time
eating such fancy food.

369
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,352
Do you have a dream?

370
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:07,112
What do you want most in life?

371
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:15,619
I want to have my own exhibition.

372
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:20,064
I want people to enjoy my art.

373
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:24,322
What about you? Do you have a dream?

374
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:32,606
My dream

375
00:53:34,153 --> 00:53:35,004
is you.

376
00:53:55,866 --> 00:54:13,249
(*More horny Japanese with a thick Thai accent*)

377
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:10,650
Hey.

378
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,025
Are you in a meeting or something?

379
00:55:13,454 --> 00:55:14,415
Why do you look so stressed?

380
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:18,093
Have you seen First?
Did you talk to him?

381
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:19,659
Did he tell you anything?

382
00:55:21,057 --> 00:55:23,081
No, what's going on?

383
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,776
He had a fight with his father
and ran away from home.

384
00:55:25,971 --> 00:55:28,170
He told Porsche in the afternoon
that he'll be staying over,

385
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,444
but it's already 9 p.m.
and he isn't here yet.

386
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:33,065
It...

387
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:35,417
Is he with the pizza delivery guy?

388
00:55:35,956 --> 00:55:40,042
If that's the case,
he would have texted us to show off.

389
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:44,566
- He wouldn't be gone like this.
- I already called and texted him.

390
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:46,933
What should we do?

391
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:49,386
Shit.

392
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:54,967
- I'm afraid that...
- He'll go missing

393
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:57,896
like I did?

394
00:56:03,146 --> 00:56:06,303
Shit, let's take my car.

395
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,865
- Let's go look for him.
- Come on.

396
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:09,803
Come on, hurry up.

397
00:56:59,027 --> 00:57:00,106
Mugging

398
00:57:01,027 --> 00:57:01,988
Kidnapping

399
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:06,692
It's all over the news,
didn't you ever pay attention?

400
00:57:08,285 --> 00:57:10,074
Your friend warned you.

401
00:57:10,684 --> 00:57:12,645
Never trust a stranger.

402
00:57:13,426 --> 00:57:16,379
Did you ever listen? Hmm?

403
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:19,231
What a dumbass, you
think I like you for real?

404
00:57:20,715 --> 00:57:23,145
And now you choose to
run away from your dad.

405
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,207
You ain't got no money?

406
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:28,590
Or expensive shit for me to leech off?

407
00:57:46,785 --> 00:57:48,481
You left me no choice.

408
00:57:49,973 --> 00:57:51,504
But to do this.

409
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:06,842
Ask your father for some money.

410
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:12,802
A million baht is enough, baby.

411
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
(Next Episode)

412
00:58:33,563 --> 00:58:36,228
Is this the guy you owe money to, Nun?

413
00:58:36,933 --> 00:58:37,949
What are you doing, Nun?

414
00:58:38,996 --> 00:58:40,418
I bought a secondhand laptop.

415
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:42,941
Does this mean
there's not enough storage space?

416
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:44,785
Try deleting some files.

417
00:58:49,918 --> 00:58:51,238
No!
