1
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:17,468
(Previously)
I didn't see your brother at the hotel.

2
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,077
But my drugs that he took

3
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:20,304
belonged to Mr. Lee.

4
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:21,445
I saw the clip.

5
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,156
Why didn't you tell me?

6
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,046
That might be the real reason

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,642
that Nant is dead.

8
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:28,576
Daddy knows I helped you.

9
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:30,210
I'll hide at Harvey Hotel.

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,412
They wouldn't think
we would go back there.

11
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:34,828
Prom secretly installed a bug
before coming to help me.

12
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,432
We will know his every move.

13
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:40,010
Once we get the evidence,

14
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:42,330
we must catch him red-handed.

15
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:51,060
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

16
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:55,198

Have a great one.

20
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:10,298
- Blow it.
- My birthday

21
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:11,915
in September last year.

22
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:14,298
Nant was still here with us.

23
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,160
He didn't know
his life was about to change.

24
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,266
What did you wish for?

25
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:25,235
For you to finally have sex?

26
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:27,682
You're crazy.

27
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:28,644
Come on, bro.

28
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,426
You're 20 now.

29
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:32,762
Are you saving your virginity
to sell when you're older?

30
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,663
- Right? Come on, tell us.
- Hurry.

31
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,804
- Hurry up.
- Hurry, tell us.

32
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:38,895
- Huh?
- Hey.

33
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:41,364
Don't bully him.

34
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:43,941
You want to know too, don't you?

35
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:44,941
In April the next year,

36
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:47,279
he wanted a good grade

37
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:48,653
for his performance in
Desire under the Elms.

38
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:55,637
So Captain and Porche encouraged him
to have sex with strangers.

39
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:56,401
(Click here)

40
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:57,588
So he met up with Nuth.

41
00:01:57,613 --> 00:01:58,690
(Do you want to meet?)

42
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,409
And he found his desire.

43
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:07,768
His deep desire.

44
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:09,919
Nuth.

45
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:12,654
Should we try

46
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:16,944
selling drugs?

47
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,280
The police set up a checkpoint.

48
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:22,272
Of course I had to throw the drugs out.

49
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,920
Why are you so fucking stupid?

50
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,757
Those drugs were worth
over 100,000 baht.

51
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:27,811
They can actually kill you.

52
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:31,506
Can I borrow your money?

53
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:33,663
Maybe 100,000 baht?

54
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,986
I'll slowly pay you back.

55
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,359
He was addicted to drugs
and was in debt.

56
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:46,883
He was in love.

57
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,616
He and Prom coincidentally met at a bar.

58
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,327
They got into a master-slave contract,

59
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:57,733
so he can pay back his debt.

60
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:03,954
But it wasn't enough.

61
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:08,087
Anyone who sees this clip
must think I was trying to kill you.

62
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:09,873
Don't let anyone see it.

63
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,747
I just want to go all in
before we separate.

64
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:15,359
Where are you going to hide?

65
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,351
I can't tell you.

66
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,171
If someone comes looking and finds you,

67
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:22,387
I'll be in trouble.

68
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:33,319
So he decided to make a suicide clip
and go missing.

69
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,686
His twin brother returned to Thailand

70
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:37,990
to investigate him.

71
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:39,920
Do you think this will work?

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,451
Of course.

73
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:44,498
If Nuth's boss thinks I'm dead,

74
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,404
he might stop looking for me.

75
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:14,748
The artworks I just submitted

76
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:16,220
aren't good?

77
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:19,493
Please let me know
how I can make them better.

78
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,782
(Episode 14: New Life II)

79
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:21,751
They are good.

80
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:26,144
But a top student like you
shouldn't be making these artworks.

81
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,510
You should draw something deeper
and more difficult to analyze.

82
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:45,479
Davinci,

83
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:47,049
Rembrandt,

84
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,151
Hokusai, and Warhol.

85
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,396
Are you saying their arts
are not deep enough?

86
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,560
- We're not in the medieval era.
- You're right.

87
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,283
But your artworks
represent the university.

88
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,560
You're not representing yourself.

89
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:07,623
Draw something else.

90
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,592
Otherwise I must give
this scholarship to another student.

91
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:17,469
Go ahead.

92
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,547
Why don't you do that?

93
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,565
If I'm going to have an exhibition,

94
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,761
the artworks must be something
I want to create,

95
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,590
not something you want to create
but cannot do so yourself.

96
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:32,379
So you're forcing me to do it.

97
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:50,328
Look at you.

98
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,250
Your handsome face is all messed up.

99
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:55,737
A warrior must have wounds.

100
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:58,299
Don't joke about this.

101
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:01,296
So who were they?

102
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:05,203
What did you do
to make them beat you up?

103
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,596
Phop.

104
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:14,404
Well... Old creditors

105
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:16,138
from before we met.

106
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,460
They just found me.

107
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,629
- So...
- Really?

108
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:25,022
I hope you didn't lose Mr. Lee's drugs
like Nant did.

109
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:28,733
Honestly.

110
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:30,386
Tell me the truth.

111
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:32,964
So we can fix the problem together.

112
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,350
I told you everything.

113
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,202
They're my old creditors.

114
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:40,522
Ever since I heard about
Nant losing the drugs,

115
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,197
I've always been careful.

116
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:44,908
I don't want history to repeat itself.

117
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,495
The money from the website
that I showed you

118
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,136
and the money from giving massages...

119
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:55,058
I've spent them.

120
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:04,864
I'm drowning in debt.

121
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,124
What should I do

122
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,335
to pay back this debt?

123
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,818
I know we said
that we'll grow up together.

124
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:20,813
But would we get murdered first?

125
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:57,697
How were the sales today?

126
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,064
Look at me.

127
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,701
You're crying
because everything was sold out?

128
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:07,115
I sold one bottle, asshole.

129
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,263
The customer also grabbed my butt.

130
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,927
First was going to come
and buy everything again.

131
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:14,771
But Soong stopped him.

132
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,212
He resigned from working for Mr. Lee.

133
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:19,766
They must be trying to save up.

134
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:21,493
Yeah.

135
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:25,675
He has made amends
by helping us invest in the business.

136
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:29,121
He can't help us by buying every day.

137
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,920
Are we going to make it?

138
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:40,501
I don't know.

139
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:44,884
I thought things would be better
after the election.

140
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,751
How could things be better?

141
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:49,551
No one is solving the root
of the problem.

142
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:54,644
(SOONG is going live)

143
00:09:58,804 --> 00:09:59,882
Hello.

144
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:04,719
Are you interested
in a cool rock band t-shirt?

145
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:06,677
Here, this is so cool.

146
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:09,865
Here you go.

147
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:11,458
The code is 90.

148
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:13,667
(You don't look like a t-shirt seller,
I would buy your service though)

149
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:17,448
You don't look like a t-shirt seller.

150
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:19,385
I would buy your service...

151
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:22,087
Does anyone want to buy this t-shirt?

152
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:25,445
Well...

153
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:27,375
Is anyone interested?

154
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,625
I...

155
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,308
I'll do a live video again.
Thank you to all...

156
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:37,901
Well...

157
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:40,539
All seven customers who are watching.

158
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:41,959
Thank you.

159
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:49,493
Great.

160
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:52,454
I'm trying over here
and you're just chilling.

161
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:00,863
Can't help it.

162
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,374
Someone's not going to help me with it.

163
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:05,994
So I have to do it myself.

164
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:08,916
Honestly, Soong.

165
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,815
I told you
that I would take care of you.

166
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:16,900
You're just wasting your energy.

167
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:20,103
Waste your energy fucking me instead.

168
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:21,608
No, babe.

169
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:24,484
Don't you see
how your father looks at me?

170
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,363
It's like I'm leeching off you.

171
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,747
I don't even have the guts
to leave your room now.

172
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:32,387
Fuck him.

173
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:33,715
Fuck him.

174
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,410
Why should you care?

175
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:38,856
We're happy. That's all that matters.

176
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,663
At least let me get back
to delivering pizza.

177
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:44,921
Please.

178
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,960
So you can get back
to fucking customers?

179
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,833
No.

180
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,771
So I can have some self-worth, babe.

181
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:53,416
I don't want to sit
around and do nothing

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,164
and get to live an expensive life.

183
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,546
Don't you trust me?

184
00:11:58,607 --> 00:11:59,732
I only love you, babe.

185
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,750
I can never sleep with anyone else.

186
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:10,206
Hey.

187
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,748
Babe.

188
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:20,490
Please.

189
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:23,471
I'm begging you.

190
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,463
I just can't go on living like this.

191
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:32,153
Come here. It's going to be okay.

192
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:34,091
It's going to be okay, baby.

193
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:01,676
It's nothing.

194
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:04,326
If they were going to come here,
they would have come last week.

195
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:32,009
Shit.

196
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:47,824
It's nothing.

197
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,130
The woman just walked by.

198
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:52,568
So?

199
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:53,883
What was the notification about?

200
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:02,045
There's an update on Jason Lee.

201
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,306
Tomorrow night

202
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:11,665
drug delivery

203
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:13,486
around the abandoned building

204
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:23,858
where Nant's body was found.

205
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:27,976
That is probably Jason Lee's
usual drug delivery spot.

206
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:34,471
So what should we do?

207
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:35,564
Should we just go there?

208
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:37,291
Ask Nuth to film it for evidence.

209
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:38,469
It's too risky.

210
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,422
Don't film anything.

211
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,195
Let my father handle this.

212
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,586
We'll just wait and see him go down.

213
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,829
(I'm waiting for you, Keen)

214
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:00,767
(Are you finished?)

215
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:06,332
Why do you still come here?

216
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:12,113
Are you meeting up with Keen?

217
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:13,718
None of your business. Stay out of it.

218
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:15,562
Wait.

219
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,668
I didn't tell the principal about you.

220
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,139
You know what kind of a person I am.

221
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:27,585
I always play by the rules.

222
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,830
I heard you talking to the guys
at the university.

223
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:34,431
Why don't you find them suspicious?

224
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,305
No one has an issue with me like you do.

225
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:57,159
Aren't they the ones who have an issue
with you, me, and Keen?

226
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,693
I admit that I never liked you.

227
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,706
But I would never
do anything to hurt you.

228
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:10,568
Because we're the same, Captain.

229
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,056
We're gays in a society
where straight men are dominant.

230
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,236
We should help each other out

231
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:24,761
not sabotage each other.

232
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,193
It's too late, Puen.

233
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:34,365
Saying that won't make anything better.

234
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:46,168
That's right.

235
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:50,683
Because I have nothing left, Captain.

236
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:20,952
(I'm here)

237
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:23,554
(The elevator's down,
please leave it in front of my room)

238
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,898
(Room 1408)

239
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,104
Shit.

240
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:34,982
Damn it.

241
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,741
Excuse me, the pizza is here.

242
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:51,018
Enjoy your hot slice.

243
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:52,979
Yeah.

244
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:53,956
It seems hot.

245
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,893
Do you want to come in?

246
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:00,411
Have a drink and rest.

247
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:02,117
It will rain soon.

248
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:07,781
I'll pay for your add-on services.

249
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:42,979
(Did you arrive
at the customer's house?)

250
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:47,904
(Answer me)

251
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,797
(Hey handsome)

252
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:30,657
(Looking?)

253
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:31,586
(Power bottom)

254
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:32,993
(Into S&amp;M?)

255
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:34,547
(Yup!)

256
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,345
(Wanna meet?)

257
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:50,098
Aob said that
for an important drug delivery,

258
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,198
the customer will park on the side.

259
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:55,214
The delivery guy in the guard outfit
will get the cash.

260
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,862
My dad's men will arrest them then.

261
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,650
We have to get them to confess.

262
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:01,579
Sit down.

263
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,539
Along with the voice recording we got
from Jason Lee,

264
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:05,132
he won't be able to get away.

265
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:34,272
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:37,592
My phone died.
I was texting you and it just died.

267
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:39,317
I was so stressed.

268
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:41,067
I thought you would worry
if I didn't reply.

269
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:42,462
Of course.

270
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:45,319
What if you get into a car accident
because of the rain?

271
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:46,616
My phone died.

272
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,279
What happened?
Why did you turn your phone off?

273
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:52,662
Were you sleeping with someone else?

274
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:55,231
Come on, babe.

275
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:58,138
We talked about this.

276
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:01,710
The customer asked, but I rejected.

277
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,350
I'm sorry. I really can't do that.

278
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,202
I'm sorry.

279
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:11,758
Why is it so hard for you to trust me?

280
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,094
You know how we started.

281
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,399
It doesn't matter how we started.

282
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:18,178
Haven't I proved myself enough
that I love you?

283
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,827
And it's only you.

284
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:42,421
What have you done?

285
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:47,493
I thought you were cheating on me.

286
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:50,985
So I hooked up with a guy on Stranger.

287
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:55,488
Yeah, but when I left,

288
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,418
I just realized that I couldn't do it.

289
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:00,277
Cause I love you.

290
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,090
It's okay, babe.

291
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:17,617
At least you didn't.

292
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:19,374
No.

293
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:20,774
But I almost did.

294
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:26,095
It's okay,

295
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,436
but you didn't.

296
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:29,943
That is all that matters.

297
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:33,354
Babe, listen. I need to work

298
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:36,525
because I don't want to leech off you.

299
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:38,728
And I will save some money

300
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:42,462
and we will find a fantastic place
to live together.

301
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:48,246
So the only thing that I need...
I need you to trust me.

302
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:51,274
And things like this will
never happen again, okay?

303
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:53,549
Alright?

304
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:21,736
This abandoned building is also close
to where Mr. Nantnarin's body was found.

305
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:24,904
He was the son of a politician
from Palang Pakdee Party.

306
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:28,108
The arrested criminal would not confess

307
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,609
who was behind the drug deal.

308
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,796
But I'm curious as to whether

309
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:37,579
this has anything to do
with Mr. Nant's overdose and death.

310
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:23,975
Fuck.

311
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:27,108
What in the Jeffrey Dahmer series
is this shit?

312
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,807
If I didn't do that,
my Daddy wouldn't stop looking.

313
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,003
So Jump must disappear for a long time?

314
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,533
Good, you'll be fucking him good.

315
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,135
Asshole.

316
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:44,982
I don't know.

317
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:47,302
Things will quiet down.

318
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,153
Really?

319
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,583
I don't think so.

320
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,930
You will connect the dots.

321
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,195
I must inform you

322
00:24:57,227 --> 00:25:00,678
that Mr. Tutor Techanat
was recently fired from his job.

323
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:02,597
No, he's being talked about.

324
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:04,956
My Daddy will probably
go abroad to lay low again.

325
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,526
So I'm asking
if his words can be trusted.

326
00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:26,197
You're all here.

327
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:29,825
No.

328
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:32,411
Nuth isn't here.

329
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:34,356
Why did you get him arrested?

330
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,880
No.

331
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:38,250
I didn't even know Nuth sold drugs.

332
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,596
We're not accusing him.

333
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:46,607
He really went to deliver drugs.

334
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,277
Was this your plan?

335
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:55,993
You didn't hurt anyone, did you?

336
00:25:56,915 --> 00:25:57,689
No.

337
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,445
How are you?

338
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:08,937
I'm good.

339
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,382
I have many things to do.

340
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:13,751
School, exams.

341
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:15,805
And...

342
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:17,441
How is Nuth's boyfriend?

343
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:19,933
They seem in love.

344
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,457
I don't know.

345
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,261
I feel so horrible right now.

346
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:46,235
And why are you standing there?

347
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,184
Come here.

348
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:54,021
Let's eat.

349
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:55,927
Come on.

350
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:43,547
I'm sorry, Phop.

351
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:48,177
I didn't want
things to turn out this way.

352
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:52,273
Why did you do it?

353
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:56,812
You said we were going to start over.

354
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:02,346
I wanted to make some money
to pay off your debt.

355
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,659
This money

356
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,451
- could help us start over.
- You told me

357
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:09,724
not to get caught.

358
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:11,896
But you got caught.

359
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,540
Huh?

360
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:15,595
How am I going to live?

361
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:17,696
Huh?

362
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,172
How am I going to live?

363
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,605
Is there no other way?

364
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,128
We need the money.

365
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:44,011
It would be great
if our parents were powerful.

366
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:49,928
If I say who's behind the deal,

367
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:52,154
my sentence will be reduced.

368
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:53,787
But you won't do it.

369
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:56,618
Right?

370
00:29:58,438 --> 00:29:59,165
Right?

371
00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:02,024
He will kill you,

372
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,394
your mother, and your siblings.

373
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:08,285
I don't care about my life.

374
00:30:09,785 --> 00:30:10,902
But we're talking about you.

375
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:15,264
I'm sorry, Phop.

376
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:18,475
There's nothing I can do.

377
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:23,822
How many years?

378
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:38,867
Five.

379
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:45,125
Wait for me.

380
00:30:46,237 --> 00:30:47,042
Please.

381
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,096
I love you, Phop.

382
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:51,057
I love you the most.

383
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,677
Phop, I love you.

384
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:57,483
Please wait for me.

385
00:30:58,843 --> 00:30:59,538
Phop.

386
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,372
Phop, I love you.

387
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,994
You're going to pay me
even though he didn't come?

388
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:27,884
That's the first thing I said to you.

389
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:30,106
That's right. Your turn.

390
00:31:32,052 --> 00:31:33,169
Where did we have sex
for the first time?

391
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:35,803
The office or the car wash place?

392
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,733
Don't try to trick me.

393
00:31:38,193 --> 00:31:40,521
We had sex for the first time
at home on Zouey's birthday.

394
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:41,670
At the parking lot.

395
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:43,232
Like peaches?

396
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:45,803
Damn, you were so hot then.

397
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,626
What about now?

398
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,071
Now you're so cute.

399
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:50,798
Hey.

400
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:52,376
Was that a question?

401
00:31:52,735 --> 00:31:53,227
No.

402
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:56,302
The question is... Do you love me?

403
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:01,740
I risk my life every day for you.
Don't you think I love you?

404
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:04,553
You never said it.

405
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:06,832
When did you start falling for me?

406
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:15,444
Ever since you opened up
and talked to me nicely.

407
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:17,564
Honestly,

408
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,877
you were so annoying then.

409
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:25,332
I could tell that you liked me.

410
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:27,397
You were so into me.

411
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,252
Why did you have to act cool?

412
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:34,447
You know what I've been through.

413
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:38,017
I can't act cute like Zouey.

414
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:42,137
But you are doing just that now.

415
00:32:43,856 --> 00:32:45,293
Ask me nicely for once.

416
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,158
Let's have sex.

417
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:57,909
Have sex with me

418
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,167
as my boyfriend.

419
00:33:55,981 --> 00:33:56,692
I'm sorry.

420
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,411
I saw the news.

421
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:00,614
I didn't know

422
00:34:01,503 --> 00:34:03,206
that Nuth delivered drugs for Jason Lee.

423
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:06,957
Never mind.

424
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:09,519
Saying that won't get him out of jail.

425
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:11,816
Let's find a way to help him.

426
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,811
Nuth didn't tell us everything.

427
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,709
Something happened to Nant

428
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,544
before he set up his own suicide
and sent the clip over.

429
00:34:32,981 --> 00:34:36,192
I just realized the real reason

430
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,600
Nuth feels guilty about your twin.

431
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:43,420
Look at this clip
and you'll understand everything.

432
00:34:56,323 --> 00:34:57,174
Please help Nuth.

433
00:34:57,838 --> 00:34:58,463
Nont.

434
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:01,764
Nuth is everything to me.

435
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:12,939
It's funny.

436
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:16,919
You were someone who randomly
got a hold of Nant's laptop.

437
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:20,313
And now you're an important witness.

438
00:35:26,163 --> 00:35:27,578
I'll expose Jason Lee.

439
00:35:29,187 --> 00:35:31,062
Your boyfriend will get out
of jail safely.

440
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:41,658
I'm sorry.

441
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:44,395
Nont.

442
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:48,871
Please help him.

443
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,088
Who were you looking at?

444
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:18,324
I was looking for the one who poked me,
but I didn't find anyone.

445
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:19,957
What are you doing?

446
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,769
- I'm fishing.
- Did you get any?

447
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:24,155
Do you see any?

448
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:24,332
Nuth.

449
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:27,714
I miss you.

450
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:32,010
I thought I would have to go alone.

451
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:37,689
Where are you going, sweetie?

452
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,962
Stay with me.

453
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,090
Stay with me for a long time.

454
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:47,637
Let's grow up together.

455
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,958
I'll be your tree and flower.

456
00:37:58,717 --> 00:37:59,498
I'm cold.

457
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,047
Nuth, my sweetheart.

458
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:22,852
You must finish your movie.

459
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,558
I'll be waiting for it.

460
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:28,683
No.

461
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:33,357
This movie is for you.

462
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:36,881
You must stay and work on it with me.

463
00:38:39,603 --> 00:38:40,564
Thank you

464
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,226
for being my happiness.

465
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,628
I really mean it.

466
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:50,143
You are my everything.

467
00:39:11,813 --> 00:39:12,735
I love you, Nuth.

468
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:15,618
My sweetheart.

469
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:37,902
You can submit these artworks
for your exhibition.

470
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:39,629
They're beautiful.

471
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:41,882
No.

472
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:44,198
You know

473
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:47,598
how hard it was for me to accept myself

474
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:48,702
and my sexuality.

475
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:51,506
I want this exhibition

476
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,529
to celebrate an important step
in my life.

477
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,017
I envy you

478
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,603
for knowing what you want

479
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:05,220
and you fight for it.

480
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:08,989
I'm so proud of you.

481
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:15,419
This is all

482
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,294
because of you.

483
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:33,344
Let's take a shower and go to bed.

484
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:36,891
I'll pack my things and follow you.

485
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:44,324
Don't take long.

486
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:03,463
Hey.

487
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:05,260
Get in.

488
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:20,773
- Huh?
- Hey.

489
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,250
Don't bully him.

490
00:44:24,472 --> 00:44:26,472
- You want to know too, don't you?
- You're no better.

491
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:28,839
- You're a pussy.
- Stop talking.

492
00:44:29,073 --> 00:44:30,643
- Stop it.
- You're a pussy.

493
00:44:30,732 --> 00:44:32,834
- I'm afraid.
- Stop being a virgin.

494
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:33,725
You're 20 now.

495
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,748
My birthday in September last year.

496
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:38,536
Why do I have to start here?

497
00:44:39,568 --> 00:44:41,459
Why do I have to go
all the way back to last year?

498
00:44:42,857 --> 00:44:44,591
That's when it started.

499
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:47,380
I had a crush on Jason Lee.

500
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:50,185
We were talking since then.

501
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:56,906
In April last year,
I found my own desire.

502
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,678
Jason raped me.

503
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:11,162
So I was afraid to have sex
with anyone else.

504
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:33,022
I was mad at him.

505
00:45:33,749 --> 00:45:34,819
I took it out on my artwork.

506
00:45:35,678 --> 00:45:37,303
No one knew about this except Nant.

507
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,103
That's the reason he couldn't stay.

508
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:47,451
After Nant was in debt,
he wanted to expose Jason Lee.

509
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:49,970
He asked me to be a witness.

510
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:53,071
He wanted to expose Jason Lee
for what he did to me.

511
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:05,308
I couldn't let that happen.

512
00:46:06,316 --> 00:46:08,590
So I came up with the idea
to make him fake his own suicide.

513
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,092
He came back to see me at home

514
00:46:11,553 --> 00:46:13,186
- and pack his things to go abroad.
- Nant.

515
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:14,577
Nant.

516
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:17,210
So I told Jason Lee to kidnap him.

517
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:22,845
During the time he was missing,

518
00:46:23,845 --> 00:46:24,564
Jason Lee

519
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:27,497
had him captured in the VIP room
at Playboyy lounge.

520
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:32,574
Why are you here?

521
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:36,449
That doesn't matter.

522
00:46:37,983 --> 00:46:39,452
The most important thing
is that I'm here.

523
00:46:40,663 --> 00:46:41,507
I'm sorry.

524
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:44,538
For what?

525
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:47,439
I'm sorry for not being here sooner.

526
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:50,471
I'm sorry, Nant.

527
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:52,971
I am the reason you're dead.

528
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,216
Listen to me.

529
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,731
Now your twin is investigating about you
and things are all messy.

530
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:01,809
Nont?

531
00:47:02,812 --> 00:47:04,468
- Why is...
- I don't have time to explain.

532
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:09,211
He has seen your suicide clip.

533
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:11,761
Let's make him believe that

534
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:14,878
until he gives up
and stops investigating.

535
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:26,872
I asked my mother to buy
a flight ticket for you to the States.

536
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:29,130
Go stay with your father.

537
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:30,643
Wait for your brother there.

538
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:36,947
But now you have to hide.

539
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:49,284
Don't let anyone know you're alive.

540
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:53,995
My mother will call you tomorrow.

541
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:55,763
She'll send a driver to pick you up.

542
00:47:57,263 --> 00:47:58,482
Once you have arrived there safely,

543
00:47:59,388 --> 00:48:00,537
I'll send Nont there right away.

544
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,188
- Let me see Nont.
- No.

545
00:48:04,922 --> 00:48:06,157
Mr. Lee's men will know.

546
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:09,652
You have to run away now.

547
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:11,777
Mr. Lee is coming back to Thailand.

548
00:48:20,203 --> 00:48:21,118
Wear my clothes.

549
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,732
So the people here won't notice.

550
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,141
You still treat me the best.

551
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:34,211
Thank you, friend.

552
00:48:39,565 --> 00:48:41,151
I thought my plan could help Nant.

553
00:48:42,154 --> 00:48:43,436
But it killed him instead.

554
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:44,989
That's all I know.

555
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:47,906
I caused Nant to die.

556
00:48:49,085 --> 00:48:51,148
But I don't know who killed him.

557
00:48:55,072 --> 00:48:56,955
(More after the credits)

558
00:49:59,424 --> 00:50:00,713
If I'm not good enough,

559
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,916
you must let me know.

560
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:06,931
You are very important to me.
Do you know that?

561
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,106
You're the best I could ever ask for.

562
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:25,441
Thank you.

563
00:50:28,144 --> 00:50:28,894
I have to go.

564
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,171
Wait, Phop.

565
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,558
Can you not go?

566
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,247
How else will I make money?

567
00:50:53,671 --> 00:50:54,671
I have a meeting with the customer.

568
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,663
This is a big delivery.

569
00:50:57,906 --> 00:51:00,421
I have to complete my task
and let's have a buffet dinner after.

570
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:17,828
Be careful, Phop.

571
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:20,157
Don't get caught.

572
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:22,737
Don't lose the drugs.

573
00:51:24,191 --> 00:51:25,566
I can't live without you.

574
00:51:35,115 --> 00:51:35,943
I won't lose them.

575
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:37,375
I want to eat a buffet dinner.

576
00:52:57,248 --> 00:53:02,934
The police found him dead and naked
in a forest near Rangsit.

577
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:07,701
Based on initial assumptions,
he has probably been dead for 48 hours.
