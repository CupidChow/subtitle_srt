1
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:16,095
(Previoulsy)
Hey, Dad.

2
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:20,167
Can you contact the police for footage
from the CCTV at Harvey Hotel?

3
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:24,458
Nant gave me this mask

4
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:26,028
to wear to a party.

5
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:27,138
That's it.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,443
We'll get the CCTV footage
from the hotel soon.

7
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,930
If you lie to me,

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,430
I'll kill you.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,444
Soong.

10
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:35,710
Don't go.

11
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:37,862
I hate hurting you, man.

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,565
I won't let you leave me.

13
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:41,979
I'll be the one who leaves.

14
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,481
(It's not Nuth and not Captain's coach)

15
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:45,715
(Who is the masked man?)

16
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:48,918
Are you

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,490
the man who wore the dog mask?

18
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:07,643
The police found him dead and naked

19
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:09,974
in a forest near Rangsit.

20
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:11,779
Based on initial assumptions,

21
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,572
he has probably been dead for 48 hours.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,861
Listen to me.
I have nothing to do with this.

23
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:22,822
I'm not listening.

24
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,106
Look at this.

25
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:34,856
You're the last person who was with him.

26
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:37,332
You're the person who went
to this fucking hotel with him.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,059
I can explain.

28
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:42,192
- Calm down and listen.
- I'm not listening.

29
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,837
I gave you chances to speak,
why didn't you?

30
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,125
Why did you tell me he's alive
when you killed him?

31
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:50,516
You said you loved him.

32
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:52,860
How could you do this to him?

33
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,800
(Playboyy)

34
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:55,562
(Episode 10: Everyone wears a mask)

35
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:08,101
Pain

36
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,890
is like a shadow that follows you.

37
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,503
Sometimes it's small.

38
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:21,550
But sometimes

39
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,218
it's too big for you to handle.

40
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:33,643
Damn it!

41
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:42,989
Fuck!

42
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,513
The way to escape that shadow

43
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:49,820
is not to deny it.

44
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:51,109
Nont.

45
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:53,593
Nont, calm down.

46
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:54,859
What's wrong?

47
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,201
What's the matter?

48
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:57,123
Calm down.

49
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,037
It doesn't matter if the shadow
was caused by someone else.

50
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:01,490
I will take legal action
against this account.

51
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,120
You destroyed my future
just because I had sex.

52
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:08,519
You have sex, humans have sex.
Everyone does.

53
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:11,351
Even though you fired me,

54
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:15,202
I won't let you
take away the journalist in me.

55
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,032
Follow my news

56
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,415
and updates on the case at the page.

57
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,429
Tutor Techanat.

58
00:05:22,094 --> 00:05:23,578
Or caused by you.

59
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,047
Did you delete everything?

60
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,539
I deleted everything. You can check.

61
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:29,719
I'm so sorry.

62
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,511
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

63
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,417
- I'm sorry.
- Get out.

64
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:36,542
I said get out!

65
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:41,388
Leave!

66
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:48,949
Sometimes you don't have to fix things.

67
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:28,823
(First, take it easy on my employees)

68
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,131
(Another one just quit)

69
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,537
(The boss is okay with you)

70
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,220
(You can go to this address)

71
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:44,845
(Good luck on your new job)

72
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:48,904
To create a shadow,

73
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,638
you must have light.

74
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,279
You must accept that light.

75
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,868
Don't forget to brighten
that light of hope.

76
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:00,673
That's all you've got to do

77
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:05,136
to be able to live with it
with no pain.

78
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:54,757
Your dad is pretty cool.

79
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,593
If we weren't in a funeral,
I would have asked for a selfie.

80
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:13,508
If we

81
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,282
had taken better care of Nant,

82
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,089
things wouldn't have
turned out this way.

83
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:25,683
I'm sorry, Nont.

84
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,464
We're really sorry for your loss.

85
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:33,217
But I think it's weird, man.

86
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:34,865
Think about it.

87
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:36,779
Overdose.

88
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:38,758
But in the forest.

89
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,540
Who would go do drugs in the forest?

90
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:44,031
Also, he was missing for months.

91
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:47,315
But the autopsy report shows that
he's been dead for two days when found.

92
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:50,613
- Where did he go during this time?
- Hey.

93
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:55,115
This isn't a thriller
you can enjoy talking about.

94
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:57,840
Nont is mourning.

95
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,433
Let's not talk about the case now.

96
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,948
I agree with them though.

97
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,128
If we keep being dramatic,
the culprit won't get caught.

98
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,772
We must hurry.

99
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,381
- Right, Nont?
- I'm going back to the States next week.

100
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,246
Thank you

101
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,878
for everything.

102
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:01,189
I will take legal action
against this account.

103
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,926
You destroyed my future
just because I had sex.

104
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:08,215
You have sex, humans have sex.
Everyone does.

105
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,484
Even though you fired me,

106
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:14,249
I won't let you
take away the journalist in me.

107
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:22,869
Eat!

108
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:38,031
I said eat!

109
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:42,231
You can torture me.

110
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,184
If I have the evidence,

111
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:46,753
I will make you and your daddy
suffer even more than this.

112
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:51,028
I'm not stupid enough
to leave any evidence, would I?

113
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,887
You were recording me?

114
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,629
Someone like you can't hurt me.

115
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,324
So if you don't eat this,

116
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,066
eat my cum.

117
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:21,178
Otherwise, you'll be going to jail
before you can expose me, Jump.

118
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:27,858
I would rather eat dog food

119
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,538
than eat your cum.

120
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:58,208
What's the matter with him?

121
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:00,458
What's going on?

122
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:03,059
A perverted client

123
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,432
strangled, punched, and kicked him.

124
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,307
The client put a pillow over his face
and almost suffocated him.

125
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:10,099
Shit.

126
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:12,340
Why did he let the client do that?

127
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:13,980
He was offered 10,000 baht an hour.

128
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,566
You would have done the same thing.

129
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:20,544
Who are you looking for?

130
00:14:21,623 --> 00:14:22,396
Aob?

131
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:27,255
No.

132
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:43,300
You look stressed.

133
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:45,628
What about another hour of massage?

134
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,745
Why did you do that?

135
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:51,953
Why did you do that, Nant?

136
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,450
Why did you?

137
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:54,489
Why?

138
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,036
Why?

139
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,020
Calm down.

140
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,090
Hey, calm down.

141
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:02,418
Calm down.

142
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,937
You made me spend all this time
looking for you,

143
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,026
but you died from an overdose.

144
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:18,659
Damn it.

145
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:20,448
You're pathetic.

146
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,388
Hey.

147
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,334
Hey.

148
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:26,959
You're wasted.

149
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,045
- You should go home.
- Who's pathetic?

150
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:29,896
Isn't that you?

151
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:36,930
You went looking on your own.

152
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:39,044
You thought someone was guilty.

153
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:42,635
But you're the one who's guilty.

154
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:44,363
What did I do?

155
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,191
- I never hurt you.
- When we were together,

156
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:48,476
you took it out on me
when someone bullied you.

157
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,140
When Mom and Dad fought,
you accused that I tattled.

158
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,686
You just wanted to make it up to me

159
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,397
for what you did to me.

160
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:58,444
That's not true.

161
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,167
You know that's not true.
Why would you say that?

162
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,549
You're denying the truth.

163
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,273
I was dead

164
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,945
when you left me.

165
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:10,797
I changed because you made me repressed.

166
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,229
I felt inferior to you all my life.

167
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:15,549
Now

168
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,096
it's too late.

169
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:18,878
- It's too late.
- Shut up!

170
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,380
- It's too late.
- Shut up!

171
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:21,497
- Hey.
- Shut up.

172
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,864
Calm down.

173
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:24,239
- Nant.
- Hey.

174
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,185
- Hey.
- Aob.

175
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,007
- Why did you do that?
- Hey.

176
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,046
Leave him alone.

177
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,631
- Get the guards.
- Let me go.

178
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:35,092
I can't do that.

179
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,623
What if something happens to him?

180
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:39,047
Get the guards, I'll watch him.

181
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,151
Maybe he's the pervert
who's been hurting our guys.

182
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:43,140
Nant and I got two matching masks.

183
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,617
The guy who went to the hotel
with Nant in the footage

184
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,249
is me.

185
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,162
I swear that I didn't hurt him.

186
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:56,985
The clip you saw

187
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,133
was role play.

188
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,238
Don't.

189
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,246
Anyone who sees this clip
must think I was trying to kill you.

190
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:16,498
Don't let anyone see it.

191
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,459
I just want to go all in
before we separate.

192
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:27,212
Thank you for always helping me.

193
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:29,759
We'll meet once this dies down.

194
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:44,544
Where are you going to hide?

195
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,154
I can't tell you.

196
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:54,724
If someone comes looking and finds you,

197
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:56,209
I'll be in trouble.

198
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:00,837
Do you think this will work?

199
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:03,219
Of course.

200
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:05,285
If Nuth's boss thinks I'm dead,

201
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,171
he might stop looking for me.

202
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,694
Tell me whether it's realistic.

203
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,395
If life is a journey...

204
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:27,590
Yes.

205
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,207
When Nant took a video of himself
faking his own death,

206
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:34,914
I was with him.

207
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:31,303
I'm sorry.

208
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:35,900
When you had your mind set on the mask,

209
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:38,751
I didn't dare tell you.

210
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:40,717
I didn't want you to misunderstand.

211
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,185
So you made me an idiot for a long time.

212
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,125
I'm sorry.

213
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:00,716
If I had told you,
you wouldn't have wasted your time.

214
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:01,498
Never mind.

215
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:04,623
It's too late.

216
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,834
I'm done.

217
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:12,603
Nont.

218
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:17,774
I don't want you to think
that I'm the bad guy.

219
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,087
I would like to say thank you all
for coming today.

220
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:04,595
Thank you so much.

221
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,485
Today

222
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:09,219
we'll being giving
scholarships to everyone.

223
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:10,553
He's such a saint, right?

224
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:12,686
To show our support to everyone of you.

225
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:13,483
Yeah.

226
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:14,642
Daddy is back.

227
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,149
He gives scholarships
to St. Paul's students every year.

228
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,022
The juniors who are top of their faculty

229
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,898
are given the opportunity
to work on a big project.

230
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,180
He gives the students opportunities
and takes the credit.

231
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:30,967
If he likes someone,

232
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,483
they get chosen to work for him
after graduation.

233
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:35,716
These kids go to heaven

234
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:39,480
at the same time
I'm about to face the hell at home.

235
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,163
- Hello.
- Hello.

236
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:57,166
Thank you for the scholarship, Mr. Lee.

237
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,982
No need for any formalities.

238
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:02,568
Any plan for your project?

239
00:25:05,175 --> 00:25:06,558
My dream

240
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,363
is having an exhibition.

241
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:13,938
Have you thought about
what kind of exhibition?

242
00:25:22,332 --> 00:25:24,183
I'll have to think about it.

243
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,210
Thank you.

244
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:44,970
You didn't pick me up at the airport.

245
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,001
Don't you miss me?

246
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,068
Can we not do this here?

247
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:55,943
Okay.

248
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:57,717
So,

249
00:25:58,935 --> 00:25:59,842
when we get home,

250
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:02,258
I will punish you

251
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,906
as hard as I can.

252
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:07,087
Okay?

253
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:56,013
What's wrong?

254
00:26:56,763 --> 00:26:57,513
You look upset.

255
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:02,805
Well...

256
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:06,653
I did something bad, Puen.

257
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:09,712
You criticized me about it.

258
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:12,681
About the clip?

259
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:16,313
See?

260
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:18,590
I knew

261
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,254
that this would get you
in trouble one day.

262
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:24,199
Have you deleted the clips?

263
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:25,508
I have.

264
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:28,569
But he won't forgive me.

265
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:32,623
Serves you right.

266
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:35,381
I wouldn't forgive you either.

267
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:38,786
Who is he?

268
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,765
He made a self-centered
person like you fret.

269
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,359
Coach.

270
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:48,379
What have you done?

271
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,531
You took clips of Keen?

272
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:01,093
I didn't know how

273
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:02,586
or when it happened.

274
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:07,679
How could I like someone like him?

275
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:11,726
He...

276
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:14,706
means well.

277
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:17,237
He always takes care of me.

278
00:28:18,604 --> 00:28:19,542
He lets me have my way.

279
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:24,529
I shouldn't have done that, Puen.

280
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:27,880
Yes.

281
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:32,118
If the former coach
or any professor sees this,

282
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:33,844
Keen might get expelled.

283
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,227
You don't deserve to like him, Captain.

284
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:39,711
I already do.

285
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:41,718
I even love him.

286
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:44,328
Damn it.

287
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:45,968
Why?

288
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:48,728
Why do I love him?

289
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:06,860
(Comfort him for me)

290
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:30,663
Kid.

291
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:33,093
I should be mad at you and hate you.

292
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:44,044
I'll give you a massage.

293
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,641
What's wrong? Why aren't you speaking?

294
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:51,688
Are you embarrassed?

295
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,535
It's strange.

296
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,050
I never had sex
with someone I've known before.

297
00:30:00,503 --> 00:30:01,511
Are you Captain's friend?

298
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:03,128
I've seen you before.

299
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:05,568
Speak to me properly.

300
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:07,138
I'm sorry.

301
00:30:07,662 --> 00:30:08,459
Sir.

302
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:11,592
Are you top or bottom?

303
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:15,423
I can do both if you pay me well.

304
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,180
What if I offer 10,000 baht an hour?

305
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:20,413
Would that be enough?

306
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,608
A perverted client

307
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:25,256
strangled and punched him.

308
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:26,827
Why did he let the client do that?

309
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,413
He was offered 10,000 baht an hour.

310
00:30:29,114 --> 00:30:30,031
You would have done the same thing.

311
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,874
Just do what I ask.

312
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:01,556
I'll do it now.

313
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:09,231
Can I put another finger in?

314
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:25,065
Do you want to continue?

315
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:28,041
I'll give you 12,000 baht.

316
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,396
Most importantly,

317
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:32,068
you can decline them.

318
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,717
But you might miss the bonus.

319
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:36,318
When they ask you to do something
you don't want to,

320
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:38,174
whisper in their ears
and ask for more money.

321
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:40,284
Everyone of them will pay.

322
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:42,268
You just have to force yourself
and do it.

323
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:07,973
Puen.

324
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:09,645
Who did this to you?

325
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:13,567
Puen, answer me. Who did this to you?

326
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:15,539
A client.

327
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:18,234
How does that involve you?

328
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:20,000
You hate me, don't you?

329
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:22,248
This is a serious matter.

330
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:25,400
What's his name? How does he look like?

331
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:28,489
- I'll tell Prom not to let him in again.
- Don't.

332
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:31,185
I'll take my own client.

333
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,302
You taught me

334
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:37,768
that if a client asks us
to do something we don't want to,

335
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:39,869
we should ask for more.

336
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:42,103
There.

337
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:43,494
I got tens of thousands of baht.

338
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,041
Are you trying to piss me off?

339
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:47,762
I don't care about you.

340
00:32:50,114 --> 00:32:51,161
The world revolves around the sun,

341
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:52,684
not you.

342
00:32:57,663 --> 00:32:59,117
Are we going to be like this, Puen?

343
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:04,714
You were guilty for lying to me.

344
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:06,738
Did you ask me?

345
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,683
Did you let me explain?

346
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,225
You really took my virginity.

347
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:17,248
I only gave Coach a blowjob.

348
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:18,903
Okay?

349
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:27,098
You got so mad and threw a tantrum
even though I did nothing wrong.

350
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:29,558
What more do you want from me?

351
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:23,852
Nont is going back
to the States next week?

352
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:30,976
We still have time.

353
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:33,993
What do you think the truth is?

354
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:41,734
I don't know.

355
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:44,640
Let's dig deeper to find out.

356
00:34:57,711 --> 00:34:58,859
Dig deeper?

357
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,816
Is that a shiitake mushroom?

358
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:11,446
If you dig hard enough,

359
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:15,766
you might even find a cheese sausage.

360
00:35:18,378 --> 00:35:19,253
Wow.

361
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:22,183
You're so flirty now.

362
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:24,753
You've changed a lot.

363
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,100
I haven't changed.

364
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,631
I just took off my mask

365
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,256
to show my true self.

366
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,619
Let's do it.

367
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,560
You'll see the shiitake,

368
00:35:43,864 --> 00:35:44,927
the seaweed,

369
00:35:48,536 --> 00:35:49,989
and the cheese sausage.

370
00:36:57,613 --> 00:36:58,441
You should eat.

371
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,685
You've been working all day.

372
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:05,051
I haven't found anything

373
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:06,814
except that Jason Lee

374
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:09,705
imports and exports
Thai and Chinese goods

375
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:11,955
and he gives scholarships
to St. Paul's students.

376
00:37:13,342 --> 00:37:14,507
He donates to temples.

377
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:16,767
Nothing more.

378
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,434
(See you at the shop)

379
00:37:29,504 --> 00:37:30,825
(In the office now)

380
00:37:34,476 --> 00:37:35,703
Why do you want to know about him?

381
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:37,538
Well...

382
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:39,639
His name rings a bell.

383
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:41,937
But I don't know where I heard it from.

384
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,577
But...

385
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:46,265
It rings a bell.

386
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:50,120
Who texted you?

387
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:51,245
Porche.

388
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,425
He wants me to see him at the shop.

389
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,709
Go.

390
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:57,990
Get some evidence.

391
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:00,607
Please.

392
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:06,501
Kiss me.

393
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:09,852
We've never kissed
without having sex before.

394
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,842
It happens if you don't use enough lube.

395
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:47,783
If you get a favor,
it means you went too hard.

396
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,298
If it keeps bleeding,
you need to see a doctor.

397
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,661
I'm embarrassed, Coach.

398
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,668
- But if you come with me...
- Let's go.

399
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:01,184
I told you

400
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:03,538
that I would take care of you.

401
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:08,203
Coach.

402
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:11,800
I know about you and Captain.

403
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:14,941
He doesn't know about us, right?

404
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,368
There's nothing between us.

405
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:20,844
You said so yourself

406
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,938
that you're having sex with me

407
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,878
so I stop bullying you.

408
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:29,871
I agreed to that deal.

409
00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:32,511
That's it, right?

410
00:39:47,815 --> 00:39:48,455
Hey.

411
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:49,933
I know you're in there.

412
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:52,613
Hey.

413
00:39:59,452 --> 00:40:00,436
Damn it.

414
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:05,436
I knew that you were fucking him
behind my back.

415
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:07,239
How long have you been fucking?

416
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:08,677
Calm down.

417
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:10,755
Nothing's going on between us.

418
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:13,208
Nothing?

419
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:14,848
You bled from fucking.

420
00:40:18,987 --> 00:40:20,183
You have no right to ask.

421
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:22,143
What are we?

422
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:25,415
You said you love me

423
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:27,111
and want the best for me.

424
00:40:28,254 --> 00:40:29,520
Why did you sleep with this asshole?

425
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:35,706
You always approach me
because you want something.

426
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:38,371
What do you want now?

427
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:39,918
Isn't that too cruel?

428
00:40:45,683 --> 00:40:46,761
I can be even more cruel.

429
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:50,523
I have a clip that shows your face.

430
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,913
Stop hooking up with him

431
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,265
and be exclusive with me

432
00:40:58,182 --> 00:40:59,197
or I'll upload the clip.

433
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:04,967
Get out of my room.

434
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:07,787
You can do whatever you want.

435
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:09,638
I don't care.

436
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:17,243
Get out!

437
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:15,568
Are you going to keep digging?

438
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:18,725
Will that make you more upset?

439
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,001
I can't be more upset than this, Zouey.

440
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:25,267
I must do this.

441
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:29,013
If Nant really died from his stupidity
like we're hearing on the news,

442
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:30,912
then I'll hate him to the bone.

443
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:33,774
But if someone killed him,

444
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:37,079
I'll take revenge on his death.

445
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:43,183
The only suspect is Nuth's boss.

446
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:45,722
But Nuth doesn't know him
and has never seen his face.

447
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:47,680
So I looked through Nant's Line,

448
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:51,455
Facebook messages,
Instagram DMs, and Twitter.

449
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:52,979
I found nothing.

450
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,303
If I was talking
about drugs with someone,

451
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,045
I would delete the message.

452
00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:02,467
I recovered his old Line messages.

453
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:09,488
What about his Facebook messages?

454
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:40,570
Done.

455
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:43,055
Usually it takes one day.

456
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:10,892
You're here.

457
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,032
I'm almost sober from the beer I drank.

458
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:23,960
Hey.

459
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:26,483
Did your daddy do this to you?

460
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:33,542
My father was his driver.

461
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,878
My mother was his maid.

462
00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:37,839
They both died in a car crash.

463
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:40,450
So Jason Lee adopted me.

464
00:44:41,438 --> 00:44:42,289
But yeah.

465
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:45,657
He doesn't treat me like a son
like everyone thinks.

466
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:48,922
He was mad at me today.

467
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,488
I didn't pick him up from the airport.

468
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,473
- So he raped me.
- So you let him fuck you

469
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,824
and beat you up?

470
00:44:59,327 --> 00:45:00,640
Why do you have to stay with him?

471
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:02,648
Run away.

472
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:06,191
Why stay and let him
treat you like an animal?

473
00:45:06,652 --> 00:45:07,698
He did to me

474
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:10,380
like I did to you.

475
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:19,772
I'm sorry, Jump.

476
00:45:20,655 --> 00:45:21,475
For everything.

477
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:25,335
For taking it out on you

478
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,377
and for releasing that clip.

479
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:30,736
I can't live without you.

480
00:45:32,736 --> 00:45:34,189
I love you, Jump.

481
00:45:40,465 --> 00:45:42,145
But I don't know if I love you.

482
00:45:43,718 --> 00:45:45,273
What you did was wrong.

483
00:45:47,593 --> 00:45:49,203
I just want one more chance.

484
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:52,316
I will treat you right.

485
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,581
I will make you love me again.

486
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,122
My father was his driver.

487
00:46:40,434 --> 00:46:41,582
My mother was his maid.

488
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:43,379
They both died in a car crash.

489
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:46,113
So Jason Lee adopted me.

490
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:48,004
But yeah.

491
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:51,598
He doesn't treat me like a son
like everyone thinks.

492
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:05,885
(Don't do anything yet)

493
00:47:08,756 --> 00:47:10,506
(Let me clear the air with him first)

494
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:27,643
(Hey)

495
00:47:30,189 --> 00:47:31,361
(You're acting like Zouey,
don't just type "Hey" and be gone)

496
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:33,311
(I'm going to sue you for defamation)

497
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,038
(I don't do that anymore)

498
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:37,603
(I went to Playboyy)

499
00:47:38,783 --> 00:47:39,845
(Guess who is a prostitute there)

500
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,111
(If it's Teena, Soong, Jump,
or Captain's Coach, don't tell us)

501
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:43,837
(I don't want all the drama)

502
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,732
(Puen!)

503
00:47:52,443 --> 00:47:53,584
(Puen, your good
scholarship student, Captain)

504
00:48:15,047 --> 00:48:16,336
I didn't like you,

505
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:19,659
but I didn't think I would hate you.

506
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:27,448
Your clothes look fancier,
but they don't make you look better.

507
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:30,402
Did a client get them for you?

508
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,404
Or did you get them by whoring yourself?

509
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:36,959
I'm just making a living.

510
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:39,045
Why are you looking down on my job?

511
00:48:39,506 --> 00:48:40,451
I'm not looking down on your job.

512
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:42,299
I'm looking down on you.

513
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:47,314
You whored yourself
to make it on the team, asshole.

514
00:48:48,344 --> 00:48:49,492
You also recorded him.

515
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,969
You're worse than I am.

516
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:54,019
- Leave him alone.
- I only fucked him when I first joined.

517
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:56,933
We didn't hook up after.

518
00:48:59,009 --> 00:48:59,854
I don't care.

519
00:49:01,323 --> 00:49:03,057
If you don't want
the whole university to find out,

520
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,779
don't let me catch you with him again.

521
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:07,771
I'm warning you

522
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:09,779
because I'm kind.

523
00:49:22,551 --> 00:49:28,871
(TN: The text reads: You
dare to betray me, you're dead!)

524
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,297
Auntie.

525
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:38,922
Can I see the CCTV footage

526
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,031
on June 11?

527
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,843
Please.

528
00:49:43,805 --> 00:49:44,384
Auntie.

529
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:46,150
Please.

530
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:48,192
Auntie.

531
00:49:50,465 --> 00:49:51,207
Auntie.

532
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:52,817
I'm begging you.

533
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:56,163
Shit.

534
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:07,287
Hey.

535
00:50:07,506 --> 00:50:08,865
Someone came to see me earlier.

536
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,343
He asked for the CCTV footage.

537
00:50:11,547 --> 00:50:13,602
He asked for the June footage

538
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:16,000
when you brought
a whole group of people here.

539
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:18,493
Did you act innocent
like I asked you to?

540
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:20,902
Yes.

541
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:22,644
Good.

542
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:24,612
If you talk,

543
00:50:28,248 --> 00:50:29,209
this thing will talk too.

544
00:50:32,482 --> 00:50:34,959
- Keys.
- Oh, okay.

545
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:39,071
Keys.

546
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,235
Here.

547
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:53,090
(Room 503?)

548
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:57,731
(Yup, come in)

549
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:43,733
Hey.

550
00:51:44,741 --> 00:51:45,842
Go easy, man.

551
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:50,069
I never do anything easy.

552
00:51:51,306 --> 00:51:52,251
I do it rough.

553
00:52:06,586 --> 00:52:07,172
Hey.

554
00:52:07,578 --> 00:52:08,312
Red light.

555
00:52:08,554 --> 00:52:09,234
Red light.

556
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:10,648
Shut the fuck up.

557
00:52:13,694 --> 00:52:14,553
Red light.

558
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:16,366
I said shut up.

559
00:52:17,428 --> 00:52:18,382
Shut up!

560
00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:24,033
Who the fuck are you?

561
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:36,797
It doesn't matter.

562
00:52:37,537 --> 00:52:41,552
Do unto others as you would have
them do unto you.

563
00:52:41,577 --> 00:52:42,310
Ouch.

564
00:52:42,998 --> 00:52:43,678
And...

565
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:47,141
Don't go back to Playboyy.

566
00:52:48,422 --> 00:52:49,235
Or else

567
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:53,897
it won't be my fist

568
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:57,914
that pierces.

569
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:03,147
It will be a bullet.

570
00:53:55,478 --> 00:53:56,048
Hello.

571
00:53:56,712 --> 00:53:57,954
Is this the police station?

572
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:00,548
Yes.

573
00:54:00,783 --> 00:54:02,345
I'm Phop, Phiphop Srikaew.

574
00:54:03,553 --> 00:54:04,936
I'm calling from CA Apartment.

575
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,507
I want to file a missing report.

576
00:54:11,132 --> 00:54:13,757
My boyfriend went missing
in the script he wrote.

577
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:17,190
I can't reach him.

578
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:50,655
Done.

579
00:54:52,897 --> 00:54:53,671
Hey, Phop.

580
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:54,882
When did you get here?

581
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:02,548
Nuth.

582
00:55:03,723 --> 00:55:05,325
You're not paying attention to me.

583
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:07,567
Come on.

584
00:55:08,426 --> 00:55:09,622
Don't sulk.

585
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:14,547
You must be punished.

586
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:16,321
Have sex with me.

587
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:17,774
Now.

588
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:19,592
No buts.

589
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:22,725
Three hours at least.

590
00:55:24,248 --> 00:55:25,365
Don't come first.

591
00:55:28,134 --> 00:55:29,048
Do you understand?

592
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:31,204
I do.

593
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:33,462
Good.

594
00:55:36,988 --> 00:55:38,316
Who would be able

595
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:39,356
to do it for three hours?

596
00:55:39,817 --> 00:55:41,231
Stop.

597
00:55:41,598 --> 00:55:42,473
Wait.

598
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:44,327
I finished the script.

599
00:55:45,288 --> 00:55:46,116
Read it

600
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:48,538
and I'll do it.

601
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:06,462
(I have news on CEO of
J. Lee Group, we can meet)

602
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:42,917
Everyone wears a mask.

603
00:57:08,748 --> 00:57:11,194
Mr. Lee, I want to ask you

604
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:12,827
about

605
00:57:13,046 --> 00:57:15,163
the promise you made to me

606
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:16,804
about my exhibition.

607
00:57:18,327 --> 00:57:22,331
I decided that I want
the exhibition to be at your office.

608
00:57:24,557 --> 00:57:27,260
Did you think about the concept
of the art exhibition?

609
00:57:30,877 --> 00:57:31,822
Nudes.

610
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:36,403
I'm sorry.

611
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,677
But I think an art exhibition with nudes
is not suitable

612
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:42,474
with the prestigious St. Paul.

613
00:59:04,766 --> 00:59:05,680
Hello.

614
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,095
So Jason Lee adopted me.

615
00:59:24,977 --> 00:59:26,134
But yeah.

616
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:29,143
He doesn't treat me like a son
like everyone thinks.

617
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:30,900
He was mad at me today.

618
00:59:31,627 --> 00:59:33,424
- What the fuck?
- I didn't pick him up at the airport.

619
00:59:34,372 --> 00:59:36,630
- So he raped me.
- So you let him fuck you

620
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:38,294
and beat you up?

621
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:52,820
What happened?

622
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:56,023
Who was that? I'm asking you.

623
00:59:56,687 --> 00:59:57,570
What happened?

624
00:59:58,387 --> 00:59:59,543
Everyone wears a mask.

625
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:01,895
It just depends

626
01:00:02,794 --> 01:00:04,147
on when it will be ripped off.

627
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:09,321
(Next Episode)
- Jason Lee owns Playboyy. - Jason Lee owns Playboyy.

628
01:00:09,782 --> 01:00:10,618
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

629
01:00:11,634 --> 01:00:12,462
Prom told me.

630
01:00:12,726 --> 01:00:17,273
I can't believe that one of Asia's
15 most generous businessmen

631
01:00:17,953 --> 01:00:19,953
might be a pedophile.

632
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,772
Your adoptive father
doesn't sleep with you, right?

633
01:00:22,054 --> 01:00:23,249
He doesn't hurt you, right?

634
01:00:24,694 --> 01:00:26,030
You have a nice body.

635
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:29,001
It would be a shame
if the world doesn't see it.

636
01:00:30,587 --> 01:00:33,009
Is Jump here? Mr. Lee is coming.

637
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:34,235
I hired you to be a manager,

638
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,618
not ask the owner to do
everything that you can't do. Fuck!
