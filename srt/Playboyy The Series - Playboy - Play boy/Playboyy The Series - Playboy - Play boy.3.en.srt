1
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,797
(Previously) The police found out
that his signal was last tracked here.

2
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:19,395
His signal was gone
when he went to sleep somewhere else.

3
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:21,737
I think there must be something
on his phone.

4
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:23,124
Where have you been?

5
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:24,687
I thought something bad happened.

6
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:27,249
I want to make you want me.

7
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:28,960
I think that will be interesting.

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,726
Do you know the account Wash Your Sin?

9
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,187
Car wash and sex.
We can text him if we're interested.

10
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:36,820
Should we rent an apartment?

11
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:38,915
I'll ask my father.

12
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,297
First he had a fight with his father
and ran away from home.

13
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:48,692
A clip of a police officer
has been released.

14
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:51,295
A police officer accused a man of drugs
and threatened his wife.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,090
A police officer was filmed
in a gas station bathroom.

16
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:55,982
A government official has a sex tape.

17
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,464
He is blackmailed and threatened.

18
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:01,878
Dad.

19
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:07,433
If you see this clip,
it means I'm alive.

20
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:11,261
I'm sorry, Dad.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,893
I'm sorry for trusting a stranger
more than you.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,807
You have eight hours.

23
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,347
Transfer a million baht to my account.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,701
So I can transfer it to the kidnapper.

25
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:31,735
He will send me home unharmed.

26
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:36,446
The smart watch
used to measure my heartbeat

27
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,587
has been connected to your phone.

28
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:41,524
If you tell the police,

29
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:43,829
you will get a notification

30
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:47,076
that my heart has stopped beating.

31
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:51,427
Don't agree to this, Dad.

32
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:53,528
Don't pay him.

33
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:55,153
Dad.

34
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,508
I gave you a chance.

35
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,862
But you disobeyed me.

36
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:34,058
Now

37
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,995
your dad will get to see us fucking.

38
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,163
Smile for your Daddy.

39
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,100
Good.

40
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:10,413
Tell your dad what I told you to say.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,303
Tell him.

42
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,553
Daddy.

43
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,939
Your son is a slut.

44
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,765
Did you get hard?

45
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:43,179
Tell me, when can you get hard?

46
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:44,383
When...

47
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:46,679
When you allow me.

48
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:48,789
- Fucking wait for it then.
- Please.

49
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:51,687
I'm begging you.

50
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:53,547
I will be a bad boy.

51
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,792
So don't wait for my dad.

52
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:57,877
Who made you turn out this way?

53
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,932
Who made you turn out this way?
Say it.

54
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,049
Dad.

55
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,838
Dad, you made me turn out this way.

56
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,253
It's your fault, Dad.

57
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,637
It's your fault, Dad.

58
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:14,691
It's your fault, Dad.

59
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,900
"Playboyy The Series"

60
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,441
(Episode 3: Sacrificing yourself)

61
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:28,914
Did you enjoy that?

62
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:44,721
I'm glad I can express myself this way.

63
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,588
You performed really well, Soong.

64
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,461
Dad, you made me turn out this way.

65
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,695
It's your fault, Dad.

66
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,750
It's your fault, Dad.

67
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:14,867
I want to send this to Dad

68
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:16,961
and just be done with him.

69
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,026
If I get a million baht,

70
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,440
we can run away together.

71
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,206
Don't do it.

72
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,979
Let's just role play for fun

73
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:31,159
or we'll get in trouble.

74
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,326
Are you leaving?

75
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,896
There's a new order.

76
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,607
Can you not go?

77
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,211
Why is the after care so short?

78
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:58,860
If I don't go, we won't have any cash.
You're not with your father anymore.

79
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,430
Do you want to stay with your friends?
I'll send you there.

80
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:14,666
They'll be worried about you.

81
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,978
I'm back.

82
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:29,196
I got a new laptop.
There won't be any hiccups.

83
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:34,897
(You were gone)

84
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:35,279
(I miss you, Phop)

85
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,443
(I transferred you the money, Phop)

86
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,553
(Let's have a private call today)

87
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,535
(You haven't replied to my text)

88
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,615
(Phop)

89
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:46,177
(Who are you?)

90
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:53,942
(Zouey: Come back, Nant
We are very worried about you)

91
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:54,685
(First: I miss you, Nant
Come home)

92
00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:57,748
(Who are you?
How did you get my brother's laptop?)

93
00:09:58,771 --> 00:09:59,990
(Answer!
If you don't, I'll call the police)

94
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,024
(If you got it by accident,
reply to me and return it)

95
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:16,766
(My brother is missing, if you don't
return it, you'll become a suspect)

96
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:17,641
(I'm sorry, I bought a secondhand laptop
I didn't think it would cause trouble)

97
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:23,652
(Return it
if you don't want any trouble)

98
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:25,089
(So?)

99
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,480
(The police can track you down,
I'll pay you double for it)

100
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,243
(Where should we meet up?)

101
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:07,308
Damn it. Where did he go?

102
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,573
I don't know.

103
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:10,019
- Do you know?
- Shit.

104
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:12,128
What should we do?

105
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:19,170
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

106
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:23,068
I'm sorry, guys.

107
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:24,639
My phone isn't working.

108
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,584
I can't call anyone.

109
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:31,568
I'm glad you're okay.

110
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:33,175
If you didn't show up by tomorrow,

111
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:34,503
I would've called the police

112
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,019
and accused the pizza delivery boy
of kidnapping you.

113
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,813
Why do you hate him that much?

114
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:42,204
He asked me to move in with him.

115
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,712
Why do you still not trust him?

116
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,696
The Western looking guy
who rode the orange Vespa here?

117
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,090
Where are you going so late, Nant?

118
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:55,613
I have errands to run.

119
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:59,152
At the same place
at around 10 p.m. again?

120
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:02,551
Just admit that you're seeing someone
and introduce him to us.

121
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,324
Even First brought his guy here.

122
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:32,353
You should go to bed.

123
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,900
You're trying out
for the rugby team tomorrow.

124
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:37,798
Don't worry. I'll pass the tryout.

125
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,455
I'll sacrifice myself.

126
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:49,966
- Sacrificing your body for it?
- Sacrificing your body for it?

127
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,513
- What's the matter with you guys?
- Like this?

128
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:56,193
Right? Is that your plan?

129
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,115
What the hell?

130
00:12:58,646 --> 00:12:59,654
Shut up.

131
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,743
I'm here. I got it for 15,000 baht.

132
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:41,307
How did you get this laptop?

133
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,158
I got it from a secondhand shop.

134
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:46,362
The shop would have wiped everything
and logged out from Facebook.

135
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:49,143
- How did you get it?
- Why are you asking all these questions?

136
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,068
- I found it around my dorm.
- Where is your dorm?

137
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:08,739
I returned the laptop to you,
so just let me go.

138
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:11,591
My dorm is at...

139
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:43,119
Keen is a senior.

140
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:45,810
He is the team captain
who's taking the role of coach

141
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,076
because the coach got into an accident
and needed surgery.

142
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:51,963
Many people accept him, but many don't.

143
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,668
Based on our tradition,
a pair has to enter the dark room.

144
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,723
We'll get to know each other better

145
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,614
and we'll give you a mission.

146
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:08,887
If you can't complete the mission,

147
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,903
you must leave the team.

148
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,562
The first pair

149
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:19,609
is Captain and Puen.

150
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:28,976
Honestly.

151
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:30,823
Are you gay?

152
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:34,666
- No.
- No.

153
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:42,182
Have you ever fucked someone in the ass?

154
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:44,260
- No.
- No.

155
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:46,807
I'm not lying.
I've never done it before.

156
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:50,437
But I've been fucked before.

157
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,804
Good.

158
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:54,781
Do you have a girlfriend?

159
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:08,797
Not yet.

160
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:10,953
Okay.

161
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:15,984
Your mission

162
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:18,227
is to go to the sauna room

163
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,078
and fill this shot glass

164
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,815
with your cum.

165
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:38,354
Damn it.

166
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:53,349
The son of a hospital director
only has a few thousand baht.

167
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,872
Yeah, I had to get a new phone.

168
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,622
That's all I have.

169
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:02,273
I normally use my credit cards.

170
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,523
Why did Dad cancel my cards?

171
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:08,484
Calm down.

172
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,492
Being upset isn't helpful.
Just go back to him.

173
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:28,461
You can't survive
with this amount of money.

174
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,483
How many times
have you done it in one day?

175
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,155
What's the point of this question?

176
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,256
This is already so awkward.

177
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:52,928
A shot glass

178
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:55,077
has a capacity of 15 milliliters.

179
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,814
When you come,
you only produce about 1.5 milliliters.

180
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,611
So we need to come 30 times.

181
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,572
- We can each contribute half.
- Are you serious?

182
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:06,767
Damn it.

183
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,095
Can we sue them?

184
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:13,600
But I need to do this.

185
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:15,398
I'm on a scholarship.

186
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,007
If I don't make it on the team,
I'll have to drop out.

187
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:23,163
If you don't care,
then don't do it and turn around.

188
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:29,850
Damn it.

189
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:32,398
I've tried for three years.

190
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,757
I already made it on the team.

191
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:38,955
They took our phones.

192
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:42,455
At least let me watch some porn.

193
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:44,986
Only if I had some help...

194
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,955
Do you mind?

195
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,153
I'm fine if you just use your hands.

196
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:13,893
That's enough.

197
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,424
That's dope.

198
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:31,938
Keen was just messing with you.
This isn't your mission.

199
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:35,446
He was going to do it for real.
That's awesome.

200
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:40,415
If you want to be on the team,
you have to be determined.

201
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,532
Good job.

202
00:19:42,774 --> 00:19:44,165
Look at him.

203
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:46,843
You bullied him. Look at him now.

204
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,080
What are you doing?

205
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:18,908
Why are you smelling my underwear?

206
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:21,817
Talk to me nicely.

207
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:23,426
Call me Coach.

208
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:24,864
No.

209
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:26,520
What are you going to do?

210
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:31,293
You've been getting on my nerves.

211
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:34,520
The shot glass and the locker.

212
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,997
You also asked if I had a girlfriend.

213
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:40,133
Why? Do you like me?

214
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:44,969
I was just checking

215
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:47,196
if you are obedient.

216
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:51,321
Do you have a secret
that you haven't told me about?

217
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:54,578
We both have secrets, don't we?

218
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:57,769
What should I do?

219
00:21:58,894 --> 00:21:59,800
Bully me again

220
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,120
and I'll expose your secret to the team.

221
00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:55,843
Hey.

222
00:23:57,624 --> 00:23:58,632
You pretended to come?

223
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:02,194
- Answer me.
- Don't raise your voice.

224
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,014
You don't own me
like the roles we're playing.

225
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:06,889
Find a balance.

226
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,108
Just tell me if you're not in the mood.

227
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:11,545
Pretending to come

228
00:24:12,154 --> 00:24:14,326
- is fucked up.
- Would you have stopped?

229
00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:19,548
I'm tired from working every day

230
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:23,110
and I still have to
take on all these roles.

231
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,907
Can't we just have normal sex?

232
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:44,856
(My Saving Account)

233
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:54,476
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

234
00:25:58,226 --> 00:25:59,101
Hey.

235
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,234
So did you sacrifice yourself to get it?

236
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,249
Fuck you. I got in because of my talent.

237
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:07,932
I'm still upset about giving
the scholarship student a handjob.

238
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:13,658
Nant, do you want a beer?

239
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,408
Wine only.

240
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:20,596
Nant.

241
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,191
You love beer.

242
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:24,072
You like Thai craft beer.

243
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:28,314
(I thought you got a new laptop,
why aren't you going live?)

244
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,653
Nant, are you okay?

245
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:44,949
What are you doing?

246
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,598
- Nant.
- Leave me alone.

247
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:49,113
Hey. Shit.

248
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,988
You've been acting strange
ever since you came back.

249
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,668
Calm down, Porche.

250
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:55,301
Nant is probably stressed.

251
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:08,835
You're not the Nant I know.

252
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:10,632
Honestly.

253
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,121
Look at him.

254
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:50,381
The guy who had the laptop
said he found it at his dorm,

255
00:27:50,897 --> 00:27:52,358
which is near Playboyy.

256
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,283
If it was thrown away there,

257
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,689
it means he was there.

258
00:27:58,814 --> 00:28:00,908
The person he was doing
a sex call with must be at that dorm.

259
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,970
This is probably the guy he met up with
and became his boyfriend.

260
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:16,879
He could be a host at Playboyy.

261
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:28,528
Is this the guy you owe money to, Nant?

262
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:34,008
(Do you want to meet up?)

263
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,102
(See you then)

264
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:44,835
(Your mission is to take a clip of
the guy who keeps going to Keen's room)

265
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:46,546
(Send a clip before tomorrow morning
or you're off the team)

266
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:51,072
There.

267
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:52,908
They turned off the lights.

268
00:28:53,611 --> 00:28:55,041
Keen is probably asleep now.

269
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:58,143
I'm so confused.

270
00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:00,658
How do you know which is Keen's room?

271
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,822
Have you been there before?

272
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,799
I asked the seniors.

273
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:09,834
Shit. They're here.

274
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:12,678
I know. Is it Keen?

275
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:15,849
I'll take the clip.

276
00:29:58,292 --> 00:29:59,893
I won't say "I told you so."

277
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,373
But I really did.

278
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:08,131
That's why I told you to just have sex.
Love doesn't exist.

279
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,858
It does.

280
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:15,967
Here's your unsweetened milk tea.

281
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,064
Thank you.

282
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,947
Calm down.

283
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,603
You have every right to be jealous.

284
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,613
- But if you're not exclusive...
- He called me baby.

285
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:41,832
I call waiters baby all the time.

286
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,488
The point is

287
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:47,738
if you aren't exclusive,
he can have sex with anyone.

288
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:50,996
He might not be dating you
for your money.

289
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,473
But it doesn't mean
he's only sleeping with you.

290
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:56,201
He delivers pizza every night.

291
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,227
He meets a lot of people.

292
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:07,594
When I became broke,

293
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,219
he started acting distant.

294
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,297
Damn it. I want to die.

295
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:17,143
Come on.

296
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:41,021
(Hello, let's have a call)

297
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:44,279
(Good, are you new?
Show me your face)

298
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:57,602
(You're cute)

299
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,415
(Hold to see)

300
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:09,768
I've sacrificed myself
for you twice already, Nant.

301
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,799
(My microphone doesn't work,
let's text)

302
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,522
(That's good too,
You're cute, why are you on webcam?)

303
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:46,479
(Because I like it)

304
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,440
(Who do you think of when you jerk off?

305
00:32:57,846 --> 00:32:58,775
(Meeting strangers,
having sex with twins in a small room)

306
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,713
(The twins make out
and lick all over my body)

307
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:00,951
(I wear a mask
and I'll make them moan like a dog)

308
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:02,240
(With the camera on)

309
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,412
(Damn, you made me hard)

310
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,803
(Who do you think of?)

311
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:19,337
(Those who treat me like shit in life,
come to me and I'll fuck them)

312
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:20,399
(I'll torture and punish them
until they bleed)

313
00:33:20,424 --> 00:33:21,149
(Shit I like it)

314
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:22,165
(Tell me more)

315
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:29,258
(I'm sorry, I can't type
because I'm about to come)

316
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:51,757
(I'm not done yet,
show me your cute face)

317
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:23,729
(Why are you surprised?)

318
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:49,651
How is First?

319
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:54,151
He's still upset.

320
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:57,604
But he went to see
the pizza delivery guy.

321
00:35:04,342 --> 00:35:06,350
Do you care about my friends?

322
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:14,288
If your friends are upset,

323
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,538
you're upset.

324
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:19,530
Of course I care.

325
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:31,837
Even though I'm not your boyfriend?

326
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,853
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

327
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:00,087
I'm ready.

328
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:19,025
I really like you.

329
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:22,794
I want you to be with me

330
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:25,521
like this forever.

331
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:28,576
We don't need to have sex.

332
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,435
You don't need to sacrifice yourself.

333
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:35,362
I'll always be with you.

334
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:04,307
I'm in the mood.

335
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:42,222
You've succeeded in making me want you.

336
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:26,806
If I come fast,

337
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:28,923
please don't mock me.

338
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,380
Why would I mock you?

339
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,263
I promised to give you a private lesson.

340
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:55,633
But if you don't feel comfortable,

341
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:58,578
say "red light"

342
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:02,282
and I'll stop.

343
00:40:08,015 --> 00:40:09,101
Do you miss me?

344
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:10,932
You were moaning so loudly.

345
00:40:12,432 --> 00:40:13,737
Aren't you afraid others would hear you?

346
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:24,166
Are you ready for round two?

347
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:32,192
What's with the face?

348
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:34,528
You're acting
like we've never done it before.

349
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:45,141
Shit.

350
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:54,608
The next time you do push-ups,
you have to go lower.

351
00:40:55,593 --> 00:40:57,413
I'm sore from demonstrating it to you.

352
00:40:58,171 --> 00:40:58,890
You're sore?

353
00:40:59,812 --> 00:41:00,687
Do you want a massage?

354
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:02,741
My uncle always asks me to massage him.

355
00:41:05,893 --> 00:41:07,150
Are you calling me an uncle?

356
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,103
I'll kick you out of the team
before you get to try out.

357
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,182
Come on.

358
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:13,549
You're misusing your power.

359
00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:15,932
Do you want a massage?

360
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,638
But I won't be using only my hands.

361
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,552
Are you going to sacrifice yourself?

362
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,115
Don't say that.

363
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:26,482
I'm just earning extra credit.

364
00:42:10,473 --> 00:42:11,512
You're getting wet.

365
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:13,888
Come on.

366
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:16,865
Let's fill this glass.

367
00:42:18,357 --> 00:42:19,490
I really like you.

368
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,136
We are not dating.

369
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:29,832
When we're with others,

370
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:31,730
don't talk to me casually.

371
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:33,480
Sure.

372
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,269
I'll talk to you like an uncle.

373
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:06,229
Hey.

374
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:08,873
Can you put your dick in me?

375
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:22,907
Wait.

376
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:27,868
I think we should stop.

377
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,252
Just a little more.

378
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,642
You want to learn, don't you?

379
00:43:38,978 --> 00:43:40,033
It will feel even better.

380
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:22,679
I can't take it.

381
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:24,632
I can't take it either.

382
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:33,026
Please.

383
00:44:34,143 --> 00:44:35,471
Just let me put the tip in.

384
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:39,948
If we're going to be a couple,
we'll have to do this someday.

385
00:45:06,968 --> 00:45:07,757
Zouey.

386
00:45:10,078 --> 00:45:10,828
I'm sorry.

387
00:45:12,328 --> 00:45:13,671
I didn't know you couldn't take it.

388
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,882
We agreed on the word "red light."

389
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:23,780
I'm sorry.

390
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:27,350
I'm not experienced enough
to remember that.

391
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:32,720
How could you say

392
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:36,603
that if we're a couple,
we'll have to do it?

393
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:48,845
That's not what I meant.

394
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,423
I didn't mean it like that.

395
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:00,215
I just meant that

396
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:02,208
if we're going to do it eventually,

397
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,231
we should just do it.

398
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,239
I didn't mean it like that.

399
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:16,421
You told me

400
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:20,085
that we don't need to have sex
if we're a couple.

401
00:46:22,768 --> 00:46:24,456
You're using sex

402
00:46:27,205 --> 00:46:28,471
to not be in a relationship with me.

403
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:46,172
You should leave.

404
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:53,086
I'm so disappointed in you.

405
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:10,941
I'm sorry.

406
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:12,533
I can't do it.

407
00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:14,837
I said I wasn't in the mood.
Why didn't you stop?

408
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,158
How do I know if you're acting
or saying the truth?

409
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,017
You didn't use the safe word.

410
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:24,658
Fuck the safe word.

411
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:27,844
Look at me. You should know
that I don't want to do it.

412
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:31,264
I'm not a whore.
I can't fuck like this every day.

413
00:48:34,154 --> 00:48:34,857
Fine.

414
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:37,311
I'm sorry for wanting you

415
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:41,612
even though you just want my money.

416
00:48:44,151 --> 00:48:45,619
How dare you say that.

417
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,815
I let you live with me.

418
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:51,018
- Are you paying rent?
- Am I wrong?

419
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:54,486
Ever since I've moved in
and don't have any money for you,

420
00:48:55,257 --> 00:48:56,726
you've been distant from me.

421
00:48:57,648 --> 00:48:58,765
What about the after care?

422
00:48:59,507 --> 00:49:01,093
You used to call me baby.

423
00:49:07,468 --> 00:49:08,343
Just leave.

424
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:10,527
You...

425
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:13,339
You're just sacrificing yourself
for money.

426
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:16,612
You're going to leave me
because I'm broke.

427
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:17,949
Right?

428
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,308
I know

429
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:23,566
that you have a new target.

430
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,428
You're not a whore, Soong.

431
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:27,928
You're a leech.

432
00:49:34,342 --> 00:49:36,069
If that's what you think,
we shouldn't see each other again.

433
00:49:38,158 --> 00:49:39,220
You failed me, man.

434
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:01,401
Baby.

435
00:50:03,607 --> 00:50:04,779
Baby.

436
00:50:20,074 --> 00:50:21,379
I'm glad I can express myself this way.

437
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:27,137
You performed really well, Soong.

438
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:30,426
If I get a million baht,

439
00:50:31,606 --> 00:50:33,576
we can run away together.

440
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:03,715
You're so dope, Captain.

441
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,769
- Are you a detective?
- No.

442
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:09,644
I'm willing to do anything
to be on the team.

443
00:51:11,566 --> 00:51:13,621
Keen is gay.

444
00:51:14,981 --> 00:51:16,122
I'm not judging him.

445
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,497
But do you want someone like him
to take control of the team?

446
00:51:20,653 --> 00:51:22,567
You're right. What if he says,

447
00:51:23,509 --> 00:51:25,511
"You made us lose.
Let me fuck you in the ass."

448
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:27,043
What are we going to do?

449
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:31,672
Why didn't you get the face
of the one being fucked?

450
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:33,250
It's like you knew the angle to take.

451
00:51:33,938 --> 00:51:38,937
Did you do this clip with Keen
to fool all of us?

452
00:51:39,274 --> 00:51:40,743
I like girls.

453
00:51:41,251 --> 00:51:43,376
Girls with big boobs,
a smooth ass, and a small waist.

454
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:46,798
A muscular and hairy guy like him
turns me off.

455
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:49,649
You're acting sketchy, Captain.

456
00:51:50,379 --> 00:51:51,918
So are you gay?

457
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:56,488
Of course not. I'll take
a clip of me sleeping with my girl.

458
00:51:56,715 --> 00:51:58,090
Wow.

459
00:51:59,176 --> 00:52:00,348
I'll wait for it.

460
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:02,309
Show me the clip.

461
00:52:45,182 --> 00:52:46,510
Even though I started it...

462
00:52:47,018 --> 00:52:48,908
If I wanted to stop,
but he didn't want to,

463
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,322
is this considered abuse?

464
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:53,010
I don't know.

465
00:52:54,736 --> 00:52:57,049
What I did to Soong...
Was that abuse?

466
00:52:58,799 --> 00:52:59,713
Did he give you consent?

467
00:53:02,026 --> 00:53:06,174
If you both agreed
and no one was being forced,

468
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,791
it's not abuse.

469
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:13,320
Then what he did to you wasn't abuse.

470
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:15,360
You didn't use the safe word.

471
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:18,618
Zouey.

472
00:53:19,555 --> 00:53:20,860
People who are into BDSM

473
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:23,665
have no clue

474
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:26,016
if you're enjoying the pain

475
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,852
or you're actually in pain.

476
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:31,297
Yeah.

477
00:53:32,149 --> 00:53:33,883
Should I try to make it up to him?

478
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:39,504
Hey.

479
00:53:39,903 --> 00:53:44,059
Are you so depressed
you're drinking beer at the university?

480
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,645
We're upset.

481
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,902
You've never felt this way before.
You don't get it.

482
00:53:52,106 --> 00:53:52,762
Yeah.

483
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:54,137
Shut up, man.

484
00:53:54,394 --> 00:53:55,754
Who said I've never felt this way?

485
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:01,215
I have to go.

486
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
See you at home.

487
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:12,022
Zouey.

488
00:54:12,944 --> 00:54:14,202
Do you think something's going on?

489
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:17,428
He's been disappearing often.

490
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:19,572
Sure.

491
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,244
He said he hated
his dad's car wash shop.

492
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:28,087
- But now he's always...
- Zouey, my bestie.

493
00:54:28,908 --> 00:54:29,759
Do you love me?

494
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:35,208
I need your help.

495
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:47,585
Bestie.

496
00:54:49,257 --> 00:54:50,886
Even though I made you
lose your virginity,

497
00:54:51,277 --> 00:54:52,621
you love me, don't you?

498
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:55,421
What do you want?

499
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,842
Well...

500
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:01,318
I need to perform.

501
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:05,060
I need to perform
as part of my team's mission.

502
00:55:06,482 --> 00:55:07,310
I need a wig.

503
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:11,823
Do you have wigs and makeup
at your club?

504
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,354
Can you borrow them for me?

505
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:22,498
I'll order it for you.

506
00:55:23,545 --> 00:55:24,131
Hey.

507
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:26,568
I bought a secondhand laptop.

508
00:55:27,068 --> 00:55:29,154
Does this mean
there's not enough storage space?

509
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:31,474
Yes.

510
00:55:33,064 --> 00:55:35,142
The shop didn't give it a reboot.
That's why it's slow.

511
00:55:35,805 --> 00:55:36,875
Try deleting some files.

512
00:55:37,446 --> 00:55:38,219
I thought so too.

513
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,188
But there's nothing to delete.

514
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:57,226
There's a hidden file.

515
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,390
Can it be recovered?

516
00:56:00,878 --> 00:56:01,745
So I can delete it.

517
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:19,072
Done.

518
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,815
Don't forget the wig and makeup.

519
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:23,635
Thank you.

520
00:57:18,532 --> 00:57:19,399
No.

521
00:57:20,532 --> 00:57:22,664
Shit.

522
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:25,891
No.

523
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,758
No!

524
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,137
It was like seeing myself get stabbed.

525
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,168
The more I dig,
the more I don't want to know.

526
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,340
How can a human be so cruel to another?

527
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:45,215
Nant slept with Prom for money.

528
00:57:45,943 --> 00:57:46,982
He sold his clips to Captain.

529
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:49,138
And now this guy.

530
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,614
Does sex have to be this violent, Dad?

531
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,890
My brother isn't dead.

532
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:04,852
Who downloaded this clip to his laptop?

533
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:07,554
Maybe the guy in the clip just found out
he was being filmed

534
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:08,938
and wanted to get rid of the clip.

535
00:58:13,796 --> 00:58:15,851
And that's why Nant is missing.

536
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,556
What are you staring at?

537
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:37,760
You're acting like
you've never been here before.

538
00:58:42,114 --> 00:58:42,810
Well...

539
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:44,974
I haven't been here in awhile.

540
00:58:48,646 --> 00:58:49,638
You've changed.

541
00:58:51,355 --> 00:58:52,707
You used to hate it here.

542
00:58:54,373 --> 00:58:55,913
I had to convince you to come.

543
00:58:58,725 --> 00:58:59,327
Really?

544
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:01,819
What did you do to me

545
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:03,538
to make me not want to come here?

546
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:17,111
Beer only.

547
00:59:19,076 --> 00:59:20,662
I thought you've changed enough
to drink wine.

548
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,615
Have you tried doing a sex call

549
00:59:37,725 --> 00:59:38,686
with a webcam

550
00:59:40,256 --> 00:59:41,303
or something online?

551
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:43,147
No.

552
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:47,065
I can have sex in real life,
why do I need to join a call?

553
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:54,670
Let's get to the point.

554
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:56,412
You're here today

555
00:59:57,701 --> 00:59:58,506
because you want money?

556
01:00:07,047 --> 01:00:08,344
I just want to have sex with you.

557
01:00:15,684 --> 01:00:16,496
Master.

558
01:00:19,738 --> 01:00:21,176
Punish me hard today.

559
01:00:30,342 --> 01:00:30,858
Sure.

560
01:00:34,436 --> 01:00:35,678
I'll make you moan like a dog.

561
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:38,967
(My microphone doesn't work,
let's text)

562
01:00:38,992 --> 01:00:39,796
(I'll make them moan like a dog)

563
01:00:39,821 --> 01:00:42,414
(Like a dog)

564
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,563
Are you scared, naughty boy?

565
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:49,688
Do you want to be even more scared?

566
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:02,499
Do you want me to set up the camera

567
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:05,507
and wear a mask

568
01:01:06,846 --> 01:01:07,916
like I used to?

569
01:01:52,753 --> 01:01:55,714
(Next Episode) I told you that he
might not be dating you for your money.

570
01:01:55,956 --> 01:01:58,542
I'm sad. I think about you all day.

571
01:01:59,198 --> 01:02:01,862
- What's the first rule of this job?
- I know.

572
01:02:02,503 --> 01:02:05,120
Don't fall in love with the client.

573
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:07,065
I don't know
if I think of him as a client.

574
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:09,191
Even though we're just sex buddies,

575
01:02:09,216 --> 01:02:11,785
we can't be in
a monogamous relationship.
