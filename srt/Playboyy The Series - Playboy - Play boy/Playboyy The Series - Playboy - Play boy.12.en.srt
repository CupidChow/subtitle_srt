1
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,746
(Previously)
- Jason Lee owns Playboyy. - Jason Lee owns Playboyy.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,425
What if Nant tried exposing

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,785
that he's behind Playboyy
and other shady businesses?

4
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:22,223
So Jason Lee took him

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,201
after he filmed the suicide clip.

6
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:26,199
Daddy has a VIP room at Playboyy.

7
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:27,302
I'll have a look.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,060
I told you guys not to come back here.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,998
- Hey.
- Captain.

10
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:36,385
You told First to hurt other people?

11
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:38,607
Captain complained about Puen to me.

12
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:41,359
I accidentally met him here.

13
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:43,351
I paid him.

14
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,443
We had a talk about it.

15
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,068
You can call me naive and immature.

16
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:50,958
But if I have to be horrible,

17
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,020
perverted, and sadistic to be mature,
I'm willing to stay immature, assholes.

18
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,349
You and Nont are the best.

19
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:58,133
I'm out.

20
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:01,055
You guys can continue investigating.

21
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,981
A woman has come forward
confessing that she's been tricked.

22
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:19,013
She was physically abused.

23
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,013
Petition to the government
against kidnapping laws

24
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:23,068
that do not prosecute kidnappers.

25
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:25,363
There is still no conclusion.

26
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:43,241
I get how you’re feeling, babe.

27
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:46,382
But I didn't think
Zouey meant it, you know?

28
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:50,494
Please don't hold it against him.

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,916
I know.

30
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,228
He's not wrong either.

31
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,900
I almost lost my mind losing you, Soong.

32
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,090
And took it on everyone.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,715
Damn.

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,340
I hate myself.

35
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:15,015
I won't leave you again.

36
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:17,429
Let's get through it together.

37
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,273
I know you will make things right.

38
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,132
Let me kiss away your pain.

39
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,152
All good.

40
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:34,128
You're well now.

41
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,887
You and Nont are the best.

42
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:24,442
Even when Nant was around.

43
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:27,520
You guys are the main characters.

44
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,372
First and I just play supporting roles
in your story.

45
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,365
Are you okay, friend?

46
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:38,861
What?

47
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:41,017
Did I say something wrong?

48
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:46,673
You called me a friend

49
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,525
when you weren't pretending to be Nant.

50
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:57,990
You are the closest to a friend to me.

51
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:01,669
Ever since Nant passed away,

52
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:03,743
you've been the only one

53
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:05,186
who have worried about me

54
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:06,897
and cared about me.

55
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:09,733
Prom

56
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:11,835
only cares about his innocence.

57
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,369
You said you went through
something similar to Porche.

58
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,557
You're not talking about Teena, right?

59
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:34,033
No one is in the boss' room
and the fire exit.

60
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,331
I was told that they took the elevator.

61
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:40,167
Follow them.

62
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,221
The fire exit.

63
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,100
"Playboyy"

64
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,293
(Episode 12:
The path you shouldn't take)

65
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:49,448
You're going to investigate
at Harvey Hotel later, right?

66
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:50,768
Yes.

67
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:52,503
I hope it won't be a dead end again.

68
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:55,518
And...

69
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:57,487
What about us?

70
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,487
Can you forgive me?

71
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,478
Thank you for helping me.

72
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,955
I only have a few days left.

73
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,658
In the meantime,

74
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:42,272
let's make the most out of it.

75
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,100
You were a beast.

76
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,507
Are you that upset with your friends?

77
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,671
All they do is cause trouble.

78
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:17,819
When they're mad,
they take it out on others.

79
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:20,746
Have you never taken it out

80
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:22,524
on someone?

81
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:57,970
I'm sorry

82
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:00,298
for taking it out on you.

83
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:07,066
You don't have to apologize.

84
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,223
I actually enjoyed it.

85
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,801
Zouey,

86
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:13,387
you are more daring,

87
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:14,643
more talented,

88
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,048
and much cuter.

89
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:44,469
So love me a lot.

90
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:10,760
I will attend his funeral

91
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,841
by tomorrow night.

92
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:15,649
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:26,524
Oh...

94
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,183
And one more thing.

95
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,526
As for the boys at Playboyy lounge,

96
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,428
keep an eye on them.

97
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,913
So what happened
on the night of 11th June?

98
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,178
Who took my brother away?

99
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,850
Tell us everything.

100
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:31,296
You know we're serious.

101
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:33,725
What we did was torturing, wasn't it?

102
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:35,999
So?

103
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:38,455
Do you want to suffocate and die?

104
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:39,676
Auntie!

105
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,917
Kill me because I won't talk.

106
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,073
Fine.

107
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:48,745
You made a choice.

108
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:51,826
Zouey.

109
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:53,797
Time to be extreme.

110
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,889
- Take that.
- Hey!

111
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:09,546
Start talking.

112
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,921
- Auntie.
- Hey.

113
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:12,272
- It's ticklish.
- Talk.

114
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:15,069
- Talk now.
- Okay.

115
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,722
Someone was really
looking for him that day.

116
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:21,933
Who?

117
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,246
Do you remember his face?

118
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:27,066
I don't.

119
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,131
But I have a clip.

120
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:47,814
Stop staring.

121
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,431
Untie me first.

122
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:52,376
- I'll show you the clip.
- I'm sorry.

123
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:53,486
Zouey, hurry up.

124
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:56,217
Hurry.

125
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:12,567
During that time,

126
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:17,317
I was pretending to watch series
and had my earphones in.

127
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:19,434
But in reality,

128
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,145
I secretly took a video

129
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:22,505
of hot clients.

130
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:23,965
I always did.

131
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:25,426
Oh, dear.

132
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:26,981
Why wouldn't I?

133
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,434
Sometimes celebrities show up.

134
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:32,121
Clips of them going into the room

135
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,254
can be sold for a lot of money.

136
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,922
That boy seemed weird.

137
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:40,742
So I thought

138
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:43,125
his girlfriend was following him.

139
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:47,539
But it turned out that the follower

140
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:50,667
wasn't his girlfriend,

141
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:57,042
but his boyfriend.

142
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:03,528
I didn't want him to have any problem
with his partner.

143
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:04,718
Have you seen this guy?

144
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:06,515
So I told him.

145
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:07,775
I don't know.

146
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,057
Hundreds of people come here a day.

147
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:11,268
I don't remember.

148
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:18,666
Well...

149
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:21,871
A mosquito bit me.

150
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:24,794
Oh.

151
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:26,325
I know this guy.

152
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:28,559
He's upstairs.

153
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,106
I think he's still in his room.

154
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:42,726
Hurry up.

155
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,202
Leave. Hurry.

156
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:45,779
- Take your things and go.
- Thank you.

157
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:47,154
That was close.

158
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,607
Leave!

159
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:00,298
Can you leave now?

160
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,439
Don't tie me up again.

161
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:05,516
I could have died from a heart attack.

162
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:21,227
So what now? This must involve Aob.

163
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,118
Yeah.

164
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,371
Did you see the beginning of the clip?

165
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,605
Who was Nant on the phone with?

166
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,480
His real phone was hidden at home.

167
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:35,418
If he hadn't hidden it then,

168
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,824
he would have to go back and hide it.

169
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:40,311
If that's the case,

170
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:42,069
your friend must know.

171
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:45,811
But he was carrying his laptop bag.

172
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,561
We know that it would go missing
around Teena's dorm.

173
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:51,983
The opposite of his dorm

174
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,060
- is where...
- Nuth lives.

175
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:58,763
Why do you think it's Nuth?

176
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:05,177
Why did he call

177
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:07,448
when he was the one who sent the clip?

178
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:16,299
Even the brilliant Conan
had The Junior Detective League.

179
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:19,429
Go make up with your friends.

180
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:21,833
We need them.

181
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,049
All I knew was
that Aob worked for Daddy.

182
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:11,073
I didn't know he was involved
in looking for Nant at Harvey Hotel.

183
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,748
It's getting more complicated now.

184
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:19,662
Yeah.

185
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:22,716
I hope we're on
the right path this time.

186
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:26,099
So we don't have to
go around in circles.

187
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:01,805
A fruity scent

188
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:04,399
makes me hungry.

189
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:11,195
Give Me Twice.

190
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:17,570
Let's do it twice as the name suggests.

191
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:41,508
Fine.

192
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:44,021
I feel bad that you feel bad

193
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:46,592
that I feel bad
about what you said to me

194
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,553
and what I said to you at Playboyy.

195
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:50,576
I'm sorry, friends.

196
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,240
I'm sorry?

197
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:59,321
But your apology doesn't seem
geniune to me.

198
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:02,430
I'm mad at you that you got mad at me
for being mad at Puen.

199
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:04,235
If you have a problem
that we have a problem,

200
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:08,258
that means the problem is
you don't think our feelings are valid.

201
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:11,864
Fine.

202
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:13,918
Now I know that I didn't think

203
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:17,223
that you would think
about me thinking about your feelings.

204
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:21,309
From now on, I'll care more
about your feelings.

205
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:24,296
Please let me stand up.

206
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,296
- Please.
- I'll get to the point.

207
00:25:26,882 --> 00:25:29,296
Did Nant not call you on his birthday?

208
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:32,898
Yeah.

209
00:25:33,947 --> 00:25:36,228
That's why we're so confused
about him going missing.

210
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:39,818
Like I said, he called Nuth.

211
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:43,693
We should ask him.

212
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:48,154
But now,

213
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:50,454
I can't get up to investigate

214
00:25:50,972 --> 00:25:52,659
until First and Captain...

215
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:53,753
- Don't get up, idiot.
- Don't get up, idiot.

216
00:26:04,805 --> 00:26:05,547
Hey.

217
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:08,039
Can you not go?

218
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:10,242
Are you that mad at me?

219
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:12,867
I'm sorry.

220
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:14,164
Let's make up.

221
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:16,508
So we can keep investigating.

222
00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:18,841
See?

223
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:21,263
You're trying to make up to me.

224
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:23,723
But you won't stop begging me
to help you.

225
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:26,325
You and Nont

226
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:27,786
are unbelievable.

227
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:47,042
Are you stressed about Keen?

228
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:50,346
You can still meet him
even though he's not on the team.

229
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:52,799
Yeah.

230
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,678
But Puen got him expelled
when he did nothing wrong.

231
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,913
Calm down.

232
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:01,046
You don't even know for sure
that Puen did it.

233
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:27,633
Damn it.

234
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:30,548
Why can't we see Captain's face?

235
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:32,477
Yeah.

236
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,118
So both of them will get expelled.

237
00:27:35,643 --> 00:27:36,221
Damn it.

238
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,190
Who knew?

239
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:40,088
Puen too.

240
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:42,260
They sleep with each other.

241
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,619
All three of them.

242
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:45,049
It's terrible.

243
00:27:45,924 --> 00:27:46,573
Shit.

244
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:48,713
I was showering beside him.

245
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,721
Did he record me to jerk off to later?

246
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:52,258
Yeah.

247
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,703
- He must have.
- We don't sleep around.

248
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,516
You think you're cool, huh?

249
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,250
You dare talk back to us?

250
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,633
What you did was wrong.

251
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,269
I know you didn't like him,
but did you have to get him expelled?

252
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:09,678
We're still keeping you around

253
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:12,576
because we think you're still tame.

254
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:16,061
If you don't want to be expelled,

255
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:17,670
you must help me.

256
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:19,914
You're close to Captain.

257
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,297
Get a clip that shows his face clearly.

258
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:26,469
Otherwise, you'll be exposed too.

259
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:28,344
You're on a scholarship.

260
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:31,242
If you get expelled,
you'll have to return the tuition fee.

261
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,758
But I'm guessing

262
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,862
that you won't be able to do that.

263
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:39,956
Right?

264
00:28:57,076 --> 00:28:58,849
How can I sleep with the former coach?

265
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:04,055
He was fired.

266
00:29:05,337 --> 00:29:06,680
The evidence is clear,

267
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:08,704
how will you deny it?

268
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:23,054
What the hell were you thinking?

269
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:26,852
If you want to have sex with someone,

270
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:28,738
it's fine.

271
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:32,539
But it must not be
at our prestigious school.

272
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:34,578
Prestigious?

273
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:36,375
Who sent the clip to you?

274
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:40,391
The one who secretly took it
should be the one who's guilty.

275
00:29:45,547 --> 00:29:46,719
Sign the resignation form.

276
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:50,898
Pack your things and leave by tomorrow.

277
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:14,365
Do you think a student
who's a prostitute

278
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:17,256
should continue studying
in our prestigious school?

279
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,308
Fuck.

280
00:32:40,652 --> 00:32:42,066
- Fuck you.
- What's up with you?

281
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:43,472
Damn it.

282
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,308
Come at me.

283
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:01,092
Take that.

284
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:04,627
Take that.

285
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:10,317
What's the matter with you?

286
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:12,239
Why did you tell the professor?

287
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:13,739
You took a video of me.

288
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,364
You got me expelled first.

289
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:16,793
I didn't do it, asshole.

290
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:18,817
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

291
00:33:20,953 --> 00:33:22,296
Fuck you.

292
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:29,570
That's enough.

293
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:32,774
- Fuck you.
- That's enough.

294
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:33,658
Damn it.

295
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:52,258
If I were to have a boyfriend,

296
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:54,968
he would be someone like you.

297
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:58,156
That's why I don't want a boyfriend.

298
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:02,893
Look at you.

299
00:34:03,487 --> 00:34:04,784
How many times have I taken care of you?

300
00:34:06,104 --> 00:34:07,221
You're always in trouble.

301
00:34:08,073 --> 00:34:09,463
He came at me first.

302
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:11,362
I didn't want to get in trouble.

303
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,263
I was expelled in the end.

304
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,474
Please bear with me a while longer.

305
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:25,068
I'll move out as soon
as I find a place to stay.

306
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,861
You can stay as long as you want.

307
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:31,376
Do you think you can be with me?

308
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:34,978
Let me warn you
that being with me is dangerous.

309
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:36,704
Dangerous how?

310
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,025
You sound like you're a hitman

311
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,026
or a mafia's right-hand man.

312
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:47,838
If you live with me,

313
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:49,823
you'll run out of bullets.

314
00:35:15,568 --> 00:35:16,397
I'm hungry.

315
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,265
Go get me some chicken noodles.

316
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:23,993
I won't let you live with me rent free.

317
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:26,243
Go.

318
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:52,794
Hello.

319
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:54,270
What the hell are you doing?

320
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:55,880
Where are you?

321
00:36:56,627 --> 00:36:57,916
You weren't at your place.

322
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:00,119
I'm visiting my mother in Rangsit.

323
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,681
Good, I'll be around there later.

324
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,158
Come meet me.

325
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:07,900
I've sent you the location.

326
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:22,338
Are you scared?

327
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,138
He's like a brother to me.
He won't hurt me.

328
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:27,349
How can you be so sure?

329
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,286
He works for Daddy.

330
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:31,278
What if he betrays you, Jump?

331
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,117
Then I won't be returning.

332
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,178
Puen, why did you follow me?

333
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:46,306
So?

334
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:48,509
This is your dangerous life?

335
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,868
- What are you doing here?
- This isn't the time. Leave.

336
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,017
I won't.

337
00:38:54,149 --> 00:38:56,546
I deserve to know who you are
and what you do.

338
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:00,124
So?

339
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:02,406
You told me you were going out to eat.

340
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:04,843
But you left to kill someone.

341
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:12,027
Jump, calm down.

342
00:39:12,214 --> 00:39:13,105
If you don't want to die,

343
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:15,081
stop talking.

344
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:29,698
Hey!

345
00:39:38,151 --> 00:39:39,370
Let go of me, asshole!

346
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:41,401
Why did you tie me up?

347
00:39:42,065 --> 00:39:42,893
Let go!

348
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:45,026
Why did you tie me up?

349
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:46,612
Let go, asshole!

350
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:48,784
Let go of me!

351
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:49,763
I said...

352
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:53,092
Don't shout.

353
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:55,560
Talk when I tell you to talk.

354
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:12,557
Your boss sent you to kill my brother.

355
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,057
Weren't you surprised

356
00:40:15,603 --> 00:40:16,783
when you saw me at Playboyy?

357
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:17,755
Huh?

358
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:18,911
Talk!

359
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,630
I don't remember
the names of people I've killed.

360
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:33,204
Let go of Puen.

361
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,672
He isn't involved.

362
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:39,555
Thank you for making everything easier.

363
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:41,297
You love him, don't you?

364
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:44,816
I remember

365
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:48,988
that when I threw a tantrum at Playboyy

366
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:52,293
and you got hurt,
he was so worried about you.

367
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:55,347
So...

368
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:57,053
Tell me everything.

369
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,178
Why did Jason Lee order you
to kill my brother?

370
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,397
What did you do to him?

371
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:04,139
If you don't start talking,

372
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,233
this asshole will die.

373
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,467
So, Puen?

374
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,155
You were tortured in front of him.

375
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:34,241
But he wouldn't come and help you.

376
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:38,181
You still hope he'll love
and take care of you?

377
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:42,306
I don't know anything.

378
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,048
I don't love him.

379
00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:53,075
Okay, fine.

380
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:57,278
Then find someone who knows.

381
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:06,948
Damn it. Stay still.

382
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,049
Talk.

383
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:15,998
Don't play games.

384
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:19,889
The faster this ends,
the faster Puen is free.

385
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:28,382
Okay.

386
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:39,507
Shit.

387
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:44,390
Hurry up.

388
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,030
Your time is running out.

389
00:42:50,466 --> 00:42:52,122
Okay, fine.

390
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:53,592
Okay.

391
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:04,499
Hello.

392
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:30,313
Hey.

393
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,201
The house is much emptier.

394
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:56,842
So many people used to live here.

395
00:43:58,766 --> 00:43:59,774
Where did they all go?

396
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:04,821
Nont didn't tell me where he went.

397
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:07,782
Porche has been quite lately.

398
00:44:09,368 --> 00:44:10,657
Captain hasn't replied to my texts.

399
00:44:13,832 --> 00:44:14,871
Gosh!

400
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:16,683
What the heck is going on?

401
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:18,980
Calm down, babe.

402
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,527
We all need our own space, don't we?

403
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,194
Without you,

404
00:44:29,842 --> 00:44:31,233
I would be all alone.

405
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:47,335
Hello.

406
00:45:01,011 --> 00:45:01,683
What is it?

407
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:03,441
What's wrong?

408
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,941
What happened?

409
00:45:05,425 --> 00:45:06,050
Something's off.

410
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,287
I'll be back. I'm sorry.

411
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:09,474
I'm sorry.

412
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:38,237
I already told Zouey

413
00:45:38,722 --> 00:45:39,941
that Nant never called me.

414
00:45:40,214 --> 00:45:42,542
I believe you.
I told Soong, Teena, and Jump to come.

415
00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:44,034
I want you to help me.

416
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,472
Did you bring it?

417
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:56,384
Okay.

418
00:45:58,918 --> 00:45:59,926
He owed me money

419
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:01,564
because he lost my drugs.

420
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:03,587
Say something I don't know.

421
00:46:04,986 --> 00:46:05,587
And he...

422
00:46:06,252 --> 00:46:07,204
He threw away the drugs.

423
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:08,369
Those drugs

424
00:46:08,837 --> 00:46:09,744
belonged to Mr. Lee.

425
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:11,319
I already know that.

426
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,805
Stop stalling, asshole!

427
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:15,587
Did you kidnap my brother?

428
00:46:15,845 --> 00:46:17,150
- Aob.
- Shit.

429
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:18,439
- What happened?
- Shit.

430
00:46:18,627 --> 00:46:19,619
Let go!

431
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:21,080
Shit.

432
00:46:21,408 --> 00:46:22,736
Don't you think
you're taking this too far?

433
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:23,947
Stop.

434
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:25,947
- Stop.
- Shit.

435
00:46:25,972 --> 00:46:27,099
- Stop.
- Hey.

436
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,263
- Hey.
- Huh?

437
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:30,607
- Stop.
- Shit.

438
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:32,217
- Stop.
- What?

439
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:33,420
Sit down!

440
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:34,240
No.

441
00:46:34,396 --> 00:46:35,724
I said sit down.

442
00:46:36,646 --> 00:46:37,998
I said sit down!

443
00:46:38,782 --> 00:46:40,180
I'll kill you.

444
00:46:40,712 --> 00:46:41,422
Hey.

445
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:43,063
I'll kill you.

446
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:19,678
Don't lecture me.

447
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:22,811
I'm not that kind of person.

448
00:47:27,413 --> 00:47:28,671
You have an issue
with this prostitute, right?

449
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:31,386
My suspect is probably dating him.

450
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:34,553
I plan to torture him to get the truth.

451
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:36,155
I need your help.

452
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:39,975
Torture him?

453
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:41,944
Not seriously.

454
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,733
If the suspect sees Puen in pain,
he'll confess.

455
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,001
We'll back off when things get serious.

456
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:48,408
Deal?

457
00:47:53,228 --> 00:47:53,954
If you agree,

458
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:56,884
I'll ask my father
to get you on the national team.

459
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,645
What about Zouey, First, Porche?

460
00:48:06,457 --> 00:48:07,379
They are good guys.

461
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:10,270
Bad people like us
must take care of this on our own.

462
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,320
What the hell is this, Nont?

463
00:48:19,992 --> 00:48:21,492
I thought we would back off
when things get serious.

464
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:24,785
I know I'm bad, but I'm not a killer.

465
00:48:26,957 --> 00:48:28,223
- Shit.
- They are not my people.

466
00:48:58,759 --> 00:48:59,587
You guys are not involved.

467
00:48:59,962 --> 00:49:00,752
Get out.

468
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:02,587
Otherwise, you're next.

469
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:14,053
Aob!

470
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,525
The boss told you to kill Jump.

471
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:18,375
But you weren't capable.

472
00:49:20,245 --> 00:49:22,776
- I will kill you instead.
- Hey.

473
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:24,026
Calm down.

474
00:49:24,612 --> 00:49:26,299
Let's do something fun.

475
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:28,776
You two

476
00:49:29,722 --> 00:49:30,925
have sex with him

477
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:34,831
as his punishment
for fucking Mr. Porche.

478
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:37,292
Hurry up!

479
00:49:37,317 --> 00:49:38,917
- Hurry.
- Now!

480
00:49:41,182 --> 00:49:41,909
Come on.

481
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:44,237
Hurry up!

482
00:50:00,641 --> 00:50:01,524
First.

483
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:03,586
Are you not mad at me anymore?

484
00:50:04,118 --> 00:50:04,844
Not yet.

485
00:50:05,453 --> 00:50:08,172
But I can't reach Soong. He went out.

486
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:19,504
Teena too.

487
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,254
Nont and Captain aren't home.

488
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:24,201
Shit.

489
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:25,901
I'm so fucking lonely.

490
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,029
You seem strange.

491
00:50:31,974 --> 00:50:33,005
Are you just lonely?

492
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:36,466
You seem mad and stressed
about something.

493
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:56,817
(Soong's heart rate is over 130 BPM)

494
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:58,106
Fuck you, Soong.

495
00:50:59,168 --> 00:51:01,418
Come on, Zouey.
Let's go get him with me.

496
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:04,785
His heart rate is as high as
when he's having sex with me.

497
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,706
He must be secretly
fucking someone else.

498
00:51:07,072 --> 00:51:08,041
Let's go.

499
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:10,408
Fuck you, Soong. I'll kill you.

500
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:23,653
- Hey.
- Shit.

501
00:51:25,638 --> 00:51:27,817
What in a fucking Serbian film
is this shit?

502
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:32,692
That's why you didn't ask me to come.

503
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:35,320
Did you have to go this far
to get information?

504
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:40,211
We have to run.

505
00:51:40,236 --> 00:51:41,257
- Shit.
- Come on.

506
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,781
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

507
00:51:42,906 --> 00:51:44,898
- Shit.
- Fuck this.

508
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:46,904
Follow them.

509
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:52,771
Puen.

510
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:53,904
Puen!

511
00:51:55,427 --> 00:51:56,333
Puen!

512
00:51:57,279 --> 00:51:57,958
Puen.

513
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,891
Puen.

514
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,443
Puen.

515
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:06,029
Puen.

516
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:55,341
(Next Episode)
Ever since I showed up,

517
00:54:56,091 --> 00:54:57,583
I've put you guys in trouble.

518
00:54:58,021 --> 00:54:59,544
Someone will be dead today.

519
00:54:59,771 --> 00:55:01,396
That person might be Teena

520
00:55:01,787 --> 00:55:03,052
or my friend.

521
00:55:04,141 --> 00:55:05,141
I saw the clip.

522
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:07,571
Why didn't you tell me?

523
00:55:08,883 --> 00:55:10,727
I want the traitor,

524
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:13,610
the guy who slept with my son,

525
00:55:14,347 --> 00:55:15,743
and the guy who dyed his hair

526
00:55:16,235 --> 00:55:19,453
by breakfast tomorrow!
