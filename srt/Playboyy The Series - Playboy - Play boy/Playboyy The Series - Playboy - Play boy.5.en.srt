1
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:16,774
(Previously)
Are we shooting porn?

2
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,433
Why do you think they're Nuthyim91?

3
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:21,808
I don't know if they are,
but your brother is a drug addict.

4
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:24,824
- Maybe...
- One of them sold drugs to him.

5
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:27,694
What are you going to do?

6
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,795
I'll do anything to find out the truth.

7
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:34,970
I'm not Nant.

8
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:37,283
I'm his twin brother.

9
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:38,423
Nont.

10
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,237
Arrested.

11
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:43,190
An evil mother forced her daughter
to become a prostitute for cash.

12
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:45,612
A creative artist committed suicide
because of his 20-million baht debt.

13
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,910
A big brother borrowed money
from his friends to take care

14
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:50,636
of his little brother,
who's a drug addict.

15
00:00:51,027 --> 00:00:52,199
He then drowned himself.

16
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,545
What is it, Nont?

17
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:59,913
Where the hell have you been?
You didn't respond to my texts.

18
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:01,250
Are you dating someone?

19
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:02,946
Of course not.

20
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:05,102
I was busy taking Mom to the hospital.

21
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:07,258
She tried to commit suicide again, Nont.

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,480
Nant.

23
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:11,550
If you're tired,

24
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:13,972
come live with me for awhile.

25
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:23,428
That was the last time I talked to him.

26
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:27,834
On the 11th of June. Our birthdays.

27
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:30,956
He texted me
that he was catching a flight.

28
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:33,823
But he didn't show up.

29
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:37,575
Yeah.

30
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:40,231
That's why I'm certain he's missing.

31
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:44,635
Nant.

32
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:46,549
He said that we're his family.

33
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,321
But look what you guys did to him.

34
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:08,406
Tell me everything.

35
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,839
What did you do to him?

36
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:19,343
It started a few months ago

37
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,366
when he had to perform for his mid-term.

38
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:25,528
"Desire under the Elms."

39
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,826
(I don't understand the character)

40
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,397
(Bye A-Acting!)

41
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:36,757
(I told you to stop being a pussy
and get life experience)

42
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,179
(How? I don't know
how to hit on someone)

43
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:39,734
(Hit on someone? Just use the internet)

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,961
(Go to this website)

45
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:57,573
I introduced him to that website.

46
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,848
So he met up with a stranger.

47
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:02,231
(Do you want to meet?)

48
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:25,610
That's when

49
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:27,696
Nant told us,

50
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:30,802
"My mother is very sick."

51
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,372
Can I borrow your money?

52
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,528
Maybe 100,000 baht?

53
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:37,627
I'll slowly pay you back.

54
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,248
It was a lot of money.

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,404
Who would lend it to a friend?

56
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:49,578
So I declined.

57
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:56,903
I'm really sorry.

58
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,840
My father would scold me.
I don't have the cash.

59
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,726
So Nant went to my brother.

60
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:06,624
Nant slept with him for cash.

61
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:08,624
Once I found out,

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,468
I told him to stop seeing my brother.

63
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,810
I threatened him

64
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:16,224
to kick him out of this house.

65
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:18,610
After that, he asked me
to talk to Porche.

66
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,110
But I didn't want to get involved.

67
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:26,316
- So I told him...
- You gave him no choice.

68
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:30,191
So he had to take videos

69
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,613
and sold them to you, Captain.

70
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:38,303
(If I go harder,
are you going to pay more?)

71
00:04:41,926 --> 00:04:43,497
If I go harder,
are you going to pay more?

72
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:46,184
So he had to sleep with strangers.

73
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,199
The last clip he took...

74
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:01,069
A guy was wearing a dog mask
and hurting my brother.

75
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:05,006
Who the hell is he?

76
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,072
Nant was involved
with three sex workers at Playboyy

77
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:32,506
and Nuthyim91.

78
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,623
I still don't know who he is.

79
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:42,430
One of them made him a drug addict
and had debts.

80
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:52,258
Those three guys

81
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:55,251
are your crush,

82
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:00,668
your pizza delivery boy,

83
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:03,253
and your employee at the car wash shop.

84
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:13,307
From now on,

85
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,383
you guys must help me find Nant,

86
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,164
who calls you family.

87
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:27,878
God damn.

88
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:30,857
What in the thriller-fantasy hell
is this shit?

89
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:07,866
(Playboyy the Series)

90
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:11,378
(Episode 5: Bought with cash)

91
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,260
- But I rejected.
- Shut up.

92
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,713
Sex is so important to you, huh?

93
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,333
You're using sex as an excuse

94
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:30,904
not to date me.

95
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:00,680
I want to punch you like this sticker.

96
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,708
Come on.

97
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:06,559
Don't be so mean.

98
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:09,834
Don't you see
that I only want to date you?

99
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,900
I've ended things with everyone.

100
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:22,528
Are you sure you have no other secrets?

101
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,989
Besides working at Playboyy,
were you working somewhere else?

102
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:28,993
I don't have any more secrets.

103
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,813
I swear.

104
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:33,837
I'll tell you everything from now on.

105
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:35,705
We no longer have secrets.

106
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,273
You've passed the first stage.

107
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,695
But you have
so many more stages to go.

108
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:18,687
Good luck.

109
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,719
Your friend has the right to be mad.

110
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:16,805
You shouldn't have posted the clip.

111
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,848
He allowed me to take the clip.

112
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,741
I posted it to a closed group.
How is that bad?

113
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:25,693
He allowed you to take the clip,
but he didn't give you consent to share.

114
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:28,060
It caused him damage.

115
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,915
He and his crush had a fight.

116
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,988
Why was his crush
a part of the closed group?

117
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:37,617
I didn't sell the clip online.

118
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:41,492
Zouey is a baby.
I told him that I deleted it.

119
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:48,073
The problem is you think too little.

120
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,812
Zouey could have you arrested.

121
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,116
I know the clip was just for fun.

122
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:01,187
- But you can't do that to him.
- Do you know what your problem is?

123
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:09,540
You're too good, Puen.

124
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:10,799
Honestly.

125
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:13,489
Have you never done anything
illegal or wrong in your life?

126
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,294
I'm just trying to warn you.

127
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,603
If you don't want to listen,
it's up to you.

128
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:27,423
Where are you going?

129
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,010
Your dorm is that way.

130
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:30,768
Puen.

131
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:51,752
Ouch.

132
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:53,589
What the hell is wrong with you?

133
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:00,165
I'm sorry, boss.

134
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,337
We've been doing this for hours.

135
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:04,860
I just want to finish.

136
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,634
I have feelings too.

137
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,778
Don't you understand
why you have to do this?

138
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:11,231
I'm sorry, boss.

139
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:14,005
It's because I never told you
that I worked there.

140
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,047
But you never asked.

141
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,726
Shut up and make me come.

142
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:25,719
(Name Mr.Jason Lee)

143
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:30,310
This isn't your car?

144
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:32,483
It's my dad's, why?

145
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:42,412
Are you mixed?

146
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:44,474
Is he your stepfather?

147
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:47,271
You are my slave. Just do what I say.

148
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,826
I bought you with cash.

149
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,739
You are my servant,
so just act your part.

150
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:52,716
Hey.

151
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:53,841
That's too harsh.

152
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,380
- It was just a question.
- Shut up.

153
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:57,707
Don't butt in.

154
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,203
What did you say?

155
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:19,468
Huh?

156
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,362
Wonder Pizza said that he resigned.

157
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,042
Shit.

158
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:28,159
We came all the way to his place,

159
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,406
but he's not here.

160
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,258
What should we do now?

161
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:38,250
We must find out
if he made Nant a drug addict.

162
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:40,391
Does Nant owe him money?

163
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,784
My guy doesn't know where he went.

164
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:48,214
Do you know anyone else who knows Soong?

165
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,159
Be ready to work.

166
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:24,717
Time to work, Puen.

167
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:06,714
Hello.

168
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:08,675
Who are you interested in?

169
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,347
Aob

170
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:15,725
is a legend here.

171
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,826
He gives great massages.

172
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:20,052
This guy.

173
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,295
He's new.

174
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:22,876
He's becoming popular.

175
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,618
- But he...
- I'm not interested in anyone.

176
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,212
So what the hell are you doing here?

177
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:33,265
I'm here to see you.

178
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,233
Do you have some time?

179
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:37,366
I want to ask you about Soong.

180
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,673
I need to go get ready.

181
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:23,659
Are you Puen?

182
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:25,306
Yes.

183
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:27,345
You're quite hot.

184
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:30,235
You just went on a break
and someone's calling for you again.

185
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:33,927
Time to work.

186
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,763
Hey.

187
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,255
Come find me when you're done.

188
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:43,989
I want to know why you're so popular.

189
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,239
He was flirting with clients,
so he got complaints.

190
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,653
He's now a rider at OK Rider.

191
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,351
OK Rider?

192
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:19,773
Yeah.

193
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:21,976
They call it the XX Rider.

194
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:24,807
It shows the rider's location,

195
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,229
name, and face.

196
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,776
They can make a deal.

197
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,112
Damn it.

198
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,846
You seemed like you wanted service here.

199
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,385
I do.

200
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:49,388
Make me forget about Soong.

201
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:53,661
Who would you recommend?

202
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:55,846
I want someone hardcore.

203
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:12,851
The boss sent me
to evaluate your performance.

204
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,269
Go ahead.

205
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,777
If I was a client,

206
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,605
what would you do to me?

207
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:47,711
Look at the client.

208
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,343
Make him want you.

209
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,070
Try it.

210
00:20:58,503 --> 00:20:59,596
Sir.

211
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,018
Is there anywhere
you would like me to focus on?

212
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:04,779
My head.

213
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:06,951
Every head.

214
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:30,813
You're not that great, Puen.

215
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:40,933
May I?

216
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:54,710
May I?

217
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:57,421
I think

218
00:21:57,906 --> 00:21:59,242
it's making you uncomfortable.

219
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:00,976
Please.

220
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:39,206
What is it?

221
00:22:39,636 --> 00:22:41,315
We just had a shower.
Don't you want a massage?

222
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:53,806
Is that how you usually
treat your clients?

223
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,142
Yeah, don't you like it?

224
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,149
Let me know where I can improve.

225
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:10,267
Everything.

226
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:16,574
We can't just lay there
and let the clients do everything.

227
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:19,316
I knew it.

228
00:23:19,907 --> 00:23:22,493
You're not that great.

229
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:25,063
You're awkward

230
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,266
and you attract clients
who want to try new things.

231
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:30,234
Once they are bored,

232
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,503
they'll dump you.

233
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:34,097
What should I do?

234
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,706
No one taught me.

235
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:38,690
Why don't you teach me?

236
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,873
I want to be like you.

237
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:49,401
I'm sorry.

238
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,151
I'm not a teacher.

239
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:52,948
I'm a prostitute.

240
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:57,467
Oh.

241
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:00,092
Don't be like me.

242
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:04,712
Because you can never be.

243
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,306
Loser.

244
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:38,998
Your tip was too much.
You need a friend to accompany you, huh?

245
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:43,526
Are you sure
you want to drink beer here?

246
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,567
Shit.

247
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:29,129
What the hell are you doing?

248
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,137
- Fuck.
- Murder, robbery,

249
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:34,098
and kidnapping

250
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:36,460
are on the news.

251
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:39,835
But you don't care.

252
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:44,573
That's not true.

253
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:47,080
Why are you here?

254
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:49,182
Who are you?

255
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,669
You are aware.

256
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,958
Yes, I'm not Nant.

257
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:02,313
Tell me

258
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:04,978
how you met Nant.

259
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:06,952
What's the relationship?

260
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:09,952
What did you do to him?

261
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:14,108
If you don't tell me,

262
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:24,880
I'll let you choose

263
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:27,838
if you want to be cooked
medium rare or well done.

264
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:29,197
Fuck you.

265
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:33,634
What the hell are you doing?

266
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,668
What the fuck?

267
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,528
It's hot.

268
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,937
What the hell are you doing?

269
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,164
Let me go.

270
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,557
Let me go!

271
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:47,823
What the fuck are you doing?

272
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:17,342
You were drunk in front of my dorm.

273
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,373
I helped and got you here.

274
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,431
You used all my drugs.

275
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,095
How do you want me to be responsible?

276
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,408
How can I believe you?

277
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,324
- Did you drug and rob me?
- Hey.

278
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:32,285
How could you say that?

279
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,809
This is entirely your fault.

280
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:37,192
Pay me.

281
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,216
Pay me.

282
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:41,940
You used all my drugs.

283
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,007
Is that difficult?

284
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:44,662
- Soong.
- You used all my drugs.

285
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:45,741
- Hey.
- Soong.

286
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:47,499
- What the fuck?
- Hey.

287
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:48,593
Soong.

288
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:49,323
You.

289
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:51,055
- Fuck you.
- Calm down.

290
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:52,625
- Calm down, Soong.
- Shit.

291
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,523
- Soong.
- Fuck you.

292
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:54,531
- Calm down.
- Hey.

293
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:56,696
Damn it.

294
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:58,384
- I'll kill you.
- Calm down.

295
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:04,883
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

296
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,089
Did you rape my brother?

297
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:16,073
He was too drunk to give you consent.

298
00:28:16,972 --> 00:28:19,620
Even if he asked for it,
you should have self-restraint.

299
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,464
You.

300
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:23,464
Did.

301
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:24,332
Not.

302
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,286
Did you take a video?

303
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:47,411
I swear I never.

304
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:49,953
I slept with him a few times. That's it.

305
00:28:50,553 --> 00:28:51,443
Damn it.

306
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:52,795
Where is he?

307
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:54,334
I don't know.

308
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:56,209
I swear.

309
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,528
He paid me back after a few days.

310
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:03,458
After that, he was the one
who provided us the drugs.

311
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,172
If he didn't get drugs from you,

312
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:10,555
- where did he get them from?
- Damn it.

313
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:13,890
Your brother was a drug addict
before he met us.

314
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,106
Shit.

315
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:20,160
He probably brought the drugs
from the guy he was hooking up with.

316
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,895
His name was...

317
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Nat?

318
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,804
Nuth? Something like that.

319
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:55,832
Nuth.

320
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,839
What is there to film?

321
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:04,189
There's a cute guy sitting here.

322
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:06,111
High on something.

323
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,220
How can I not film?

324
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:13,939
What did you want to ask me?

325
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:18,192
Oh.

326
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:22,699
Did you know
that we can't lick our elbow?

327
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,163
What do you mean?

328
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:36,392
- Try licking it.
- No.

329
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,252
Do it. I won't.

330
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:41,745
- If I do it, you must do it too.
- No, it's disgusting.

331
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,488
Come on.

332
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,683
Read the script.

333
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:55,060
If you do well, I'll give you drugs.

334
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:07,266
Five hundred

335
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:08,532
twenty

336
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:09,813
five thousand

337
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:11,751
and six hundred minutes in a year.

338
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:15,253
How do you spend those minutes?

339
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:17,019
I...

340
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,285
I spend the time
thinking about my loved ones.

341
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:30,224
You should go back to porn.

342
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:32,443
Don't let me say anything.

343
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:37,175
Porn doesn't win awards.

344
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:39,098
Why?

345
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,215
Are you saying that porn has no value?

346
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:44,653
Everyone likes porn.

347
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:47,279
For porn to win an award...

348
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:49,092
Well...

349
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,522
You must be someone famous

350
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:52,420
or someone with a name.

351
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:54,269
People will think it's art.

352
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,113
But for someone like us,

353
00:31:57,886 --> 00:31:59,003
it's obscene.

354
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,446
It doesn't matter what we create.

355
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:04,164
What matters is the creator.

356
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,219
That's hard.

357
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:22,602
I don't get it.

358
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,758
I just know that I need to go to work.

359
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:42,554
Come on. Let's take a shower.

360
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,403
Do you know

361
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,574
that ever since I've started working,

362
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,606
you have been the best client.

363
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:45,368
Even though I don't have cash for you?

364
00:33:47,188 --> 00:33:48,313
Yeah.

365
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:50,782
Money isn't the only thing
that can buy me.

366
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:52,403
But you can be bought
with drugs, right?

367
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,460
I don't want you to go.

368
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:09,730
I have to go.

369
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:11,410
I need to make a living.

370
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:43,742
But before I go,

371
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,383
shave me there.

372
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:52,643
Can I kiss it too?

373
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:19,148
I don't want you to go.

374
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:20,875
I don't want you to go anywhere.

375
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:32,389
I'm sorry.

376
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:34,139
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

377
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:35,233
What the hell is this?

378
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:37,575
He's been on his knees since morning.

379
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:41,559
He won't get up
until Zouey forgives him about the clip.

380
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:45,848
Come on. Just let it go.

381
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:47,604
You and your guy are back together.

382
00:35:48,737 --> 00:35:49,487
You're right.

383
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,128
But what if my parents see it?

384
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,542
You can join my closed group.

385
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:55,151
Right?

386
00:35:57,093 --> 00:35:59,070
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

387
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:01,016
I'm sorry.

388
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:04,352
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

389
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:06,196
Did you find anything, Nant?

390
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:07,460
Sorry.

391
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:08,902
Nont.

392
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:13,624
He won't respond
to all the accounts I created.

393
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:14,974
He's not even online.

394
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,872
He must know that I'm snooping.

395
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:23,380
How can I find his address?

396
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:27,023
He might be bored.

397
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,031
Like how Soong played with my heart.

398
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,072
Should we hack him?

399
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,077
Find his IP address.

400
00:36:37,102 --> 00:36:39,002
He slept with someone else.

401
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,911
Why do I still miss him?

402
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:48,904
If you can hack him, shut down
the car wash shop and be a detective.

403
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,349
How about this, Nant? I mean Nont.

404
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,458
If you have a call with him,

405
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:59,438
I can figure out where he is.

406
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:12,339
But I can't get up until Zouey...

407
00:37:12,784 --> 00:37:13,441
Fine.

408
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,171
Get up immediately.

409
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:16,741
I forgive you.

410
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:17,835
Damn it.

411
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,304
I'm sorry, Zouey.

412
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,507
I love you so much.

413
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,929
I'm sorry.

414
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,249
I'm sorry.

415
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:34,949
Come here.

416
00:37:46,444 --> 00:37:47,405
What is wrong with you?

417
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,991
Come here.

418
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:17,905
See?

419
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,044
When the clients get bored of you,

420
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,735
you become an obsolete item.

421
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,015
It causes me trouble.

422
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:29,447
Why are you criticizing me?

423
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,143
People might think you're jealous of me.

424
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,518
Jealous? Fuck you.

425
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:38,380
The boss wants me to talk to you.

426
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:40,825
He thinks you can attract clients.

427
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:44,052
So now I'm your mentor.

428
00:39:45,437 --> 00:39:47,382
If you talk to me like that again,

429
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:49,117
I'll kick your ass.

430
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,701
Just lay there
and remember what I do to you.

431
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:08,029
Clients want to escape the real world.

432
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:12,000
Your job is to make them
the center of attention.

433
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,680
Don't attack, but don't be lazy.

434
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,243
Go slowly.

435
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,644
Flirt slowly.

436
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:30,102
You must know the clients
as quickly as possible.

437
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:32,305
Do they like it slow or fast?

438
00:40:32,949 --> 00:40:34,293
Hard or soft?

439
00:40:34,863 --> 00:40:37,644
Where do they like and dislike
to be touched?

440
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:48,108
If you can flirt with them well

441
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,970
and make them want you so badly,

442
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:52,189
they'll satisfy you.

443
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,137
Then you'll have to go all in.

444
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:16,034
Most importantly, you can decline them.

445
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,081
But you might miss the bonus.

446
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:21,387
When they ask you to do something
you don't want to,

447
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:23,070
whisper in their ears
and ask for more money.

448
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:25,086
Every one of them will pay.

449
00:41:25,937 --> 00:41:27,273
You just have to force yourself
and do it.

450
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,296
Every client wants to be a favorite.

451
00:42:08,132 --> 00:42:09,625
Don't come and go separate ways.

452
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:12,031
You must treat them well
until the very last minute.

453
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:01,453
(Don't you miss your first client?)

454
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,585
(Hello)

455
00:43:03,093 --> 00:43:05,070
Don't you miss your first client?

456
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:07,951
I'm sorry. We're closed.

457
00:43:08,724 --> 00:43:10,911
What you were doing just now...
Is that an add-on service?

458
00:43:22,748 --> 00:43:24,943
I can reduce your sentence.

459
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:29,440
You will only provide service to me.
Get rid of that account.

460
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:31,514
Be my slave

461
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,884
or you'll be
providing your service in jail.

462
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,198
(I miss you, let's meet up at night)

463
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:06,078
I'm going.

464
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:27,375
Do you want
to eat chicken noodles with me?

465
00:44:28,868 --> 00:44:29,852
What the hell?

466
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:32,828
I'm asking you to join me for dinner.

467
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:35,042
Has no one ever asked you out?

468
00:44:36,503 --> 00:44:37,753
You are my mentor.

469
00:44:38,417 --> 00:44:39,636
We should be close.

470
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,048
Hold on.

471
00:44:42,686 --> 00:44:44,686
My job is to teach you.

472
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,931
I don't need to be close to you
outside of work.

473
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,853
What the hell? You were fine earlier.

474
00:45:00,027 --> 00:45:01,395
Whatever happens in the room

475
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:03,481
stays in the room, Puen.

476
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,187
You can't have feelings for the clients.

477
00:45:07,093 --> 00:45:08,546
They're strangers once they leave.

478
00:45:09,053 --> 00:45:10,639
But you're not a client.

479
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:15,139
Aob.

480
00:45:15,477 --> 00:45:18,789
Why do you have to act cold
and emotionless to everyone?

481
00:45:24,817 --> 00:45:26,395
Can't you have feelings

482
00:45:26,663 --> 00:45:27,945
for your friends or brothers?

483
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:35,366
You're not my friend

484
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:36,889
or brother.

485
00:45:38,206 --> 00:45:39,346
You're a competitor.

486
00:46:07,787 --> 00:46:08,685
You've got it bad.

487
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,705
We've only been apart for a day.

488
00:46:14,263 --> 00:46:15,169
I'm hallucinating.

489
00:46:16,028 --> 00:46:17,200
I can hear his voice.

490
00:46:18,302 --> 00:46:19,255
I'm physically here.

491
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Hey.

492
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:25,345
How did you get here?

493
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:27,853
I walked here.

494
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,371
I'm kidding.

495
00:46:33,613 --> 00:46:34,559
I miss you.

496
00:46:38,413 --> 00:46:39,851
Me or the drugs?

497
00:46:43,273 --> 00:46:44,476
Both?

498
00:46:55,466 --> 00:46:56,388
Phop.

499
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,622
I want you to wear a condom this time.

500
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:04,894
I know that I shouldn't have feelings
when I'm working.

501
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:10,687
But what can I do? I'm human.

502
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:12,694
I can't stop my feelings.

503
00:50:14,975 --> 00:50:16,928
Does the N on this necklace
stand for Nuth?

504
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:18,538
I found it on the kitchen floor.

505
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:22,989
Oh.

506
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:25,205
I was looking for it.

507
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:27,228
I couldn't find it.

508
00:50:42,451 --> 00:50:43,576
Can I keep it?

509
00:50:44,259 --> 00:50:46,103
When I leave for work and miss you,

510
00:50:46,556 --> 00:50:47,673
I can look at it.

511
00:50:50,274 --> 00:50:51,220
No.

512
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:52,973
I'll get you a new one

513
00:50:53,577 --> 00:50:54,733
with the letter P

514
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:56,054
for Phop.

515
00:51:58,225 --> 00:51:59,467
You're up early.

516
00:52:00,623 --> 00:52:01,842
No progress?

517
00:52:03,529 --> 00:52:04,373
Yeah.

518
00:52:07,493 --> 00:52:09,040
You don't need
to provide me an after care.

519
00:52:10,306 --> 00:52:11,290
I sleep with you for pleasure.

520
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:13,924
We don't have a contract like Nant.

521
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:19,347
If this was a thriller,

522
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:21,534
we would have passed the introduction
a long time ago.

523
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:23,808
Let's not waste time.

524
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:26,483
Get all the suspects together

525
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,358
and find out the truth.

526
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:49,210
(Next Episode) To get all the suspects together
to find more information...

527
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:50,874
I want you to make one suggestion each.

528
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:51,803
Why don't we host a party?

529
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,129
I've never had sex wearing a mask.

530
00:52:55,154 --> 00:52:56,692
Are you sure this plan will work?

531
00:52:56,717 --> 00:53:00,067
Now we know that Jump, Prom, and Keen
like having sex wearing a mask.

532
00:53:00,237 --> 00:53:01,815
Should I remind you how much trouble
you'll be in if Dad finds out?

533
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,972
He takes care of you
because you're my brother.

534
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:07,706
Zouey wants to have sex with you.

535
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,623
He made you wait.

536
00:53:09,904 --> 00:53:14,717
But Teena approached him
because he wants to take his virginity.

537
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:18,683
Tell me if there's anything
you want me to do, Nuth.
