1
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:18,552
(Previously) I couldn't tell
that you are emotionally unstable.

2
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:21,152
Will you ever be so mad
that you beat me up?

3
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:22,366
No way.

4
00:00:22,842 --> 00:00:23,889
I love you so much.

5
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:25,275
Love you long time.

6
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:28,259
You always make it seem
like I'm going to die in front of you.

7
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,705
Did your ex-boyfriend die
in front of you?

8
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,731
Do you think taking revenge
really makes us happier?

9
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:37,215
What are you worried about?

10
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:39,920
We know where Nuthyim is.

11
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,112
How did you come back?

12
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,033
Didn't you commit suicide?

13
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:49,198
Commit suicide?

14
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:52,068
Plot twist.

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,888
The victim died
with 200,000 baht cash on hand.

16
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:55,732
A clip before her death is revealed.

17
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:58,333
The wife was not murdered.

18
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,943
A dark truth is revealed.

19
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:03,162
A friend said there was motive.

20
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:07,970
Honestly,

21
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:09,595
how did you come back?

22
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:11,776
Didn't you commit suicide?

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,245
Commit suicide?

24
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:15,925
You called me

25
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:18,029
saying you were going to kill yourself
to escape the creditors.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,331
What did you guys do?
Why did Nant kill himself?

27
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:22,933
I said tell me.

28
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:25,925
If you don't, I'll shoot his brains out.

29
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:34,396
Don't.

30
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,274
Don't.

31
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,048
Don't.

32
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:42,165
Don't.

33
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,723
Phop.

34
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:46,029
Don't. Phop.

35
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:47,201
Don't.

36
00:01:48,537 --> 00:01:49,146
Don't.

37
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:50,985
Don't. Phop.

38
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:53,318
Don't, Nant.

39
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:54,591
Phop.

40
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:57,005
Phop. I'm sorry.

41
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:58,724
Phop. Don't.

42
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:00,497
Don't!

43
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,083
Phop.

44
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:07,172
It's over, Nant.

45
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:09,703
In the end, we've reached a dead end.

46
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:21,014
There is no point to continue

47
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:23,866
even though I couldn't find out
where you are.

48
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:33,214
But I'm certain

49
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:46,321
that while I walked
the dark path you took in the past,

50
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:10,574
I found out a lot about myself.

51
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,700
(Playboyy)

52
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,102
(Episode 8: The Most Valuable Person)

53
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,305
So you have a twin, don't you?

54
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:15,567
I'm sorry

55
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:17,289
to the both of you.

56
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:22,118
I was just tired
and stressed out, so I...

57
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:42,971
This isn't you, right?

58
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:51,380
I swear.

59
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:52,599
Here.

60
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:53,810
Right here.

61
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:57,177
On my stomach.

62
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:00,227
The guy in the clip
didn't have a scar here, right?

63
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:13,306
Nant stabbed me three months ago.

64
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:16,051
That's how I got this scar.

65
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,098
The one in the clip isn't me.

66
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:23,975
If you don't believe me,

67
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:27,671
I have the clip from that day.

68
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:40,708
Earlier,

69
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,130
you said my brother committed suicide.

70
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,623
I'm begging you.

71
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:47,431
Please tell me what happened.

72
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:58,617
Nant and I met

73
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:00,634
and took videos together

74
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:02,080
about three or four months ago.

75
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:19,423
We video called on Thaiboyslive
several times.

76
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:21,463
Nant wanted to be an actor.

77
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:23,245
I wanted to make movies.

78
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:25,580
So we met up.

79
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,237
Five hundred twenty five thousand

80
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,682
and six hundred minutes in a year.

81
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:31,510
How do you spend those minutes?

82
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,200
I spend the time
thinking about my loved ones.

83
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,470
Five hundred twenty five thousand

84
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:37,809
and six hundred minutes in a year.

85
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:40,166
How do you spend those minutes?

86
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,755
I spend the time
thinking about my loved ones.

87
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:46,981
He didn't accept any payment.

88
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,582
But he wanted something else.

89
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:56,362
He used to be a wimp.

90
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,905
But he was pressured by his friends

91
00:07:58,796 --> 00:07:59,476
and became a sex addict.

92
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:02,502
When he kept accepting drugs as payment,

93
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:05,291
he became a drug addict too.

94
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:09,223
Nuth.

95
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:11,950
Should we

96
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,231
try selling drugs?

97
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,540
If the scholarship is that hard to get,

98
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,228
we should save up and make a movie

99
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,267
and enter a competition.

100
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:26,363
I want to help you save up.

101
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:29,246
I want your dream to come true.

102
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:36,733
The police set up a checkpoint.

103
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:38,624
What do you want me to do?

104
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,454
Go to jail?

105
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,087
Of course I had to throw the drugs out.

106
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:43,742
Why are you so fucking stupid?

107
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:45,601
Those drugs were worth
over 100,000 baht.

108
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,953
Find a way to pay the boss back

109
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,400
or his men will beat us up.

110
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,232
They can actually kill you.

111
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,685
Don't ever come back here.

112
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:54,966
Got it?

113
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,857
Or we'll all be in trouble.

114
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:58,894
No.

115
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,527
No, Nuth.

116
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:02,468
I love you.

117
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,390
But the worst thing was

118
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:07,720
he was addicted to me.

119
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,385
But I don't love you.

120
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:12,791
You should understand that.

121
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,286
Why?

122
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:15,379
Is this about the drugs

123
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:16,903
or the sex?

124
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,317
Am I that bad?

125
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:20,700
Huh?

126
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,210
- Damn it. I suck.
- Nant, don't.

127
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,736
- I suck.
- Nant.

128
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,376
Nant, don't do this.

129
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:32,473
Nant, don't.

130
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:35,168
Nant. Don't.

131
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,562
What the hell did you do?

132
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,189
I never agreed
to make it official with him.

133
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,572
But he kept coming to see me.

134
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,996
He forced me to treat him
like a boyfriend.

135
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:00,603
When I didn't agree,

136
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:02,446
he threw a tantrum.

137
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:05,485
He slowly paid me back.

138
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:10,437
But he wanted more drugs.

139
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,633
In the end,

140
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:17,737
he was in debt and had to run away.

141
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:22,940
Do you want to keep watching?

142
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,041
If life is a journey,

143
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:34,361
I think

144
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,775
I've reached a dead end.

145
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:41,941
Now I understand

146
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:45,912
why you tried to run away
from this world many times, Mom.

147
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:49,944
I'm sorry

148
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,963
for making this decision.

149
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,377
But if I have to keep running,

150
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,817
it's just too tiring.

151
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:09,385
Nuth.

152
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,487
I know I've done horrible things to you.

153
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:19,349
Please forgive me.

154
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:43,819
Nant.

155
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:45,862
Nant.

156
00:12:57,954 --> 00:12:58,657
Nant.

157
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:18,173
Have you ever

158
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:21,087
tried your best, but would never
be as good as others?

159
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:24,819
Have you ever

160
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:26,683
made one little mistake,

161
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:28,808
but were severely punished for it

162
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:33,001
and became someone's
emotional punching bag?

163
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,223
And all you could do
is watch your friends from the bench?

164
00:13:44,978 --> 00:13:45,921
Try this.

165
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,827
Let me introduce you to Sex,

166
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:51,557
a new product for the success
of a smart person like you.

167
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:56,019
Sex helps people adore you
like they've never done before.

168
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:04,529
Sex helps you get more privileges.

169
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:16,444
Sex helps you become the chosen one.

170
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,526
Sex, because the power is in your hands.

171
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,523
Sometimes the power is in your mouth
and somewhere else too,

172
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:33,233
but I'm sure Sex can help you succeed.

173
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,811
Awesome!

174
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:37,249
Woo!

175
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,174
I love you.

176
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:43,557
Woo!

177
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:44,882
Amazing!

178
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:47,233
Woo!

179
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,510
Get me the trophy next game.

180
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,484
Thank you for letting me be the starter.

181
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:11,078
I love you the most.

182
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,547
I'll become the MVP.

183
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,979
You already are
the most valuable player to me.

184
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:23,967
Come on.

185
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:52,968

191
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,291
You are valuable to me too.

192
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,302
Very valuable.

193
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,543
Well...

194
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,340
Are you guys trying
to channel your psychic abilities?

195
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:41,226
Thank you.

196
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:43,351
We would be doomed
if it weren't for you.

197
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:46,135
- I'll enjoy this meal.
- I'll enjoy this meal.

198
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,158
Is Nont still upset?

199
00:16:58,304 --> 00:16:59,009
Yes.

200
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:00,727
I don't know where he went.

201
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:02,705
He hasn't come home.

202
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:06,507
He isn't with Prom.

203
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,070
Prom can't find him either.

204
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:18,254
Something's off with you, Zouey.

205
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,947
Where did that shy little boy
who didn't like to be touched go?

206
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:25,541
Excuse me.

207
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:26,970
You fucked, didn't you?

208
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,734
I'm ready to be yours.

209
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,007
My favorite man.

210
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:57,530
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

211
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:01,326
Having sex with someone you love
is okay too.

212
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:03,928
Wow.

213
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:06,166
- Tell me.
- Come on.

214
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:07,244
Ouch!

215
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:27,312
- Tell me.
- Damn it.

216
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,598
Tell me everything.

217
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:30,840
Come on.

218
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,214
Are you okay?

219
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:37,621
You don't look too well.

220
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,492
No, I'm fine.

221
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,344
I'm just overthinking about myself.

222
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:46,157
I know a clinic.
I can take you. You want to go?

223
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,057
That's not what he meant.

224
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:54,651
- Zouey.
- Tell us everything.

225
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:55,917
No.

226
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:57,838
You should ask Zouey.

227
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:00,401
Come on.

228
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,202
You're so good at keeping secrets.

229
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:03,288
Zouey.

230
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,248
- Tell us.
- Zouey.

231
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:06,585
Look.

232
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,797
(I found Nont, he came to see me)

233
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,387
I'm sorry

234
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:35,858
about Nant.

235
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,038
It shouldn't end this way.

236
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:45,377
Nant was the most
important person to me.

237
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,396
Even though we were separated since
we were young because of our parents,

238
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,220
we met up.

239
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,615
We talked to each other about stuff.

240
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,161
This was the only thing

241
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:13,039
that made me feel like

242
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:15,305
I didn't know him at all.

243
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,847
I can't tell you that I understand.

244
00:20:23,027 --> 00:20:25,081
I don't have a real brother like you.

245
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,529
But Nant was important to me too.

246
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:37,723
For Nant,

247
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:39,934
everything was after care.

248
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:42,953
But for me,

249
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:46,639
it was the best time.

250
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:50,038
I got to spend time with someone

251
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,272
I really cared about.

252
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:57,806
A love triangle.

253
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:01,212
What a classic story.

254
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:05,996
You ruined my life.

255
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:07,801
Just because I couldn't date you.

256
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:09,938
You beat me up.

257
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:11,485
You manipulated me.

258
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,355
I couldn't sleep for months.

259
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:18,074
Was Nant violent to you

260
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:19,832
like he was with Nuth?

261
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:24,670
No.

262
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,405
Sometimes I let myself think

263
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:31,955
that maybe Nant also liked me.

264
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,408
Do you have the clip
when Nant and Nuth had a call

265
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:39,692
before he committed suicide?

266
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:42,903
I had asked him for it.

267
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:44,473
Why?

268
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:48,031
Let me see it.

269
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:51,781
Who knows?

270
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,406
It could have been a setup.

271
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,455
I think

272
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:00,596
your brother might still be alive.

273
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:22,347
It's great we don't wear
the same clothes.

274
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:24,300
Because we don't have to take turns.

275
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:30,980
Aren't you mad at me about Nant?

276
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:33,253
If this were a movie,

277
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:35,183
the moment Nont came over

278
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,428
would have been the moment
you broke up with me.

279
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:41,584
You already told me about it.

280
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,412
Why would I be mad?

281
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:46,782
I just want you to tell me everything.

282
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:48,595
Then I'll be fine.

283
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,935
You're the best.

284
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,186
All I get is a hug and a kiss?

285
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:15,736
Come on.

286
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:31,515
It's funny

287
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,945
how my first relationship
is in my mid-thirties.

288
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,432
Because you were looking
for a partner online.

289
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,619
What if it wasn't me?

290
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:46,905
You could have met scammers
or problematic people like Nant.

291
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:48,499
That would be really unfortunate.

292
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,194
It's not easy to find a partner
for gays who are older, Phop.

293
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,967
If you don't like to socialize or party,

294
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:57,745
how will you find one?

295
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:58,949
Right?

296
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:00,558
Especially for someone like me.

297
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:03,608
You're right.

298
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:05,522
I'm too thin.

299
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,365
I'm too tall to be the bottom,

300
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:09,959
but my dick is too big to be the top.

301
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:12,182
It's funny, huh?

302
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:15,713
Yeah.

303
00:24:18,184 --> 00:24:20,285
This community isn't open to anyone.

304
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,668
Meeting you wasn't easy.

305
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:26,051
If there's something I can improve,

306
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,176
please tell me.

307
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:32,367
You are very important to me.

308
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,816
You're the best I could ever ask for.

309
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,612
Thank you.

I'll buy you a meal)

00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:03,799
(Break a leg, man)

313
00:25:04,424 --> 00:25:05,315
(Can I do it? Yes, I can!)

314
00:26:41,154 --> 00:26:41,951
Hey.

315
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:44,318
I told you to practice,
but you wouldn't listen.

316
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:46,388
You're not focused.
What the hell is wrong with you?

317
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,279
He keeps acting girly.

318
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:50,037
You're right.

319
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:51,778
Damn it.

320
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:55,843
I'm sorry.

321
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,468
Do you have some time?

322
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:00,792
It must be a big deal
for you to come see me now.

323
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,635
I'm sorry.

324
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,010
I'm in a hurry.

325
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,315
I had to come see you.

326
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:06,862
I can't leave any evidence.

327
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,806
You told me that someone was asking
about the masked party.

328
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:13,916
Did you tell me everything?

329
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:15,775
You aren't hiding something, right?

330
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:21,255
What happened at the masked party?

331
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,872
Is there something else
I should know about?

332
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:27,867
No.

333
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:33,777
Do you still have
the stuff I asked you to keep?

334
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,468
Good.

335
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,163
Keep it well.

336
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:40,601
Don't throw it away.

337
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:42,015
Don't lose it.

338
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:43,921
Don't let anyone see it, Keen.

339
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:46,471
Nuth.

340
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:47,760
Nuth.

341
00:29:11,803 --> 00:29:14,623
Here you have striploin,
fries and and streamed vegetables.

342
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,725
How was the steak cooked?

343
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,908
Mid-rare, chef.

344
00:29:21,712 --> 00:29:24,188
So it must be pink in the middle.

345
00:29:24,384 --> 00:29:25,048
Pink.

346
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:26,829
It's gotta be pink as you like.

347
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:43,421
But it's not that pink, don't you think?

348
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:45,172
Yes, chef.

349
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:51,909
Show me.

350
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:54,393
Is there something
that is pinker than this meat?

351
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:58,443
Yes, chef.

352
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:24,350
Take off my shoes.

353
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:28,623
Yes, chef.

354
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,500
And my socks.

355
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:12,311
Lick it.

356
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,266
Yes, chef.

357
00:31:58,689 --> 00:31:59,597
I'm begging you, First.

358
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:01,652
Can we go back to how it was?

359
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:02,855
I'll make up with you

360
00:32:04,905 --> 00:32:06,006
on one condition.

361
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:09,218
You are my slave.

362
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:11,913
Gonna take it

363
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:13,405
or leave it?

364
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,570
Did I go too far this time?

365
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:32,437
A little.

366
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:35,448
If you don't like it,
I won't do it again.

367
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:45,256
I'm sorry.

368
00:32:55,696 --> 00:32:59,316
Having sex with someone you love
is okay too.

369
00:33:06,226 --> 00:33:06,890
Hug me.

370
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:10,437
Hey.

371
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:13,854
Hey, are you okay?

372
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,271
I...

373
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:27,822
I'm scared.

374
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,652
I can't control myself.

375
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:35,449
I don't want to become a monster.

376
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:43,503
Actually,

377
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,146
I just want you.

378
00:33:51,184 --> 00:33:52,630
I want you to love me.

379
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,759
I want to be loved.

380
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:00,650
For once in my life.

381
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:41,063
(Status: Available) / (Status: Working)

382
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:54,351
You taught him well.
He's the most requested.

383
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:56,697
The clients are calling him Big Gun.

384
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:04,864
Jealous?

385
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:07,833
Jealous my ass.

386
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,785
I don't have feelings for him.

387
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,930
Okay.

388
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:12,711
It's fine if you don't.

389
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,406
There's no need to take it out on me.

390
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:26,618
Prom.

391
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,853
The client wants a second round.

392
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:34,833
And...

393
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,575
He is requesting the four-hand service

394
00:35:37,028 --> 00:35:38,176
with Aob as well.

395
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,070
I was just done.

396
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:47,406
- I'm not taking this job.
- What?

397
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:52,627
You taught me
that we can't choose our clients.

398
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:59,985
You're not being very professional.

399
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:01,790
Mentor.

400
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:35,537
(Do you want to come over?
I miss your worm)

401
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,021
(Warmth)

402
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:40,086
(DMK. 8 PM. Next week. Cum pick me up.)

403
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:44,508
Finish cleaning quickly.

404
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:47,839
Hotpot is waiting for us.

405
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:50,964
I can't go. I'm busy.

406
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:54,166
At 9 p.m.

407
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:56,861
Jump, be honest.

408
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,213
Are you seeing someone else?

409
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:00,182
Yeah, why?

410
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,174
We're not together anymore.

411
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,527
- But I...
- Stop it.

412
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,074
We've switched roles, haven't we?

413
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:10,188
You are my slave.

414
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:13,695
But we agreed

415
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:14,844
to be flexible.

416
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:16,653
But it doesn't mean
you can fuck someone else.

417
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:18,981
That's what you think.

418
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,333
I terminated the contract.

419
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:24,390
We agreed about sex.

420
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:26,046
Nothing else.

421
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:27,406
I'm begging you, Jump.

422
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,554
My daddy is coming back next week.

423
00:37:29,828 --> 00:37:31,171
Let me use the remaining time

424
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,893
to the fullest. That's all I'm asking.

425
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:42,817
Jump.

426
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:44,372
I'll give you 30,000 baht.

427
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:45,935
Please.

428
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,804
Faster!

429
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:11,281
Harder! Faster!

430
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:17,378
You only appreciate
the value of something

431
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:20,065
- when you are about to lose it.
- This is so damn good!

432
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:20,863
It's just...

433
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:22,262
so fucking awful.

434
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:24,387
Especially when

435
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:26,223
you know in your heart

436
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,725
that you are powerless.

437
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:34,799
- Because he isn't your boyfriend.
- Because he isn't your boyfriend.

438
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:35,838
Harder.

439
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:37,635
I said harder.

440
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:39,557
Faster.

441
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,012
I want you to go harder.

442
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:46,934
The more you want to know,
the more painful it gets.

443
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,696
You are ready to suffer

444
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:52,383
to the fullest.

445
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:27,380
(New generation of reporters)

446
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:28,701
(Hot and ripped)

447
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:31,329
(Hot reporters)

448
00:39:31,398 --> 00:39:32,483
(1. Nirat Pattanon)

449
00:39:32,508 --> 00:39:33,891
(2. Polsawas Kongkanakorn)

450
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,258
(3. Tutor Techanat)

451
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,075
(It's okay, try again next time)

452
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,583
(Don't be upset! We're rooting for you)

453
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:57,714
Do you regret

454
00:39:58,222 --> 00:39:59,410
letting me be a starter?

455
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:01,949
Why would I be?

456
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:04,092
You did your best.

457
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:06,513
The other team was good.

458
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,044
Hey.

459
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:10,560
It's okay.

460
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:14,019
You win some, you lose some.

461
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:18,852
The team lost because of me.

462
00:40:20,305 --> 00:40:21,477
I got the position through sex.

463
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:24,246
But I actually suck.

464
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:29,957
The teammates will destroy me tomorrow.

465
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:32,803
They can try.
I won't let anyone hurt you.

466
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:37,716
I agreed to let you play

467
00:40:38,698 --> 00:40:40,386
because I saw your potential.

468
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,393
You've tried so hard.

469
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:46,387
But if you really sucked,

470
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:48,314
no matter what you gave me,

471
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,431
I wouldn't have let you played.

472
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:53,892
I have my ideals.

473
00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:56,715
I made the decision.

474
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,932
No one can criticize you.

475
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,819
I know the stakes are high for you.

476
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:08,999
Your dad was on the national team.

477
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:12,299
So you had to prove yourself.

478
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:15,755
But these things take time.

479
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:19,989
Don't be so hard on yourself.

480
00:41:22,297 --> 00:41:23,290
Take it slow.

481
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:25,118
I'll help you.

482
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:33,539
Smile.

483
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:37,406
Let me be the only one with a grim face.

484
00:42:05,945 --> 00:42:07,437
See? I told you so.

485
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:10,116
I told you
it wouldn't affect my grades.

486
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:11,257
Great job.

487
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:14,230
Attaboy.

488
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,496
So when are you moving back?

489
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:25,655
Are you still thinking about that guy?

490
00:42:29,392 --> 00:42:30,611
I'm okay now.

491
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:33,475
But living with my friends is better.

492
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:35,038
They help me study.

493
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:39,129
Your friend who's a psychologist...

494
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,606
What if I wanted to meet him?

495
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,461
I'll be right back, Dad.

496
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:06,592
Why are you here?

497
00:43:07,295 --> 00:43:08,193
I'm here to pick you up.

498
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:09,443
I wanted to surprise you too.

499
00:43:10,498 --> 00:43:11,498
You want me to love you?

500
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,079
I'm doing just that.

501
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,376
Dad might see us.

502
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,540
How dare you kiss me?

503
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,032
So what?

504
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:29,521
Aren't you going to kiss me back?

505
00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:34,296
I have to go.

506
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:40,889
Daddy.

507
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:43,967
Your son is a slut.

508
00:43:47,696 --> 00:43:49,454
(You want to do this again?)

509
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:50,744
(I'm waiting out front)

510
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:57,998
Dad.

511
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:00,162
I forgot I ordered pizza.
Do you want some?

512
00:44:01,107 --> 00:44:01,701
Leave it there.

513
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:03,529
I'll go meet Zouey.

514
00:44:04,594 --> 00:44:05,157
Okay.

515
00:44:05,805 --> 00:44:06,493
About my friend who's a psychologist,

516
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:09,141
I'll call him.

517
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,309
Okay.

518
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,058
Hey.

519
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,112
How are you going to haze me today?

520
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:52,846
No.

521
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:55,974
You must be tired.

522
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:57,096
How many times?

523
00:45:00,555 --> 00:45:01,189
I stopped counting.

524
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:03,799
That's because you didn't take the job.

525
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:06,267
So I had to take care of all the VIPs.

526
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:10,278
But sometimes I had to pretend to finish
like you taught me to.

527
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:20,507
Do you want to get chicken noodles?

528
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:23,464
I'll pay

529
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,447
to make up for making you
work extra hours.

530
00:46:07,993 --> 00:46:10,540
I think what Prom said
makes a lot of sense.

531
00:46:13,763 --> 00:46:14,662
Aren't you happy

532
00:46:15,427 --> 00:46:16,951
that your brother might still be alive?

533
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:19,458
I don't get it.

534
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:21,990
I think you guys don't either.

535
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:23,975
Get your shit together.

536
00:46:24,772 --> 00:46:26,420
Nont said it like 30 times.

537
00:46:27,014 --> 00:46:27,819
Look at this.

538
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:32,401
Look at the end.

539
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:34,104
Nant climbed up

540
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,346
to...

541
00:46:35,635 --> 00:46:36,557
hang himself, right?

542
00:46:36,729 --> 00:46:37,768
- Yeah.
- Look.

543
00:46:38,724 --> 00:46:40,271
His leg hit the camera here.

544
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:43,036
Yes.

545
00:46:43,263 --> 00:46:44,435
And that's the end of the clip.

546
00:46:44,622 --> 00:46:47,123
But wasn't that too coincidental?

547
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:49,489
How did his legs move

548
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,487
to push the stop button?

549
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:52,659
Look at the back.

550
00:46:54,136 --> 00:46:54,862
Do you see something?

551
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:56,167
Here.

552
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:57,323
What?

553
00:46:58,648 --> 00:46:59,218
Here.

554
00:47:00,101 --> 00:47:01,296
Shit.

555
00:47:01,648 --> 00:47:04,460
- It's says room service.
- Nant killed himself at a motel.

556
00:47:04,874 --> 00:47:05,601
Yeah.

557
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:06,843
There was no news.

558
00:47:07,265 --> 00:47:08,359
And no one found his corpse.

559
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:09,578
Think about it.

560
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:11,023
What if he really died?

561
00:47:11,804 --> 00:47:13,797
Who put his laptop near Soong's dorm?

562
00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:16,251
Who was the guy who wore the dog mask?

563
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:18,212
What about his creditors?

564
00:47:19,892 --> 00:47:20,493
Nant

565
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,460
owed money to Nuth's boss.

566
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,190
Because he lost the drugs.

567
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:25,635
Shit.

568
00:47:26,057 --> 00:47:26,830
It was a setup.

569
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:30,354
He pretended to kill himself
to get away from the creditors.

570
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:32,692
Nont.

571
00:47:33,271 --> 00:47:34,997
You have a chance of finding him.

572
00:47:36,177 --> 00:47:37,732
He might already be dead.

573
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:43,345
The motel might not
want the bad publicity.

574
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:45,469
So they threw away his corpse
and his laptop.

575
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:46,324
That's it.

576
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,550
But that might not be the case.

577
00:47:48,777 --> 00:47:50,675
- You must continue searching.
- I won't.

578
00:47:52,397 --> 00:47:54,186
If he's alive
and not telling me anything,

579
00:47:55,384 --> 00:47:56,603
that means he doesn't want to be found.

580
00:47:57,259 --> 00:47:58,767
It's like he's dead to me.

581
00:48:01,267 --> 00:48:01,877
I don't care.

582
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:03,103
Whatever.

583
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:04,559
You can keep searching.

584
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:05,911
But I'm out.

585
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:07,942
Nont.

586
00:48:08,606 --> 00:48:09,551
How could you say that?

587
00:48:10,376 --> 00:48:11,532
That's your brother.

588
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:13,262
A brother who got fucked up.

589
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:15,801
A brother who created problems,

590
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:18,254
physically abused others,

591
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:20,746
had sex with strangers,
and became a drug addict.

592
00:48:21,676 --> 00:48:23,644
He went missing
and that's why we're all in this mess.

593
00:48:25,756 --> 00:48:26,951
But you guys still worry about him.

594
00:48:27,686 --> 00:48:29,272
You guys still think he's important.

595
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,397
What about me?

596
00:48:39,604 --> 00:48:41,480
No one cares about how I feel, right?

597
00:48:42,508 --> 00:48:43,469
No one cares

598
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:45,203
if I'm tired, stressed, or sad.

599
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:46,961
Isn't that right?

600
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,091
Damn it.

601
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:54,942
Everyone wants to feel important.

602
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:55,658
You're drunk, aren't you?

603
00:49:57,478 --> 00:49:58,415
Do you know what you're doing?

604
00:50:03,642 --> 00:50:04,282
Yes.

605
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:07,040
Have sex with me.

606
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:11,887
Have sex with me.

607
00:50:13,996 --> 00:50:14,894
Pretend that I'm Nant.

608
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:17,644
Do it like it's written in the contract.

609
00:50:19,428 --> 00:50:20,335
Then I'll keep searching for Nant.

610
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:39,881
That's all, right?

611
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:44,688
I'm Nant.

612
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:47,220
Have sex with me.

613
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:40,372
So what are you going to do?

614
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:43,242
Where are you going to search for Nant?

615
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:48,953
You must miss him so badly.

616
00:55:01,488 --> 00:55:02,590
The guy who wore a mask...

617
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,254
I really like him.

618
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:07,640
I must find him.

619
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:10,808
(There's more after the credits)

620
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:13,757
(Next Episode)
Your private group

621
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:15,288
only has clips of athletes, right?

622
00:56:15,649 --> 00:56:16,829
If I have a clip of someone famous,

623
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:18,680
can I sell it to you?

624
00:56:19,391 --> 00:56:20,087
Dad.

625
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,987
Can you contact the police for the
footage from the CCTV at Harvey Hotel?

626
00:56:25,655 --> 00:56:26,444
Nuth.

627
00:56:26,764 --> 00:56:28,077
Have you seen this clip?

628
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:30,342
Damn it, Porche. If I get arrested,

629
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:31,960
come bail me out.

630
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:33,112
Damn it.

631
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:34,222
What can I do?

632
00:56:35,401 --> 00:56:36,667
I already warned you, didn't I?
