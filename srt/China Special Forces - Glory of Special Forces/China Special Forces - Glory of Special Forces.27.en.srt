major literary and artistic project)

(Episode 27)

4
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,990
I got this all by myself.

5
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,389
Whatever you say,

6
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:39,334
Young Master.

7
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,320
Everyone knows the detachment commander
is sending you for further study.

8
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:45,055
Of course the Most Outstanding Soldier
award can only be yours.

9
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,999
Yue Kong of 3rd Platoon,
1st Squadron.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,080
Someone is here to see you.

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,440
It must be his dad.

12
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,040
Jin, Wang,

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,680
what are you doing here?

14
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:05,079
What are you doing?

15
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,700
What's wrong with you?

16
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,520
It's Dai Jin's birthday.

17
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,839
Didn't you ask me to bring Dai Jin
here today for her birthday?

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,680
Oh, right.

19
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:20,080
Come on, let's show my comrades

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,360
how beautiful my girlfriend is.

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,200
That's enough.

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
I know you.

23
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,559
Just admit that you forgot.

24
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:28,000
I... I didn't forget.

25
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,160
I remember it every day.

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,280
I've been waiting for today.

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,160
-Let's go.
-You're so fake.

28
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:40,165
It's so late now.

29
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,751
Are you sure it's safe
for you to go home alone?

30
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,421
You are not allowed to leave.

31
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,399
(Military Control Area)
Don't worry.

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,399
I should've let Wang take you home.

33
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:52,968
I don't want to.

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,161
I want to stay with my Kong.

35
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,758
I'm sorry

36
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:00,957
for not being around.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,601
What do you want for your birthday?

38
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,039
Just one present isn't enough.

39
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,712
I want a Doraemon.

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,919
I am Doraemon.

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,400
No matter how many presents
you want, I'll give it to you.

42
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,479
I don't need so many gifts,

43
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,600
I just want you to
always be with me.

44
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:32,112
I'll always be with you.

45
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,149
It's good that

46
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,625
you're getting discharged soon.

47
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,800
Jin.

48
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:56,427
I

49
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:57,998
don't want to get discharged.

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,360
Pardon me?

51
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:04,442
I want to sign up for
the special forces squadron.

52
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,919
Jin... Jin!

53
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,320
-Stay back.
-Jin!

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,240
-Stay back!
-Jin...

55
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,240
You should've seen this coming

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,399
when you made that decision!

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Jin...

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,760
Go.

59
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,879
Congratulations.

60
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,181
You've passed the
selections and assessments.

61
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,799
You've been selected by Cheetah.

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
But this is just the beginning.

63
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,679
The beginning of becoming
a qualified special forces member.

64
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
What awaits you afterward is

65
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
more inhumane training.

66
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,039
We will restructure your body

67
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,519
and refine your minds.

68
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,120
Here,

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,359
your value will be maximized.

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,040
(Cheetah Special Forces)
Capability is everything.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Hello, Wang.

72
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,559
Have you seen Dai Jin lately?

73
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,239
I haven't been able

74
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,119
to reach her lately.

75
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,119
(When I called her home,
no one picked up.)

76
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,359
I don't know either.

77
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:25,647
I haven't spoken

78
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,000
to her lately.

79
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,200
Then, can you help me find her?

80
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,199
(Okay.)

81
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,920
Since when?

82
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,660
Since the day

83
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:54,052
you decided to join special forces.

84
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,239
My mum has waited
for my dad her entire life.

85
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,001
In the end, all she got
was a martyr medal.

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,279
I grew up watching her
being worried and in fear.

87
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,000
I've had enough of it.

88
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,440
Yue Kong, you know that.

89
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,320
The moment you decided to
become a special forces member,

90
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,239
it's over between us.

91
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
(Double Happiness)

92
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,079
Yue Kong!

93
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
Captain Qin!

94
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
What's going on with you?
You are completely off.

95
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,879
I've been standing
behind you for so long.

96
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
You aren't being alert at all!

97
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,279
-I am useless!
-You take that three words back!

98
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,679
Cheetah has no useless people.

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Joining Cheetah

100
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,920
is a symbol of glory!

101
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,480
Are you regretting it?

102
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,520
No, sir!

103
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,759
But

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
I think I made a mistake!

105
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,680
Yue Kong,

106
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,359
do you know what is the scariest thing

107
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,920
for a sniper?

108
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,359
It's not skills,

109
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,920
not the harsh environment,

110
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,440
not the powerful enemy,

111
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,970
but self-doubt.

112
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,920
A great sniper

113
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,120
is like a bullet that is fired.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,720
Once a bullet leaves its chamber,

115
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,239
it never has doubt over
the direction it's heading to!

116
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
If something is bothering you,

117
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,279
go and fix it.

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,520
And then,

119
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,239
do what you should do.

120
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,280
How should I fix it?

121
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,079
It's simple.

122
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,760
Face it.

123
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,639
Force yourself to accept it.

124
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,399
No matter how painful it is,

125
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,159
let it run over your heart.

126
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,800
It's fine if you can't let go,

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
but you must be clear-headed
and tell yourself

128
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,919
what choice you should make.

129
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,320
Captain Qin.

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,280
I'd like to take leave.

131
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,560
Granted!

132
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:15,583
Fire!

133
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,039
Report, sir!

134
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,800
Yue Kong requests to get back in line!

135
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:28,625
-Go!
-Yes, sir!

136
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,320
Yue,

137
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,159
after hearing your story,

138
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,599
I finally realized something.

139
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,400
You got two-timed.

140
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,679
That's mean.

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,800
You had it coming.

142
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,760
Scumbag.

143
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,320
-You were quite a scumbag indeed.
-Exactly.

144
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,599
Fine, fine. I'm a scumbag.

145
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:04,944
I had it coming.

146
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,640
So now,

147
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,800
I can only wish them happiness.

148
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:11,367
Yue,

149
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,119
so you are

150
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,680
still single now?

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,039
So what if I'm single?

152
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,414
Are you going to introduce a girl to me?

153
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:21,033
No introduction is needed.

154
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,559
There is one sitting

155
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,239
right in front of you.

156
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,479
You guys are a team, right?

157
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
You can communicate more

158
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,119
in combat and life.

159
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,479
I will communicate with you now!

160
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,322
A filthy mouth can't
utter decent things.

161
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:35,679
-Serve you well.
-It was just a joke.

162
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,200
Don't be mad.

163
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,559
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

164
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,080
What do you think?

165
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,959
Want to watch back the
video from ten days ago?

166
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,760
No need.

167
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:51,736
These ten days together

168
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,239
were like six months for them.

169
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,159
This experiment

170
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,799
is quite successful.

171
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,361
It's a pity that

172
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,520
only Yan Po Yue that brat
hasn't opened up.

173
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,639
He's still putting a wall
between himself and others.

174
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,080
That's right.

175
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,039
He's like a stone,
nothing can warm him up.

176
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,519
He's more like an egg.

177
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,640
Tough on the outside.

178
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,119
But once you crack it open,

179
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,640
his heart is softer than anyone's.

180
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
Yan Po Yue,

181
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,872
you're the only one who
hasn't told your story.

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,800
My story is boring.

183
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,359
All the more reason you should tell us.

184
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,559
While listening to you,

185
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,439
it'll help everyone to fall asleep.

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Go to sleep.

187
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,319
I'll tell you when we wake up.

188
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,280
Once I'm done,

189
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,520
the training will be over.

190
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,760
How do you know?

191
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,600
This is just

192
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,520
how he is.

193
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,880
One minute he's talking,

194
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
the next he's already snoring.

195
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,080
Let's go to sleep.

196
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,120
Wake up!

197
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,575
It's morning.

198
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,719
Wake up!

199
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,120
Hurry up.

200
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,320
The training has ended.
Get ready to leave.

201
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,960
It's over?

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,880
-Yes.
-Ten days have passed.

203
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,479
Today is the morning of the 11th day.

204
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
Really?

205
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,840
All we do is eat and sleep all day long.

206
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,000
I got all confused.

207
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,120
Hurry up.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
How did you do it?

209
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,360
What?

210
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,760
Being locked up in the basement

211
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,760
will gradually lose
the sense of time.

212
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,952
You may still be able to
time in the first or second day.

213
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,640
But ever since we came in,

214
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,280
you seem to know every cycle of

215
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,080
day and night very well.

216
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,920
That's right.

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,119
Even we veterans in Cheetah

218
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,080
can't do this.

219
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,200
You're just a new recruit.

220
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,039
How can you be sure
this is the 10th day?

221
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,119
Because I was imprisoned once.

222
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,039
The place was smaller than this one.

223
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:30,871
There was no bed

224
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,544
or toilet.

225
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,000
I was locked up for a whole month.

226
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:36,689
Was it a confinement

227
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
or a training?

228
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,959
When I was little,

229
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,440
several accomplices of a drug dealer
who my father had caught,

230
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,679
abducted me

231
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,390
on my way home after school
to get back at my father.

232
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,719
They locked me up in a cellar.

233
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,559
There were many other kids
locked up inside.

234
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,120
They were caught by human trafficker,

235
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,599
waiting for their buyer.

236
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,679
There was no light

237
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,719
and no sound all day long.

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,840
Fear and loneliness
were infinitely magnified.

239
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,399
Just for a little amount of food,

240
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,159
every day, we all fought and snatched

241
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,719
like dogs.

242
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,520
But no one dared to resist or run away,

243
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,239
because it would only
get us more beating.

244
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,239
Finally, one day,

245
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,039
I climbed out,

246
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:40,265
but no one was willing
to run away with me.

247
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,760
They kept yelling...

248
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,239
Somebody! Someone is running away!

249
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,280
Somebody! Someone is running away!

250
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,039
Because if they caught me,

251
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,960
they would get
a piece of corn in return.

252
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,000
And I kept running.

253
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:55,871
I ran like hell.

254
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:58,015
I didn't know where I could run to.

255
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,799
After that, did you get out?

256
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,560
What kind of question is that?

257
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:13,152
If he hadn't gotten away,
who is talking with you right now?

258
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,236
-What a stupid question.
-Exactly.

259
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:16,797
I ran all the way to the border post.

260
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,104
And I was saved.

261
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,359
Later, the troops found the cellar.

262
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,799
All the kids in there were rescued.

263
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,520
My dad thought that this happened

264
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:29,712
not because he wasn't vigilant enough,

265
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,799
but because I was too weak.

266
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,799
And I wanted to protect myself too.

267
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,279
After that,

268
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,022
he started to

269
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,039
give me military training.

270
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,440
Five kilometers run.

271
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,000
Weight-bearing race.

272
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,479
Combat training.

273
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,040
Those were the things I had
to finish every day after school.

274
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,800
Even during summer and winter break.

275
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,279
I trained every day.

276
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,200
How old were you at that time?

277
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:55,559
First grade.

278
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:56,793
That explains it.

279
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,680
I was wondering how a pretty boy
like you became so strong.

280
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:03,186
I've trained more than you.

281
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:05,955
But I was traumatized.

282
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,033
I've never told anyone.

283
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:16,092
Whenever I was in an enclosed space,

284
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,560
and when there was
someone in there with me,

285
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,760
my heart would beat faster

286
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,400
and I would sweat.

287
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,000
I would feel uncomfortable.

288
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:28,608
If I was in there longer,

289
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,520
I would even have difficulty breathing.

290
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,119
I remember it now.

291
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,720
It was like that time
in the confinement cell

292
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,320
when we just joined the army, right?

293
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,721
-Yan?
-Yan?

294
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,240
-Yan!
-Go get help! Go!

295
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,719
Somebody!

296
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,280
-Yan?
-Somebody, help!

297
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:53,783
Yan Po Yue is dying! Come now!

298
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,159
I locked myself up

299
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,359
in a dark room,

300
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,799
and tried to overcome it.

301
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,400
You have severe insecurity

302
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,000
and trust issue.

303
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,240
I knew the way,

304
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,080
but it was difficult to treat it.

305
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,959
Until last time,

306
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,119
during Hell Week,

307
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,040
I fell into hunter's trap.

308
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:19,942
In order to save me,

309
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,120
Guo Xiao Xiao came down after me.

310
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,680
We tried to climb out
over and over again.

311
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,040
But we failed.

312
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,719
That was the day I suddenly realized

313
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,640
I didn't palpitate

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,800
and sweat.

315
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,400
That means

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,119
you trusted Xiao Xiao.

317
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,480
Yes.

318
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,599
At that moment,

319
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
I understood how important

320
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,240
my comrades are to me.

321
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,239
This time,

322
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,599
over the past ten days,

323
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,920
when I was with you all,

324
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,439
I never

325
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,560
had those symptoms again.

326
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,599
Thank you all.

327
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,368
You cured me.

328
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,399
-That's enough.
-Cut it out.

329
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,119
We're all friends.

330
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,999
You should've told me about it sooner.
I would've cured you already.

331
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,439
This is great.

332
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,560
These ten days were not wasted.

333
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:31,520
-Yes.
-At least we healed you.

334
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:32,919
That's right.

335
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,400
And your reward

336
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,680
is five extra pounds of fat.

337
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:39,199
And you got eight pounds.

338
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,600
Come out.

339
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,719
The mission is over.

340
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:49,984
It's been ten days
since you last saw me.

341
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,840
How are you?

342
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,479
Did you miss me?

343
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:55,519
I get it.

344
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,160
I locked you up in the basement.

345
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,560
No sunshine all day.

346
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,719
You all must

347
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,719
really hate me.

348
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,600
Do you have anything
you want to say to me?

349
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Do you have any question?

350
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:11,625
Yan Po Yue.

351
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,320
-Yes, sir!
-Any questions?

352
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,560
No, sir!

353
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:15,937
Do others have questions?

354
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,119
No, sir!

355
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,920
I told you,

356
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,280
Squad 9 will have no questions.

357
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,960
At ease!

358
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:30,280
Congratulations to

359
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,640
all of you for passing
the mental training.

360
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,825
Through this period of examination
and analysis of your abilities,

361
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,079
special forces brigade

362
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,759
will make arrangements

363
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,280
to divide you for specialized training.

364
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,479
You have one day to rest.

365
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,920
Your training starts tomorrow!

366
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,199
Yes, sir!

367
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,160
(Due to)

368
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,000
(political instability and
military conflicts)

369
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,920
(in the Region M,)

370
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,400
(more and more government forces)

371
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,959
(and guerrillas are
intruding into drug trades,)

372
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,520
(which greatly reducing)

373
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,719
(the survival space of Red Scorpion.)

374
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,599
(A defeated anti-government troop)

375
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,439
(has retreated into
Red Scorpion's territory,)

376
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,040
(and has clashes with
the organization frequently.)

377
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,680
(Faced with the choice of war or truce,)

378
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,160
(Kun Sheng and Xing Tian
are in disagreement again.)

379
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:30,858
Daddy Kun,

380
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,319
these guys who retreated to
our place clearly want to conquer us.

381
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,520
They have lots of men,

382
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,760
but our weapons are better.

383
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,976
They attacked intermittently

384
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:39,096
because they're worried
that they couldn't defeat us.

385
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,800
Trying to get some advantage from us.

386
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,920
We should either take them in,

387
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,439
or destroy them.

388
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,880
If they join forces

389
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,640
with others,

390
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
we'll be in trouble.

391
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,889
If we take them in,

392
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,599
do we have enough food to feed them?

393
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:56,337
We will figure out a way.

394
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,319
The market is very competitive now.

395
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:02,233
Too many competitors

396
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,560
are trying to get a slice
of pie in the market.

397
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:08,680
Having more people
will add to our trouble.

398
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,160
Baby,

399
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
it's time to eat.

400
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,840
Daddy Kun,

401
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,359
but they refuse to leave,

402
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,920
even if we get into a fight and
manage to wipe them out,

403
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,280
our forces will be weakened too.

404
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:33,199
Our neighboring competitors will
certainly take advantage of us then.

405
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,439
We'll trade our supplies,

406
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:39,839
food and American dollars

407
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,119
for their weapons and ammunition then.

408
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,479
Just get as much as we can.

409
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,040
Once we pull out a crocodile's teeth,

410
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,560
it'll become four-legged snake.

411
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,519
It'll naturally fall apart.

412
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,119
You have no appetite?

413
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
But would they be this stupid?

414
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,879
If they weren't,

415
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:04,880
would they

416
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,160
have been defeated?

417
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,079
Come, eat something, Baby.

418
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,119
Baby,

419
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:10,599
you have no appetite?

420
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,799
I'm going to town.

421
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,439
Want me to bring you anything?

422
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,479
Just come back alive.

423
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,520
Don't get killed.

424
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,680
You want to buy my weapons with

425
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:12,056
these petty amount of stuff?

426
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,239
That's so stingy.

427
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,359
These things of yours
are old and worn out.

428
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,119
If we really get into battle,

429
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,520
half of them would be unusable.

430
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,719
If I trade these things in the South,

431
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,064
the guns I can get are ten times
better than yours.

432
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,959
You're not here to buy goods,

433
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,001
you are here to get yourself killed.

434
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,239
I'm here to buy goods,

435
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,801
but not these junks.

436
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,880
What I want to buy is

437
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,359
you,

438
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
and you guys.

439
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:01,719
Very well, very well.

440
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,959
Come on, tell me.

441
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,479
What are we worth?

442
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,601
The entire region.

443
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,120
These things I brought today

444
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,880
are just welcome gift.

445
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,199
The deposit

446
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,140
is all the areas
controlled by Red Scorpion.

447
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,520
Full payment

448
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:22,449
is the entire region.

449
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,760
I've always wanted to know this,

450
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:33,398
between Daddy Kun and I,

451
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,839
if one of us has to die,

452
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
which one of us do you wish to survive?

453
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,400
People in the village said that

454
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:49,239
you are the first person
who called him Daddy Kun.

455
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,120
You're indebted to him?

456
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,879
He used to sell me.

457
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,479
I was born in a small town
close to China's border.

458
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,839
When I was a kid, my parents
died of drug overdose.

459
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,880
I was starving at home.

460
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,199
So, I crossed the border
and came to China.

461
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:12,443
I ran into Daddy Kun.

462
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,040
He caught me and
locked me up in a cellar.

463
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,040
He was a human trafficker.

464
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,680
I thought that it was
a money-losing business to him.

465
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,560
Because no one would buy me.

466
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,959
In that deep well,
there were a few more children,

467
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,280
I didn't know where they were from.

468
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,320
After that,

469
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,000
more kids were thrown into the cellar.

470
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,079
We didn't have enough food.

471
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,920
I had to fight to get it.

472
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,920
But in that little deep well,

473
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,280
I felt secured.

474
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,840
In there,

475
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,640
as long as you were
strong and ruthless enough,

476
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,920
you could get food.

477
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,760
In that well,

478
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,319
no one dared to look down on me.

479
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
Later,

480
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,880
a kid got out.

481
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,640
He wanted to take us with him.

482
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
The moment he extended his hand to me,

483
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,959
I suddenly realized that

484
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,479
once I left,

485
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,119
my good life would be over.

486
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,040
Somebody! Someone is running away!
I shouted.

487
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,399
I tried to get those stupid
human trafficker to catch him.

488
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,599
Somebody! Someone is running away!

489
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,934
But he still got away.

490
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,239
As I expected,

491
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,920
the Chinese police
found us a few days later.

492
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,800
And they got us out.

493
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,040
I didn't appreciate it at all.

494
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,520
Because I still had nowhere else

495
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,680
to go after I got out.

496
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,079
I ran,

497
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:34,920
I walked,

498
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,640
I didn't know where I could go.

499
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,239
I really missed that well.

500
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,080
-What do you want?
-Take me with you.

501
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,920
-Go away.
-Take me with you.

502
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,720
Please.

503
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,840
Take me...

504
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,159
What are you doing?

505
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,000
He... He's my dad.

506
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,480
He... He came out to work
and was cheated.

507
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,637
We can't afford food.

508
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,199
My son is hungry.

509
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:15,999
He's making a fuss.

510
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,640
Here, have some.

511
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,160
Buy your son a meal.

512
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,400
Buy tickets and go home.

513
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,279
Thank you.

514
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:32,813
Thank you.

515
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,880
Dad, let's go.

516
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,285
Do you know who I am?

517
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:42,294
I know.

518
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,504
Why do you still
want to follow me then?

519
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,560
My parents are dead.

520
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,640
From now on, you're my dad.

521
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,480
Son,

522
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,960
let's go eat.

523
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:05,184
After that,

524
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,304
he took me across the border,

525
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,880
and we ended up here.

526
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,640
And then,

527
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,000
we joined Red Scorpion.

528
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:15,949
And you know everything after that.

529
00:28:17,287 --> 00:28:20,004
The best part hasn't started yet.

530
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,719
The best part

531
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,113
has only just started.

532
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,481
Tomorrow morning,

533
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:37,301
Daddy Kun is sending me
to the South to deliver goods.

534
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:41,051
Between Daddy Kun and you,

535
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,760
I'll follow the one who survives.

536
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,703
Everyone knows this is your turf.

537
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:09,119
That's a no-man's land.

538
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:11,000
Extremely valuable.

539
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,040
If we cooperate,

540
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,720
together we will go north

541
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,359
and make a path for ourselves in China,

542
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,440
we will make lots of
money then, won't we?

543
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,280
I'm getting old.

544
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,520
I

545
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,199
just want to earn money with

546
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,574
my brothers here safely.

547
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:38,254
But our brothers are still young.

548
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,809
They don't just want
to earn money safely.

549
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:02,862
Perhaps

550
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm really getting old.

551
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,439
My mind is no longer sharp.

552
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,280
Allow me

553
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:12,560
and my brothers to consider about it.

554
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:13,519
Lai,

555
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,400
see them out.

556
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,560
Looks like our brothers

557
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,160
have made up their mind.

558
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,359
Our brothers have
held back for a long time.

559
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,119
I can't talk them out of it.

560
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:57,919
I see.

561
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,560
I see.

562
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,359
Give me a field

563
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,880
and let me grow poppies then.

564
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,599
Daddy Kun,

565
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,800
you've been teaching me

566
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:20,967
Red Scorpion's tradition.

567
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,537
The leader

568
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:25,834
must abdicate.

569
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,479
Who is going to kill me?

570
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,560
I'll never forget that you were the one

571
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,239
who raised me.

572
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,399
Since you insist on
going north to deal with

573
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,599
the Chinese special forces,

574
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,841
you can only beat them with artillery.

575
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:48,400
I got it,

576
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,199
Daddy Kun.

577
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
(Counter-terrorism infiltration
explosives removal training)

578
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,119
This is so cool.

579
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,920
It's just like Game for Peace.

580
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,679
I don't want to land and die instantly.

581
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,439
-Be serious.
-Don't worry.

582
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,880
This little challenge is
easy and enjoyable for me.

583
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,280
We're in the minefield.

584
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,119
Hang tight.

585
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,039
Target is spotted.

586
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:36,719
Target is in the northeast corner.

587
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:37,941
Second floor.

588
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,600
From the front
of the building to the back,

589
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,679
the patrol soldiers take
two minutes and ten seconds.

590
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,399
We have only two minutes.

591
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,360
What's going on?

592
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,600
I haven't even touched it.
And the countdown started already.

593
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
It's connected to wires underneath.

594
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,439
This is your defusal mission.

595
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:17,439
Solve the Rubik's Cube and take it
out before the countdown runs out.

596
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,880
Yan,

597
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,000
honestly, I've never been able to

598
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,800
figure out Rubik's Cube
since I was little.

599
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,120
I know.

600
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,080
Four minutes and 35 second left.

601
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,120
Hurry up.

602
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
The wire is too tight.

603
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,439
If you take it out before you solve it,

604
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
you'll trigger the alarm.

605
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,280
Whose terrible idea is this?

606
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,199
The water is so cold.

607
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:49,999
It's not hard.

608
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,560
Easy.

609
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,920
Keep going.

610
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,280
You can do it. Believe in yourself.

611
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,639
You can do it. You're almost there.

612
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,640
Done!

613
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,719
Congratulations. Mission accomplished.

614
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,880
Xiao,

615
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:21,560
this is your first mission as a blaster.

616
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,479
For me, a mission like this is

617
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,360
easy.

618
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,320
Is it?

619
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:29,560
True.

620
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:31,159
You used five minutes.

621
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:34,039
That's because the water was too cold.

622
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,520
You try it.

623
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,750
I don't need to try.

624
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,400
I used to play it when I was a kid.

625
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:40,386
Unlike you.

626
00:41:40,605 --> 00:41:42,004
You have to use your head more.

627
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,199
Yan Po Yue, I didn't know you
when I was a kid.

628
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,120
Hot buns are so nice.

629
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:51,406
I never thought

630
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,800
hot buns can be so nice.

631
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:54,279
-It's awesome.
-Here you go.

632
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,320
Warm your hands.

633
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,441
Here, you can have mine too.

634
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,560
You have to finish it.

635
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,560
Don't waste food.

636
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:01,759
Finish them all?

637
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:03,199
It's fine.

638
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:04,399
I haven't washed my hands anyway.

639
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,159
If I can't finish it,
you guys will help me.

640
00:42:06,964 --> 00:42:08,404
Camouflage reconnaissance training

641
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,120
(Counter-terrorism camouflage infiltration)
requires participants to

642
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,120
(reconnaissance sniper training)
form a team of three.

643
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,239
You will advance 300 meters

644
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:15,679
in camouflage to the reconnaissance
firing line within 30 minutes.

645
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,799
You're required to read the six numbers
in the spotter's position,

646
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,760
and shoot two targets.

647
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,040
Please note that during this period,
six searchers will...

648
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,440
Let's split up and sneak in.

649
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
Then, we'll meet here.

650
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,600
-I disagree.
-Bai,

651
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,520
that area is covered with plants.

652
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,760
There is a slope below.

653
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,900
It's perfect for
concealment and retreat.
