(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,720
(Episode 4)

4
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,919
What are you doing?

5
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,839
Yan, this is your first time.

6
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,519
Don't cut your fingers.

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,240
Stop.

8
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,360
Did you cut this?

9
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,120
Does this look edible to you?

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,199
Step aside!

11
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,040
So many onions are wasted.

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,040
Watch and learn.

13
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,919
Cut it diagonally.

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,720
Chopping onions well is a skill too.

15
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,479
Go! Go!

16
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,320
Go! Throw faster!

17
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,600
-Hurry!
-Soldiers of kitchen squad

18
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,559
are so motivated.

19
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:34,776
Pull harder, pull harder.

20
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,199
What are you looking at, Yan?
Pull harder.

21
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,359
They are doing new training programme.

22
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:46,872
Yan,

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,560
we have to love what we do.

24
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,640
We belong to the kitchen squad,

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
don't bother to envy
them for lifting tires.

26
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,119
If you really want to practice,
there is a way.

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
It seems to me that

28
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,840
the tire weighs about
the same as our cart.

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,840
If you really want to, why don't
you pull it back all by yourself?

30
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,081
What do you say?

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,120
It was just a joke.

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,361
Strongest Yan, you're the coolest!

33
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,080
Carry the slop! Work harder!

34
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,399
Strongest Yan!

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,080
Strongest Yan!

36
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,520
What's with the sigh?

37
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,759
It's only been a few days,

38
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,199
but the recruit already
knows how to cut vegetables.

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,160
This is all thanks to your teaching.

40
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,336
He cut all of these?

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,399
Steady, accurate and hard.

42
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,959
It's not like I'm willing to teach him.

43
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,516
If he won't obey orders,

44
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:49,717
assigning him to kitchen squad
won't help him.

45
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,360
Come on.

46
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,479
Fan,

47
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,240
you think I don't know you?

48
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,640
You're tough on the outside,

49
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
but on your inside,
it's as soft as noodles.

50
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
I love peppercorns,

51
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,960
I put peppercorns in stir fries,

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,110
I put peppercorns in stews,

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,240
I even put some peppercorns in soups.

54
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
Is he the peppercorn?

55
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,279
I'm the peppercorn.

56
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,319
There is hidden meaning in your words.

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Enough with the nonsense.

58
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,600
The noodles are ready.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm going out to get some air.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,319
I'd advise you to stay in.

61
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
What's wrong?

62
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,119
Come on.

63
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,640
After they finished their tasks,
they started practising.

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,040
They didn't even get much sleep.

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,240
It's like they're made of metal.

66
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,600
Xiao, can we take a break?

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
No.

68
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,119
Well, say something, sir.

69
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,200
Our men watch them practice every day,

70
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,799
no one knows why they are doing this.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,839
It's bugging us.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,760
Have they finished their daily tasks?

73
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,879
I mean,

74
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,999
you're supposed to rest
after you finish your task,

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
right?

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,893
Everyday, we wake up early and sleep
late, burying ourselves in the kitchen.

77
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,360
We already don't have enough sleep,

78
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:18,360
and practising like this every day...

79
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,679
Did he affect your rest?

80
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,079
If he keeps practising like this, do you
think it'll make us feel comfortable?

81
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,679
What's more,

82
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,760
what is the duty of kitchen squad?

83
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,880
Training?

84
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,160
Do you want me to order him
to stop practising?

85
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,040
It's undermining our unity.

86
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,200
It's called having ambitions.

87
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:42,651
What's wrong with kitchen squad?

88
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,920
Kitchen squad needs combat power too.

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,160
Hang in there! Hang in there!

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,399
One more! One more!

91
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,399
Sir.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,440
Sir.

93
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:01,919
Sir.

94
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,119
What are you doing?

95
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,440
We're practising in the farm.

96
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,479
We should practice,
if the conditions allow.

97
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
If it's not, we'll still figure
something out and keep practising.

98
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,879
Kitchen soldiers should
be combat-ready too.

99
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,000
That is true.

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,600
But what about the skills
of kitchen squad?

101
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,920
We're learning hard
for all cooking methods.

102
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,600
We study the recipes every day
so that we won't give you trouble.

103
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
We only practice during breaks.
It doesn't interfere with our duty.

104
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,079
Sir,

105
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,679
you can give us any test

106
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:23,660
and you'll know.

107
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,480
Okay.

108
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,559
Any test.

109
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Lifting dumbbells.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,359
Squatting, deadlifting.

111
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,839
Bench press.

112
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,239
pick one.

113
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,239
Very confident.

114
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,839
We're not competing this.

115
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:40,791
Get changed and come with me.

116
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,839
Put down the firewood.

117
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,399
Dress right!

118
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,079
Eyes front!

119
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,000
Today's training programme

120
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,720
is very simple.

121
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
Outdoor smokeless cooking.

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
The setting is

123
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,320
battlefield.

124
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,055
Your test is

125
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,239
to set up a smokeless stove

126
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,440
and prepare a proper meal.

127
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,040
-Report, sir!
-What?

128
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,359
Can we do other test?

129
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,320
Five kilometres running,
capture, fighting, anything else.

130
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,640
When you belong to the kitchen squad,

131
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,760
you are a kitchen soldier!

132
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
What is the root of a kitchen soldier?

133
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,720
Serving the soldiers!

134
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,318
What are our basic skills?

135
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,399
Setting up stove and cooking!

136
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,920
-Report, sir!
-What?

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,641
I understood what you're saying.

138
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,697
We need to dig a hole
and bury some dirt,

139
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:41,743
and cook a meal without smoke, right?

140
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,320
Correct.

141
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,040
But that doesn't make sense.

142
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:48,440
It seems impossible
to cook without smoke.

143
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:49,697
On the battlefield,

144
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,880
you can make fire
without producing smoke.

145
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
If there is smoke, are you trying
to tell the enemy where you are?

146
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,239
I don't understand!

147
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,120
What?

148
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,879
The rolling kitchen
is readily available.

149
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,600
There are a lot of
portable cooking tools too.

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,799
Why do we have to dig a stove?

151
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,839
The enemy has cut off our supply lines.

152
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,880
The rolling kitchen and tools
have been blown up.

153
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,200
If you don't cook,
are our soldiers going to eat dirt?

154
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Report, sir!

155
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,400
What about canned food
and fortified biscuits?

156
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:12,653
We're surrounded.

157
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,480
We have run out of portable rations,

158
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,079
leaving only the rice.

159
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,960
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

160
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,841
Start digging!

161
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,120
Yes, sir.

162
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,239
Yan, you know how to do this too?

163
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,599
I'm trying.

164
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,479
Steady.

165
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:41,479
-Sir, sir.
-Yes?

166
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,599
I mean,

167
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,159
your words are so inspiring.

168
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,960
I just remembered that

169
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
during the Red Army's long march,

170
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:51,239
didn't the kitchen soldiers also use

171
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,519
these pots to feed our soldiers?

172
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,599
Shut up!

173
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,159
What a suck-up.

174
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,080
Keep digging.

175
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,039
Carry on.

176
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,000
What is this?

177
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,520
Yan, you can't handle this too.

178
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,000
You don't know how to do it.

179
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,159
Lu Xiao Tian.

180
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,080
How did you do it?

181
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,640
Looks like you're doing great.

182
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,280
It's just smokeless cooking.

183
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,559
Sometimes,

184
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,159
even I'm afraid of myself.

185
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,799
When I concentrate,

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
I don't even pee when I poop.

187
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,479
Let me take a look.

188
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,840
Let me see it first.

189
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
I think the fire has gone out.

190
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,400
-Something is not right.
-It is right. Just give me a minute.

191
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,880
Why does this look
like self-heating hot pot?

192
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,119
No, you're mistaken.

193
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,880
The fire has gone out.
Just let me start it again.

194
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,880
Xiao...

195
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Wow.

196
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,000
You're cheating.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,159
No, no.

198
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,479
-Are you done?
-Squad Leader.

199
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,359
Squad Leader is here.

200
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,201
Are you becoming a deity?

201
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,801
Good job.

202
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,401
You exposed yourself.

203
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,441
You three are dead now.

204
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,119
Sir,

205
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,919
mine is smokeless.

206
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,000
Smokeless indeed.

207
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:31,769
But is there any fire?

208
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,879
Go stand at attention for an hour.

209
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,679
You heard him.

210
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
Go now.

211
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,320
Report, sir.

212
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,359
Can I peel potatoes instead?

213
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,719
Are you going or not?

214
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,840
Go now.

215
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,400
Is there anything else
you would like to say?

216
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,840
I don't know how to do it.

217
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,040
Sir, please teach us.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,919
Okay!

219
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:00,048
Come.

220
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,239
Ground oven

221
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,799
is the same as the gas stove
in the kitchen.

222
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,440
How can you vent smoke without a flue?

223
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,320
What use can it be to just dig a stove?

224
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,559
Watch how I do it.

225
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,440
Cover the flue

226
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,000
with wet leaves,

227
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,039
so that the smoke doesn't come out.

228
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,159
Go open that pot.

229
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,280
The older, the wiser indeed.

230
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,640
Anyone in the kitchen squad
could dig a stove like this.

231
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,560
Well, of course,

232
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,760
except for you three.

233
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,320
Are you impressed?

234
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,399
I am.

235
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,279
Should we stand at attention
or peel potatoes?

236
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,119
Running is fine too.

237
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,880
Did I say I was going to punish you?

238
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:26,249
He cheated.

239
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,559
You two were practical.

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,560
Kitchen squad may seem insignificant,

241
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,039
but we have a lot of skills too.

242
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,520
So don't be arrogant.

243
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,239
So humble yourself.

244
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,119
Stop thinking that
you're better than others.

245
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:40,359
No matter how advanced the equipment is,

246
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,719
the old traditions of
the army cannot be lost.

247
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,760
The legacy of our seniors

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,559
must be passed on.

249
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,760
As for your punishment...

250
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,240
Lu Xiao Tian.

251
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,839
-Yes, sir!
-Come here.

252
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
Yes, sir.

253
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,599
You three,

254
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,000
finish the rice in the pot.

255
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,479
Report!

256
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,599
Can we have some dishes to go with it?

257
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,440
We are a family of three.

258
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
Fan,

259
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,039
I heard no one could handle

260
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,239
the two difficult recruits.

261
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:29,119
You somehow managed
to get them listen to you.

262
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,760
Listen to that.

263
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,200
It's nothing difficult.

264
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,400
There is

265
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,640
no soldier I can't handle.

266
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,520
Look how smug you are.

267
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,039
Their words are not enough,

268
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,719
they have to really be
impressed by you from heart.

269
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,919
Listen to yourself.

270
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,239
They can try to disobey me,

271
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,799
and I'll teach them a lesson.

272
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,960
Squad Leader.

273
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,239
The training base needs more supplies.

274
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
We need to make a trip.

275
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,359
Got it.

276
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,320
-Get the car ready.
-It's ready.

277
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,599
You guys eat.

278
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,960
Okay, go on.

279
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,960
Bring the three with us.

280
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,890
Is it necessary to bring so
many people for supply delivery?

281
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,840
If I don't take them with us,
who else can handle them?

282
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,159
Just bring them.

283
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,559
It'll put my minds at ease.

284
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,599
Might as well

285
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,880
send them to feed the chickens.

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,239
Out of sight, out of mind.

287
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:24,960
It's not a bad idea.

288
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,400
Better than feeding the pigs.

289
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,719
You're such a wimp.

290
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,120
Hills need not be high to be famous,
as long as there is presence of gods.

291
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:33,766
Soldiers need not be strong, it's
good enough as long as they are useful.

292
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:34,919
Next,

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,520
I will spend my free time

294
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,241
developing my business.

295
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,200
You have a business?

296
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:46,599
Check this out.

297
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,640
Lu Xiao Tian,

298
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:52,320
you're not thinking of
growing marijuana, are you?

299
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,679
Second Place Xiao,
think before you speak, okay?

300
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,000
You want to grow herbs in the army.

301
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,559
Yan sure knows what he's talking about.

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Saffron

303
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
is a valuable medicinal herbs.

304
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,440
I had it sent from home.

305
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,679
With the connections
we have built up in the army,

306
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,840
growing a few saffron bases

307
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,159
on these hills shouldn't be a problem.

308
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,960
Don't underestimate this.

309
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,000
If we grow it in the army,

310
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,559
it's called military quality.

311
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,493
In ten years,

312
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
or 20 years, at most,

313
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,960
big fish won't stay in
a small pond forever,

314
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,960
we are bound to build a great business.

315
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,240
Shut up!

316
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,280
On the border,

317
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,039
criminals often wreak havoc.

318
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,919
Our mission is to ensure
the safety of people's lives.

319
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,702
There is no time
for your unrealistic dreams.

320
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,760
Whoever is planning something,
you can pack your stuff and leave.

321
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,640
Oh no.

322
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,760
Has my trade secret been compromised?

323
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,719
Lu Xiao Tian,

324
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,480
having brain is good,
but please use it on the right thing.

325
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,519
I just want to do something
useful on my own time.

326
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,320
Is that wrong?

327
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,839
A soldier's life belongs to
the nation and the people.

328
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,280
We don't have any own time.

329
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:52,919
Repeat it.

330
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:56,000
A soldier...

331
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,280
Forget it.

332
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,561
(Emergency alert.)

333
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,573
(According to the latest news
from Public Security Department,)

334
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,880
(three cross-border drug traffickers
have been caught.)

335
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:10,432
(There are suspects still at large.)

336
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,200
(Public are reminded to pay attention)

337
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,159
(to the safety of their
lives and property.)

338
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,199
The training base is
located near the border.

339
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,479
We have to...

340
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,599
What's wrong with that rider? He...

341
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:30,838
Oh no, we have a problem.

342
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,959
Guo, I'll go check it out.

343
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,400
Get down.

344
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,900
Come on, hurry up.

345
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,159
-Don't move!
-Hurry.

346
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,359
Take off his helmet.

347
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,280
What's wrong with him?

348
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:11,053
He's having withdrawal symptoms.
He's very likely to a drug trafficker.

349
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,559
So this is how a drug trafficker
looks like?

350
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,520
Hold him down. Now.

351
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,320
Turn him over.

352
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,079
Sir, what are you doing?

353
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,760
Turn him over.

354
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,199
Xiao Yun Jie, search his bag.

355
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,000
The gun is loaded.

356
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:46,999
Sir.

357
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,359
Take off your belt,
so we can tie him down.

358
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,519
What are you waiting for?

359
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,320
Take it off.

360
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,440
Sir,

361
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,040
can we get a credit for this?

362
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,920
Cut the crap.

363
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,280
♫ Flying through the sky ♫

364
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,640
♫ Flying ♫

365
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,839
Can you shut up?

366
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Kuo Gui, I mean, Guo Kui,

367
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,559
this is such a big deal,
why can't I celebrate it a little?

368
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,040
I'll get at least a third-class merit.

369
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,520
-What did you contribute?
-I handed my belt over timely.

370
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,119
Without my belt, we would've lost him.

371
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,239
Oh my,

372
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,959
you actually remembered
to wear your belt today.

373
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,719
Very funny, Guo Kui.

374
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,000
Behave yourself.

375
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,040
It's going to rain.

376
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:58,160
You're dead meat.

377
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,480
Go.

378
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,800
About two kilograms of drugs.

379
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,119
We've locked the man up.

380
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,760
Roger that.

381
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,359
Rest assured, Chief,

382
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
we'll keep a close watch on him.

383
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,879
Yes, sir.

384
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,479
Goodbye.

385
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,480
What did he say?

386
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:08,521
The rain is too heavy.

387
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,880
Cars couldn't come up.

388
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,520
The regiment and the police
will take him away tomorrow.

389
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,319
Fan, you got lucky.

390
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,119
You were just sending supplies,
but you got a chance to earn credits.

391
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,400
Gao,

392
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,400
you mustn't take this lightly.

393
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,600
The regiment has communicated
with public security.

394
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,760
There must be a big case on this man.

395
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,640
Now that he's here in our base,

396
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,439
there is no way he can escape.

397
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,920
Stop messing around.

398
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,319
I need a belt.

399
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,920
Wait here.

400
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,560
Come here.

401
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,839
You speak Chinese.

402
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,040
Come here.

403
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,200
If you have anything to say, speak up.

404
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,839
What does your family do?

405
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,000
Is it any of your business?

406
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,600
How did you end up here as a soldier?

407
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,319
To catch you.

408
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,959
Catch me?

409
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
You'll have to go home

410
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,439
to earn a living after
your military service.

411
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,319
How about this?

412
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,040
I'll give you all the money

413
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,359
you can spend for the rest of your life.

414
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,479
Stupid.

415
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,680
Let me tell you,

416
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,160
it's for your own good to let me go.

417
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,119
Yan,

418
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,079
go have your dinner.
I'll watch him for you.

419
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,719
You came back to life.

420
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,800
No more foaming.

421
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,361
I brought your dinner.

422
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Chinese soldiers are nice to prisoners.

423
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,719
I'll keep an eye on him for you.

424
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

425
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,439
Look at this state, what else can he do?

426
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,040
What did you say?

427
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,400
You're going to die tonight.

428
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,760
And you,

429
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,160
go and have your dinner.

430
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,880
It'll be your last meal!

431
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,079
What's with the madness?

432
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,719
Stupid drug dealer, behave yourself.

433
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,700
Two options.

434
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,179
Shut up,

435
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:46,640
or,

436
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:48,569
I'll help you shut up.

437
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,239
Military truck, FAW Jiefang.

438
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,479
Fully loaded truck.

439
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,721
Fan,

440
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
why are you still awake?

441
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
I'll take the first watch.

442
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,519
Assign another man.

443
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,680
You take the second watch.

444
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,920
I've got everything arranged.

445
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,079
Just go to sleep.

446
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:31,000
My eyes keep twitching.

447
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,600
This rain is a little unusual.

448
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,360
How about this?

449
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
We'll take two-hour shifts.

450
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:40,911
There's been a lot of
trouble on this border lately.

451
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,680
Several large drug syndicates
often send men

452
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,079
across the border to sell drugs.

453
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,160
Police alerts come in once every day.

454
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,359
You only have one squad here.

455
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,400
Don't spread out your men
too thin during patrol.

456
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:52,799
Careful that you might
run into armed drug dealers.

457
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,840
We have rehearsed
the contingency numerous times.

458
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:57,845
Those fugitives better not run into us.

459
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,359
This rain is a little unusual indeed.

460
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,079
He's been asleep for a while.

461
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,270
He's pretending.

462
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:37,958
How do you know?

463
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,479
Look at his body.

464
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,959
It's not relaxed.

465
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:45,373
His breathing is short.

466
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,599
He's thinking.

467
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,000
He's meditating.

468
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
What is that noise?

469
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,599
Can you tell what sound is that?

470
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
It seems to be the sound
of a flute from Myanmar.

471
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,920
Yan,

472
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,079
this place is creepy.

473
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,839
Is it haunted?

474
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,440
He's having withdrawal symptoms.

475
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,680
He's exchanging signals.

476
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,800
Find something to gag him now.

477
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,840
Stop moving.

478
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,320
Are you okay, Yan?

479
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,640
Oh no, come on.

480
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Hurry.

481
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,840
Sniper.

482
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:12,519
Oh no.

483
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,199
Everyone, do not walk through the yard.

484
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,040
Crouch against the wall.

485
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:32,119
Keep in mind that you
mustn't turn on your torch.

486
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:32,959
Yes, sir.

487
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,280
Bai, Dong,

488
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:42,000
throw smoke grenades
to confuse the enemy.

489
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,560
Zhi Qiang, through the
back door of the garage.

490
00:30:43,656 --> 00:30:45,097
Get the sentries to safety.

491
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,720
Sir!

492
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,440
Hang in there.

493
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,359
Hang in there. Hang in there.

494
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,680
Quick, get him over here.

495
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,159
Move out of the way.

496
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Slow down, slow down.

497
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,039
Don't crowd him.

498
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,323
Spread out, give him some air.

499
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,680
Lu Xiao Tian, shine the flash light here.

500
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,199
Hold him down. Hold him down.

501
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,720
Hang in there.

502
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Hold him.

503
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,520
Hold on, you have to hold on.

504
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,239
Bear with it. Hang in there.

505
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,040
Hold on, hold on.

506
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,839
You're fine now.

507
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:48,617
Yan.

508
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,360
Sir.

509
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,960
What are you doing here?

510
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,160
Xiao Yun Jie is watching him.

511
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:02,015
I'm here to help.

512
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,719
No gunshot heard,

513
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,399
which means they are using silencer.

514
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
No one in sight,

515
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,199
means it's long range shot.

516
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:13,699
And he has night vision goggles.

517
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,319
Our enemy is well armed,
and their numbers are unknown.

518
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,519
It's highly likely that they came
for this man in the warehouse.

519
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:19,325
Fan,

520
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,879
I'll leave the drug dealer
and the wounded to you.

521
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,040
I'll take the men and
set up a defensive line.

522
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,159
-Let's go!
-Wait.

523
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,040
The enemy is in the shadows,
and we are in the light.

524
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,479
Be more cautious when you shoot.

525
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,680
Sir, the power supply box is broken.

526
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,839
Calls can't be made.

527
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,839
Gao, does the post have a radio?

528
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,080
There is one in the warehouse.

529
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:34,919
Yan Po Yue,

530
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
go to the warehouse and find the radio.

531
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,599
Contact the regiment.

532
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,159
-Have them send reinforcements.
-Yes, sir.

533
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,239
You and Lu Xiao Tian stay here
to look after the wounded.

534
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,080
Yes, sir.

535
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:47,919
Prepare for combat.

536
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,440
Keep in mind that

537
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,160
you mustn't turn on the lights.

538
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,440
Yan.

539
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,280
Yan, how did it go?

540
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,479
What are you looking for?

541
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,600
You sit still.

542
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,040
What are you looking for?

543
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,519
I found it.

544
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:32,278
Yan,

545
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,479
how do we set this up?

546
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,840
Sir.

547
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,959
Hold this.

548
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,679
Stop.

549
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,919
It'll be your turn
when all of us veterans are dead.

550
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,399
Old Dog Fan!

551
00:34:58,919 --> 00:34:59,719
Plug it in.

552
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,360
Contact the regiment,
request for reinforcements.

553
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,199
Yes, sir.

554
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,240
You are the Dog of the
Dragon, Tiger, and Dog?

555
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,639
Contact them now.

556
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,159
Wait, he...

557
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,840
He's one of the strongest
Dragon, Tiger and Dog

558
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,000
in the regiment?

559
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,159
From here,

560
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,679
and here, we will work together
to form active defence.

561
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,719
But the power box is broken.

562
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:35,800
The sniper is here.

563
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,360
We would be very passive.

564
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,360
Look for opportunity to activate
the back-up power box.

565
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,360
Yes, sir!

566
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,160
Gao,

567
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:57,359
I'll leave this to you.
I'll go to the garage.

568
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:02,959
It's powered.

569
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:04,199
Take a look at it.

570
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:12,199
This.

571
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,800
01, 01.

572
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:31,839
Change place?

573
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,679
01, 01. Do you copy?

574
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,679
Is it the right channel?

575
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,239
It's the right one.

576
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,520
The signal is poor.

577
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,080
Too much interference.

578
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,959
(Say again. Say again.)

579
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,320
01, 01, this is Tiger Three Five.

580
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:13,199
Tiger Three Five.

581
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,800
(Copy.)

582
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,040
Tiger Three Five is under attack.

583
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,199
Enemy is unknown.

584
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:19,279
Requesting backup.

585
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,560
Two of our men were shot.

586
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,679
(Copy. Please stay in touch.)

587
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:29,000
-Copy.
-Attack now! What are you waiting for?

588
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,560
What are you waiting for?

589
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:34,760
Shut up, stay still!

590
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,960
Take it.

591
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,800
(Tiger Three Five, please reply.)

592
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,480
Tiger Three Five copy.

593
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,639
(Please identify yourself, over.)

594
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:22,660
Private Yan Po Yue,

595
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,519
Squad 247, Special Service Company,
over.

596
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,439
(Copy.)

597
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,800
(Tiger Three Five,
reinforcements are in preparation.)

598
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,239
Copy.

599
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,199
Yan,

600
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,439
why don't we go help them?

601
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,040
Our mission is to keep an eye on him.

602
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,640
(Tiger Three Five, Tiger Three Five.)

603
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:20,582
Tiger Three Five copy.

604
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,200
(Reinforcements are on their way.)

605
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:23,221
(How is your situation?)

606
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,600
We had a crossfire.

607
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,800
I did not participate.
I'm not sure of the situation.

608
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,080
(Why didn't you participate?)

609
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:33,520
We caught a drug dealer.

610
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,160
The squad leader ordered me and
another comrade to watch him.

611
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:37,719
Who are you?

612
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:39,199
(I...)

613
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:40,680
(I am Staff Officer, Li Guo Sheng.)

614
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
(Please describe
the current situation in detail.)

615
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,560
(Our superior needs information.)

616
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,560
Yan, why don't you tell him

617
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,560
we are in the warehouse?

618
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,600
Please tell your superior that

619
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,560
the situation is very critical.

620
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,680
Reinforcements need to be quick.

621
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
(Do you have weapon?)

622
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:03,493
Yes.

623
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,280
(We have reported to the higher-up.)

624
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,879
(The helicopter has been dispatched.)

625
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:07,919
(Due to the weather,)

626
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,479
(the helicopter is
unable to locate you.)

627
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,399
We are all at the post.

628
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:19,320
(Helicopter landing
guidance is required.)

629
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,080
(Do you have flares or lights?)

630
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,239
No.

631
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,560
(The light at the sentry post
can be used as a guide.)

632
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,159
(Turn on the lights.)
