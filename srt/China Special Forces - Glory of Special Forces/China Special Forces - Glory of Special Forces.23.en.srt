(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:33,720
(Episode 23)

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,680
Report!

5
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,319
An eight-man squad isn't agile enough.

6
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,279
Our advance is too slow.

7
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:38,639
It hasn't achieved
the effectiveness of a raid.

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,680
It'll only affect our speed
if I act overcautiously.

9
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,480
Do you think you'll face enemies
like them on the battlefield?

10
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,040
Do you think your enemies
will show you mercy?

11
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,120
Do you think so?

12
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,599
Listen.

13
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,919
When you're surrounded by enemies,

14
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:52,680
what is your goal?

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,239
Your goal is to accomplish the mission

16
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,400
and go home safely

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,599
with your comrades.

18
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,800
Killing more people is never the goal!

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
If we progress faster,

20
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,680
our military capability

21
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,353
will be so much better!

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,279
Yan Po Yue!

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,559
Have some team spirit!

24
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,679
Care for a match?

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,919
What is worth for a match?

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Are you telling all of us
to follow your pace?

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,559
We will never know if it works
if we never try it.

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,679
That's enough! Shut up!

29
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,800
All of them are talking rubbish.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,080
Remember the battle plan!

31
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,360
Come again!

32
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,679
Move!

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,920
Let's go.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,520
Let's go.

35
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:39,845
I was shot!

36
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Mu Qing, save him!

37
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,880
Yan Po Yue! Xiao Yun Jie! Cover them!

38
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,920
Where are the rest?

39
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,559
They're staying back
to help the injured.

40
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,640
That's enough! Fall in!

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,759
Fall in around Yan Po Yue!

42
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,959
Yan Po Yue!

43
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:07,559
Here!

44
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,119
Fall out!

45
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,680
Yes!

46
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,679
In this simulation training,

47
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,799
besides Yan Po Yue,

48
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,640
everyone else is considered dead!

49
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,839
The mission is a failure!

50
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,321
Yan Po Yue, are you crazy?

51
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,353
Can't you see that
your comrades were down?

52
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,880
You didn't bother to cover them!
Why did you run away?

53
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,119
It's not even necessary
to have so many people

54
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,239
attempting to accomplish the mission.

55
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,200
I dare you to repeat!

56
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,120
Yan Po Yue!

57
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,040
You're too arrogant!

58
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,320
What is going on?

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,281
I haven't even left this place.

60
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,720
It's just the first day
of the group training.

61
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,880
Are you having an internal conflict?

62
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,559
What is going on?

63
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Attention!

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
Captain.

65
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,840
What is with the ruckus?

66
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
Nothing.

67
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,000
A few useless rookies
are having some conflicts.

68
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,720
Is Yan Po Yue trying to
steal the limelight again?

69
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,080
Report!

70
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,560
He didn't do that.

71
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,920
We're merely having a discussion
on the battle plan.

72
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,800
Yes.

73
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,520
We're just discussing
about the battle plan.

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,520
Is that true?

75
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,320
Yes.

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,200
Discussing among the group members
is a good practice.

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Let's go for lunch.

78
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,840
You may discuss the plan while eating.

79
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,520
-Bai Long.
-Yes!

80
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,640
Come to my office now.

81
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:27,520
Yes.

82
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,160
What's wrong?

83
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,681
Do you want to eat?

84
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,640
Yes.

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,160
Aren't you ashamed to have lunch
because you have failed in your mission?

86
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,239
Since you've failed,
you should embrace your failure.

87
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,800
Now,

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
each of you have to do 200 push-ups.

89
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,240
The person who just asked for lunch
will have to do 300 push-ups.

90
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,520
Then, run 5,000 meters around the field.

91
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Do it now.

92
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,040
Bai Long.

93
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:09,760
Thank you.

94
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,200
When was the last time
we had a private talk?

95
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,306
I'm so glad

96
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:17,620
that you're back.

97
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,241
Look.

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,399
Nothing has changed in the camp.

99
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,319
The veterans are still the same.

100
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,721
Is that why

101
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:35,133
you're still unable
to let go of the past?

102
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,320
I just can't forget that incident.

103
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,440
None of us

104
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,798
will ever forget that incident.

105
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,799
Some of them bottle up their emotions

106
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,841
while some of them hold on to it dearly.

107
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,079
Some of them should be held responsible
for that incident.

108
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,200
Are you referring to me?

109
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
If anyone should be held liable,

110
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
that should be me.

111
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,800
Captain.

112
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,359
Nothing was wrong with your commands.

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,160
But...

114
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,559
But the platoon leader
should not be sacrificed.

115
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,161
What do you think should have happened?

116
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
He should have survived.

117
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,078
Back then,

118
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,640
if Xiang Fei didn't save Cao Ben,

119
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,960
he could have survived.

120
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
But in that case,
Cao Ben would have died.

121
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:45,672
Would you feel upset if Cao Ben died?

122
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,080
Yes.

123
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,159
Lu Tu, Leng Jing and me.

124
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,640
We've mastered the way

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,280
to keep the incident in our heart.

126
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,760
I thought you're the same as us.

127
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,039
On that day,

128
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,719
when you challenged Cao Ben
in front of everyone else,

129
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:10,640
it suddenly struck me

130
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,119
that not only have
you not forgotten the incident,

131
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,679
you've also been looking for the answer.

132
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,680
This answer

133
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,400
will come out soon.

134
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,239
What is it?

135
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,880
Let me ask you a question.

136
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,679
Why don't you
think highly of Yan Po Yue?

137
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,159
He's selfish.

138
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,640
Let's put it mildly.

139
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
He lives by individual heroism.

140
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,281
Just like you,

141
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
I don't think highly of him either.

142
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,761
But I still decided to keep him.

143
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,560
I have even made you guys a team.

144
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,440
Do you know why?

145
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,559
Why?

146
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,167
You...

147
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,200
You and Yan Po Yue

148
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,780
are the two extremes of human nature.

149
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,559
You attach great importance

150
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,840
to the bond among comrades
and team spirit.

151
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,960
He, on the other hand,

152
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,000
attaches great importance
to individual heroism.

153
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,852
He loves being in the limelight

154
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,280
and loves acting alone.

155
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,920
I make you two a team

156
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,599
so that you can live together,

157
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,760
and train together.

158
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,320
You'll get used to each other soon.

159
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,559
Perhaps it'll help the pair of you

160
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
to get out of your blind spots.

161
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,119
Since I can't get used to him,

162
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
I'll let him get used of me.

163
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,761
Bai Long.

164
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,680
As your captain,

165
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,703
I'm assigning two missions to you.

166
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:43,944
You have to accomplish it alone.

167
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,640
Yes!

168
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,519
Firstly,

169
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,281
from now on, during training,

170
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,960
you have to take the initiative
to approach Yan Po Yue

171
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,361
and get along with him.

172
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,401
Yes.

173
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,920
Secondly,

174
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
tonight, after the training,

175
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:00,598
see Cao Ben in private

176
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,720
and have a talk with him.

177
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,680
Remember.

178
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,559
No fighting.

179
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,160
Yes!

180
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,960
Brat.

181
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,079
Go to the other side.

182
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,521
Keep eating. It's none of your business.

183
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,481
Platoon Leader Ma.

184
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Are you keen to sit here?

185
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,880
It's okay. There are only two of us.

186
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,840
Let's go, Yan.

187
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:32,598
Don't be mad at our comrades.

188
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,400
He's almost done.

189
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,039
He only has one more bite to go.

190
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,039
Hurry up!

191
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,879
Don't be mad at our comrades.

192
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,518
Enjoy your lunch, Platoon Leader Ma.

193
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,520
Enjoy your lunch.

194
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,413
Go on, enjoy your lunch.

195
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,121
Rookies nowadays

196
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,761
are so arrogant.

197
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Let them be.

198
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,200
They're rookies.

199
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,320
They have not seen the world.

200
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,761
Yes, they are too arrogant.

201
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,078
Just wait and see.

202
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,119
He'll get into trouble, sooner or later.

203
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,399
I'm used to it.

204
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,200
He has been behaving this way
since we first joined the army.

205
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,999
These veterans

206
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,119
are trying to teach him a lesson.

207
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,799
However, to Yan Po Yue,

208
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,680
they're no match for him.

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,761
He's not bothered at all.

210
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,012
Yan.

211
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:50,092
I think

212
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,519
they're just a little strict.

213
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,519
It seems that you don't trust me, too.

214
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,401
No.

215
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,199
It took us so much of effort to come in.

216
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,920
Can't you tone down a little?

217
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,440
Be cooperative.

218
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,681
What did I not cooperate with?

219
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,439
You were uncooperative
during tactical training.

220
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,400
We're new here.

221
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:16,079
You should be cooperative.

222
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,721
It's not that I refuse
to be cooperative.

223
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,081
The battle plan

224
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,441
is problematic in the first place.

225
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,960
The same battle plan has been used by

226
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:26,080
Cheetah Special Forces
for a very long time.

227
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,802
From where did you get the idea
that it's problematic?

228
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,599
The battle plan

229
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,120
overly rationalises the enemies.

230
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,559
The attacks and defences
were played by the book.

231
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,720
We're told to advance
and retreat together.

232
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,480
But in reality,

233
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,240
when we're carrying out mission,

234
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,241
we'll face desperados.

235
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,961
They're irrational and reckless.

236
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:44,972
During the fight,

237
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,840
if one of us is shot,

238
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,679
they'll come at us at all cost.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,480
It's impossible to defend ourselves.

240
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,279
So tell me, what should we do?

241
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,481
The only way

242
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,240
is to kill the leader of our enemies

243
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,839
in the shortest time.

244
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,160
You're entitled to have your own view

245
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,520
but nobody cares about your view.

246
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,960
If you don't stand by your own view,

247
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,200
no one will listen to it.

248
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,800
This is a friendly reminder.

249
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,320
Being a part of Cheetah Special Forces,
we may be eliminated at anytime.

250
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,799
Will we be eliminated just because
we have our own view?

251
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,640
I don't believe in that.

252
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:20,599
No.

253
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Look.

254
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,360
Everyone has their own view

255
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,360
but everyone just bites their tongue.
No one says anything.

256
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,401
Look at Guo Xiao Xiao.

257
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,761
She's such an excellent sniper.

258
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,600
She can shoot with great precision.

259
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,840
She's assigned as a spotter
once she joined.

260
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,201
Did she say anything?

261
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,721
Don't forget about Yue Kong.

262
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,440
Do you know his background?

263
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,039
For three years in a row,

264
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,120
he's the champion
of the military sniping tournament.

265
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,527
He's also the top in
Cheetah Special Forces

266
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,840
in term of comprehensive strength.

267
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,119
He's not as good as you think.

268
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,519
Maybe you won last time
because he gave in to you.

269
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,429
Why don't we pick a fight with him

270
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,638
so that we can fight against him again?

271
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,479
My goodness.

272
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,886
He's more senior than us, right?

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
You should give face to him.

274
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,241
We should get closer with everyone here.

275
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,494
Or else, everything won't be easy for us

276
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:03,906
when we're here.

277
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,321
What should I do?

278
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,680
Should I buy him some cigarettes

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,759
to befriend him?

280
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,001
You may do so.

281
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,160
I do things in my own way.

282
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,839
Lift your leg.

283
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,599
Leave me alone. Leave now!

284
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,960
This is an order!

285
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,159
Leave.

286
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,801
Are you sent by the captain?

287
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,960
Is it even necessary?

288
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,160
That's enough.

289
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,680
It's getting late.

290
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,320
Go back and rest early.

291
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,871
You've been aiming for so long

292
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,479
but you didn't fire the rifle.

293
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:16,966
Why?

294
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,321
I...

295
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,039
I was just practising aiming.

296
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,518
I didn't plan to fire the gun.

297
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,479
Care for a match?

298
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,639
There is no way that a person
with a rifle does not intend to shoot.

299
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,080
You stared at me for two minutes
but you didn't say anything.

300
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,599
I've told you everything
I need to tell you

301
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,400
a long time ago.

302
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Bai.

303
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,622
You went through a lot of obstacles

304
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,000
to rejoin Cheetah Special Forces.

305
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,759
Did you do that just to remind me

306
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:59,959
that it's not worthy for Xiang Fei
to sacrifice himself for me?

307
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,960
Am I right?

308
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,160
Do you really have to hurt me

309
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,079
as if you're a knife?

310
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,279
Now, you're my superior.

311
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,200
I'm sure that I'm not a knife.

312
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,880
I'm at most a scar.

313
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,880
Don't say that.

314
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,640
We're comrades.

315
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,721
What do you want to do?

316
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,759
Do you want to beat me up?

317
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,240
That's too easy on you.

318
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,000
Bai.

319
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,920
The captain asked me
to have a talk with you.

320
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
I have completed the mission.

321
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,360
Form a group of two for combat training.

322
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:54,240
(One-on-one combat training)

323
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,400
Get ready, Group One.

324
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,319
Vice squad leader.

325
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,959
Don't give in to me this time.

326
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,440
My head is tough.

327
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,473
I can take 100 punches.

328
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,800
Let's place a bet.

329
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,919
Sure.

330
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,120
The loser

331
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:14,186
will drink the winner's
feet washing water.

332
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,481
Do you dare?

333
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,279
It's a deal.

334
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,839
Come on.

335
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,119
Bai!

336
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,279
I'll do it.

337
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,480
Yue Kong, listen to the squad leader.

338
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,241
Fine, you'll do it.

339
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,320
It starts now.

340
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,040
Yan!

341
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,640
You need to stop being so arrogant!

342
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,880
You're being nosy!

343
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,160
You're not the best in
Cheetah Special Forces.

344
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,319
I'll become the best sooner or later.

345
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,079
With me around,

346
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,200
dream on!

347
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,761
Yan!

348
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:19,145
Bai is getting too serious.

349
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,520
Shall we stop them?

350
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,479
It's called a fight
when you beat up your enemies.

351
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,320
It's called training

352
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,160
when you beat up your comrades.

353
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,321
We aim to train them
in actual combat.

354
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,119
Let's wait and see.

355
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Harder!

356
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,520
That's enough.

357
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:26,522
Take a break.

358
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,719
Next!

359
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,319
Right face!

360
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,760
Left face!

361
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,079
Turn to the back!

362
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,359
What? Do you want me to feed you?

363
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,199
Listen.

364
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,880
It's been quite a while

365
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,640
since Bai Long got even with someone.

366
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,919
Who was the last person?

367
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,840
Does it have anything to do with you?

368
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,920
You can't live without competing
with others, can you?

369
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,520
You're referring to
tactical training, right?

370
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,121
The battle plan is problematic!

371
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:21,560
None of you have noticed that.

372
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,839
The battle plan used by
Cheetah Special Forces

373
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:23,959
is accumulated

374
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,560
bit by bit through real combat.

375
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,520
It's accumulated from uncountable
experience and lessons.

376
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,439
Do you get it?

377
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,800
I don't get it!

378
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,800
When some of the comrades
are unable to move forward,

379
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
the entire troop will be wiped out
if we stop half way,

380
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,039
but we're still required to stop
and help them.

381
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,960
It's pointless to sacrifice for nothing!

382
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,920
Right face!

383
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,721
If you ever abandon
any injured comrades,

384
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,481
even if you survive the battle,

385
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,520
you'll live in pain
for the rest of your life.

386
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,599
Are you serious about joining Team Nine?

387
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,040
Yes, I'm serious.

388
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,000
Give me a reason.

389
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
After a careful thought,

390
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,759
I learned that there are things
I have to face on my own.

391
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,319
Bai Long is like a X-ray machine.

392
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,520
He makes me

393
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,040
embrace my fear
that I didn't want to face.

394
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,080
Is Bai Long really that impressive?

395
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,040
Yes.

396
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,319
Three years ago,
after Xiang Fei sacrificed himself,

397
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,479
all of you

398
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,520
hid your true feelings from me.

399
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,601
Some showed sympathy for me

400
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,160
while some had scruples against me.

401
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,680
Then, Bai Long appeared.

402
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,760
He reminds me at all time

403
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,839
that someone else should be here,

404
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,280
but not me.

405
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,880
We're the special forces

406
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,920
of Chinese People's
Armed Police Force.

407
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,957
Sacrifices are inevitable.

408
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
As such, under certain circumstances,

409
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,481
we're not having sympathy for someone.

410
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,079
We do that because we understand.

411
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,921
You can even say that
it's part of our duty.

412
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,839
However, this duty

413
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,199
is too heavy to me.

414
00:25:14,374 --> 00:25:15,880
I need to start all over again.

415
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,880
Or in other words,
I need to get used to it.

416
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,239
Do you think you can get used to it
just by joining Bai Long's team?

417
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,239
Let me try, Captain.

418
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,439
I'll work hard.

419
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,600
Listen.

420
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,119
What you and Bai Long need

421
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,440
is a mutual understanding.

422
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,600
But it's almost impossible

423
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,280
to reach that kind of understanding

424
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,680
through normal training
and cohabitation.

425
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:40,760
There are always chances for us
to experience extreme environments.

426
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:55,953
The temperature is 32 degree Celsius.

427
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,760
The humidity is about 20 percent.

428
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,400
Wind is blowing
in the south-east direction.

429
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,760
The wait in lying position

430
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,480
will last for ten hours.

431
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,761
I'm a man.

432
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,599
I waited in lying position
for 26 hours before.

433
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,280
I was lying in mud.

434
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,119
I know that you're impressive.

435
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,040
I didn't make you a spotter.

436
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,161
I don't care.

437
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,560
I only care about
accomplishing the mission.

438
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,440
Check out the direction of 11 o'clock

439
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,519
which is about 530 meters from us.

440
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,240
The wind speed
is six to eight meters per second.

441
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,721
The sight from west to east is good.

442
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,399
If my memories serve me right,

443
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,199
your leader is Captain Leng.

444
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,319
Yes.

445
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,000
Are you making the mistake on purpose?

446
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
You bypass your immediate leader
to lodge a complaint.

447
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,241
Captain Leng is here.

448
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,560
Anyway, if you think that I'm at fault,
then I'm at fault.

449
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,280
Xiao Xiao, talk properly.

450
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,199
Yes.

451
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,640
Based on my observation,

452
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,759
Yue Kong is not as good as I am.

453
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,679
What is the problem?

454
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,721
I'm always a sniper.

455
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,520
I was accepted
because I'm a qualified sniper.

456
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,920
I don't think I'm inferior to him.

457
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:10,126
What is the problem?

458
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,040
Why am I assigned as a spotter

459
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
while he's assigned as a sniper?

460
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:13,959
Xiao Xiao!

461
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,319
Guo Xiao Xiao.

462
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,800
Why do you think that
you're better than Yue Kong?

463
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,801
Do I have to make you a sniper

464
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,719
just because you want to be one?

465
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,439
Does everyone have to give way to you?

466
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,439
I'm not asking for that.

467
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,601
I'm letting my strength
speak for itself.

468
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,601
Fine.

469
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
We'll have a sniping training tomorrow.

470
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,119
Leng Jing, let Yue Kong
have a match with her.

471
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,081
Let's see who is qualified
to be the sniper.

472
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,320
Is it okay?

473
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,320
I'm willing to do that!

474
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:39,145
Get out!

475
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,120
Yes!

476
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,400
Is it even necessary?

477
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,040
It'll be difficult for Yue Kong
to work with her in the future.

478
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,561
If Yue Kong can't deal with her,

479
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,280
then he's not qualified to be a sniper.

480
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,159
Guo Xiao Xiao is a female soldier.

481
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,040
I don't want to see her get discouraged
because of this.

482
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,439
That won't happen.

483
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,280
Guo Xiao Xiao
is so much tougher than you think.

484
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,867
This young lady

485
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,319
is too arrogant.

486
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,080
Let Yue teach her a lesson.

487
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,721
I'll persuade her.

488
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,600
Don't do that.

489
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,799
It's useless anyway.

490
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,159
Her nickname is Lone Wolf.

491
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,959
She's always alone
because she's too arrogant.

492
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,560
If we want her to work
with Yue Kong of her own will,

493
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,201
we must let her fight with him
in a harsh way.

494
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,639
Or else, she won't admit defeat.

495
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,880
One, two, one.

496
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,640
One, two, one.

497
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,040
One, two, one.

498
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,119
One, two, one.

499
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,119
One, two, one.

500
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,399
You're a lady. Why are you so fierce?

501
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,520
We'll have to work together
in the future.

502
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,119
If you want me to work with you,

503
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,281
you must convince me.

504
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,840
Show me your real strength.

505
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,321
One, two, one...

506
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,680
Why do I have a feeling
that the atmosphere is weird?

507
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,000
Guo Xiao Xiao went
to see Captain Qin just now.

508
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,159
She volunteered to have
a match with Yue Kong.

509
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,119
Who do you think will become the winner?

510
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,119
It's hard to say.

511
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,839
I'll bet on Guo Xiao Xiao.

512
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,240
I'll bet on Yue. Is that okay?

513
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,200
The winner gets a canned luncheon meat.

514
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,480
Sure. Make sure you don't
go back on your own words.

515
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,160
-It's a deal.
-One.

516
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,119
One, two, one.

517
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,959
One, two, one.

518
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:27,361
One, two, three, four.

519
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,160
One, two, three, four.

520
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,959
One, two, three, four.

521
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
One, two, three, four.

522
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,242
One, two, one.

523
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,800
-Has Qin agreed to it?
-One, two, one.

524
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,639
Did he agree straight away?

525
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,040
One, two, one.

526
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,520
What do you mean?

527
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,480
If he simply agreed with it,

528
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,400
then it's not as simple as it seems.

529
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,159
One, two, three, four!

530
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,280
Do you think
that I'm not on a par with him?

531
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,920
One, two, three, four!

532
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,040
One, two, three!

533
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,000
It seems that Yue Kong has never shown
his true strength in all this time.

534
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,760
One, two, one.

535
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,319
If he can defeat me,

536
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,079
I'll admit defeat.

537
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,040
One, two, one.

538
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,520
The comprehensive shooting training
will begin soon.

539
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,319
First round at 350m,

540
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:32,439
second round at 700m with weights.

541
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,319
Then, at 900m,
you'll have to shoot the moving targets.

542
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,599
There'll be a final shooting
at the end point.

543
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,440
Do you get it?

544
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,239
Yes!

545
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,440
Let's begin.

546
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,880
Shoot!

547
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,359
They have
a strong foundation in shooting.

548
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:25,232
What's going on, Captain Leng?

549
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:26,892
Why are you looking so concerned?

550
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,159
The first round is easy.

551
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,480
They'll be exhausted in the second round
as they have to run with weights.

552
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,240
(700m)

553
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:17,920
They're too impatient.

554
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,680
That's right. They're indeed impatient.

555
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,641
Even blowing machine
is used in this match.

556
00:33:55,412 --> 00:33:57,172
The wind becomes stronger

557
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,520
as the target moves around
in different speed.

558
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,280
Yue Kong is not using anemometer.

559
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,360
Anemometer can only detect wind speed
and wind pressure at a certain spot.

560
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,679
An experienced sniper

561
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,439
will observe the changes
in the length of shadow

562
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:22,993
to grasp the target

563
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,760
and the speed of the wind
on a bullet's trajectory.

564
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,280
But this is too difficult.

565
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,761
I may not be able to do it either.

566
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,281
In other words, they rely on shadows.

567
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,520
Will it work?

568
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,239
Yue Kong is really something.

569
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,721
You're right.

570
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,000
The result is a foregone conclusion.

571
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:57,766
It's my turn.

572
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,281
If it wasn't for Captain Leng,

573
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,840
you would not
have been able to defeat me.

574
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,319
Is that so?

575
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,600
If you're so confident
with your shooting skills,

576
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,599
what stops you from shooting?

577
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,559
I looked into your shooting skills.

578
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,240
You're good at defending

579
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,081
while I'm good at attacking.

580
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,559
If you can be good
at both attack and defence,

581
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:53,000
I'll be your spotter.

582
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,332
We have more goods now

583
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,280
but the price
has decreased by 20 percent.

584
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Now, all the goods
are distributed only through Zan.

585
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,800
It's a huge place

586
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,640
but he has the final say in everything!

587
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,840
As you know,

588
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,239
all the roads in the north
has been sealed.

589
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,041
Is Chinese People's Armed Police Force

590
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,080
really unassailable?

591
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,640
It's an order from Daddy Kun.

592
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,281
That's right. You're right.

593
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,801
We'd rather eat lesser

594
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,000
than losing our life.

595
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,520
The winner gets all the money!

596
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,839
So many bank notes.

597
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,480
Please share some with me.

598
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,520
Daddy Kun.

599
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,600
What are you doing?

600
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,439
Are you trying to win them over?

601
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,961
Daddy Kun, that's not true.

602
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,920
They've worked hard.

603
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,560
I just want to make them happy.

604
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:31,493
Come with me.

605
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,681
Red Scorpion

606
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,080
was initially
a dilapidated fishing village.

607
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,360
It grew from a small fishing village
with less than 100 villagers

608
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,280
to Red Scorpion
that is known by everyone.

609
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,520
What is the main key?

610
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,521
Caution.

611
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,560
What else?

612
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,200
Viciousness.

613
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,001
I was ambitious back then.

614
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,640
I expanded the army

615
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,400
and brought drugs into China.

616
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,199
Later, the amount was
getting bigger and bigger.

617
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,120
It eventually attracted attention.

618
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:13,800
As you know,

619
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,520
Red Scorpion was heavily attacked

620
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,601
and almost wiped out.

621
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,761
It took me more than a decade
to slowly recover.

622
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,320
I'll bring back what you lost.

623
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,840
You don't get me.

624
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,360
I know that you travelled
to the north quite often lately.

625
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,320
You're trying to
get into the China's market.

626
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,720
Daddy Kun.

627
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,599
I just want everyone
to have a better life.

628
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,240
Isn't all of us living now good enough?

629
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,040
You're greedy.

630
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,520
Daddy Kun.

631
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,120
Shoot my heart.

632
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,159
See it for yourself

633
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,320
if I genuinely care for you.

634
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,400
He sees China as his home.

635
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,879
He yearns to go home all the time.

636
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,201
It does no good to keep him with you.

637
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,679
Yes.

638
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,679
I know

639
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,199
that you've been
secretly watching me for Daddy Kun.

640
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,961
Kuang Cha was buried here.

641
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,641
Make a choice.

642
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:11,080
It's either I make you reunite with him

643
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,800
or you work for me
wholeheartedly in the future.

644
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,640
Tian.

645
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,919
Daddy Kun threatened me
with my wife and children.

646
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,479
I didn't have a choice

647
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,720
but to listen to him.

648
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,240
Now, you're giving me a choice.

649
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,120
Of course I'll choose you.
