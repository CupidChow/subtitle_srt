1
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,120
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:31,100
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,680
(Episode 45)

4
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,720
You forget to close it.

5
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,399
Stop! Hands up!

6
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,001
Would you like some fresh goat milk?

7
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,359
Goat milk or sheep milk?

8
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
Black goat milk.

9
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,960
Clear.

10
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Ten minutes ago,

11
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,440
he went in and never came out.

12
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,160
Alpha Zero,

13
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,360
Charlie team has made contact
successfully with the informant.

14
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,280
Over.

15
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:19,958
The QRF (Quick reaction force)
has set out.

16
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,559
And will arrive in 15 minutes.

17
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,239
The task can be completed
ahead of schedule.

18
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,720
Too simple.

19
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,720
They won't let us win so easily.

20
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Who?

21
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,959
Edmina. Goat milk.

22
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Nobody.

23
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,199
It's a trap!

24
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,440
Shit!

25
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
(Contact on the right.)

26
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,480
Let's go! Let's go!

27
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,400
I'm on the move.

28
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,040
Bomb exploded.

29
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,960
Romeo 2, Alpha 2,
was KIA (Killed in action).

30
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,001
Alpha Zero, mission failed.

31
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,383
Our personnel exposed.
Request for backup.

32
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:19,119
Hey, Jason, why did you
decide it's failed?

33
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,478
Mission started just now.

34
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:22,440
Let's pull them back
and make a new plan.

35
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,000
Let me tell you the new plan.

36
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,720
The new plan is to rush through it.

37
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,320
Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

38
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
Lunatic.

39
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,079
Sniper, sniper.

40
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,359
Coordinate, 537 north, 47 east.

41
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,440
Mortar ready.

42
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,719
Ready to fire.

43
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,920
We're exposed. Let's go!

44
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Fire!

45
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,120
Yan Po Yue,

46
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,799
the battle in the village is commanded.

47
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,680
The tower on the west side
should be the best spot.

48
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:09,873
S might be there.

49
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,760
Copy.

50
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,800
Jason, Sergei,

51
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,720
get together at the tower
on the west side of the village.

52
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,239
And call for the support.

53
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
Copy that.

54
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,640
Go, go, go. Move!

55
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,521
Move!

56
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,080
Location of Target S confirmed.

57
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,160
He's up in the tower.

58
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
(Roger. Stand by.)

59
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,241
(We'll meet you there.)

60
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,360
Copy.

61
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,721
Go over there and kill them!

62
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,839
Go! Go! Go!

63
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,320
Enemy is here! Enemy is here!
Get here now!

64
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,919
Grenade!

65
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,159
Go! Go! Go!

66
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Flash!

67
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,600
Relax, relax. Relax, kids.

68
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,719
It's just a drill.

69
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,719
Clear!

70
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,360
Fire me! Fire me!

71
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,960
Aim at the tower and fire.

72
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,000
That's our plane, guys.

73
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,119
Just like the Black Hawk incident
in 1993 in Somalia.

74
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,240
At least whole city won't be
attacking them.

75
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,920
But there is no delta force
or rangers to bail them out.

76
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,920
There's no goddamn air support!

77
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,320
They can get out.

78
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
(Yan Po Yue, this is Guo Xiao Xiao.)

79
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,801
We are approaching the target building

80
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,840
and are expected to
meet you in three minutes.

81
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,040
QRF will arrive in 10 minutes.

82
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:05,919
Over.

83
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Copy!

84
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,320
Enemy!

85
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,679
Stop moving.

86
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Take the tower as a stronghold
and wait for the QRF.

87
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,399
(Team Alpha to Team Charlie.)

88
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,360
(The Cobra 2 was shot down.)

89
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,799
(The crew survived.)

90
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,760
(We're sending you the coordinate.)

91
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,599
(You need to get to the crash site)

92
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,721
(and rescue the crew in ten minutes.)

93
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,360
Copy.

94
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,880
We'll complete the mission.

95
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,519
Look at the coordinates.

96
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,079
The crash site is in
open area with no cover.

97
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,000
There is going to be
more enemies than here.

98
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,961
The rescue is a suicide?

99
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,200
Yes, of course.

100
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,320
We should wait for the QRF

101
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,960
and we go to the rescue together.

102
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,280
Capture Target S alive
and bring him back safely

103
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,400
was our primary mission.

104
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
No, Jason.

105
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
They won't survive that long.

106
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,440
Then, we'll do this.

107
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,240
Jason is right.

108
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,920
There is no need for
everyone to go to the rescue.

109
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,240
A team will stay here to guard S,

110
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,431
the other team will carry out
the rescue operation.

111
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:13,680
If the rescue is successful,

112
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,882
we'll send a signal. You guys
will bring in QRF to pick us up.

113
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:16,843
I'll come with you.

114
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Me too.

115
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,358
Count me in.

116
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,240
How come there are only Chinese?

117
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,320
Who caught S?

118
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,840
We caught him together.

119
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,799
This won't do.

120
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,440
At least one of us should stay.

121
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,360
Otherwise, they will
take all the credits.

122
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,960
Sergei.

123
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,720
My friend,

124
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,480
listen to me carefully.

125
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,360
I mean,

126
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
we're going to save your men.

127
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,280
We don't feel safe
leaving the target to Jason.

128
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,240
We don't.

129
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:56,033
You, you remember

130
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,281
to pick us up.

131
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,320
Got it?

132
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,200
You understand?

133
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,400
Got it, man?

134
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,440
Man, can you try to understand?

135
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
No problem, my friend.

136
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,880
You scared me.

137
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,480
I know I can count on you.

138
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,320
We're getting closer to the target.

139
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,840
It should be right across us.

140
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,239
It's too quiet.

141
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,920
Something seems off.

142
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,360
And there are survivors.

143
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
47.

144
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,720
51.

145
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,680
63.

146
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,080
You're doing it again.

147
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,720
Xiao Xiao, translate it.

148
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,079
11 o'clock on
the left side of the ravine

149
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,680
and two o'clock on the right

150
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,560
are great sniper positions.

151
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,880
And 12 o'clock direction as
the opposite mountain top.

152
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,840
But that requires long-range sniping.

153
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,840
With the information we have so far,

154
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,800
I don't think the terrorists
have such weapons.

155
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,760
Got it.

156
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,880
Xiao Xiao,
suppress two o'clock.

157
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,160
Yan Po Yue, suppress
11 o'clock.

158
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,720
Xiao Yun Jie, cover fire.

159
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:35,623
I'll go scouting.

160
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,640
Let me go.

161
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,000
I run faster.

162
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,960
I heard about it.

163
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
But it's limited to jungle warfare.

164
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,280
This is the plateau, air is thin.

165
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
If I go, at least you
can save your strength.

166
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,040
Carry out my orders.

167
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,920
Roger.

168
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:54,173
Roger.

169
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,959
Go. Go.

170
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,280
Go! Sniper!

171
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,320
Xiao Xiao,

172
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,600
take out the sniper!

173
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,680
Captain!

174
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,360
Sniper spotted at 12 o'clock
at the top of the mountain.

175
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,239
He's too far away.

176
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,199
Our range can't form
effective fire suppression.

177
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,679
I'll go find him. Cover!

178
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,800
(Yan, Yan,)

179
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,258
(have you found the sniper?)

180
00:20:59,494 --> 00:21:00,320
No.

181
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
But the threat is temporarily lifted.

182
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,560
(Ground forces are
coming to pick us up.)

183
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,440
(The enemy is massing here.)

184
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
(Retreat now.)

185
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,119
Got it.

186
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,119
Are you okay?

187
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,520
Do I look okay to you?

188
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,801
How is Yan Po Yue?

189
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,560
Stronger than you.

190
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,320
Vice captain.

191
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,160
If this was a real battle,

192
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,560
I would've lost my leg already.

193
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:07,441
I hand over the command to you now.

194
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,080
I owe you my life.

195
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
Your life is worth
only a pack of cookies?

196
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,360
Get in.

197
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,520
This is as far as I could go.

198
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,400
Bye.

199
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
We'll see you at the base.

200
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,440
Hurry up, guys. Get aboard.

201
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,599
We're safe for now.

202
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,159
I did what I promised you.

203
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,720
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

204
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,640
But you're a good guy, Sergei.

205
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
You didn't steal the
fruits of the revolution.

206
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,160
Got to give you credit.

207
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,000
My friend, let's have
a vodka after this.

208
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,480
Xie is so chatty.

209
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,760
Captain Yan,

210
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,440
if you were the test maker,

211
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
would the mission end here?

212
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,560
Everyone is exhausted

213
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,080
from continuous combat.

214
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
At this moment, everyone's strength
and energy have reached the limit.

215
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,600
We'll begin to let our guard down.

216
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,480
It is the perfect time to test
our response to sudden change

217
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,720
and our individual potential.

218
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
What test will come next?

219
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,240
Take cover!

220
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,680
Alpha Zero, our convoy
is under heavy fire!

221
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,280
Requesting air support!

222
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,960
Alpha Zero, do you hear me?

223
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,840
In 2017,

224
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,600
12 US Special Forces soldiers

225
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,040
on a reconnaissance mission

226
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,200
in the Sahara desert

227
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:56,000
were ambushed when they
were returning to their base.

228
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,640
That's right. They ended up confronting
the enemy on their own

229
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,479
in an open area.

230
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,599
Four people died in the end.

231
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,519
It was a repeat of the tragedy
of the Black Hawk Down incident.

232
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,920
We are in the same situation

233
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
as they were then!

234
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,760
This car can't hold up any longer!

235
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,719
Move! Move!

236
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,640
Go! Go! Go!

237
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,680
Go! Go! Go!

238
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,120
You're a casualty!

239
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,880
Mao Lang, take care of the casualty!

240
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,880
Yan Po Yue!

241
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,680
Number of enemies unknown!
Firepower is rapid and heavy!

242
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,120
Come on!

243
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Follow me!

244
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,079
Cover! Cover!

245
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,840
There is too much artillery.

246
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,840
We have no air support.

247
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,480
And only one vehicle left.

248
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,119
What about the others?

249
00:26:01,646 --> 00:26:02,622
You cover me.

250
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:03,560
Not a chance!

251
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,319
Take the target and wounded out!

252
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,960
We'll cover you!

253
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,361
Yan, are you crazy?

254
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,560
Let them go!

255
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,480
Don't make the mission failed!

256
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,920
Let us think about it.

257
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,920
Brothers, cover them!

258
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
Suppress fire!

259
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Cover them!

260
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,200
Go!

261
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
Jason, ammo! Ammo!

262
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
Is Yan Po Yue insane?

263
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,640
Use the majority to stall the enemy

264
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,120
in exchange for the minority
to get the target out.

265
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,720
The only thing he has in mind now

266
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,520
is no longer the ranking,

267
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,360
but the mission as a soldier.

268
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,673
He wants to complete the mission.

269
00:27:16,754 --> 00:27:17,680
Those from Country A

270
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,160
are so good at stealing
the fruits of others' work.

271
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,717
Xiao, we're friends.

272
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,040
Country A is just a partner.

273
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,665
Of course! We're friends!

274
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,720
Reloading!

275
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,240
Cover fire!

276
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,759
They are safe now!

277
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,800
What do we do?

278
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Sergei,

279
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,720
take the men and leave from
the north side of the mountain!

280
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,719
It's safer!

281
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,920
Xiao, you and Sergei

282
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,959
will take everyone to retreat through
the north side of the mountain.

283
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:46,760
It's safer!

284
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:47,680
What about you?

285
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,640
I'll hold them off!

286
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,040
No way! You can't be the only one
who has a chance to be a hero!

287
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,200
-I'll stay too!
-Yes. Between sacrificing two captains

288
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,560
and sacrificing two members, the former
will cause us lose more points.

289
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,280
It's enough to have
Sergei commanding the team!

290
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,440
I have to stay!

291
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,640
You guys retreat!

292
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,960
Everyone!

293
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,000
Pull back! Pull back!

294
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,920
Retreat!

295
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,879
Stay alive!

296
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,320
You always love to act tough,

297
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
so see it through.

298
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,520
Xiao,

299
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,520
let's go!

300
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,660
Ammo!

301
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,239
Your soldiers made the same choice
as Staff Sergeant White.

302
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,760
How did Sergeant White die?

303
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,080
When facing an emergency like this,

304
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,680
this is the best choice.

305
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,880
Yura!

306
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Sergei, watch out!

307
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,760
The first shot hit the side,

308
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,680
the second hit the back.

309
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,600
On the hillside at the east!

310
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,440
It's the same guy
from the hilltop just now.

311
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,840
The range is too large.

312
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,280
It's hard to determine his location.

313
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,760
Smoke grenade.

314
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,960
I don't have it.

315
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,960
Smoke!

316
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,000
Smoke! Smoke!

317
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:16,560
Hurry!

318
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We'll cover you.

319
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,680
You take your guys and go.

320
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,440
Go!

321
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,040
Go back!

322
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,640
Friend,

323
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,400
you are a trustworthy friend

324
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,200
Take care!

325
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,880
Reload.

326
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,320
Good!

327
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,320
You guys go first! I'll cover you! Go!

328
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,040
Xiao Xiao, are you okay?

329
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,600
My leg was shot.

330
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,880
The sniper is at six o'clock.

331
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,760
I'll lure her out.

332
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,800
Keep an eye on her.

333
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,720
Roger that.

334
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,919
Be careful!

335
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,200
You too!

336
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,959
Congratulations.

337
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,080
You're a brilliant sniper.

338
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,800
Thank you.

339
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,760
You're welcome.

340
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,720
You've worked hard.

341
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,201
We've seen your performance.

342
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,480
Where is Yan Po Yue?

343
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:34,960
Hasn't he returned yet?

344
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:43,440
The last signal was
when he covered the others' exit

345
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,920
and fought off the enemy troops.

346
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,840
But there is still no news of KIA.

347
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,440
Is the communicator broken?

348
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm not sure.

349
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,640
Check again.

350
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,160
Where is the last batch of
enemy role-players he defeated?

351
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,280
Tell them to find him!

352
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,360
How is it going?

353
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:34,679
Where is he?

354
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,280
The other cars are still searching.

355
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
We come back for gas.

356
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
Thank you.

357
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,881
Katherine,

358
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,040
you've worked hard. Let us find him.

359
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,920
You're not familiar with the terrain.

360
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,840
This no-man land is 50 kilometres long.

361
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,959
However,

362
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,560
please trust us.

363
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,640
We'll guarantee the safety
of every participant.

364
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,080
Thank you.

365
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,040
Katherine, thank you. Thank you.

366
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,600
Brave soldiers,

367
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,840
after the analysis and the approval

368
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,480
of the organizing committee
and the judges,

369
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,240
the team
with the winning score

370
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,560
is the team of Country A.

371
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,440
The winning argument

372
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,000
is that in different conditions,

373
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,320
they have made the best choice

374
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,720
in the contest

375
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,000
of the modern war against terrorism.

376
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,721
Please, Commander.

377
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,760
We were the ones who
found the target first,

378
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,440
but they stole our victory.

379
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,319
Our goal isn't to

380
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,952
show our power,

381
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,737
or to prove to others how great we are.

382
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,920
We no longer

383
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,320
need to prove anything to anyone.

384
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,200
Our goal is to

385
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,480
contribute as much as possible
to the unity of the global coalition

386
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,520
against terrorism and to free the
world from the threat of terrorism.

387
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,480
In this respect,

388
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,160
we made it.

389
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,400
Yan Po Yue is right.

390
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,880
Ranking is just flowers and
applause on your road ahead.

391
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,640
You have been through
tests and transformed.

392
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,000
You are now stronger.

393
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,193
When you return home,

394
00:40:22,274 --> 00:40:23,720
there will be more difficult missions

395
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,000
waiting for you.

396
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,960
Now,

397
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,360
we want to award
a special medal of valour

398
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:32,720
to a soldier

399
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,120
that has shown an all-time
courage and sacrifice.

400
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,159
That soldier

401
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,000
belongs to Team China, Yan Po Yue!

402
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:47,279
Bravo!

403
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,760
Bravo! Bravo!

404
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,280
Bravo! Bravo!

405
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,640
Bravo!

406
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:19,919
Next,

407
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:21,787
let's hear from Yan Po Yue,

408
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,600
who will speak on behalf of the
participants of Warrior Competition.

409
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,200
Comrades and fellow students,

410
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,080
the moment you joined
the armed police forces,

411
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,680
you have embarked on
a never-ending journey.

412
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,440
Let us always remember

413
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,520
the vows we made

414
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,360
when we put on this uniform.

415
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,080
I am People's Armed Police Force.

416
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,680
I pledge...

417
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,320
I am People's Armed Police Force.

418
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,840
I pledge...

419
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,760
To obey the leadership of
the Communist Party of China,

420
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,800
to dedicate to the people.

421
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,560
To obey the leadership of
the Communist Party of China,

422
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,040
to dedicate to the people.

423
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,160
To obey orders,

424
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,440
to abide by discipline,

425
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,720
to devote myself to my duties,

426
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,760
to work hard.

427
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,920
To obey orders,

428
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,280
to abide by discipline,

429
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,600
to devote myself to my duties,

430
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:19,719
to work hard.

431
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,268
To train hard to
improve my military skills,

432
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,280
to be a loyal defender of
the Party and the people.

433
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,040
To train hard to
improve my military skills,

434
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,679
to be a loyal defender of
the Party and the people.

435
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,680
Under any circumstances,
never to betray my country

436
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:33,000
or defect from Armed Police Force.

437
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,200
Under any circumstances,
never to betray my country

438
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,800
or defect from Armed Police Force.
