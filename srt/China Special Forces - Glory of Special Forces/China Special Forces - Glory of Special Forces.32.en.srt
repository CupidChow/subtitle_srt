00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:29,120
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,101
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,600
(Episode 32)

4
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:35,719
I haven't had a hot meal in days.

5
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,199
I wonder what
we're having for lunch today?

6
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,720
Can you just shut up?

7
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:41,592
Can't you just stop talking?

8
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:43,360
This is my style.

9
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,319
Buddy! You're still working on it?

10
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,599
Just forget about it.
You won't be able to fix it.

11
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,838
You should fix it then.

12
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,599
It'll surely be fixed
if I'm working on it.

13
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,680
You're pretty spiteful, aren't you?

14
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,839
Are you done?

15
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,199
The dead shouldn't talk.

16
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:56,544
Aren't you guys dead too?

17
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:57,919
You should keep quiet too.

18
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,128
This is interesting.

19
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:02,173
There's no way I can fix this.

20
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,992
This transformer box
is just a metal box now.

21
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,119
-Sir!
-Speak.

22
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,679
Currently, we only have
one diesel generator working.

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
We can only make sure that enough power
is supplied to the command centre

24
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,279
and the information automation centre.

25
00:02:19,952 --> 00:02:20,952
What are they doing?

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,440
The water pump isn't working
since there's no electricity.

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,001
We have no choice but to acquire water
using the most traditional method.

28
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,928
When will the power be restored?

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,160
The sapper said this situation
would last for at least another week.

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,880
If we don't have power,
none of our equipment can function!

31
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,279
We have no choice
but to use petrol stoves now.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,720
The Cheetahs are so wicked.

33
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,559
They're so wicked.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,440
I guess we have no choice.

35
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,399
Water incoming.

36
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,479
-Sir!
-What's the situation?

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,559
We don't know
why the water became like this either.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,520
Come.

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,174
We've already tested the water to guard
against the enemy from sabotaging us.

40
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,351
The water is fine.

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,921
It's just that it became bitter
all of a sudden.

42
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:09,199
Our comrades said the water in the well
was more bitter than the porridge.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,320
They didn't poison

44
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:19,119
the water.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,319
It's denatonium benzoate.

46
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,080
It's a type of bitters.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,559
Just 5ppm of this substance

48
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:32,232
can transform the cleanest water source
into something undrinkable.

49
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,199
And, as the concentration was too low,

50
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:37,800
we wouldn't be able to detect its
presence using normal testing methods.

51
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,800
Aren't they too mean?

52
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,181
We're in a state of war.

53
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,598
Our enemies only
managed to poison our water source

54
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:50,553
because of our weak defence.

55
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,898
It has nothing to do with
the kitchen squad.

56
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,080
Go back

57
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,841
and relay my message to
the kitchen squad.

58
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:01,009
Since this is a special period,
please ask them to hang in there

59
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,360
and use the water
we had reserved for wartime

60
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,480
to make breakfast for the last time.

61
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,168
If I'm not mistaken,

62
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,840
Yan Po Yue joined the kitchen squad

63
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,720
right after he graduated
from the recruit company, right?

64
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:25,799
That's right.

65
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,552
That makes sense.

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,769
He was once part of the kitchen squad.

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,519
So, he understood

68
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:45,598
the kitchen squad's schedule
and work arrangement

69
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,760
and he used his experience
to his advantage.

70
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,471
That's how he was able
to deal a heavy blow to our team.

71
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,317
Although he didn't deal
any substantive damage to us,

72
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,846
he has succeeded in
dealing a blow to our morale.

73
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,778
The only advantage we have here,
which is the availability of nice food,

74
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:04,720
was ruined by him.

75
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,200
He's being an ingrate here.

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,960
To let us know
the weakness of our defence,

77
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:13,120
that's the best way for him to repay us.

78
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,519
The well is usually guarded.

79
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:21,385
Last night,

80
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:24,049
when the base was in turmoil,

81
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:26,545
he used the only chance he had

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,478
to pour the bitters into the well.

83
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,920
If he wants to use the bitters

84
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,799
to his fullest advantage

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,200
and reduce our morale continuously,

86
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,494
I'm sure he'll make a container

87
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:40,920
that allows the bitters to
diffuse through it slowly.

88
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,520
Send someone to search
the bottom of the well!

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,679
-Yes, sir!
-Hurry up!

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,880
I knew it.

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,680
There was something wrong
with the water source.

92
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,640
Don't blame us for this.

93
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,959
It'll never be this bitter even if we
put 20kg of Coptis into the containers.

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,679
We got it out.

95
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,160
-Come, give us a hand.
-Be careful.

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,679
Come on.

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,239
Come!

98
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,679
-Over there.
-Come here, buddy.

99
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,341
Be careful.

100
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
What is this?

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,000
Calling to mind the past sufferings
and think about the good times ahead

102
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,920
is the glorious tradition
of the military?

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,839
Yan Po Yue?

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,399
This ingrate!

105
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,359
He betrayed us.

106
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,239
How is he still not captured even though
we've sent so many men after him?

107
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,421
Take cover!

108
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,120
What's going on?

109
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,240
First, he poisoned the water.
Now, he's using a mortar against us?

110
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,480
Are you serious?

111
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,071
The team beside the well was
caught by a mortar explosion.

112
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:44,600
10 squad leaders of the kitchen squad

113
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:46,448
and 27 members of the kitchen squad

114
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:47,680
were annihilated.

115
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,464
How did the Red Team
get their hands on mortars?

116
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:52,000
They launched a surprise attack
against our armoury.

117
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:53,688
I think they've stolen it from us.

118
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,760
More than 70% of the kitchen squad
has been wiped out.

119
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,961
The entire squad
is considered annihilated.

120
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:02,064
This is the first time
we're facing such a battle.

121
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:06,865
(Yan Po Yue,)

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,161
(the Blue Team's special service unit
is less than 600m away)

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,320
(from the location of your mortar shot.)

124
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Thank you.

125
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,320
(I can stall them
for another three minutes.)

126
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:16,880
Roger that.

127
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,920
Don't move!

128
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:00,346
Yan Po Yue learned how to set up booby
traps from Fan of the kitchen squad.

129
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,320
This might be one of his booby traps.

130
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,120
After him!

131
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,880
Stop!

132
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:31,976
Everyone, watch out for landmines.

133
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,640
Yan Po Yue trained at a very young age.

134
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,000
Even when he runs, the size of
his foot tracks remains almost the same.

135
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:37,439
But after he entered the bushes,

136
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,200
11 of his foot tracks were
obviously shorter than usual.

137
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,480
That means he has reduced his speed.

138
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,720
However, he had plenty of stamina
when he was pursued by his enemy.

139
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,880
There's only one possibility.

140
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,799
Everyone, line up and get into a column.

141
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,800
Follow my footsteps.

142
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,560
(Yan Po Yue, there are
too many snipers on their side.)

143
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:21,160
(They've suppressed me completely.)

144
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:22,800
(I cannot provide you
with any assistance.)

145
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:26,880
Roger that.

146
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,800
I hope both of us
can last until the very end.

147
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,512
Over.

148
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:01,186
Lone Wolf!

149
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,200
Although we're using sniper rifles,

150
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,680
we're using rubber bullets!

151
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,360
Our bullets can't even
pierce a piece of leaf!

152
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,681
Don't you think

153
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:10,920
this is meaningless?

154
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,719
Why don't we have a showdown
with live bullets?

155
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,280
Lone Wolf!

156
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,096
Your camouflage technique,

157
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:25,025
sniping skills,

158
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,519
and calculating abilities

159
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,520
are the strongest I've ever seen!

160
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,079
However,

161
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,360
you can only utilise about
60% of your abilities

162
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,720
for a drill like this!

163
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,080
I wish to see you
at your strongest moment!

164
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,800
I don't want an enemy who's restricted
by the rules of the drill!

165
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,320
Now, we have 11 members left!

166
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,920
I can suppress you completely
if I leave six of them here!

167
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,280
After that, I'll lead my team
and eliminate Yan Po Yue personally!

168
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Now,

169
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
he's being pursued by
Gao Zhun and his team.

170
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm sure you know this. To snipers,

171
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:02,720
he's a sitting duck!

172
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,760
I need at most an hour

173
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,960
to eliminate him!

174
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,664
After that, I'll bring my team back
and confront you!

175
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,930
Lone Wolf!

176
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,120
If this was a real battlefield,

177
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,640
and you insisted on concealing yourself,

178
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,480
that means you're doing nothing while
your teammate's being hunted down!

179
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:31,114
Lone Wolf!

180
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,039
These 11 water bottles

181
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,919
represent the 11 snipers
on the Blue Team,

182
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:36,841
including me!

183
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:38,465
For every water bottle you hit,

184
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,921
one member will be eliminated!

185
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:43,770
At the same time,
I will observe the entire situation.

186
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,280
And, I will direct the snipers

187
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,563
with my walkie-talkie!

188
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,129
If we discover your tracks,

189
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:52,793
you will be eliminated!

190
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,073
X122, Y34.

191
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:14,193
That's right. That's the place.

192
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,240
Search thoroughly.

193
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,050
Squad Leader!

194
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,840
You two have already been eliminated.

195
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,426
This grass

196
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,920
is just part of her diversionary tactic.

197
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:46,480
She cuts the grass with her blade

198
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,760
and places them on top of the bush.

199
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,600
When the wind blows,

200
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,560
the grass moves with the wind.

201
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,440
She used the moment when the grass moved

202
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:57,040
to attract our attention

203
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:59,328
and shot her targets at the same time.

204
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,218
I'm truly impressed. She's amazing.

205
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:04,937
We won't be able

206
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,385
to learn this type of skill
in training or classes.

207
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:11,112
How is this possible?

208
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:16,437
She's truly amazing.

209
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,120
Write this down.

210
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,904
When a person is in
a highly-focused state,

211
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,073
that person can only stay within
that state for at most 30 minutes.

212
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:25,828
Once the limit is exceeded,

213
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,400
the body won't be able
to stand the burden.

214
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,640
When that happens,
that person will become absent-minded

215
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,785
and commit a mistake
that isn't possible to commit usually.

216
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:33,882
Due to that,

217
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,120
our body will put us in a trance
or force us to blink

218
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,521
to force us to relax

219
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:39,871
and take a break.

220
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:42,890
In order not to exceed
the limit of my body,

221
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,599
I will close my eyes
and take a short break

222
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,994
every 18 minutes.

223
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,921
During the entire process,

224
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,039
I will still hold my binoculars

225
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,529
and rotate my body at a small angle

226
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,489
and be in a surveilling state.

227
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:01,984
It's been 129 minutes.

228
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:05,127
I've taken seven breaks in total.

229
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,999
During the entire process,

230
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:10,225
I thought I was cautious enough.

231
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,400
However, behind my effort
to conceal myself,

232
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,798
maybe it's because of
the slight deviation of my movements,

233
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:19,030
or the slow turning rate

234
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,681
when I was readjusting my vision,

235
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,039
anyway,

236
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:24,864
when I took my sixth break,

237
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,920
Lone Wolf had already found
the rhythm of my movements.

238
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,719
And,

239
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,639
she pulled the trigger decisively

240
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,881
and hit me during my seventh break.

241
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,799
At this moment,

242
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,880
I was blind even though
my eyes were open!

243
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:46,432
Some people love to camp at high spots.

244
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,519
When you camp at high spots,
you'll have great vision.

245
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,976
Some people

246
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,793
love to hide themselves in bushes.

247
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,039
That way, they feel secure.

248
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,359
Some people

249
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:59,200
are left-handed.

250
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,040
They're used to
aiming with their left eyes.

251
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:04,497
Even when they draw an escape path,

252
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:07,192
they'll stick to the left
due to their habit.

253
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,767
Due to the difference
of details for each individual,

254
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:12,824
we call them humans

255
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,682
instead of machines.

256
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:16,914
But I only realised this

257
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,000
by today.

258
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:23,048
If we do encounter enemies
like Lone Wolf,

259
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,385
we might be dead

260
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,570
without even seeing them.

261
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:29,960
That's why

262
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,039
a sniper

263
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,536
must never have a habit.

264
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:25,936
That's impossible.

265
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,038
We didn't see any spark
nor hear any gunshots.

266
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,280
Did she install a silencer
on her sniper rifle?

267
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:34,744
She changed her bullets.

268
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,825
After doing some recalculations,

269
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:38,505
the amount of gunpowder
within the new bullets

270
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,840
is lesser than normal bullets.

271
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,160
The gunshot and spark

272
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:44,705
were contained in the barrel

273
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,802
due to precise calculations.

274
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,319
You guys have already done a great job.

275
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:49,842
But, we've lost.

276
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:03,186
Lone Wolf!

277
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:12,353
I admit,

278
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:14,233
we've lost to you!

279
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,959
But when you were
confronting our snipers,

280
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:22,079
your approximate location
was locked on by our artilleries.

281
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,186
They will carpet-bomb the location

282
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:27,945
in 15 minutes.

283
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:31,993
No matter how excellent you are,
you won't be able to escape it.

284
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,600
(The fifth day of the drill)

285
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,641
-Sir!
-Speak!

286
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,480
The supplies that the HQ had sent
to us will arrive by today.

287
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:10,953
So, is there still no news
from the search company?

288
00:21:11,762 --> 00:21:12,593
No.

289
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,760
-What's the situation?
-This is a restricted zone.

290
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
They're undergoing
a military drill right now.

291
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,560
Please show me your identification card
and your access permit.

292
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:04,962
What about you guys?

293
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,800
I need to check the cargo.

294
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,640
I heard that the Red Team
had sabotaged your water source

295
00:22:35,718 --> 00:22:37,160
and that you guys
were waiting for our rescue.

296
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,240
That's right.

297
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,520
The radishes and cucumbers
came at the right moment.

298
00:22:43,304 --> 00:22:45,544
The military drill zone extends
from here all the way to the camp.

299
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,920
In order to prevent accidents,

300
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,520
I will escort your truck

301
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,116
to ensure the safety
of your men and the cargo.

302
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:51,880
Okay.

303
00:22:57,906 --> 00:22:59,400
Did you see that soldier just now?

304
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,486
His eyes were gleaming
when he saw the cucumbers.

305
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:02,841
Escort us?

306
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:05,000
He just wants to quench his thirst.

307
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,296
You guys will arrive at
the base after 1km.

308
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,210
I have to return to my post.

309
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,056
Goodbye.

310
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,680
Buddies, double up!

311
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,480
Thank you so much.

312
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:11,360
Great job.

313
00:24:11,546 --> 00:24:13,599
We would've been done for
if you guys took longer to arrive.

314
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,840
Where's the leader of your detachment?

315
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,040
He was killed in battle.

316
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:23,920
What about the political commissar?

317
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,760
He was killed in battle too.

318
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,880
Is the drill that intense?

319
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,760
We've taken down Three Shells Qin too.

320
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,038
But, the drill isn't over yet?

321
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,400
There are only a few soldiers left
on the Red Team.

322
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,000
I think the drill will be over soon.

323
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,360
Reporter Gu?

324
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,600
You didn't tell us that you were coming.

325
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,400
We just wanted to get some
true footage from the frontline.

326
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,202
No problem.

327
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,920
Staff Officer Liu, come here.

328
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,770
Bring Reporter Gu around.

329
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
-Yes, sir!
-No need for that.

330
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,319
We can do it ourselves.

331
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:55,959
Okay.

332
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,560
-We'll make a move now.
-No problem.

333
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,721
-Take care.
-Okay.

334
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,560
For this time Red vs. Blue drill,
it's a battle between

335
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,200
the special unit detachment of
the plateau base

336
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,800
and the four squads of
the Cheetah Commando.

337
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:12,200
Although there's a huge number gap
between the two teams,

338
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,632
the armed police forces know fully well

339
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:18,240
how capable the Cheetah Commando are.

340
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,880
Currently, this is
the fifth day of the drill.

341
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,480
The Blue Team has suffered terrible
casualties. They're out of supplies.

342
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,680
The contest isn't over yet.

343
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,360
The members who were eliminated
could not leave the drill zone yet.

344
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,080
Now, let's hear from them.

345
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,800
My comrades, time to eat!

346
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,600
Why are you guys pulling a long face?

347
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:45,880
-All of you look so dejected.
-Give us a smile.

348
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,560
As soldiers, we either win or lose.

349
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,920
We should stay hopeful. Time to eat.

350
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,240
Don't feel dejected or disappointed
in yourselves!

351
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,760
You guys have already
done an excellent job!

352
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,760
Give us a smile.

353
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,800
-It's fine.
-Come on, raise your head.

354
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,360
-Eat up.
-Here you go.

355
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,040
Give us a smile.

356
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,178
Good job.

357
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,240
What's with the amount?
How is this enough for us?

358
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah, there's only a pack of hardtack.
Where's the meat?

359
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,080
My buddies,

360
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,040
since we've already given you some food,
you should eat without complaining.

361
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:11,959
Logically speaking,

362
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,800
you guys were already sacrificed.

363
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,640
We shouldn't waste
our food supplies on dead people.

364
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,520
But, as we couldn't bear
to see you guys starve,

365
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,239
Comrade Guo Kui and I did our best

366
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,160
to get you guys some food
meant for the living.

367
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,119
And now, you're asking for meat?

368
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,645
Eat up! Don't complain!

369
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,320
Only the housekeeper
knows the housekeeping.

370
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,239
-Get your cans here.
-Comrades, good job.

371
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,680
To serve the people!

372
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,320
So, what do you guys
think about your performance?

373
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,040
As part of the logistics support team,

374
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,239
we've already done our best.

375
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,640
I even eliminated one of the Cheetahs.

376
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,080
That's right! Me too!

377
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:42,720
So, how do you rate your opponent?

378
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:45,319
Although they're excellent soldiers,
we're not mediocre either.

379
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,760
That's right! We're not mediocre!

380
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,040
So, do you think your team can win?

381
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,720
We will surely win!

382
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,200
I've already eliminated Xiao Yun Jie
from the enemy team.

383
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,439
Our snipers

384
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,480
have already eliminated
their golden sniper as well.

385
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,640
Now, Yan Po Yue is
their only surviving member.

386
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,200
He will be eliminated soon as well.

387
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,200
There's no doubt.
We will surely win, right?

388
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,840
That's right!

389
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,380
Victory is ours!

390
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,080
-Am I right?
-That's right.

391
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,840
Seems like
the Blue Team's morale is rising.

392
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,039
Facing such a huge gap in numbers,

393
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,800
will the last Cheetah
be able to fight his way out

394
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,680
and increase
the Blue Team's casualty to 50%?

395
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,120
Let's look forward to his performance.

396
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:28,480
The cucumbers are here.

397
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,040
Our fruits are here!

398
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,480
Have a cucumber after your meal,
be as happy as a seal!

399
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,361
Let's eat. Here.

400
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,000
One for each of you.

401
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,840
Only one, okay? Don't take extra.

402
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,080
What?

403
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,400
-Guo.
-What's the matter?

404
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:50,176
Wait, what happened to your mouth?

405
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
What do you mean?

406
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,040
What's wrong with you?

407
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
Why is your mouth bleeding?

408
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,760
I'm not bleeding.

409
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,920
The cucumber is bleeding.

410
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,640
Mine is bleeding too!

411
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,680
I've already taken half of it!

412
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,640
Stop eating!

413
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,600
Spit them out!

414
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,040
Get us some water!

415
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,880
The water is bitter!

416
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,839
Don't drink the water!
Find some salt! Hurry!

417
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,319
Find some salt! Hurry!

418
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
-Test them immediately.
-Yes, sir!

419
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,800
They were fine
when we were transporting them.

420
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,360
How did this happen?

421
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,959
Didn't you discover
anything suspicious on your way here?

422
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,920
One of your soldiers stopped our truck.

423
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,439
He was reminding us that
we were entering the drill zone.

424
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:43,239
He escorted our truck for a short period
to ensure our safety.

425
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,760
Is he the person you were talking about?

426
00:28:51,937 --> 00:28:53,011
That's right. It's him.

427
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,160
He's not our ally!
He's from the Red Team!

428
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,133
Yan Po Yue?

429
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:02,280
During wartime,

430
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,479
it's common

431
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,040
for one's supplies
to be sabotaged by the enemy team.

432
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,441
When the test result is out

433
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,640
and my hypothesis has been proved,

434
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,520
I will write a report and explain
the entire incident to our higher-ups.

435
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,040
You should take the cucumbers back.

436
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:18,256
I'm really sorry about this.

437
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:19,778
I didn't expect this to happen.

438
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
Go now.

439
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:33,999
Where are you going?

440
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm going to find that Yan Po Yue.

441
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,560
Everyone is talking about him.

442
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,920
I want to see how good is he.

443
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,919
Let's get some first-hand experience.

444
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,880
-Where can we get it?
-The drill zone.

445
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,000
Are you out of your mind?

446
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,399
The Blue Team couldn't find him even
though they had dispatched many men.

447
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,600
Do you think you can find him?

448
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,880
In my opinion, we should just stay here
and get some footage.

449
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,080
We need to interview the top soldier
since we have come all the way here.

450
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,240
How could we get first-hand information
without going to the frontline?

451
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,000
We've been travelling
for over three hours.

452
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,440
We saw no one at all.

453
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,920
We should've followed the Blue Team,

454
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,400
but you insisted on taking another path.

455
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,560
Now, we can't even find our way back.

456
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,000
You've been nagging me all the way.
Can you stop?

457
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,040
The Blue Team couldn't find Yan Po Yue
because they took the wrong direction.

458
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,200
But, we can't find him
if we just act like a headless chicken.

459
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,720
Yan Po Yue! Come out!

460
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,200
I'm a reporter of
the armed police forces!

461
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,039
I want to interview you!

462
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,560
Come out!

463
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,439
Enough. Stop shouting.

464
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,439
You'll attract a bear here.

465
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,320
Don't try to scare me.

466
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,040
There's no bear around here.

467
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,800
Who are you guys?

468
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,040
We're reporters from
the armed police forces' HQ.

469
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,601
We're here to interview you guys.

470
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,040
Go back and tell the Blue Team
to come and rescue her.

471
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,760
Staff Officer Sun!

472
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Why have you returned?

473
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,600
The Red Team has taken Gu Meng
as their hostage.

474
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
-Was it Yan Po Yue?
-I think so.

475
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,120
Didn't I tell them
not to enter the drill zone?

476
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,160
Gu Meng and the photographer
sneaked into the drill zone.

477
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:28,760
He said they were ambushed by Yan Po Yue
and Gu Meng was abducted.

478
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,480
He wants us to rescue her.

479
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,400
The photographer is a newcomer.
He said he's going to report this

480
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,920
to our higher-ups and say

481
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,960
that we're not cooperating with them
by putting them in danger.

482
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,959
Where did it happen?

483
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,680
Judging from his description,
I think it's Zone D.

484
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,080
Hurry.

485
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,680
Tell the rest that 15 of them
can stay here and guard the base

486
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,680
while 20 of them shall head to Zone D
to rescue the reporter.

487
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,720
The rest can head to Zone C
and flank him

488
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,720
to prevent him from
launching a feint attack.

489
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,960
Once you find the target,
rescue her immediately!

490
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,800
Yes, sir!

491
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,000
You! Let go of me!

492
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,640
Let go of me!

493
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,840
Sorry about this. You might
have to endure this for a while.

494
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:23,593
What are you doing?

495
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm a reporter!

496
00:32:25,728 --> 00:32:26,848
Are you truly a reporter?

497
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,840
-What are you doing here?
-To get an interview.

498
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,960
To put it accurately,
I'm here to interview you.

499
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,760
I thought you were one of their spies.

500
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,840
How could I be a spy?

501
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,080
I guess you're not a spy.

502
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,800
I've already searched your body.

503
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:42,680
I didn't discover anything suspicious.

504
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,800
You!

505
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,520
How dare you say you're the top member
when you took advantage of a woman?

506
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,520
All of them described you as someone
amazing! But I think you're just a...

507
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,440
A what?

508
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,120
What are you doing?

509
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,680
Are you even a disciplined soldier?

510
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,074
I just want a pretty,

511
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,360
elegant,

512
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:09,896
and wealthy

513
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,214
young lady like you who takes
the military camp lightly to understand

514
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,000
that wearing a military uniform to
the battlefield without thinking twice

515
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,233
will harm

516
00:33:22,194 --> 00:33:23,794
countless other people.

517
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:28,367
Save me!

518
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:31,080
Is anyone there?

519
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,080
Help!

520
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,720
Help!

521
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,080
Is anyone there?

522
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,680
Save me!

523
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,600
-Help!
-Squad Leader!

524
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,160
Why are we still waiting?
Let's hurry and save her!

525
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,760
Look at the location
Yan Po Yue has chosen.

526
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,256
It's an open field.

527
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640
If we go there, we'll be gunned down!

528
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,960
So what if we're gunned down?
This is just a drill!

529
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,720
Even if this was a real battle,

530
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:58,119
we couldn't just do nothing about it
when a female comrade

531
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,120
is being held hostage!

532
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:01,040
Save me!

533
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,600
Is anyone there?

534
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,680
Save me!

535
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,360
Help!

536
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,800
-Is anyone there?
-Squad Leader!

537
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,919
Squad Leader!

538
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,440
-Squad Leader!
-Squad Leader!

539
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,152
-Number 06!
-Yes, sir!

540
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,041
Take two men with you
and rescue Reporter Gu!

541
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,720
Yes, sir!

542
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,680
Watch out!

543
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,959
Number 06, stop!
You're already eliminated!

544
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:47,860
Why are you still
going against the rules?

545
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,520
If you don't stop, you'll have
no right to tell Yan Po Yue off!

546
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,119
Yan Po Yue! Come out!

547
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Come out!

548
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,080
You're a scoundrel! Come out!

549
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:03,840
Come back!

550
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,840
Do you want to die for nothing?

551
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,240
Don't come here!

552
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,481
Don't come here!

553
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,440
Don't come here!

554
00:35:11,002 --> 00:35:12,561
Yan Po Yue!

555
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,680
-You scoundrel!
-Scoundrel!

556
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:16,280
You scoundrel!

557
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,720
Come out!

558
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,080
You guys!

559
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:47,257
You're fine now.

560
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,080
Don't be scared. Everything's fine now.

561
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:53,600
Yan Po Yue!

562
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,160
You scoundrel!

563
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,937
I hate you!

564
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:58,760
I hate you so much!

565
00:36:01,938 --> 00:36:03,600
(Battling alone)

566
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:05,400
(is just like diving underwater.)

567
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,840
(There's only
an endless amount of silence.)

568
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:11,680
(Camouflaging oneself,
infiltrating the enemy's base,)

569
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,480
(looking for food,
those aren't the hardest things.)

570
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:16,080
(The hardest thing is that
you have no one to communicate with.)

571
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,160
(In the past,)

572
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:21,920
(I thought fighting
by myself was enough.)

573
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:24,160
(But now, I hope)

574
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:28,160
(I wouldn't end up like this
if I was caught in a true battle.)

575
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,057
(I'm isolated.)

576
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,880
(I have no one else to depend on
except for myself.)

577
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,320
Hurry! After him!

578
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,520
Hurry!

579
00:37:44,777 --> 00:37:46,200
The drill lasted for
seven days and nights.

580
00:37:46,658 --> 00:37:47,640
It's finally over.

581
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,400
Liu, stop staring into space.

582
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,720
Hurry and announce the result.

583
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
I hereby announce

584
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,360
that the drill is over!

585
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,520
Yes, sir!

586
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,631
Dismissed!

587
00:38:28,396 --> 00:38:29,240
Liu,

588
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:30,960
are you furious?

589
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,680
All of our drills are dictated

590
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:35,223
by the drill command centre, am I right?

591
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,600
The winner and loser were
already stated in the script.

592
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:42,200
We have to do our part
and play our own roles.

593
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:43,400
That's why

594
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,840
although you guys have
an absolute advantage over us,

595
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:49,600
you guys were still restrained by

596
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,480
the traditional ways of thinking.

597
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:55,120
You guys were still
sticking to the script.

598
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,000
Listen, the philosophy of the Cheetahs

599
00:38:58,183 --> 00:38:59,960
is to delve into the blind spot

600
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,320
of our enemies' thinking from the start.

601
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:07,258
Qin,

602
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,490
we've known each other
for so many years.

603
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,960
Do you think
I'm truly furious at the result?

604
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,640
You see, I was thinking about this.

605
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,440
If this was a true battlefield,

606
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,520
would we be able to win

607
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,160
when we encounter enemies like you guys?

608
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:33,640
So, what do you think?

609
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,280
The Cheetahs,

610
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,329
especially Yan Po Yue,

611
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:42,200
had performed spectacularly
in this drill.

612
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,520
He used the loopholes in the rules
to his fullest advantage

613
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,040
and showed us his clever schemes.

614
00:39:48,746 --> 00:39:49,680
However,

615
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,170
when you think about it,

616
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,080
if this was a true battlefield,

617
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,649
after he saw

618
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,720
the blood of his teammates,

619
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,400
when he would do anything

620
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:06,320
in order to avenge his teammates,

621
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,920
what kind of ruthless schemes
do you think he'd come up with?

622
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,800
(The Red vs. Blue drill is over!)

623
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,480
(All units, assemble
at the Blue Team's base.)

624
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,360
(The Red vs. Blue drill is over!)

625
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,000
(All units, assemble
at the Blue Team's base.)

626
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:30,600
(The Red vs. Blue drill is over!)

627
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:34,320
(All units, assemble
at the Blue Team's base.)

628
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
(The Red vs. Blue drill is over!)

629
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,440
Here.

630
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,200
What's going on?

631
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,720
Isn't the drill already over?

632
00:40:59,089 --> 00:40:59,970
What's going on?

633
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,998
Who's shooting at us?

634
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,240
-Sir!
-Is everyone already there?

635
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,240
No, sir. Yan Po Yue isn't here.

636
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,000
He's still attacking the Blue Team.

637
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:17,785
What? Say that again?

638
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,680
He's still attacking our team.

639
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:24,120
Qin, what's wrong with him?

640
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:26,257
What's going on?

641
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:27,729
He's your subordinate!

642
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,519
(Yan Po Yue,)

643
00:41:39,044 --> 00:41:40,320
(I'm Qin Feng.)

644
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:42,040
(The drill is already over.)

645
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,080
(The drill sensor system
has been deactivated.)

646
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:46,680
(You are)

647
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,200
(to head to
the Blue Team's base immediately.)

648
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:55,840
(Yan Po Yue, I'm Qin Feng.)

649
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,520
(The drill is already over.)

650
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,560
(The drill sensor system
has been deactivated.)

651
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:01,938
(You are)

652
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,480
(to head to
the Blue Team's base immediately.)

653
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,320
(Yan Po Yue,)

654
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:10,925
(I'm Qin Feng.)

655
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,841
(The drill is already over.)

656
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,880
(The drill sensor system
has been deactivated.)

657
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,720
(The 17th day of the drill)

658
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:35,160
We need someone
to search from here to here.

659
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,305
We've already sent out
every man we have.

660
00:42:37,386 --> 00:42:38,386
We still have no news from him.

661
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:43,400
We've searched that area.
There's no sign of him.

662
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,840
He's not back yet.

663
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:47,502
Could it be that he's in danger?

664
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,440
That brat, I guess
he's addicted to fighting.

665
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:53,040
Captain, how about this? I'll find him.

666
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,226
I'll bring him back personally.
