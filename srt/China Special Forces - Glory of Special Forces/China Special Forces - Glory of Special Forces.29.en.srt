(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,040
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,720
(Episode 29)

4
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,201
For this simulation exercise,

5
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,632
25 enemies

6
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,999
were killed.

7
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,560
Four enemies

8
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,640
were injured.

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,680
There were zero casualty

10
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,000
on our side.

11
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,679
The hostage

12
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,880
was rescued successfully.

13
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,040
The enemy leader

14
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,200
was captured successfully.

15
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,160
Extraction

16
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
was a success.

17
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,600
Overall,

18
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,775
mission accomplished!

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,000
You guys have accomplished your mission.

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,880
Do you guys feel happy?

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
But, this is a retake!

22
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,840
There's nothing for you
to be happy about!

23
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,040
I would've been proud of you guys

24
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,600
if you guys passed at the first attempt.

25
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:43,880
So this time,

26
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:47,848
it's barely a pass.

27
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,880
I hope

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,320
that you guys can remember
the lessons you've learned here

29
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,680
on every mission you go to.

30
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,560
Grab hold of your enemy's weakness

31
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,120
and deal them a fatal blow.

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
Conclude what you've learned here

33
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:02,760
when you go back.

34
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,080
Captain,

35
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,200
don't be that stingy.

36
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,400
You should reward them.

37
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,169
Tonight,

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,480
the kitchen squad
will prepare extra dishes for you all.

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,920
Thank you, Captain!

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,920
Thank you, Captain!

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
Extra dishes!

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,080
One, two.

43
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:01,240
Put down your gun.

44
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:03,320
Put down your knife.

45
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:16,400
All of you are dismissed.

46
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:24,440
What? Were you upset
that I was the one who had survived?

47
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,720
Can you make them listen to you?

48
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,241
They won't listen to me,

49
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:38,280
but they'll listen to money.

50
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,560
Let's go. I'll introduce
some new friends to you.

51
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:50,680
General, this is my little sister, Miya.

52
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:52,760
This is General Xin Min.

53
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,880
Let go of me!

54
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:09,160
Let go!

55
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:13,817
Let go of me!

56
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:15,440
Let go of me!

57
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,680
Let go of me!

58
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,400
Let go of me!

59
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,720
Is she your younger sister?

60
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:29,000
She's the goddaughter of Kun Sheng.

61
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,200
But now, she's your enemy.

62
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Naturally, she's my enemy too.

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,960
Go to hell!

64
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,257
What's the history
between you and Xin Min?

65
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,560
Xin Min was originally
a captain of the guerrillas.

66
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:22,680
And my father was
the supreme commander of said squad.

67
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,040
For the sake of money,

68
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,120
he betrayed my father.

69
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,480
He even gave me
to his subordinate as a gift.

70
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:40,320
I would rather die than submit to them.

71
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:42,680
Therefore, they locked me up

72
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,480
and injected me with drugs.

73
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,600
They wanted to force me to submit.

74
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,440
I wore his shirt and escaped from them.

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,760
But, I was addicted to the drugs.

76
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,240
That's why I tried to steal money
from the Red Scorpion.

77
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:01,826
That's how I was captured by you guys.

78
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:05,881
You should've told me the truth earlier.

79
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I've already invited Xin Min
into our stronghold.

80
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,680
What do you want me to do now?

81
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,039
Xin Min is a despicable man.
You only invited him here

82
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:15,459
because of his guns and men.

83
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm sure you won't
keep him alive for too long.

84
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:22,520
I'll leave this chance to you.

85
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,080
Get up!

86
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:38,872
Get up!

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,950
Get up, you fool!

88
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:48,475
This fight is boring.

89
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,120
They should fight with knives.

90
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,720
That way, it'll end faster.

91
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,440
Every knife-wielder here knows

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
that General Xin Min is the best
at wielding knives.

93
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,399
General, I wonder

94
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,439
if you can show us your skills?

95
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,119
Show us your skills!

96
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:15,905
Show us your skills!

97
00:08:18,713 --> 00:08:20,600
Blood will be shed
whenever I wield my knives.

98
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:22,040
Do you have an opponent for me?

99
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,809
Wasn't she dead?

100
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:36,640
She's barely alive.

101
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:38,720
Coincidentally,
we can feed her to your knives.

102
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,040
You wanted to seek revenge, didn't you?

103
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,080
Cherish your chance.

104
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,640
General!

105
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,440
Don't move! Put down your gun!

106
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,481
Put down your gun!

107
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,599
A mighty general like him

108
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,071
actually lost to a woman?

109
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,056
Since the general is gone,

110
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:52,889
all of us will join the Red Scorpion.

111
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,559
Please be our new general.

112
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,535
Hurry and pay respect
to our new general!

113
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,159
Salute!

114
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,600
You guys specialize in
jungle and mountain warfare.

115
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,760
You guys are mainly active
in jungle areas,

116
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,640
hills, and river courses.

117
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,564
So, heavy weapons like tanks

118
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,280
pose a small threat to you guys.

119
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,043
Unless you guys had just executed
an execution mission,

120
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,280
if not, the enemies wouldn't use
a large number of missiles

121
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:44,159
to attack an eight-man squad
from a long distance.

122
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,795
So, on the battlefield,

123
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,559
there are two main threats
to your squad.

124
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,440
First, artillery bombardments.

125
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,100
Second, aerial assault.

126
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:53,755
Next,

127
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,561
let's talk about artillery bombardments.

128
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,280
In Western countries,

129
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,000
they usually have three types
of diameters for artillery shells,

130
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,000
namely

131
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,416
105mm, 155mm,

132
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,879
and 203mm.

133
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,240
On the battlefield,

134
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,680
if you guys don't have enough time
to set up a trench

135
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,080
and there's no object for you
to take cover behind,

136
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,239
if you guys were taking fire
from heavy artilleries like these

137
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,119
without any retaliation,

138
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,200
I can only tell you this.

139
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,400
Rest in peace.

140
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,240
So,

141
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:27,480
why am I teaching you this today?

142
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,120
Because I was once an artilleryman.

143
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,919
Back then, when I was still
in the artillery squad,

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,201
we had some slogans.

145
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,240
Take the blame, being cheated upon,

146
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:39,320
avoiding all the bullets.

147
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Cooking porridge at the backlines.

148
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,200
Can't hit your target? Darn it.

149
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,240
No choice but to reload the shells.

150
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Reload the shells.

151
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,801
When I was still serving
in the artillery squad,

152
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,200
my ears were injured.

153
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,640
So, what happened?

154
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:55,040
On the battlefield,

155
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,160
an artillery shell struck the ground
18m away from me.

156
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:02,326
I was lucky that I survived.

157
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,840
It's because the artillery shell

158
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,480
was a 105mm shell.

159
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:10,416
If it was a 155mm shell,

160
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
I would be resting in peace by now.

161
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,880
The shock wave generated by it
covers an area of 50m.

162
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,799
If it was a 203mm shell,

163
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,200
I would've been totally dead.

164
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:22,799
The shock wave generated by it

165
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,479
covers an area of 100m.

166
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,040
And, people within a 30m radius
will be reduced to ashes.

167
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:30,440
Someone might say

168
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
that I could just take a prone position.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,281
But I need to tell you this.

170
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,832
Even if I take a prone position,

171
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:39,479
the shock wave generated by the explosion

172
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,321
is enough to shock me to death.

173
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:44,320
Next, I'll show you guys something.

174
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,560
Does anyone know what this is?

175
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,799
Let me put it like this.

176
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,719
If I was an artillery commander,

177
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,880
and my mission was
to bomb the special forces,

178
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,881
I would surely order my troops
to install these in their shells.

179
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,424
It's a cluster flechette cartridge.

180
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,640
You can store up to 1,000 flechettes

181
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,241
in an artillery shell.

182
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,400
When the artillery shell
explodes in mid-air,

183
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,200
the flechette will rain down the area.

184
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,160
It can form a fan-shaped web

185
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,999
that covers 300m in length
and 90m in width.

186
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,920
That means

187
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
as long as they fire over 10
cluster flechette cartridges like these,

188
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:24,593
you guys will be rendered useless.

189
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,361
Here. Pass it around.

190
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,320
Xiao, pass it to me.

191
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,310
-I have a question.
-Speak up.

192
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,833
If the enemies

193
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,593
do use these cluster flechette
cartridges against us,

194
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,186
what should we do?

195
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,600
There's only one solution.

196
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:51,353
Do not be caught
within their range of fire.

197
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:53,273
Any other questions?

198
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,178
-Sir.
-Speak.

199
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,343
This type of non-standard
artillery shells should be included

200
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:59,544
in the list of banned weapons
by the Geneva Conventions

201
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,640
just like the Dumdum bullet
and white phosphorus munitions, right?

202
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,035
What?

203
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,831
Do you think this weapon is too brutal?

204
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:08,332
I have something to tell you.

205
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,200
It's a shame, but it wasn't listed
within the list of banned weapons.

206
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:13,625
And, we can think about this
from another perspective.

207
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,799
So what if it's included in the list?

208
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,120
Do you think your enemies
will read the Geneva Conventions?

209
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,200
Do you?

210
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,605
-Sir.
-Speak.

211
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:25,165
I think this weapon

212
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,218
isn't as scary as what
you had described.

213
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:28,376
Explain yourself.

214
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,120
The special forces, especially those
specializing in mountain warfare

215
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,840
have the ability

216
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,560
to traverse through jungles
and hills quickly.

217
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,360
Adding to the fact that we have tactics
like using electronic decoys,

218
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,800
if our enemies wish to catch us
with their heavy artilleries,

219
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,267
it'll be like an elephant
trying to catch a mouse.

220
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,960
They have the power,
but they have nowhere to use it.

221
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,633
As long as we don't reveal our tracks
during camping,

222
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,040
the large calibre shells

223
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:56,081
won't be able to hit us.

224
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:57,680
He's right.

225
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:58,760
He did a great job explaining himself.

226
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,455
But I need to tell you this.

227
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,040
Since you can think of this,
naturally, your enemies can too.

228
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,720
This is the next topic we'll discuss.

229
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,200
So, what awaits you

230
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,040
after the bombardment
of heavy artilleries?

231
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,920
The nemesis of all infantries, mortars.

232
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,280
Mortars are weapons

233
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
that even infantries can carry.

234
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:18,520
And,

235
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,960
there's almost no dead angle
to its curve shooting.

236
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:22,759
That means

237
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,799
it's especially useful against

238
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
targets that are
hiding behind obstacles.

239
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:30,679
And, mortars are easy to use.

240
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,160
Even inexperienced militias

241
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,600
can use them
after going through simple training.

242
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:36,525
Let me put it this way.

243
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:37,960
There's a group of militias.

244
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
There are four of them.

245
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,119
They can fire around
20 mortar shells in 1 minute.

246
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,480
If they keep firing
for the entire minute,

247
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,579
they'll fire over 100 mortar shells.

248
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,921
That is more than enough to kill
members of special forces like us.

249
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,160
And,

250
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,680
the mortar might be
weaker in terms of firepower,

251
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,520
but it can fire
incendiary shells, flares,

252
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,119
even gas bombs.

253
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,359
If you guys are unlucky enough

254
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,400
to encounter mortar experts

255
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,800
that can make their
own mortar shells on the go,

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,040
they might be able to fire mortar
shells that can explode in mid-air

257
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,920
and unleash over
100 flechettes just like this.

258
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,159
Alright, I think that's all for today.

259
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,141
How is it?

260
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,640
Did you guys remember what I had taught?

261
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,240
Yes, sir!

262
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:25,418
Back then, when I was studying,

263
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,760
as long as

264
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,719
I studied seriously,

265
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,120
I didn't need to use any notebooks.

266
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:30,920
Come.

267
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,520
Now, I'll give you some time
to do your revision.

268
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,080
After that, bring your notes here

269
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,280
and burn them here.

270
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,199
Burn them?

271
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,880
Why did we write it down then?

272
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,520
Didn't the other instructors
do the same thing?

273
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,119
I don't care about the others.
This is my class.

274
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,200
You must burn the notes you had made.

275
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,359
Yes, sir!

276
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,680
Yes, sir!

277
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,640
You have three minutes
to do your revision.

278
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,480
That was quick.

279
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,880
He's really quick.

280
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,760
He's leaving already?

281
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,359
Yan Po Yue is already done.

282
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,720
1,227mm.

283
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,160
Hurry up!

284
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,209
Burn your notes!

285
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,480
My shells are the best in the region.

286
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,474
Demonstrate it to me.

287
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,440
Where should I hit?

288
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:33,368
The tallest pine tree on the hill.

289
00:19:56,873 --> 00:19:57,993
That's too loud.

290
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,880
The government soldiers
are patrolling nearby.

291
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,360
It's better if they come.

292
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:03,840
We can try these shells on them.

293
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:06,400
You can take the goods now, right?

294
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:17,056
To your 10 o'clock.

295
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,240
Hit the rock on the hill.

296
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,480
He's Nan Da.

297
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,520
He was once the best mortarman

298
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,280
in the government's mortar squad.

299
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,720
He never misses

300
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,744
with a mortar shell.

301
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,470
Do you guys know each other?

302
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:03,560
We've encountered each other before.

303
00:21:04,248 --> 00:21:05,520
But I've never met him personally.

304
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,129
So, you're the Mortar God, Nan Da?

305
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:11,592
He's that amazing?

306
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,887
Let me test you one last time.

307
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,721
If you hit the circle behind the rock,

308
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,760
I'll buy all of your goods!

309
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,400
Are you out of your mind?

310
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,287
Move out of the way!

311
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,760
You'd better not miss your target.

312
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,160
If he dies, you'll die too.

313
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,399
If you hurt Young Master,

314
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,440
you'll die too.

315
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,521
Hurry up!

316
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,839
I'm still alive!

317
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,113
How much do I need to pay you
for you to join us?

318
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,505
Someone has already hired me.

319
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,360
I'll pay you three times the price.

320
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:46,225
I'll give you three times
the price of your goods

321
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,360
to buy him.

322
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,225
He's priceless.

323
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:50,632
Bring us the money.

324
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,200
Bring us all the money!

325
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,942
You have enough to build
a new squad with the money here.

326
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:28,665
It's either you take the money,

327
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:32,241
or you take nothing!

328
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:42,712
Fine.

329
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,959
If I were you, I would've joined them.

330
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,314
He's paying so much for your service.

331
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,359
I'm sure he'll treat you well.

332
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,000
So, is my debt cleared now?

333
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:24,752
You deserve better.

334
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,520
You can create miracles

335
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:29,145
if you join me.

336
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:39,178
(Our arduous training
came to an abrupt halt.)

337
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,441
(The annual Red vs. Blue drill
will begin soon.)

338
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,335
(The special forces detachment
dispatched us)

339
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,960
(to join the drill
in the newly established plateau base.)

340
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,441
(I never expected myself)

341
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
(to face opponents
who were once my comrades.)

342
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:12,024
They were too anxious.

343
00:25:12,216 --> 00:25:13,296
They should've cooked it longer.

344
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,185
What's the matter, Cook Yan?

345
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:16,906
Do you miss your old job now?

346
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:18,713
Go and show them how it's done.

347
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:22,400
My personal dish, braised tofu,

348
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,042
it's the best.

349
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,439
Do you know which regiment
is in charge of the new plateau base?

350
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,560
It's Regiment 247 of Yun Range.
Their garrison was relieved

351
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,520
and they were transferred there.

352
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,360
They established
a special forces platoon over there.

353
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:35,599
They specialized in being the Blue Team.

354
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,640
How did you know?

355
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,280
One of my comrades
was in that regiment before.

356
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:41,288
How's their standard?

357
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,400
They're professional punching bags.
I guess you can say they're good.

358
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,072
I heard that two cooks from Regiment 247

359
00:25:48,153 --> 00:25:49,714
were recruited by the Cheetah Commando.

360
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,439
Why did they recruit them?

361
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,800
Do they lack cooks here?

362
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,040
Seems like they do recruit
all sorts of people.

363
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,359
What's wrong? This is unlike you.

364
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:04,848
You're more mature now.

365
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,280
If I beat them up,

366
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,320
we won't be able to join the drill.

367
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,760
Do you think I'm dumb?

368
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:14,792
Everyone here knows

369
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,001
that the First Corps specializes
in jungle and mountain warfare.

370
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,601
The annual Red vs. Blue drill
will begin soon.

371
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,359
The special forces detachment
dispatched the First Corps

372
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:26,160
to the newly established plateau base
to join their drill.

373
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,481
Next, I will announce
the names of the participants.

374
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,920
Lu Tu, Leng Jing.

375
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:31,886
Yes, sir!

376
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,519
You guys will be in charge
of the first squad.

377
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:35,720
Lu Tu will be the captain.

378
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:37,376
Leng Jing will be the vice-captain.

379
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,120
Yes, sir!

380
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,520
-Cao Ben, Bai Long!
-Yes, sir!

381
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,080
You guys will be in charge of
the second squad.

382
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,240
Cao Ben will be the captain.

383
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:45,920
Bai Long will be the vice-captain.

384
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:46,892
Yes, sir!

385
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,360
One, two, one!

386
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,800
One, two, one!

387
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,920
One, two, one!

388
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
One, two, one!

389
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:43,159
One, two, three, four!

390
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,400
One, two, one!

391
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,360
One, two, three, four!

392
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:48,497
Liu,

393
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:51,200
you and Qin Feng
are sworn rivals indeed.

394
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,880
In the past, you two
were equally matched.

395
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,280
After that, you two went separate ways.

396
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:57,040
But now, you're competing with
each other again.

397
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,440
Three Shells Qin,

398
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:03,368
this time,
he has to face off against me again.

399
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:06,800
Why did you call him Three Shells Qin?

400
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,520
He made a name for himself
after that battle.

401
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,120
Back then, when Qin Feng
first joined the Cheetah Commando,

402
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,008
he went to the border area
together with his squad

403
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,400
to arrest armed drug cartels.

404
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,160
Due to wrong intel,

405
00:28:18,272 --> 00:28:20,000
the power gap between the enemies
and them was too huge.

406
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:21,632
The squad was almost wiped out.

407
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,480
Their superior ordered them
to retreat immediately.

408
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,760
However, Qin Feng established
a line of defence by himself.

409
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,000
Using three bazooka shells,

410
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,480
he annihilated their command centre,
warehouse, and armoury.

411
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,160
He garrotted the rest of
the armed drug cartels.

412
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:36,335
Since then,

413
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:37,640
the name of Three Shells Qin

414
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,960
was known throughout
the armed police forces.

415
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,480
Qin Feng's killing drive
when he was young

416
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,320
did resemble someone we know.

417
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,360
I'll see

418
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:54,000
if that brat will come this time.

419
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:57,280
I'll see how good he has become.

420
00:28:58,577 --> 00:28:59,520
The Cheetah Special Forces

421
00:28:59,817 --> 00:29:02,617
overpowers the ordinary
by being extraordinary.

422
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,520
We emphasise quality over quantity.

423
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:05,960
So, are we actually extraordinary?

424
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,679
Are we actually quality soldiers?

425
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,119
That'll depend on
the result of the drill.

426
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,320
This time, our opponent

427
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:13,239
is a rapid deployment brigade
that has been reorganised.

428
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,119
Our goal

429
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,200
is to deal more than 50% damage to them.

430
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,881
They outnumber us 1 to 25.

431
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,480
With the strictest training
and the best equipment,

432
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,200
we will produce
the most extraordinary power.

433
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,640
If we can't win against their quantity
with our quality,

434
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,079
you can bang your head
into a wall and kill yourself!

435
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,480
If we lose in the drill,

436
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,480
you won't just bring shame to me,
you'll bring shame to the Cheetah!

437
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,240
Are you guys willing to face that?

438
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,600
No, sir!

439
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,720
Rumour has it that our opponents,
the Cheetah Commando,

440
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,360
overpowers the ordinary
by being extraordinary

441
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,400
and they emphasise
quality over quantity.

442
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:45,729
All of us are soldiers.

443
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,520
What gives them the right
to be extraordinary

444
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,800
while we're ordinary?

445
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
What gives them the right
to proclaim themselves as quality

446
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,200
over our quantity?

447
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,200
Do you guys

448
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:55,840
agree with that kind of saying?

449
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,439
No, sir!

450
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,679
I've read all of the battle requests
sent by each platoon!

451
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,119
All of you are extraordinary!

452
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,160
Our rapid deployment brigade,
which is a combined unit,

453
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:05,360
serves to

454
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,680
defend our country during wartime.

455
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,240
We are to stop the enemies
from invading our motherland!

456
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,065
Now, an elite unit,
the Cheetah Commando,

457
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,240
is trying to invade our country!

458
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,199
This is the time for us

459
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,920
to test the power of our combined unit!

460
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:25,479
We outnumber them 1 to 25!

461
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,000
If we can't wipe out the Red Team,

462
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,880
instead, if we suffer

463
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,800
50% damage from their assault,

464
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,520
that means we're still
the same disconnected unit!

465
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,199
That means we will fail
to defend our motherland!

466
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,360
Some of our comrades here

467
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,840
felt nervous when they heard
that our opponents

468
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,760
were elite snipers and combat experts.

469
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,120
In my opinion,

470
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,280
an elite sniper can be taken out

471
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
with a grenade.

472
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:55,200
If that doesn't work,
use another grenade!

473
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:56,400
Yes, sir!

474
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,000
Combat experts can be taken out

475
00:30:58,434 --> 00:31:00,560
with an infantry combat vehicle!

476
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,800
If that doesn't work,
use another vehicle!

477
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:03,848
Yes, sir!

478
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:05,598
Capture Three Shells Qin alive!

479
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,279
Turn the Cheetahs into kittens!

480
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,080
Capture Three Shells Qin alive!
Turn the Cheetahs into kittens!

481
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,961
There are only 32 of us

482
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:26,121
while there are 800 of them.

483
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,280
Once the drill starts,

484
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,599
we will be pursued by 800 enemies.

485
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,560
They've formed commando units

486
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:35,412
that can reach any point on
the battlefield through a chopper.

487
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,640
At the same time, they have air carriers

488
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,800
that can transport infantry
combat vehicles to the battlefield.

489
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,440
Although they cannot enter the jungle,

490
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,632
their firepower

491
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
is enough to cover any area
outside the jungle.

492
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
-Sir.
-Speak.

493
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,160
Are you saying

494
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,040
that we should prioritise on
getting rid of their air units first?

495
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,959
Figure it out yourself.

496
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,920
-Yan Po Yue.
-Yes, sir.

497
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,719
-How good are you with a grenade?
-Sir,

498
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,520
I've always been first in the platoon.

499
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:02,698
Yan,

500
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:05,825
can you bear to attack our old comrades

501
00:32:06,184 --> 00:32:07,264
if you encounter them later?

502
00:32:09,321 --> 00:32:10,321
If we can't do it,

503
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:13,922
our old comrades will despise us.

504
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,040
Jian,

505
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:21,560
do you think Yan Po Yue
has grown stronger?

506
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:25,288
Will we be able to
seek revenge against them?

507
00:32:27,937 --> 00:32:29,376
Didn't you hear the chief just now?

508
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:31,474
All elite soldiers

509
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,760
can be taken out with a grenade.

510
00:32:40,553 --> 00:32:41,473
Yan Po Yue,

511
00:32:42,473 --> 00:32:43,912
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

512
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:48,457
It's done!

513
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:51,263
My signature dish,
braised tofu, is ready!

514
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,440
Get me a bowl!

515
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,600
Lower your volume.

516
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,480
You'd better control your attitude.

517
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,440
Even if they're coming,

518
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,440
they're our enemies now.

519
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,160
Other people will beat you up
if you get too friendly with them.

520
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,320
They won't be able to tell.

521
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:06,680
I won the Oscar for my acting, you know?

522
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,479
I'm sure no one can tell.

523
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:10,359
But I did make some pork hocks
for them in secret.

524
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:11,984
I'm not betraying our regiment, right?

525
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,480
Are you out of your mind?

526
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,280
Why did you only make some of them?

527
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,440
You should make more.

528
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:21,880
I like that attitude.

529
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,479
You'd better hide it
from the detachment.

530
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,719
No problem.

531
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,760
It's done!

532
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,239
We will remove the weapons

533
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:32,280
of this armed helicopter

534
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,280
and transport medical equipment,
medical supplies, doctors, and nurses

535
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:36,841
to the helicopter.

536
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,720
We'll turn this helicopter

537
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,520
into an air ambulance
that's ready for action 24/7.

538
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,159
No matter how good Qin Feng's men are,

539
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,120
they will surely encounter
dangers in the wild.

540
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,640
If any one of them is
seriously injured or poisoned,

541
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,200
we have to rush to the scene
and rescue them at the first time.

542
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,119
We have to make sure the injured receive
their treatment in the shortest time.

543
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,880
That's a given.

544
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,720
Let's forget about the drill.
Even if this is a real battle,

545
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,199
if the enemy
is requesting help from us,

546
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,200
we should lend them a hand
on humanitarian grounds.

547
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:08,913
We should use the official channel

548
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,280
and send a message to
the Cheetah Commando's commander.

549
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,118
We'll tell them that we have prepared

550
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,840
an air ambulance in our base.

551
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,040
If any of his men are in danger,

552
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,999
they just need to fire two red flares
and one green flare.

553
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,703
The air ambulance
will reach the destination

554
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,423
within 15 minutes.

555
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:25,839
Chief,

556
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,018
as a staff officer,

557
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:32,916
I'm in charge of military propaganda
and psychological warfare.

558
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:35,721
Can I justify your action

559
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,839
as an attempt to achieve our goal

560
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:40,056
by putting on the disguise of morality?

561
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,210
Seems like our plot was too obvious.

562
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:51,994
He saw through our plot at first glance.

563
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,126
Tell me then.

564
00:34:55,775 --> 00:34:57,360
What do you think is my true motive?

565
00:34:59,248 --> 00:35:00,328
When we go up against special forces,

566
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:02,431
gathering intel and making decisions
are the most vital aspects.

567
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,399
If we can capture someone
from their squad,

568
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,800
we'll be able to get our hands
on the most direct intel.

569
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:09,217
Of course.

570
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,890
Since they're from the special forces,

571
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,008
it's especially difficult for us
to capture them.

572
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:16,009
But if one of their members

573
00:35:16,184 --> 00:35:17,424
is in danger,

574
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:19,663
and they have no choice
but to seek our assistance,

575
00:35:19,945 --> 00:35:22,080
they can make sure
their squad member can survive.

576
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,764
However, at the same time,

577
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,241
they'll send him to us,
together with the intel he carries.

578
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:32,816
Continue.

579
00:35:34,504 --> 00:35:37,304
Even if we cannot force him to speak,

580
00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:40,344
even if he doesn't want to give us
the intel of his team,

581
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:43,049
we can determine their whereabouts

582
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,623
by the soil on his shoes and the plants

583
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:47,304
he used for his camouflage.

584
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,439
Maybe we could locate their
temporary base camp with that.

585
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,640
If it's necessary,

586
00:35:52,346 --> 00:35:55,600
we can send him to
the military hospital.

587
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,000
After leaving the battlefield,

588
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,400
he will surely calm down.

589
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:03,719
By then, we can send someone
to tell him that the drill is over

590
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:05,088
and that he's a hero.

591
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,880
Someone from the military
will send someone to visit him.

592
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,454
We could even tell him that we were
going to make a film about him

593
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,041
and play it for
the whole military to see.

594
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:15,143
I believe

595
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,879
that when he's in front of the camera,

596
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
he will let down his guard.

597
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,481
This person, who doesn't know
that he's our prisoner of war,

598
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,160
will give us the intel we require

599
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,600
without any effort.

600
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,787
Not bad.

601
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:31,280
But it seems like
you've left out something.

602
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,320
After the Blue Team acquired
the necessary intel,

603
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,160
we would launch an attack
on the Cheetah Commando.

604
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,280
We would be lucky

605
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,160
if we could eliminate
all of them in one go.

606
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,880
If we just dealt serious damage to them,

607
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,600
at this time, as a staff officer,

608
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,640
you should come out
and spread your propaganda.

609
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,240
You'll tell them that
there's a traitor among them.

610
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,400
To those extremely prideful Cheetahs,

611
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,959
it's more devastating for them
to find out there's a traitor among them

612
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,929
than failing the mission.

613
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,640
Their morale, that was
already low enough,

614
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,280
would be reduced to nothing.

615
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,480
Understood.

616
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,040
Comrades of the Red Team!

617
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,960
You still have an hour left to spare!

618
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:42,845
You can have your meals
and check your equipment!

619
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,720
If any one of you is still here
after an hour,

620
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,480
we will capture you!

621
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,120
In three hours,

622
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,160
the Red vs. Blue drill

623
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,840
will officially begin!

624
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,081
Comrades of the Blue Team!
You guys cannot attack us

625
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,280
for three hours!

626
00:38:57,976 --> 00:38:59,440
But you guys can stand here,

627
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,545
construct your defences,

628
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,760
and wait for us to beat you up!

629
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,839
In three hours,

630
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,560
we will launch an official attack.

631
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:18,360
Capture Three Shells Qins alive!
Turn the Cheetahs into kittens!

632
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,120
They're here.

633
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,200
Hello. Please, over there.

634
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,281
Please sit at that table.

635
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,040
This table is occupied.

636
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,000
Sit there. You'll have
a better chance of winning.

637
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,560
That table.

638
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,320
You'll win if you sit here.
Come, sit down.

639
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,239
Sit here if you want to win. Come.

640
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,760
Come, have a seat.

641
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,239
-Come, sit down.
-Guo!

642
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,120
Guo!

643
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:40,360
I missed you two!

644
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,320
Seems like you've lost some weight.

645
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:42,923
But of course.

646
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,719
I'm on a diet. Sit down.

647
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,840
-Okay, Guo.
-Sit down.

648
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,360
Come on, eat up.

649
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,360
Don't waste the food.

650
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,560
How's the taste?

651
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,841
We can manage this ourselves. Thank you.

652
00:39:56,452 --> 00:39:57,619
Hello, comrades.

653
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,640
Let me serve you some dishes.
I'm Lu Xiao Tian.

654
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,081
Lu Xiao Tian?

655
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,000
So, you're Lu Xiao Tian?

656
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,320
Yeah, it's me. You two are...

657
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,280
We don't know you.

658
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,280
-You don't know me?
-It's pretty good.

659
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,424
You don't know me?

660
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,159
Say that again?

661
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,960
Keep quiet.

662
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,338
I'll serve you some dishes.

663
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,560
The winning dish of our detachment,

664
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,719
braised tofu.

665
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
So, who won?

666
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,920
It's a win-win situation.
Both sides won.

667
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,361
Come, try the tofu I made.

668
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,200
Eat up.

669
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,400
How did you guys arrange food
for 800 people?

670
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:35,720
How many people again?

671
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,241
Who made the pork hocks?

672
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,330
Of course it's me.

673
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,240
-It's not poisoned, isn't it?
-Take it or leave it.

674
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,360
Don't do that.

675
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,040
-It's pretty good.
-Where are the others?

676
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,400
Their mental strength is too weak.

677
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,479
They were afraid that they might cry
when they saw you two.

678
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,280
What?

679
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:52,514
Have you grown stronger?

680
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:53,745
I'm a man, you know?

681
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,520
I'll kill you.

682
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,080
Don't kill me. Eat up.

683
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,399
-I'll scare you.
-Where's Squad Leader?

684
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,639
Guo,

685
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,720
where's Squad Leader?

686
00:41:01,865 --> 00:41:03,345
Yeah, Guo. Where's Squad Leader?

687
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,105
-He's doing pretty good.
-That's right.

688
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,800
He told you two to do your best.

689
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,160
No matter who wins,

690
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,608
the kitchen squad is the best.

691
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:13,506
But of course.

692
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,440
We're the best.

693
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:20,280
Captain Qin is here
to tour around our base!

694
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,199
Stand up!

695
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,360
Sit down.

696
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:24,270
Sit!

697
00:41:31,568 --> 00:41:33,689
Commander Liu,

698
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:35,815
you did a pretty good job.

699
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:38,301
All of them are fired up.

700
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,017
Why aren't they doing anything?

701
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,600
You can't touch that.

702
00:41:56,768 --> 00:41:57,607
That is confidential.

703
00:42:01,113 --> 00:42:01,753
Not bad at all.

704
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:05,104
It's no wonder people are saying

705
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,520
that you've made the base famous.

706
00:42:09,379 --> 00:42:10,778
Do you know what they call you?

707
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:11,719
What?

708
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:13,159
They call you the Army Whetstone.

709
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,959
I'm a soldier.

710
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,720
I follow the organisation's arrangement.

711
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,719
It's the same no matter where I am.

712
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,200
No matter if I'm the knife or the
whetstone, I'm still as capable as ever.

713
00:42:19,258 --> 00:42:20,817
We're newly formed.
We're unafraid of defeats.

714
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,999
But it's different for you guys.

715
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,600
You lead the Cheetah Commando,
the squad that's praised to the sky.

716
00:42:24,695 --> 00:42:26,536
It would've been embarrassing
if you suffered a defeat.

717
00:42:27,242 --> 00:42:30,561
Don't blame us
for being too harsh on you by then.

718
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,240
Liu,

719
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:34,080
I guess you're the only person
who can say such high-sounding words

720
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,360
while keeping a straight face.

721
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:39,015
The Cheetah Commando
is always known as the Knife.

722
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,719
We can learn a lot of things
from each other through this drill.
