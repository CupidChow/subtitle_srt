1
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,136
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:31,040
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,560
(Episode 44)

4
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
Also, Team R has used anaesthetics

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,480
on the injured passengers.

6
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,120
This is extremely dangerous

7
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,239
because they didn't verify their
identity and their medical condition.

8
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,440
This could have caused harm and
also could have threatened their life.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,880
So, we cannot agree
with this kind of method.

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
You know, if the terrorists
are not eliminated quickly,

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,680
the hostages will be at risk.

12
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,720
The hostages just have broken arms.

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,520
What's more important than his life?

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,120
Are these brutal tactics

15
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,839
the reflection
of the true meaning of modern warfare?

16
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:13,560
Anyway, we finished our mission

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,721
and no hostages died.

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Right?

19
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,086
Country R

20
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,920
stands out in term of their judgment.

21
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,080
When they were searching
for the terrorists in disguise,

22
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,600
they were quick and decisive.

23
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
That means

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,721
they have a very keen sense of battle.

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,600
Next team, Team A.

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,361
Stay still.

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
Don't move.

28
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
Why aren't they coming in?
Something is wrong.

29
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:01,827
They must be on the way.

30
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,800
Okay.

31
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,841
This country is very
advanced in technology.

32
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,480
Their military strategy
is straightforward.

33
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,480
The winner is known
before the battle is over.

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,240
When it comes to military affairs,

35
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,960
make sure you never
fight an uncertain battle.

36
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,601
But each battle

37
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,999
comes with uncertainties.

38
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,961
The variables are unpredictable.

39
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,440
Move!

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,120
Cut the communication in the cabin.

41
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
All units ready.

42
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

43
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,120
Put your hands on your head! Don't move!

44
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,240
Get back! I say, get back!

45
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,360
Get back!

46
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,839
Get back!

47
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,119
Sniper, you can fire.

48
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
I declare

49
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,920
that Team A has completed their mission

50
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,520
in 10 minutes and 54 seconds.

51
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,360
All four terrorists were killed.

52
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,079
However, there was
one casualty among the hostages

53
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,652
and one casualty among the team members.

54
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,560
Wait, we didn't have any casualty.

55
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,880
How can you determine
there is one casualty?

56
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,960
There was one soldier you have seen.

57
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,600
He was controlled by
the terrorist during a certain time.

58
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,440
He died of asphyxiation.

59
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,520
I understand that this is a game

60
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:33,760
and the soldiers
didn't put their full strength.

61
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
The set-up of each team
of drills is different.

62
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,320
The designer put in a lot
of effort in designing the game.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,800
Be quiet!

64
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,080
The next team,

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,840
Cheetah Commando from China.

66
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,200
Chinese special forces have appeared

67
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:53,480
in various international competition
in recent years

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,599
and achieved good results.

69
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,080
So, we're looking forward
to your performance this time.

70
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,960
Your head, put down!

71
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,441
I know what you are going to do!

72
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
I know you can hear me!

73
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,039
There's a bomb tied
around each hostage's neck.

74
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,680
The same bomb attached
to both side hatches.

75
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,480
Any form of intrusion
will detonate the bombs.

76
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,120
You'd better verify it
with your equipment now.

77
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,040
Captain.

78
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
What should we do?

79
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
Cancel our original plan.

80
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,680
We can't carry out regular
invasion in this case.

81
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,920
(Group B snipers, stand by.)

82
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,600
We'll try to negotiate
with the terrorists.

83
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,000
We need to gain their trust
in the shortest period of time

84
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
through negotiation.

85
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,880
Women are better suited to
carry out negotiations than men in.

86
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,159
(However, the negotiation
has to be done in English.)

87
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,200
Guo Xiao Xiao.

88
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,959
Can you do it?

89
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,500
I'll give it a try.

90
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:42,120
Captain.

91
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:44,018
I'll try to find out the frequency
of the remote-controlled bombs

92
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,440
and cut off the signal soonest possible.

93
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,720
Buy more time
as I need as much time as possible.

94
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,041
Approved.

95
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:03,038
No.

96
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,159
He's the CEO of the Fila Company.

97
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,567
He's taking this flight
to have heart surgery

98
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
but the time of surgery is delayed.

99
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,960
(He might die at anytime.)

100
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,361
Are you okay?

101
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,360
From what I heard,

102
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,720
a hostage
is having an acute heart attack.

103
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,480
He's the CEO of Fila Company.

104
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,960
You have to find a way
to get into the cabin.

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,160
When you're in there,

106
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,480
try to open the hatch.

107
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,680
We'll take care of the rest.

108
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,400
Xiao Xiao,

109
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,720
you should bring a gun with you.

110
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,321
No need.

111
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:50,640
It will be more dangerous
if I carry a gun.

112
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,400
Xiao Xiao.

113
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,000
All our plans have gone in vein.

114
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,960
You have to play by ears.

115
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,720
Got it.

116
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,600
Let me talk to them.

117
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,840
Got it.

118
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,760
Please don't shoot.

119
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,617
I'm a negotiator.

120
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,160
I just want to talk.

121
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,321
No weapons.

122
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,320
See?

123
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,360
No weapons.

124
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,200
How long is your flight?

125
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,680
Is there any food on the plane?

126
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,200
What are your demands?

127
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,160
Please let me know.

128
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,695
Don't listen to her.

129
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,360
We're all great warriors.

130
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,760
We're fighting for a sacred goal.

131
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,760
Is it all right?

132
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,560
Be more aggressive!

133
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,119
Xiao Xiao.

134
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,680
(They have been moved.)

135
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,200
At this point, we can confirm

136
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,920
there are at least
three terrorists in the cabin.

137
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,280
Keep going.

138
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,640
I just got a message.

139
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
One of your hostages

140
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,600
is an old man who is the CEO
of the multinational Fila Company.

141
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,680
He took this flight to get heart surgery

142
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,400
but the surgery
has already been delayed.

143
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,040
He could have died at any moment.

144
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,519
I'm begging you. Let me replace him

145
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,120
as your hostage.

146
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,040
If something happened to this man,

147
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
this wouldn't help you.

148
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,208
But if you let him go,

149
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,360
he could use his influence

150
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,760
to communicate your demands
to the other side of the war.

151
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,960
To be honest,

152
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,560
as a hostage,

153
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm your best choice.

154
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,280
You control me.

155
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,480
It means you can control my whole team.

156
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
Think about it.

157
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,040
Are you afraid of a girl like me?

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,080
Go!

159
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,960
Easy.

160
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,440
Come down, guys.

161
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
Come down.

162
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,039
Come inside.

163
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,760
Yes.

164
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,280
Faster!

165
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,559
Yeah, okay.

166
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:50,159
Okay.

167
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,200
Relax, man.

168
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,839
I have nothing.

169
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,880
Don't say nothing! Let's go!

170
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,720
Okay.

171
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,319
Go!

172
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,040
Open the door!

173
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,000
(The remote-controlled bombs
are defused.)

174
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,440
Don't move!

175
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,640
Get back!

176
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:13,520
Drop your weapons!

177
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:14,304
Get back!

178
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,400
Drop your weapons!

179
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,200
Don't move!

180
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
The cabin is safe.

181
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,800
Beware.

182
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,000
Our enemies may be
hiding among the hostages.

183
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,520
You! Raise your hands!

184
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,160
Don't move! Raise your hand!

185
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,039
Mao Lang.

186
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,040
Not bad.

187
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,719
Mission accomplished.

188
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,159
China finished the mission

189
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
in 8 minutes and 15 seconds in total.

190
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Four terrorists were killed.

191
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,879
Two were captured alive.

192
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
No hostages

193
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,560
and no members were scratched or hurt.

194
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,400
Thank you.

195
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,479
The next team,

196
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,560
B Cobra.

197
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,360
Don't drink in a rush.

198
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,120
We need to take oral rehydration salts
besides water.

199
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,760
Let me do it.

200
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,519
You deserve all the credit.

201
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,793
The credit goes to everyone.

202
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,400
You're such a gentleman.

203
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,519
Drink up, Yan.

204
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,119
Don't be so tensed up.

205
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,880
We've accomplished the mission.

206
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,159
Don't you think that plane

207
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,840
was a little too clean?

208
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,840
It's indeed quite clean.

209
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
The cabin is huge.

210
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,120
I guess it's to facilitate
the mission. Am I right?

211
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Don't think too much.

212
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,519
Pei.

213
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,400
Jason!

214
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,880
How is it going? Long time no see.

215
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,200
I can't believe
we have become rivals already.

216
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,480
I miss working with you, my man.

217
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,320
You know, rivals and teammates can be
switched with each other at any time.

218
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,880
So, we're still good pals, right?

219
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,560
Let's go, buddies.

220
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,600
Hey, Jason!

221
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,879
Take care of yourself, okay?

222
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,399
Sure, good luck to you and your team!

223
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,920
Same to you!

224
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,081
Is he your friend?

225
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,878
It's the captain of Team A.

226
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,400
His name is Jason.

227
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,120
I met him at the hunter school.

228
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
Don't be deceived by his innocent face.

229
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,841
He's very aggressive in nature.

230
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,240
Worse, he's narrow-minded.

231
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,720
The prey whom he sets his eyes on
usually can't escape.

232
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,360
Our instructor at the hunter school
once commented

233
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,800
that if he's not in the special forces,

234
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,601
he would be a terrorist
who is a pain in the neck.

235
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,919
It seems

236
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,480
that he has set his eyes on us.

237
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,060
It's a good thing that he's after us.

238
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,000
It means our scores
are ahead of Team A at the moment.

239
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,680
The last team,

240
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,600
Ninth Commando of Country C
has completed the test.

241
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,640
It took 11 minutes and 40 seconds.

242
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,121
Five terrorists were killed.

243
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,160
Two hostages were hurt.

244
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,720
No team members were killed.

245
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:18,320
Everyone,

246
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,319
the hijacking mission is not over.

247
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,520
I should say, in fact,
it's just starting.

248
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,200
To all warriors,

249
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:34,320
congratulations on your completion
of the first stage of the competition.

250
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,000
Perhaps you don't know
the second stage already has started

251
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,120
when you attacked the cabin.

252
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,468
Please act according to the information

253
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,920
gathered in the first stage
of the operation.

254
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,063
Collect the information provided
by the organiser, select and deduce

255
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:56,960
the terrorists' real purpose,
intention and possible trick actions.

256
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,618
Please note that

257
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,160
we need the answers
when we have the meeting in one hour.

258
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,759
The computers and the materials

259
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,080
are prepared
in the rest area of each team.

260
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,360
We'll give you the final score
based on your operation.

261
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,880
Wish you good luck.

262
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,680
It's started.

263
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,760
Come on.

264
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,680
Thank you.

265
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,920
Is this an additional question?

266
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
Isn't it better if they put everything
in the same document?

267
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,799
They combine all the information

268
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,521
of different points of view in different
languages together on purpose.

269
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,320
They're testing
our ability in analysing information

270
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,642
and our ability to handle
a matter in a timely manner

271
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,280
to see who can find out
the most valuable information

272
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,839
in the shortest period of time.

273
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,920
Send it to them later.

274
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,080
Children.

275
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,520
Your life has entered in a countdown.

276
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,440
Let's see who is smarter.

277
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,840
The data is in a mess.

278
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,800
Tidy it up.

279
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,840
Mao Lang.

280
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,880
What about this?

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,520
Combine the images
captured by the military satellites

282
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,120
and the high definition photographs
taken with drones.

283
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,800
Then, build a new image network.

284
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,960
We're overwhelmed with information.

285
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,359
I need at least 20 minutes.

286
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,120
Be faster.

287
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,040
You only have 15 minutes.

288
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,160
Why did they choose

289
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,240
an obsolete An-26 passenger aircraft?

290
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,959
Anti-hijacking drills
are usually conducted

291
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,719
on aircraft models close
to the common ones.

292
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,201
This is an international competition

293
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,760
and they chose to use an
obsolete An-26 passenger aircraft.

294
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,320
Don't you think it's strange?

295
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,960
It's so strange.

296
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,400
The newspaper were from years ago.

297
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
It's useless.

298
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,339
Captain.

299
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,881
Take a look at the rearranged data.

300
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,759
Here.

301
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,839
Country W transferred dirty bombs
to Country R from 1992 to 1997.

302
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,800
Based on reliable source,

303
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
five dirty bombs
went missing mysteriously.

304
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,520
Bomb experts were of the view

305
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
that those dirty bombs

306
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,120
were most likely sold
by international arms dealers

307
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,440
to others.

308
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,920
What does it have to do with the drill?

309
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Perhaps the drill is just a show.

310
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,600
In this anti-hijacking drill,

311
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,520
the terrorists didn't make any demands.

312
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,040
Moreover, the organizing committee

313
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,040
takes the time spent
and the number of terrorist killed

314
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,600
as the performance indicators.

315
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,560
As such, we didn't have time

316
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,560
to conduct a thorough search
in the cabin.

317
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,680
If I'm not mistaken,

318
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,640
the terrorist hijacking

319
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,720
could be an exercise
in smoke and mirrors.

320
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,200
What are they trying to hide?

321
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,160
The terrorists hijacked
this obsolete aircraft

322
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,681
to reach the competition venue.

323
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,479
After we have completed
the anti-hijacking drill,

324
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
the security guards
would clean up the cabin.

325
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,120
The terrorists then blended in
with the security guards

326
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,080
to get the missing
dirty bomb out of the cabin.

327
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,520
One hour later,

328
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,481
when all the leaders and captains
of different countries

329
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,240
are having review meeting,

330
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
they'll detonate the bomb.

331
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,601
Good job in making up the story.

332
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,879
But it's just your assumption.

333
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,720
At the moment, our priority is making
deduction based on the information.

334
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,839
We can't stop making progress

335
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,359
merely because of your assumption.

336
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,680
But you're the vice leader.

337
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,600
You have the right to command the team.

338
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,520
Our target is huge.

339
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,600
We'll split up

340
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,000
and scout around
in four different directions.

341
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,520
If you see anything suspicious,

342
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,280
contact me immediately.

343
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:06,959
Sure.

344
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,800
Move!

345
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,320
Attention, Team Cheetah.

346
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,319
(Attention, Team Cheetah.)

347
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,199
(I discovered a dirty bomb
at Zone B in the rest area.)

348
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,599
(The coordination is B07.)

349
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,040
(It's going to go off in 9 minutes
and 15 seconds!)

350
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,199
(The explosion range is unknown.)

351
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,640
(Please gather bomb disposal experts
as soon as possible.)

352
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,559
(At the same time,
evacuate everyone in the camp!)

353
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,760
There's a bomb!

354
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,120
Buddy!

355
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:10,800
There's a bomb!

356
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,000
There's a bomb in the camp! Run!

357
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,439
Move!

358
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,599
Buddy, we found a bomb
and it's going off soon!

359
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,520
Move!

360
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,040
The Chinese Army reported

361
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,080
that a dirty bomb
has been found in the rest area.

362
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,280
Please evacuate all participants

363
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,880
to a safe area immediately.

364
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,159
Is the information verified?

365
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,881
It's still being verified.

366
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,758
Let's go!

367
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,640
There is a dirty bomb in camp!

368
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,520
It's going to go off in eight minutes!

369
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,165
Let's go!

370
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,760
-Don't move!
-Stop!

371
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
There's a bomb!

372
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,600
It's going to go off

373
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,640
in eight minutes! Get out!

374
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:03,659
Move!

375
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,520
Yan Po Yue!

376
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,959
Is the information verified?

377
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,361
It's only a race.

378
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,760
What are you going to do?

379
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,880
It's a war.

380
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,959
War?

381
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,040
Get out!

382
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
For everyone's safety,

383
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,400
sorry.

384
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,841
Tell everyone to get out, now!

385
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,280
Let's go!

386
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,960
Everyone,

387
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,119
evacuate immediately!

388
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,520
Let's go! Quick!

389
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,400
Move! Hurry up!

390
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,320
Let's go!

391
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,480
Go!

392
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,600
Yan, I know that you'll be back!

393
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,240
Why didn't you go inside?

394
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,680
I can't intercept.

395
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,543
We're running out of time.
What are they arguing about?

396
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:12,680
They're still arguing.

397
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,000
Sergei recognised

398
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,439
that the dirty bomb was the device

399
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,518
removed from the nuclear power plant
in their country.

400
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,439
Jason recognised

401
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,118
that the detonator belongs
to their country.

402
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,760
We don't know where to start
as they're still arguing.

403
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,920
What do you think?

404
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,800
It's a quick detonator.

405
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
A pressure calibrator is attached
to the detonator serving as a trigger.

406
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,881
The only way is to remove the trigger.

407
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:29,920
However, once the trigger is removed,

408
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,040
the pressure will be released

409
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,440
and the bomb will explode immediately.

410
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:34,720
It doesn't matter if we start
from the bomb or the trigger.

411
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,720
Either way, it'll explode!

412
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,520
There's no time. What are you doing?

413
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,839
No.

414
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,280
Jason, listen to me.

415
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,359
Calm down, okay?

416
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,280
We only have one minute to go.

417
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,200
No matter how far we go on,

418
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,640
we can never escape
the scope of the dirty bomb.

419
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,521
I would rather take a chance

420
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,280
and then try to
short-circuit the detonator

421
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,599
without removing it.

422
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,479
Maybe, I just mean maybe,
we can stop the detonation, okay?

423
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,240
We can't do it
without removing the detonator.

424
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,600
What the hell are you doing?

425
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,760
The detonator has been destroyed.

426
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,920
Chinese Cheetah Commando
destroyed the detonator

427
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,281
of the dirty bomb at the last minute.

428
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,920
Okay.

429
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,521
Tell all the personnel
to go back to the camp now.

430
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,640
We'll announce the match result.

431
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:40,599
Chinese team
passed first stage full marks.

432
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,240
Yes, sir.

433
00:29:52,846 --> 00:29:53,387
Sir.

434
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,360
Our soldier, Yan Po Yue,

435
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,279
has been disrespectful

436
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,400
for hitting the head of you.

437
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,681
I'm so sorry.

438
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,081
I know you Chinese

439
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,881
emphasise that
making no fault is a merit.

440
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:10,032
So, when you Chinese encounter danger,

441
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,280
obviously everyone knows what to do

442
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,080
but no one is willing to step out first.

443
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,065
I just know

444
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:22,680
why they look up on all the Chinese
people and the Chinese soldiers.

445
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,200
Your subordinates

446
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,080
not only have excellent mind
but also keen intuition.

447
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,840
This lad of surprising sense

448
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,840
and sense of responsibility
are called forbearance.

449
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,732
But as shown through the time,

450
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:41,439
he has the determination
and responsibility

451
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,920
that a commander must have.

452
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,279
He's very good.

453
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,000
Young man,

454
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,279
you have the true will
of a true soldier.

455
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,640
Every Chinese soldier is great.

456
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,600
We were on on pins and needles.

457
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,440
Country A and Country R
were completely stunned.

458
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,599
All of them ran away.

459
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,880
How did you get the idea
which wire to cut off?

460
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:02,880
Look at me.

461
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,199
Of course I know.

462
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,641
How could you tell that?

463
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:06,640
It's based on my experience.

464
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:07,959
You won't understand
even if I explain to you.

465
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,720
It's based on my experience.

466
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:10,680
Sergei!

467
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,640
-Buddy.
-Buddy.

468
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:14,800
Let's drink.

469
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,520
Wait a moment.

470
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,959
Let me take a look.

471
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
Do you have a bug on you?

472
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,040
What bug?

473
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,359
Okay.

474
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:24,040
Let's drink.

475
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,479
Okay. Is this Vodka?

476
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,319
Yes, Vodka.

477
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,181
Thank you for your kindness.

478
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,840
Forget about drinking.
It's not allowed here.

479
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:34,040
What a pity.

480
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
This is the best Vodka I have.

481
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,640
I heard that you're
the Captain of Cheetah Commando.

482
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,360
Yes.

483
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,120
I know what is coming up
in the next assessment.

484
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,160
I hope we can work hand in hand
to bring Country A down.

485
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,520
What did he say?

486
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,680
Let's work hand in hand
to bring Country A down.

487
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,879
He said

488
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,640
he knows what is coming up
in the next round.

489
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,360
He hopes we can work hand in hand
to bring Country A down.

490
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,240
Don't trust him.

491
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,759
Sergei, my friend!

492
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,479
What do you know? Tell me.

493
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,920
Tell me everything, okay?

494
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,680
Let's work together.

495
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,680
Sergei, we'll think about it.

496
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,601
Sure, but we don't have much time left.

497
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,881
He said we can consider about it

498
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,801
but we don't have much time left.

499
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,080
Or else,
he will work with another country.

500
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,601
Isn't this just a competition?

501
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,600
Why do they make it so complicated?

502
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,600
What should we do now?

503
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,440
We should do our part.

504
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,840
Do our part.

505
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,641
The last stage of the competition

506
00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:04,680
has started 30 minutes ago.

507
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,000
If you look at your computers,

508
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,879
you'll see some intelligent information.

509
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,840
If you're a skilled commander,

510
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,880
you'll know how to use

511
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,111
those 30 minutes
of valuable planning time.

512
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,200
International terrorism
is now more allied

513
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:26,280
and diversified.

514
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,640
Consequently, governments have to lead

515
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,640
joint military operations.

516
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,520
We have to unite the nations
against the enemies.

517
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,120
They should not have anywhere to hide.

518
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,159
And you,

519
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,491
the senior commanders of the
special forces of different nations,

520
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,840
you'll have to
make the planning together

521
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,280
and you'll have
to coordinate the cooperation

522
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,760
of various forces
with different backgrounds.

523
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,200
So, the organisation committee
will score you on that.

524
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,000
So, here, the game begins.

525
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,602
The dirty bomb in the union camp

526
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,080
has been dismantled.

527
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,288
But the man behind it, S,

528
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,040
has not been captured.

529
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,600
(According to the informant
of Country A,)

530
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,240
(S is hiding at Point X
in the inland region,)

531
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,080
(a village with civilians)

532
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,919
(but has been controlled by terrorists.)

533
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,600
(The goal of our operation
is to capture S,)

534
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,560
(the leader of
the terrorist organisation.)

535
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,902
(The scores are based on each country's
contribution and performance)

536
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,320
(in this exercise.)

537
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,680
Before beginning the assault,

538
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,720
we must have a few snipers
on defence

539
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,999
to scout here on the fort.

540
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,679
We must watch the river
so we don't get fired...

541
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,439
Wait.

542
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,639
Wait.

543
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,800
You have just messed up
the plan immediately now.

544
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,178
If you don't do this,

545
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,479
we'll fail.

546
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,799
Sir.

547
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,680
What you're arguing
about is meaningless.

548
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,920
For joint military operation,

549
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,080
commander-in-chief must be determined

550
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,959
and the commands must be unified.

551
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,473
The purpose of joint operation

552
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,830
is to put everyone's advantages

553
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,160
into full play.

554
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,880
There are some undetermined
parameters.

555
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,759
My opinion is that

556
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,360
each team sends two members

557
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:26,920
to form an investigation team

558
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,120
and then to investigate
the targeted village.

559
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,720
(Country A will provide
the reconnaissance equipment.)

560
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,964
(We provide communication satellite.)

561
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:39,165
(Country R provides vehicles.)

562
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,760
(The investigation team
with six members)

563
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,400
(will contact the informant)

564
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,760
(and report after confirming
the current location of Target S.)

565
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,999
(Then, three countries
will form Quick Response Force)

566
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,880
(and head towards Point X by helicopter
to provide airborne support.)

567
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,040
(Members remain
will form a ground reception unit)

568
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,840
(and support the investigation team.)

569
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,528
On the position.

570
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,960
Special Task Force reached Point A.

571
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:33,080
Over.

572
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,760
Copy that. Over.

573
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,880
I guess the smoking area
is where their cafeteria lies.

574
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,200
5, 6,

575
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,640
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

576
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,840
13, 14, 15, 16...

577
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Guys, let's switch.

578
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,680
You have got five minutes to eat.

579
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,360
Copy.

580
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:16,760
Roger that
and sixteen enemies have been found.

581
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,519
Copy that.

582
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,400
Okay.

583
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,879
Vodka is the best food.

584
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,481
Would you like some?

585
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,280
No, thank you.

586
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,480
You?

587
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:55,919
Command centre, this is Team A speaking.

588
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:56,719
Do you read me?

589
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,560
Roger.

590
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,479
Task Force
has reached the observation position.

591
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,560
We have got eyes on 16 hostiles.

592
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,320
No target detected yet.

593
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,879
Over.

594
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:06,840
Watch out for the bobcats. Roger.

595
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:08,360
Take cover and keep in touch.

596
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,761
Can you contact the informant again?

597
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,879
We can only wait
for the information from the informant.

598
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,639
The contact will put him in danger.

599
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,360
Terrorists?

600
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,520
Then, why the guns?

601
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,960
Why do you bring guns?

602
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,640
Hold on, Jason.

603
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,359
Why do you bring guns?

604
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,320
The grass is not enough.

605
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,920
We had to travel
to a far place every day.

606
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,600
There are wolves. It's dangerous.

607
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,520
Okay.

608
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,879
He said, they're just shepherds and

609
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,360
they have to prevent
the wolves with the gun.

610
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,159
It's like Operation Red Wings.

611
00:39:59,239 --> 00:39:59,919
Yes.

612
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The guy who designs the problem
is really giving us a hard time.

613
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,560
This is just an exercise.

614
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:06,805
We don't have the same pressure.

615
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,521
Yes, but the choice is the same.

616
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,080
What do we do to them three?

617
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,399
Tie them up

618
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,760
and move them to a hidden place.

619
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,000
They live in the village in front of us.

620
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,599
So, I think maybe somebody
is going to find them

621
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,682
if they don't come back on time.

622
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,040
So, your idea is to let them go?

623
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,241
No way.

624
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,480
If we let them go,

625
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,360
we'll end up like Operation Red Wings.

626
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,720
If we're back to the scene
where we first met,

627
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,560
what if you
encounter suspicious individuals

628
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,280
when you're carrying out your duty?

629
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,919
Taking them along
will hinder your mission.

630
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,720
But if you release them,

631
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,720
they may expose you.

632
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,440
If you keep them at the spot,

633
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,640
you may put their life in danger.

634
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,640
If you kill them on the spot,

635
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,240
it's too cruel.

636
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:53,679
Think about it.

637
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,640
If you're given another chance,

638
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,960
what would you do?

639
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,960
Where did the organising committee
find these shepherds?

640
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,320
Their acting is so good.

641
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,880
Do you understand the scene?

642
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,440
It's Operation Red Wings.

643
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,640
This operation

644
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,560
is the key emphasis
in the special forces course

645
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,960
of different countries.

646
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,160
I believe

647
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,040
they know what to do.

648
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,040
Target S's location
has not been confirmed yet.

649
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,269
We need to contact
the informant at this specified time

650
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,993
and we're running out of time.

651
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,401
Gentlemen,

652
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,120
shall we vote
on whether they live or die?

653
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,559
There's a way.

654
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,000
We'll wear their clothing,
hide in the village

655
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,960
and become them.

656
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,839
Anybody has other way

657
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,280
to keep humanity

658
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,520
and make the mission complete?

659
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,360
Okay.

660
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,131
Just let me do this.

661
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,001
No way.

662
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,080
Three of you should stay here

663
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,600
to command the operation.

664
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,799
Three captains,

665
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:04,719
stay here.

666
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,600
If anything happens,
all of you can have a chance.

667
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,880
Copy that.

668
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,759
Agree.
