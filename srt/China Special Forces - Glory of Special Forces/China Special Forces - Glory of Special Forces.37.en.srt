00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,160
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,953
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,560
(Episode 37)

4
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:38,600
Eat something now.

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,520
Get some sleep.

6
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Tasks assignment at 4am,
departure at 5am.

7
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,440
Hurry up, eat now.

9
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,320
Yan Po Yue.

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,478
A lot of mosquitoes in the mountains.
Spray it.

11
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,279
Thanks.

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,520
I heard a lot about you
when I just joined Cheetah.

13
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,441
-You're an ace.
-I'm flattered.

14
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:00,812
-But I'm not that good.
-Since you're so strong,

15
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,800
how did you end up in

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
the armoury?

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,321
We train every day to win,

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,160
but being strong and winning

19
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,000
are two different things.

20
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,040
Thanks.

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
I'll take you to the amusement park
after I finish my work later.

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,920
Okay, Daddy.

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
Let's fasten this before we go out.

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,080
Come on.

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,000
We're going to take a stroll. Get
the car to the entrance of the village.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,920
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:34,640
Give these red envelopes

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,680
to the villagers later.

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
Come on.

30
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
-Wan Zi.
-Shu Hai.

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
Do you have a dream?

32
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,440
Shu Hai, my dream is to work for you.

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,159
Do you know what my dream is?

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,840
Be like Kun Sheng?

35
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,361
That old fart

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,560
made lots of money, but he died
before he could spend them.

37
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
Even my life is so much
comfortable than his.

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
That's true.

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,960
Don't move.

40
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Come here.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
Block the road, block the road.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,240
Block the heaven and the earth.

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,880
Block ghosts and human.

44
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,440
Block the road and disaster falls.

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Move away and blessing comes.

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,560
What does that mean?

47
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Snake in the way.

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,600
That means it's unsafe

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,720
to leave the house today.

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,320
We're going back.

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,560
Did you eat?

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,120
Yes.

53
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,279
What about you?

54
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,079
Me?

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
I spent the night in the mountains.

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
I've had wind for dinner.

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,160
I'm full now.

58
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,160
You've scouted so many times.

59
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
There is no way you came alone.

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Come on.

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,560
Call your brothers out.

62
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,280
Let's talk together.

63
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,039
It's just me.

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,280
Allow me to introduce myself.

65
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm Yan Po Yue.

66
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,080
Yan as in the prodigal Yan Qing.

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,800
Po means destroyer.

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,320
Yue as in Yue Fei.

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,160
Just call me Yan.

70
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,079
That would be rude.

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,720
I have to call you Boss Yan.

72
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,600
This little girl

73
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,680
isn't your daughter, is she?

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
What do you think?

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
It hurts, Daddy.

76
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,679
Shut the hell up!

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Okay.

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
Now I'm sure you're not related.

79
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,880
Come.

80
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,200
You can have this teddy bear.

81
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,480
Do you like it?

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,575
Go away. As long as we're here,

83
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,961
we won't let you take Hai away.

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,120
Guys,

85
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,200
you didn't use a cute little girl

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,040
as a shield like Shu Hai.

87
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,880
The crimes you've committed,

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,881
even if you are arrested,

89
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,600
you won't be sentenced to death.

90
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,240
Guys,

91
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,040
we do not wish to
escalate the situation.

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,280
Please leave now.

93
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,280
Let me and Mr. Shu Hai

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,440
settle this ourselves.

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,039
The choice is yours.

96
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,600
Don't blame them.

97
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,320
Even ants cherish their lives,

98
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,880
let alone people.

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,841
What's more,

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,760
you can't take your money

101
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,640
with you when you die.

102
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,880
Asking them to

103
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,000
put their lives at risk for money.

104
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Who would want that?

105
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,080
I get it.

106
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,720
I don't blame them. I've been
dealing drugs for over ten years

107
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
and hiding for over ten years,

108
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,601
yet you still caught me.

109
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
I accept my fate.

110
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,000
I won't hide anymore.

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm getting tired too.

112
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,441
But

113
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,319
I don't want to die.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Everyone wants to live, right?

115
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,160
What do you think,

116
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,200
Yan Po Yue?

117
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,040
You know what this is, right?

118
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:00,862
Wei Wei,

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,440
open your bag for Brother Yan.

120
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,080
You recognize this too, right?

121
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,680
Let me go,

122
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,680
and I'll leave her here.

123
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
You're just here to counter
drug trafficking, right?

124
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I'll give you my word.
I'll never touch drug again

125
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
after I get out of this village.

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,520
It's a happy ending for everyone.
Mission complete for you.

127
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,400
What do you say?

128
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,200
Our mission isn't
countering drug trafficking,

129
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,880
it's you.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,400
Either we capture you,

131
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,800
or we'll shoot to kill.

132
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,880
Other than that,

133
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
there is no other option.

134
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,320
Are you hard-headed?

135
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,000
How much money can you make
working for the government?

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,760
Let me tell you, after dealing drugs
for so many years,

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,440
I've made so much money.

138
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,360
I have a habit.

139
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
When I have money,

140
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,320
I buy gold.

141
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,919
I've bought lots of gold with my money.

142
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,400
I have over 200kg of gold in my house.

143
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,240
Let me go, and they are all yours.

144
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,280
200kg of gold?

145
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,800
How many people have you harmed
to make that much money?

146
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,760
Stay back.

147
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,840
You think I won't press it?

148
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,320
If the government catch me,
I'll die by execution.

149
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,921
If I press it, I'll still die.

150
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,560
Want to try it together?

151
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,440
My job

152
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,560
is to face death.

153
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,439
Your Brother Yan
here isn't afraid of dying.

154
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,799
Are you scared of dying?

155
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:38,118
Tell him, are you?

156
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Tell him!

157
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,200
Go on.

158
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,719
What?

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
Since the bomb can't scare me,

160
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,480
so you can only take it out
on little girl, can't you?

161
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,920
You're a smart man.

162
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,320
Do you think I would bring a teddy bear

163
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,560
out on a mission for no reason?

164
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,800
What are you trying to say?

165
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,720
The remote control you are holding

166
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,000
is the most common type in the market.

167
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,520
It adopts 315MHz RF module.

168
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
Its communication technique
is amplitude modulation.

169
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,080
Its utility frequency are 355MHz

170
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,559
and 433MHz.

171
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Current emission is 2mA to 10mA.

172
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,280
You wouldn't get it.

173
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,840
You know car remote
control jammer, right?

174
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,120
The blocker hid inside this teddy bear
has the same function.

175
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,560
Therefore,

176
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
your remote control

177
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,679
is useless now.

178
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,840
Let me show you.

179
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,880
Your name is Wei Wei?

180
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,600
Let me take you home to your mum, okay?

181
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,601
Okay.

182
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,160
Believe it or not,
you can't get out of here.

183
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,360
I had fun talking to you.

184
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,320
Now shut up.

185
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,560
Let's go.

186
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Folks,

187
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,320
please make way.

188
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,799
Leave Hai here.

189
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,600
You can leave.

190
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Are you

191
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,720
village chief?

192
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,159
Patriarch?

193
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
You can say that.

194
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,799
I know you work for the government.

195
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,599
It's your job to catch criminal.

196
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,320
But I watched Hai grow up.

197
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,559
I can't just stand by and let you
take him to the guillotine.

198
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,599
Leave him here,

199
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,680
you leave alone.

200
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,321
I assure you, no one will stop you.

201
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:10,687
Impossible.

202
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,081
Over our dead bodies then!

203
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
Yes, yes.

204
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,080
Don't you dare!

205
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,960
Do you have a conscience?

206
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,400
Can you distinguish good from evil?

207
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,720
I know this place is poor.

208
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,560
The crops aren't growing.

209
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,480
Even most of your roads are damaged.

210
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
You want to make money

211
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,600
and let your family live a good life,
that's not wrong.

212
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,760
But being poor

213
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,200
doesn't mean you can
make and sell drugs.

214
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,440
Being poor

215
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,480
doesn't justify tearing apart and

216
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,960
ruining other people's families.

217
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,278
Keep still!

218
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,135
You all have hands and feet.

219
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,039
You have a head.

220
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,799
Whether it is working in the city,

221
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,229
or farming at home,

222
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,679
you can make a living.

223
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Your neighbouring villages

224
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,440
are developing little by little.

225
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,760
Except for your Shu Village.

226
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,159
Because of this rotten apple,

227
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:17,838
the young men here don't want
to work hard to earn money.

228
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,640
All they're thinking of
is making fast buck.

229
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,991
Shu Hai

230
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,419
is arousing your greed

231
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,380
while showering you with small favours.

232
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,160
You have all become his
protectors unconsciously

233
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,440
while he continues to commit crime.

234
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:33,797
Young man,

235
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,800
that's easy for you to say.

236
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
You don't live here.

237
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,600
You don't understand our situation.

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,119
After you leave,

239
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,966
no one will come and help us.

240
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,679
That's right. Who will help us?

241
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,960
Drug production and trading
are capital offences,

242
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,321
no matter in which dynasties!

243
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,921
I don't know how many of you

244
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,360
are involved in this dirty business.

245
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,961
I just have one question for you!

246
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,001
You're not even afraid of death.

247
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,760
If you had used such fortitude
on the right path,

248
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,080
would there be any limits

249
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,480
on your capability?

250
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,400
It's too risky.

251
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,759
The chance to put his skills to
good use doesn't come easily.

252
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,440
What if the situation
gets out of hand?

253
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,560
You think the situation won't get out
of hand if I barge in with Squad Seven?

254
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,920
It'll only be even more chaotic.

255
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,680
He's out.

256
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,640
Captain, mission complete.

257
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,680
Good job.

258
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,985
Deputy Director Ding, he's all yours.

259
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,080
Thank you for your hard work.

260
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:47,840
Thank you.

261
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,000
Little girl, come with me.

262
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,880
Wei Wei, be good.

263
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,080
The policeman will take you to your mum.

264
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,000
Come on, I'll take you to your mum.

265
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,120
Sure you're fine?

266
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:20,413
I'm fine.

267
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,559
Not even a scratch.

268
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,359
Yan Po Yue!

269
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,840
-Yes, sir!
-Are you a negotiator?

270
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:28,721
Report, sir.

271
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,640
No, sir.

272
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:31,864
-Can you catch a bullet with your hand?
-Report, sir.

273
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,840
-I've never tried that, sir.
-Can you take down 200 men alone?

274
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Report, sir!

275
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,040
I'm not sure, sir.

276
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:37,934
All the villagers were blocking you.

277
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,480
It's very likely that core members of
Shu Hai's gang were among them.

278
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,040
If someone had incited it a little,

279
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,240
if someone had even spit at you,

280
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,080
things could've got out
of control completely.

281
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,320
I don't care if you got yourself killed,

282
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
but how were you going
to protect a six-year-old girl

283
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,840
from being trampled to death
by the crowd?

284
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,120
Report, sir.

285
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,200
I wasn't completely defenceless.

286
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,840
This is a bomb I seized from Shu Hai.

287
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,440
If things had gotten out of hand,

288
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,080
I would've taken out
the bomb right away.

289
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
I would've told them
this was a time bomb.

290
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,520
And the countdown timer
had been activated.

291
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,040
If they were not afraid of a bomb

292
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,400
exploding on their doorstep,

293
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,440
just came at me then.

294
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,640
I told you.

295
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,121
This kid is fearless and smart.

296
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,440
Captain,

297
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,720
actually, the villagers who
stopped me are not bad people.

298
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,480
Their village is too remote and poor.

299
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,600
The young people were enticed to
dream of becoming rich overnight.

300
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,960
Right or wrong is not

301
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
that important to them.

302
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,960
It is easy to dream but hard to let go.

303
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,480
This is the weakness of human nature.

304
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,040
Many people take advantage of

305
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,959
this weaknesses.

306
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,160
Such as Shu Hai.

307
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,800
And such as, you.

308
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,479
If all you can think about was

309
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,359
obtaining your own victory,

310
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,680
I wouldn't trust you enough
to put you in Squad Nine.

311
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,080
But

312
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,080
I can trust you now.

313
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:21,286
You have passed your
individual assessment.

314
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,199
You will return to the team
starting tomorrow.

315
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,840
Who are you?

316
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,680
Who are you?

317
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,240
Is this you, Xiao?

318
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,560
You're back.

319
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:40,480
Come on.

320
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,640
We just got back.

321
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,680
As soon as we got back, we heard
that you went with Squad Seven

322
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,560
to catch drug dealer.

323
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,360
That's right.

324
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,841
Tell us what happened.

325
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,238
Good for you.

326
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,719
When we went for the competition,

327
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,760
we felt sorry for you that you had to
stay here alone guarding the armoury.

328
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,400
Turned out that you weren't
just sitting around.

329
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
It was an easy mission.
Didn't even fire a bullet.

330
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
Not even a scratch on me.

331
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,240
Even 5km weight-bearing race
is tiring than that.

332
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,561
Yue Kong, Xiao Xiao,

333
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,320
congratulations on
winning the shooting event.

334
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,920
Thank you.

335
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,120
It's a pity that
we didn't win the team title.

336
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,839
You should've seen the
look on Captain Qin's face.

337
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,400
Goodness. It was so dark and scary.

338
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:18,959
How is it, Captain?

339
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,680
Can you trust Yan Po Yue now?

340
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,080
Soldiers without personality and
only know how to obey orders

341
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,480
are easy to use,

342
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,386
but on the journey of
becoming the strongest force,

343
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:33,666
they will eventually be eliminated
by other stronger soldiers.

344
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,154
Only soldiers like Yan Po Yue
and his comrades,

345
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,760
whose strengths and weaknesses
are equally outstanding,

346
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,160
can have unlimited possibilities
in the future.

347
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,160
To be honest,

348
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
this kid really irked me at first.

349
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,120
But I had no choice.

350
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,400
For our long-term goal,

351
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,240
I had to force myself to like him.

352
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Alright now.

353
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,919
Now that Yan Po Yue's
problem is solved.

354
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
Continue to train Squad Seven.

355
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,000
Do you still remember the little girl

356
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,199
you saved from Shu Hai's hands?

357
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,280
Wei Wei?

358
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,360
The public security bureau
has found her family.

359
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,360
She was abducted three years ago.

360
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
To control the little girl,

361
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,800
Shu Hai locked her up in
a small dark room all the time.

362
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,440
She only got to see Shu Hai
once every three days.

363
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
Only when Shu Hai met her,

364
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,240
could she leave the dark room

365
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,520
and eat.

366
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,600
Over time,

367
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,360
she became mentally
dependent on Shu Hai.

368
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,520
Even now that she's back home,

369
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,360
she rarely talks to her family.

370
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,960
She would get hysterical sometimes.

371
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,480
-What can be done then?
-Wei Wei said she wants to see you.

372
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,360
Me?

373
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes.

374
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,960
Her parents reached out
to the public security bureau.

375
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,000
And the bureau contacted
local armed forces.

376
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,440
The armed forces
cascaded to higher levels.

377
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,000
Finally, the message got
to our detachment chief.

378
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,200
They did this just because
she wants to see you.

379
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,840
I...

380
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,640
What should I say to her
when I see her?

381
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,080
Study hard,
always strive for the better,

382
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,280
be a useful person for
our country in the future.

383
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,520
Do you really need me to teach you?

384
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,720
Just make up something that little girls

385
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,240
can understand.

386
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Hi,

387
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,480
Wei Wei.

388
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm your new friend.

389
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm here to see you.

390
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:52,382
Wei Wei,

391
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
do you remember me?

392
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Want some fruits?

393
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,599
Let me peel you an orange.

394
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,600
Done.

395
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,758
Here.

396
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,160
Is it good?

397
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,240
It's for me?

398
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,360
Thank you.

399
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,000
I heard you wanted to meet me.

400
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,240
Is there something you want to tell me?

401
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:08,317
It's for me?

402
00:22:09,672 --> 00:22:10,472
Let me see.

403
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,639
I...

404
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,938
(I like you.
Can I be your bride when I grow up?)

405
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,759
You like me?

406
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,714
(Okay?)

407
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,440
Okay.

408
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,439
Then, you must work with
the doctor for your treatment.

409
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:45,054
Try to get well

410
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,000
and grow up healthily,

411
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,120
okay?

412
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,920
I'll keep this.

413
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,201
It's a promise.

414
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,400
Hello, Deputy Director Ding.

415
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,760
(Captain Qin,)

416
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,600
(I'm afraid I'll have
to bother you again.)

417
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,881
(It's fine. Go on.)

418
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,040
(Shu Hai confessed that)

419
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
(their main supplier is Red Scorpion
from outside the border.)

420
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,744
(Recently,)

421
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,480
(he was scheduled to have
another big deal with Red Scorpion,)

422
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,840
(but the time and venue
haven't been confirmed.)

423
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,720
Got it.

424
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,200
Tian, the land we seized this time
is perfect for weed growing.

425
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,680
Looks like our production
will be doubled again next season.

426
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,120
Pure and natural goods like this
are becoming scarce in the market.

427
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,160
Our quality is the best.

428
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,640
What's the use of growing so much
if we can't ship them out?

429
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,240
I've made contact with Shu Village.

430
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,720
Shu Hai is so conspicuous.

431
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,520
He'll definitely
attract cops' attention.

432
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,439
Are you sure

433
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,720
he's reliable?

434
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,080
He has such a big appetite.

435
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,240
Who can be a better buyer than him?

436
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
After you set fire
on the border last time,

437
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
the security in the borderline
is still as strict as ever.

438
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,560
How are you going to get out?

439
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,640
It's time to use the person

440
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,080
I've spent so much money on.

441
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,080
We interrogated Shu Hai overnight.

442
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,040
He confessed that

443
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,000
Red Scorpion will carry out

444
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:47,880
a large-scale cross-border armed drug
trafficking operation early next month.

445
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,961
The quantity is huge.

446
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,440
And Red Scorpion's leader
will escort it personally.

447
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,080
This is a great opportunity.

448
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,880
We can capture
Red Scorpion's leader, Xing Tian,

449
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,200
and seize lots of drugs.

450
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,479
What is the specific plan?

451
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,719
Our plan is to

452
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:03,280
seize them together with the goods,

453
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,920
as soon as they enter our territory.

454
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,080
Please note that our undercover officer

455
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,120
will also participate
in this drug transport operation.

456
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,640
He will wear specific clothing
to distinguish himself.

457
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,040
This is our chance to
completely crush Red Scorpion,

458
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,600
the cancer of the border.

459
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:22,560
We will dispatch a large number
of officers to round them up.

460
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,760
We would also like
Cheetah to support us.

461
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,280
Combating terrorism

462
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,561
is the duty of our special forces.

463
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,760
Captain Qin will be in charge
of Cheetah's operation as usual.

464
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,000
Yes, sir! I promise to
complete the mission!

465
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,919
Crossing the border in
such a high-profile way.

466
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,959
You'll be dead before I can kill you.

467
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm not that stupid.

468
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,199
My life is yours to take.

469
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,640
What does that mean?

470
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,000
You let the word out on purpose?

471
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,480
I'm certain we got a mole.

472
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,560
The police gained the upper hand

473
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,160
in our last few operations.

474
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,600
Who's most likely to be the mole?

475
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,480
Me.

476
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,720
You?

477
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,520
If you want to kill me,

478
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,120
you don't need any help.

479
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,360
I know

480
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
who the mole is.

481
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,120
I'm going to send him to die this time.

482
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,560
What about the goods?

483
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,760
The new path has been paved.

484
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,280
I'll go personally this time.

485
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,000
Take me with you.

486
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,960
If you leave,

487
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:14,160
there will be no one
to look after the village.

488
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:15,625
If I go,

489
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,480
I can make sure you come back alive.

490
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,040
Over the past year,

491
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,800
our borders have been tightly guarded,

492
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,080
resulting in a huge backlogs of goods

493
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,920
held in the hands of
the drug traffickers abroad.

494
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,400
They're desperate to sell them.

495
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,800
According to intelligence,

496
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,040
Red Scorpion, a terrorist
drug trafficking organization,

497
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,840
has gathered several major
drug trafficking forces in the borders

498
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,600
and formed an unknown size

499
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,000
but absolutely not to be underestimated
joint drug transport team.

500
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,277
They attempts to take advantage

501
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,080
of the pristine jungle to conduct

502
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,961
a massive drug dump into our territory.

503
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,000
The amount is likely
to be measured in tons.

504
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,559
This time, you are likely

505
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,400
to face a mercenary squad

506
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,720
formed by veterans.

507
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,840
Keep in mind that

508
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,760
once the battle starts,

509
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,920
do not expose too much firepower.

510
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,600
Let them into the jungle.

511
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,560
And then,

512
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,640
use jungle warfare,
which is what you do best,

513
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,880
strike like a cheetah on all sides.

514
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Every time you attack,

515
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,200
I want you to tear off a piece of flesh
from the enemy's body.

516
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,601
Keep them bleeding

517
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
until they are weakened,

518
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,000
and then launch the final assault.

519
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,440
What I want from you

520
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,240
isn't just victory,

521
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,240
I want each and every one of you
to come back alive.

522
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,599
Yes, sir!

523
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,320
(Tip from undercover officer)

524
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,880
(Second aunt will be visiting
the family in the next few days,)

525
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,775
(please pay attention
to the weather forecast.)

526
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,439
Yan, how long have I slept?

527
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,944
-Ten minutes.
-I'll take over. Take a nap.

528
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:30,825
It's fine.

529
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:33,136
Go back to sleep. I can handle it.

530
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,720
Never mind. Ten minutes is enough.

531
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
It's been seven days.

532
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:51,018
How sure are you that

533
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,400
they will take this path?

534
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,760
90% sure. If the amount of drugs

535
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,520
they deliver this time really is huge,

536
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,720
they can only take this
side road of Tea Horse Road.

537
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:01,096
They will

538
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
inevitably pass by Ziyin Mountain.

539
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,559
We'll wait then.

540
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:21,919
Xiao Xiao,

541
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,520
if you're tired, take a nap.

542
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,360
I'll watch it for you.

543
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,321
Just take care of yourself.

544
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm just worried that
we would get sleepy.

545
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,520
-I'm initiating a conversation.
-There's nothing to talk about.

546
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,840
Are you nervous?

547
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,159
I just feel a little unease.

548
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
You feel unease?

549
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,912
Aren't you bent on making money?

550
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,040
How come you're getting cold feet

551
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:08,952
now that the chance is here?

552
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,079
Don't worry.

553
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,441
I'm thinking about
how I should spend my money.

554
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,122
If we encounter
the armed police forces today,

555
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,681
will that scare you?

556
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:20,607
Scare me?

557
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,599
But I never know
how to spell the word scare.

558
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,520
That's good.

559
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,440
Let's hope we won't encounter them.

560
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,160
Here. Eat this.

561
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,040
Or you'll get dizzy. Come on.

562
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,840
Possible target spotted.

563
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,120
Yan, possible target spotted.

564
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
(Attention everyone,)

565
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,960
(look carefully before you shoot.)

566
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:14,080
(Don't shoot the undercover officer.)

567
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,841
His clothes have special markings.

568
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
What about the minefield?

569
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,200
There are markings on the tree.

570
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,400
He'll keep his eyes open.

571
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,982
Those in the front, why did you stop?

572
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,160
Ziyin Mountain pass is right ahead.

573
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,641
It has great vantage point.

574
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
This is the most suitable place

575
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,000
to set up an ambush.

576
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,520
Let's check the route!

577
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,881
Xiao Xiao, get down!

578
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,919
-You okay?
-Yes.

579
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Nobody move.

580
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,280
They are doing recon by fire.

581
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,960
(All units, any casualties?)

582
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,399
Yan Po Yue, safe.

583
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,401
Xiao Yun Jie, safe.

584
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,960
-Guo Xiao Xiao, safe.
-Yue Kong, safe.

585
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,000
Xu Yang, safe.

586
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,800
Mu Qing, safe.

587
00:33:57,881 --> 00:33:58,721
Bai Long, safe.

588
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,080
Is it safe now?

589
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,120
What now?

590
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,040
My shoe is loose.

591
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,839
There are a total of ten targets.

592
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,320
No undercover marking found.

593
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,200
Fire!

594
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,120
Lai, we've been ambushed.

595
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,560
Let's retreat.

596
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,600
Retreat?

597
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,280
They are the ones I'm waiting for.

598
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,920
You really think
we're delivering the goods?

599
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,600
The real goods are with Tian.

600
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,120
Our goal this time

601
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,880
is to finish off Cheetah.

602
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,120
We've been exposed.

603
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
Should we pursue them?

604
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,800
We've alerted them.

605
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,520
If those hiding in the back
fled across the border,

606
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,160
our waiting would've been for nothing.

607
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,520
Cannon No.5. Bearing 185.

608
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,600
Firing angle, 1350.

609
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,200
Five anti-personnel bombs, rapid fire!

610
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,240
Fire!

611
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,159
It's mortar! Retreat!

612
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,679
Yan, run!

613
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,479
Go!

614
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,880
Hurry!

615
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,880
Come on!

616
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,560
Watch out!

617
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:53,679
Are they crazy?

618
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,760
3,000 meters away from us,

619
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,840
there are five 81mm mortars

620
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:59,200
bombarding us non-stop with rapid fire.

621
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,400
Go!

622
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,840
Go!

623
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,561
Yan, get out of here. Go without me!

624
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,720
Bai!

625
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,560
Bai!

626
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,600
Bearing 183.

627
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,672
Firing angle, 1358.

628
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,440
Change to 374 high explosive bombs.

629
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,520
Fire!

630
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,959
Fire! Fire!

631
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,520
Kill that sniper!

632
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:15,239
Yan, this little injury won't kill me.

633
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,200
Go now.

634
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,680
The one across from us is
an expert in mortar shooting.

635
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,080
If you don't go now,

636
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,199
if they keep bombing us like this,

637
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,239
everyone in Squad Nine and
narcotics squad will be dead.

638
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,679
Listen to me, Yan!

639
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,731
Go and do what you have to do.
Go now! Scram!

640
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,600
Scram!

641
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,760
Scram!

642
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,721
Shut up!

643
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,160
Let me do it!

644
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,320
I said scram! Do you hear me?

645
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,040
I'm going to destroy
their mortar base!
