00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:29,160
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:31,000
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 5)

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,880
(Do you have flares or lights?)

5
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,639
No.

6
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,360
(The light at the sentry post
can be used as a guide.)

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,600
(Turn on the lights.)

8
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:48,959
(Private,)

9
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,600
(please respond.)

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,280
We are in a firefight.
We can't switch on the lights.

11
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,680
We can only switch them on

12
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,960
with the permission of
Company Commander Zhang.

13
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,160
(Roger.)

14
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,880
(I'll ask Company Commander Zhang.)

15
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,560
There is no Company Commander Zhang.

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
Who are you?

17
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,360
Who are you?

18
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,000
(Your communication has been cut off.)

19
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,840
(Your escape route is blocked.)

20
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,120
(At any rate,)

21
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,280
(you can't make it through the night.)

22
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,120
Darn it!

23
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,281
He is the sniper.

24
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,080
Release my man.

25
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,599
Take the headcount.

26
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,759
(Our squad leader is missing.)

27
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,239
Has anyone seen him?

28
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,839
(We were attacked by the enemy.)

29
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
(Squad Leader Gao rushed out.)

30
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,760
(The smoke was too thick. I can't see.)

31
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,040
(I heard gunshots.)

32
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,200
(How is my man?)

33
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
(If you don't answer my question,)

34
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,360
I will smash the head

35
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,880
of that man who is half alive
in the courtyard.

36
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
The rain has stopped.

37
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,640
(There is a moonlight,)

38
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,840
(and the vision is very clear.)

39
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
(What's his name?)

40
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
(I can see his collar insignia.)

41
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,640
He is a veteran.

42
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Is he married?

43
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:22,939
Squad leader!

44
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,880
Get back!

45
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,260
Do you want to die?

46
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,200
Squad leader!

47
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Squad leader!

48
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,360
(Private Yan Po Yue.)

49
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,720
Don't you want to answer the question?

50
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
Your man is fine.

51
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
He's doing better than you.

52
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,600
(Let him talk to me.)

53
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,760
(If I can't confirm he's still alive,)

54
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,560
(we will use mortars.)

55
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,040
Why did you take so long?

56
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,720
Scoundrels! Hurry up!

57
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,880
Hurry up!

58
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,780
(Calling squad leader.)

59
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,600
Roger. Roger.

60
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,059
(The sniper on the other side
cut off our communication.)

61
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,119
He is talking to me.

62
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,079
Press your walkie-talkie

63
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,640
so that I can hear your conversation.

64
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,520
Yes.

65
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,480
Get him to talk.

66
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,759
Better still, make him shoot.

67
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,320
Roger.

68
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,680
Gao! Gao!

69
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,680
Don't move. The sniper is watching you.

70
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,440
Stop the bleeding first.

71
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,719
Private Yan Po Yue,

72
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,600
(how old are you?)

73
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,519
Twenty.

74
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
(You're so young.)

75
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,399
(Must you die young?)

76
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,600
How dare you

77
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,601
attack the Chinese People's
Armed Police Force?

78
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,999
The person beside you

79
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,120
(is worth more than all your lives.)

80
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
There are three bodies outside.

81
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,080
They're all your people.

82
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,081
So what?

83
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,880
The second round of offensive
is about to begin.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,519
(We have more people.)

85
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,360
(You don't stand a chance.)

86
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,200
Even if that is so,

87
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,640
your people will die too.

88
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,479
Is it worthwhile?

89
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,760
Soldiers

90
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,040
die in combats.

91
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
Right?

92
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,280
(You have done your best.)

93
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
(You fought well.)

94
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,440
(Don't sacrifice in vain.)

95
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,119
(Let him go)

96
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,440
(and we all stay alive.)

97
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:58,359
The soldier in the yard is dying.

98
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,320
(He could have survived.)

99
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,479
(It's your fault.)

100
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,880
(I won't let him crawl back alive.)

101
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,400
Let my man go.

102
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,119
A life for a life.

103
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,080
(Five,)

104
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,359
(four,)

105
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,000
(three,)

106
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,200
(two...)

107
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,039
Stop.

108
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:01,919
Give me some time.

109
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,440
I must request

110
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,999
permission from my superior.

111
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,040
(One minute.)

112
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,480
Yan Po Yue.

113
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,040
(Move after one minute.)

114
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,659
Understood.

115
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:19,919
(Xiao Yun Jie,)

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,880
throw smoke grenades
from the rear flank.

117
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,679
I'll fire shots to distract him

118
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,400
while you save Squad Leader Gao.

119
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,240
Roger.

120
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Yan Po Yue, continue to chatter with him

121
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,440
Roger.

122
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,840
Be careful.

123
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,320
Gao!

124
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
Hang on.

125
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,001
(Yan Po Yue,)

126
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,079
(my patience is wearing thin.)

127
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,839
(Don't play tricks with me.)

128
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,320
My request was approved.

129
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,199
I can let you see him

130
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,860
but I can't let him go.

131
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,400
(Let him go to the window.)

132
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,719
(Slowly.)

133
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,360
(Don't play tricks.)

134
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,321
(Thank you.)

135
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,960
(Squad leader,)

136
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,840
(the reserve power generator
will be up soon.)

137
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,440
Come, quickly.

138
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,680
Quickly!

139
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,840
Let's go.

140
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,760
Yan Po Yue,

141
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,559
you are courting death!

142
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,840
What are you waiting for? Attack!

143
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,040
(Thank you.)

144
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
I hit him.

145
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Is anyone injured?

146
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,280
(Squad leader, we're all right.)

147
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,600
(We rescued Squad Leader Gao.)

148
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,720
Sorry, squad leader.

149
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,520
The captive is dead.

150
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,159
(During the attack
on the Training Site 121's sentry post,)

151
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,120
(three soldiers were seriously wounded)

152
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
(and two not seriously.)

153
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,819
(Eight drug dealers were killed.)

154
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,320
(A detained drug dealer
was shot dead by his accomplice.)

155
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,239
(The drug dealers dared to
attack the People's Armed Police.)

156
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,420
(It is the first such case
in our jurisdiction.)

157
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,679
(Deputy Director Ding)

158
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,001
(of the City Public Security Bureau
will brief us about the drug dealers.)

159
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,880
First,

160
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,159
we thank the units
for your vigorous support.

161
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,119
According to our intelligence analysis,

162
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,400
the criminals involved in the attack

163
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,640
have close contact with Red Scorpion,
a drug trafficking organisation

164
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,840
that has been in hiding.

165
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,080
In the 1980s,

166
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,039
(the Red Scorpion)

167
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,620
(was rampant in the border areas
and stopped at no evil.)

168
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,479
(Under the joint attacks of
public security organs and units,)

169
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,599
(it was hit hard.)

170
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,159
(It disappeared for a while.)

171
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,799
In recent years, the organisation

172
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,200
obtained a lot of illicit funds

173
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,320
from drug trafficking, kidnapping,
and so on.

174
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,280
(It purchased advanced weaponry abroad)

175
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,880
(and gradually grew into)

176
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,400
(an independent armed drug cartel.)

177
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,159
We ask units to vigorously support

178
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,799
operations to arrest traffickers.

179
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,919
(Regiment Commander Liu,
our superior instructs)

180
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,280
(the Rapid Deployment Regiment
to fight in collaboration)

181
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,219
(with public security departments
to arrest the drug traffickers soon.)

182
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,679
(Units can access the military network
to retrieve data and operation plans.)

183
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,359
Execute immediately
after you get them.

184
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,440
Report at once.

185
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,760
Yes.

186
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,039
Spread out. Don't crowd here.
How can I serve?

187
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,200
We want to see the combat hero.
Don't we, brothers?

188
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,359
Squad Leader Fan,
which dish did you cook?

189
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,239
Give me more of it.

190
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,960
Yes. More!

191
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,760
I cooked everything.

192
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,800
You, greenhorns, can eat
till your stomachs burst.

193
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,159
More, more, more.

194
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,840
Here.

195
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:50,560
(Work Hard and Maintain Cleanliness.
Promote Health and Nutrition.)

196
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,720
Sir.

197
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,159
What did you feel

198
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,860
when you killed?

199
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:13,799
The recoil force.

200
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,200
You can train hard to kill an enemy

201
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,320
but I hope you never have to do it.

202
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:29,880
Teach me.

203
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,479
What do I teach you?

204
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,880
The skill to kill enemies.

205
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,840
If I teach you, you must master it.

206
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,799
I taught you how to fry shredded
potatoes but they're still mushy.

207
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,259
Do your job well first
and we'll talk about it.

208
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,040
We attacked three times.

209
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,698
Our opponent had an ace.

210
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,520
Our brothers were dead.

211
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,359
The Chinese soldiers put Kun Meng
by the window

212
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,160
and killed him in front of me.

213
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,000
I couldn't do anything.

214
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,880
Ten people left,

215
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,520
and you alone came back.

216
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,959
Of course, you get to say anything.

217
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,000
Daddy Kun!

218
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,359
Why is it that you are
the one to come back?

219
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,040
Daddy Kun,

220
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,479
I owe you my life.

221
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,479
You can take it

222
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:54,839
when you want to.

223
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
Xiao Guai has the gun.

224
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,719
(Kun Sheng, Southeast Asian descendent,
head of Red Scorpion armed drug cartel)

225
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,199
You got it right again.

226
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,359
Daddy Kun,

227
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm sorry for Kun Meng.

228
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,760
If drug dealers

229
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,439
snort drugs,

230
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,359
they will not have good endings.

231
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:33,720
He got himself killed.

232
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,440
No one is to be blamed.

233
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,960
Come.

234
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,560
Offer incense sticks to Buddha.

235
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,719
Thirty years ago,

236
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,320
when I first arrived here,

237
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,000
I was robbed.

238
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,200
My luggage and clothes were gone.

239
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,960
I couldn't speak the local language.

240
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,280
For 10 days,

241
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,600
I didn't eat anything.

242
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,560
Later, I found an abandoned temple

243
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,160
and made a vow to the Buddha there.

244
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,680
If I survived,

245
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,760
I would rebuild the temple

246
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,423
and reconstruct the golden statues.

247
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,840
Seven days later,

248
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,200
I still hadn't found a job.

249
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,319
When I was

250
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,039
almost starving to death,

251
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,720
in the crevices of the floor
at the Buddha's throne,

252
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,760
I found 10 yuan.

253
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,520
That was the incense money

254
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,840
that the last pilgrim dropped.

255
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,520
I used the money

256
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,560
to buy a full meal.

257
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,760
The next day,

258
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,560
someone came over and asked me

259
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,280
if I was willing to kill someone.

260
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,840
Money and food would be granted.

261
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,680
Bodhisattva

262
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,080
will only help you when you're

263
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,320
in a dire strait.

264
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,960
That way, you will be faithful.

265
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,160
I'll remember this.

266
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,079
Daddy Kun.

267
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,400
What do you remember?

268
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,119
Do you know why I named you Xing Tian?

269
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,880
Godfather, you call me Xing Tian

270
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,400
to show favour.

271
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,900
I believe in Bodhisattva

272
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,360
but I want my son

273
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,240
to be feared by Bodhisattva.

274
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,280
Get up.

275
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,320
Recruit more people

276
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,520
and train them to be tougher

277
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,360
so that we can stay alive at the border.

278
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:00,960
Yes.

279
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Tian,

280
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,920
you knew that gun
was unloaded, didn't you?

281
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,669
You could tell if the magazine
was loaded

282
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,599
by its weight in your palm.

283
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,280
If Kun Meng's half as smart as you,

284
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,680
he won't die.

285
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,400
Go.

286
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,319
You're still punching hard.

287
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,699
Sir.

288
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,699
The enemy is strong.

289
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:55,760
I must be stronger!

290
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,239
You came across a sniper who sniped,

291
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,680
and you have lost your confidence.

292
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:01,040
The captive was dead.

293
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,560
I was responsible.

294
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,160
He deserved it.

295
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,239
In terms of combat outcome,
we're successful.

296
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:08,703
I'm still not strong enough.

297
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,003
Hey.

298
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,380
How strong do you want to be?

299
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,520
The strongest!

300
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,640
The strongest?

301
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,920
Can you be the strongest
by practising foolishly?

302
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,459
Actual combats test
your comprehensive ability,

303
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,959
not just physical capability.

304
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,959
This counts too.

305
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:26,959
Intelligence

306
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,780
and experience.

307
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,640
I know.

308
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,000
That's why you must help me, brother.

309
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,079
Brother.

310
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,959
Stand properly!

311
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,539
Who is your brother?

312
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:40,232
Let me tell you.

313
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:41,380
If you want to learn,

314
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,439
swallow the word "strongest".

315
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,599
It's not up to you to say that.

316
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,040
It's up to the others.

317
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,152
Aren't you ashamed?

318
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,480
Go to bed.

319
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,360
There is a victory meeting tomorrow.

320
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:02,719
(Combat Commendation Meeting)
During

321
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,200
the sentry post combat,

322
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,001
the men from our company,

323
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,039
with their communication cut off,

324
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,480
isolated, and without reinforcement,

325
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,599
fought resolutely,

326
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,720
bravely, and fearlessly,

327
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,120
and killed eight armed drug traffickers.

328
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,120
They seized large quantities
of weapons, ammunition, and drugs.

329
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,480
By the order
of the regiment headquarters,

330
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,800
the on-duty Squad Three
of our company at the training ground,

331
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,660
Attention.

332
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,880
Hand

333
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,439
salute.

334
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,459
is given

335
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,440
the collective third-class merit.

336
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,959
For our company's

337
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,959
kitchen squad soldier,

338
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,239
Fan Jin,

339
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,000
Present.

340
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,680
the second-class merit is conferred.

341
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,280
For the kitchen squad soldier,

342
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,800
Guo Kui,

343
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:49,719
Present.

344
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,760
Yan Po Yue,

345
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,000
Present.

346
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,800
Xiao Yun Jie,

347
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,560
Present.

348
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,320
Lu Xiao Tian,

349
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,959
Present.

350
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,200
the third-class merit is conferred.

351
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:01,880
Salute.

352
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,960
Halt.

353
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
Left turn.

354
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,920
Sit.

355
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,920
One more thing.

356
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,000
A young soldier in the kitchen squad

357
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,080
rendered outstanding
performance in combat.

358
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:22,478
The company's party branch decided

359
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,520
to transfer him
to the combat platoon's squad.

360
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,000
Xiao Yun Jie.

361
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,160
Present.

362
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,199
From today onwards,

363
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,640
you are transferred

364
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,359
to Squad One of Platoon One.

365
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:43,880
Report!

366
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,299
Speak.

367
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,319
No one told me about that.

368
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,520
I'm informing you now.

369
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,040
After the meeting,

370
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,040
make room for him.

371
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,760
Zhang Tian Yang.

372
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,400
Present.

373
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:54,479
Did you hear me?

374
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,160
Yes.

375
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,880
Is this inappropriate?

376
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,680
Fan Jin.

377
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
What is inappropriate?

378
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:01,119
This was decided
by the company's party branch.

379
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,300
You've just made your mark
and you're overjoyed?

380
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,040
Will it be appropriate

381
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,219
to transfer you?

382
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,319
Report!

383
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,520
Enter.

384
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,680
Why did you transfer Xiao Yun Jie?

385
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,079
He did well.

386
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,239
Someone performed better.

387
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,419
He doesn't stand a chance.

388
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,920
I described his performance

389
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,560
in the report to the regiment.

390
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,920
If Yan Po Yue was careful,

391
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,119
the captive wouldn't die.

392
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,599
It was an emergency.

393
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,319
The communication was cut off.

394
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,319
He was only a recruit!

395
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,119
Even a veteran would make mistakes.

396
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,359
Stop talking crap.

397
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,000
He

398
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,699
has to practise more.

399
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,680
Yes.

400
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,040
Even if Yan Po Yue
has thorns on his body,

401
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,359
we should groom him properly.

402
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,239
His performance in combat
was indeed outstanding.

403
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,680
He wants

404
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,920
to be outstanding.

405
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:02,959
Do you know why?

406
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,959
He wants to be the strongest soldier.

407
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,280
Did he tell you that?

408
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,560
Yes.

409
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,599
You're an ex-combat squad leader.

410
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:19,939
What do you think?

411
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,120
Company commander,

412
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,620
I have spent three years
in the kitchen squad

413
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,959
and I have realised a truth.

414
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,000
In the past, when
I found a rotten onion,

415
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,239
I thought it was inedible.

416
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,280
Later, I found out

417
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,460
that I could peel off the rotten part
on the outside and eat it.

418
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,319
It tasted sweeter.

419
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,280
Your rotten onions are sweet?

420
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,319
Can this garbage go to war?

421
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,239
They couldn't pay off their debts

422
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,380
and they're willing to pay
with their lives.

423
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,040
Lai,

424
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,280
bring me the things.

425
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:16,920
Yes.

426
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:36,760
The debts of those

427
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:37,959
who reach this side

428
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,599
will be written off.

429
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,959
You are the one chosen by Buddha.

430
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,359
Let's go.

431
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,359
How did she come here?

432
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,359
She was with the girl who's on drugs.

433
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,920
They were caught stealing
because they ran out of drugs.

434
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,160
Take her away.

435
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,079
Don't hurt her.

436
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,760
You are lucky.

437
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,000
Let's see if Bodhisattva
will protect you this time.

438
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,280
Come up after your withdrawal.

439
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,160
You're a beast!

440
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
Beast!

441
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,040
Let me out.

442
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,160
(Xiao Yun Jie left the smoke and fire
of the kitchen squad.)

443
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,719
(He can touch guns every day.)

444
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,040
(I didn't ask him why.)

445
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,400
(I believe)

446
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,800
(he doesn't know why.)

447
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,760
I'm telling you, not just my mother,

448
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,800
but my dad in particular.

449
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,560
When Old Comrade Lu got my medal,

450
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,520
he became cocky.

451
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,620
He mounted it on our corporate wall

452
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,259
as if he rendered meritorious service.

453
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,620
I deeply felt that being a
soldier can bring glory to a family.

454
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,599
How does your family feel?

455
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:51,459
I haven't sent it.

456
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,439
Why?

457
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,800
It's not time yet.

458
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,119
You!

459
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,520
Look at Second Place Xiao.

460
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,319
His luck has finally turned.

461
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,359
He is top-notch.

462
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,359
Squad leader.

463
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,680
Come and drink green bean soup.

464
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,900
Take a break, everyone.

465
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,120
Drink green bean soup.

466
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,760
Come. Hurry, hurry.

467
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,560
Run.

468
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,839
Hurry up.

469
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,199
Here. Get it yourself.

470
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,040
Okay. Thank you.

471
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:19,839
Thank you.

472
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,560
Squad leader.

473
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,280
Xiao Tian,

474
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,239
thank you.

475
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,160
You've worked hard.

476
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:26,199
The front line trains on confrontations
while we provide logistic support.

477
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,539
Proceed.

478
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:29,179
Come, come, come!

479
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,059
I'll ladle it out.

480
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:30,719
Let go

481
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,160
and line up.

482
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,359
Pass me a bowl.

483
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,459
Drink it.

484
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,560
It has rock sugar.

485
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:54,860
I'll do it.

486
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:56,760
Kill.

487
00:31:58,479 --> 00:31:59,040
Kill.

488
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,259
Kill.

489
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,000
Kill.

490
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,119
Good.

491
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,560
Your movements are up to standard.

492
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,040
Take a break. Rest.

493
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,520
Here.

494
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,600
Have some water.

495
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,480
Do you know why
Xiao Yun Jie got transferred?

496
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:25,319
I don't want to know.

497
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:27,359
You don't want to know?

498
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,099
So, you torture yourself here every day?

499
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,199
If I don't do that,

500
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,479
I'll be the next one to fall.

501
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,359
Listen to my advice.

502
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,119
When you have too many onions,

503
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,620
no matter how anxious you get,

504
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,900
you won't finish chopping them.

505
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,680
Am I anxious?

506
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,599
Look. Look!

507
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,160
Aren't you anxious?

508
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,599
You were anxious.

509
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,299
You're more anxious now

510
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,359
and afraid.

511
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:49,959
I admit I'm anxious.

512
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,800
What am I afraid of?

513
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,359
You have too much to be afraid of.

514
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,159
You're afraid you can't get anything

515
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,480
and can't catch up.

516
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,260
However, you're not afraid of dying.

517
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,319
Greenhorn.

518
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,600
Are you still practising?

519
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,199
The greenhorn is sulky.

520
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:09,599
You won't teach me.

521
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,519
Are you upset?

522
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,479
Okay, I've figured it out.

523
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,599
I'll teach you now.

524
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,199
Aren't you the best recruit?

525
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,319
Stab me.

526
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,719
Do you want to learn?

527
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,280
Quickly.

528
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,479
Aren't you indomitable?

529
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,179
Aren't you the best combat fighter
in the recruit company?

530
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,760
You know to do blood choke.

531
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,340
You won't admit defeat?

532
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,520
Let's do it again.

533
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,120
The knife was on your neck twice.

534
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,800
I'll give you one last chance.

535
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,079
If you lose again,

536
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,800
you have to stop being
as stubborn as a mule

537
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,800
and smile at everyone.

538
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,000
Agree?

539
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:37,638
You cannot renege on that.

540
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,159
I'm thrusting

541
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,560
at your 14th vertebrae.

542
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,959
On the battlefield,

543
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,840
if I step on your vertebrae,
you won't be able to stand up forever.

544
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,199
Street fighting is nothing.

545
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,019
You can wipe the blood off your face

546
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,120
and go back to practise.

547
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,520
You can always fight another day.

548
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,239
For soldiers,

549
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,679
failure means death.

550
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,199
You're too impulsive.

551
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,920
Luckily, you were outstanding
and used force to solve the crisis.

552
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:45,040
You are a peacock
in the recruit company,

553
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,640
but what would you do
when you face a stronger enemy?

554
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,760
The braver you charge,
the faster you'll die.

555
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,391
Remember.

556
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,879
When you face a stronger enemy
on the battlefield,

557
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,159
as long as the battle spirit
inside you persists,

558
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,799
patience is to build up strength,

559
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,356
showing weakness is
for tactical deception,

560
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,479
and only by detour can you win.

561
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,680
I remember it.

562
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,040
If you remember, do it.

563
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,560
Be willing to concede defeat.

564
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,080
Don't wear a scowl
on your face every day.

565
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,640
Let me tell you.

566
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,120
Smile to whoever

567
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,080
you meet in the future.

568
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,760
Yes.

569
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,760
Squad leader!

570
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,100
Continue to practise.

571
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:28,400
More practice?

572
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,000
That's all I'll teach today.

573
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,879
If you want to practise,

574
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,040
after your work tomorrow,

575
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,019
go to buy a box of Coke

576
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,040
at the service centre

577
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,160
and wait for me here.

578
00:36:58,959 --> 00:36:59,719
Brother.

579
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,280
Why is Squad Leader Fan

580
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,199
charging you a fee?

581
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,399
A box per day isn't cheap.

582
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,800
That's okay, as long as
I can learn real skills.

583
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,800
He is the squad...

584
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,259
Squad leader!

585
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,900
Squad leader!

586
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,359
At ease.

587
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:22,479
Tell me.

588
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:24,879
What do you want me to teach you?

589
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,019
Shooting.

590
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,320
Greenhorn!

591
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,700
Alright.

592
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,560
Let's practise shooting today.

593
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,280
Squad leader,

594
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,399
the gun and bullets...

595
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:36,919
They're here.

596
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,819
Do what I do.

597
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:45,679
Drink!

598
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm boosting my ability.

599
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,100
Okay.

600
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,760
Okay, one can a day is enough.

601
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,259
Come.

602
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,040
Put them further away.

603
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,000
Alright?

604
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay.

605
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,479
Can you aim?

606
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,040
That's simple.

607
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,639
Slingshot.

608
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,959
Are we fowling?

609
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,359
Do you look down on this?

610
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,760
Listen.

611
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,719
Thirty years ago,

612
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,000
a kid who owned this slingshot

613
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,979
would be the king of children
in the courtyard.

614
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,800
Look.

615
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,760
An infusion tube made of pure rubber.

616
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,840
I stole it from my mother's hospital.

617
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,840
Look at this.

618
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,600
Pure cowhide.

619
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,000
I detached it from my grandpa's shoes.

620
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,360
It's absolutely solid.

621
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,919
It wasn't nicely cut

622
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,000
but what's crucial

623
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,000
is the stability of the entire catapult.

624
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,280
Look.

625
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,679
Dozens of coils of wire.

626
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,719
Look at this detail.

627
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,920
You played it when you were a kid

628
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,239
and brought it to the unit?

629
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,399
So?

630
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,719
My son will inherit it.

631
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,320
Aim.

632
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,599
Open your eyes widely.

633
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:48,600
Best shooter in the company!

634
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,959
Great precision! Squad leader,

635
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,019
you hit all of them.

636
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:56,239
Practice

637
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,120
makes perfect.

638
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,280
By relying on this fowling skill

639
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,439
I practised in my childhood,

640
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,120
ever since I enlisted,

641
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,760
I have been the top scorer
in shooting evaluations.

642
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,100
Thank you, squad leader.

643
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:32,159
Are you shooting without ammunition?

644
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:37,520
Arrogant.

645
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,239
Excited.

646
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,360
Excited.

647
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,239
Wait, wait, wait.

648
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:45,159
They are precious.

649
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:47,760
Listen.

650
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:50,040
I have 100 steel balls in this box.

651
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,339
I don't care how you shoot.

652
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,399
I want all the steel balls back.

653
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:55,280
Don't worry. Don't worry.

654
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,760
It will be dark in three hours.

655
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,159
You can't locate the steel balls
at night

656
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,440
Keep an eye on him.

657
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,159
Watch the steel balls.

658
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,320
Staff Officer Ai.

659
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,360
You're a combat hero.

660
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,679
What combat hero?

661
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,879
I

662
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,520
came to apologise
for the mistake last time.

663
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,800
Tell me,

664
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,600
what was your mistake?

665
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:36,360
We were too reckless.

666
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:37,719
We?

667
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,560
Why are you

668
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,719
the only one to apologise?

669
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,360
He...

670
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,639
Sister, I'll be honest.

671
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,180
Actually, I'm here on behalf of Yan.

672
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,358
You guys fought well
on the training ground

673
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,779
and rendered meritorious service.

674
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,239
What else can happen?

675
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:56,439
It's

676
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,080
a long story.

677
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,760
Can you spare a few minutes?

678
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,779
Ten minutes.

679
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,399
I have a meeting.

680
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,360
Brother, what are you doing?

681
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,000
Hit the can. The can. Not here!

682
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:15,900
Again.

683
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:19,840
Missed.

684
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,600
See for yourself how far away it was.

685
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
You have no power!

686
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,919
Again!
