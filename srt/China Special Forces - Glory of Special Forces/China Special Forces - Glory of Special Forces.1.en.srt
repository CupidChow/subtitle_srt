1
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:52,146
(Two targets on the tower.)

2
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:53,406
(One is manning a heavy machine gun.)

3
00:00:58,056 --> 00:00:59,851
(One target on each floor
at the east corridor,)

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,187
(all armed with
fully automatic assault rifles.)

5
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:04,212
(One target on the rooftop,)

6
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,440
(armed with
fully automatic assault rifle.)

7
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,040
(At least two targets were sighted
in the building,)

8
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:07,921
armed with unknown weapons.

9
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:10,448
Two enemies at the entrance,

10
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,769
armed with assault rifles.

11
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:14,112
One enemy on the second floor.

12
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:15,790
Wait for the action signal.

13
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:54,653
All units, confirm your targets.

14
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:55,938
Tiger Fang One, targets confirmed.

15
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,250
Tiger Fang Two, in position.

16
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,521
Tiger Fang Three, in position.

17
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
Tiger Fang Four, targets confirmed.

18
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:02,160
Tiger Fang Five, targets confirmed.

19
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:04,320
Tiger Claw One, targets confirmed.

20
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,567
Get ready.

21
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:07,306
Three,

22
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:09,189
two,

23
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:11,822
one.

24
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,577
The coast is clear.

25
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,197
Wake up.

26
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:00,681
Please give us the identification code.

27
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:06,576
Dispatch me in the first battle,

28
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:10,177
victory will be assured.

29
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,314
Target identity confirmed.

30
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:20,959
Target Two has been rescued.

31
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:21,836
He requires immediate treatment.

32
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,122
Tiger Fang Three, take care of him.

33
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:24,079
Roger that.

34
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:27,852
Calling for Tiger Head.

35
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,085
Our drone's signal is interrupted.

36
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,486
The current situation is unknown.

37
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,662
Hurry!

38
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,923
Take cover!

39
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:54,775
Calling for Tiger Head.

40
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,399
Enemies are surrounding
the Tiger Fang platoon.

41
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,600
Please send in
the fire support team in advance!

42
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:02,634
There's a sniper!

43
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,400
-Tiger Fang Four, let's retreat!
-Retreat!

44
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,118
Reloading!

45
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,694
Okay!

46
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,384
Reloading!

47
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:25,071
Move!

48
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:27,447
Move!

49
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:45,220
Cover me!

50
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:53,204
Tiger Fang Four!

51
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,806
Run!

52
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:13,962
Tiger Fang Two, enter the building!

53
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:26,704
Tiger Fang Three, move!

54
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:52,868
Move!

55
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:07,336
I need ammo.

56
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,430
Tiger Fang Two and Three,
you two should leave first.

57
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,129
Tiger Fang Four and Five,
draw their fire away.

58
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:46,290
Roger that!

59
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:47,208
Cover us!

60
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:09,760
Retreat!

61
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,120
Die! I'll send you all to hell!

62
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,519
(There's a fire burning in my heart.)

63
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,306
(It warms my faith)

64
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:25,376
(and burns my soul.)

65
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,079
(Qin Feng once said)

66
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,192
(that good is the enemy of better.)

67
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,600
(To become better,)

68
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:37,259
(I crave the most intense battles.)

69
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:41,288
(Whenever I pull the trigger,)

70
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,200
(I feel the extra recoil
hitting my shoulder.)

71
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,799
(Things that are worthy to do)

72
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:48,512
(are worth our every effort.)

73
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,579
(I'm Cheetah,)

74
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:52,595
(and I'm fearless.)

75
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,381
(Glory of Special Forces)

76
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:27,294
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

77
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,889
(Episode 1)

78
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,147
-Are they real?
-Are these real firearms?

79
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,733
A bunch of amateurs.

80
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,287
Everybody! Get down and line up!

81
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,748
Goodness. Look at that delicate guy.

82
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,719
If everything goes well,

83
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,520
he should be joining the model team.

84
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,459
Do not speak!

85
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Company Commander,

86
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,746
in total, there should be
70 recruits for the first batch.

87
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,017
The actual number
of recruits here is 70.

88
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:33,799
Please give us your instruction!

89
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:34,767
What instruction?

90
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,694
Do you mean instructing you guys
to waste your food?

91
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:50,626
Li, just forget it.

92
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:51,959
We can teach them a lesson
when we're back at the camp.

93
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,304
I believe all of our recruits here know

94
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:16,913
that each grain in your rice plate
is a result of hard labor.

95
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,623
That's nonsense!

96
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:21,969
I'm Li Xiang.

97
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,183
I'm the company commander
of the Tiger Special Forces

98
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:24,769
of the Rapid Deployment Brigade.

99
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:26,755
Now,

100
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:28,859
I serve as the
company commander of you recruits!

101
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,458
Li, as in Li Zicheng!

102
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:31,717
Xiang, as in kind!

103
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:34,192
My name is easy to remember.

104
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:38,239
It's fine even if you don't remember it.

105
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:42,200
Soon, you guys will
address me with nicknames

106
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:45,400
such as the devil or the scoundrel.

107
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:46,475
Two years ago,

108
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,799
a recruit came up
with a nickname for me.

109
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:49,864
I loved it.

110
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,799
You guys can call me that if you like.

111
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,280
They called me Psycho King!

112
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,719
Today, I'll show you guys
what that means.

113
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,760
I assume someone bought these eggs
at the railway platform.

114
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:08,762
It costs five yuan for one bag.

115
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:09,954
There are five eggs in a bag.

116
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,123
Among you all,

117
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:14,280
there was a spoiled young master
who didn't want to bring it down.

118
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,585
That's fine.

119
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,497
But he actually threw them
on the ground and stepped on them!

120
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,330
It's reasonable when I think about it.

121
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:22,354
If I'm not eating the food

122
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:24,506
that I had bought for myself,

123
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,914
why should I give it to other people?

124
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,809
In the military, we call this

125
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,512
not leaving any food behind

126
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:34,971
for our enemies.

127
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:41,041
When Lei Feng traveled 1,000 miles,

128
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:42,601
his heroic deeds were sung by all!

129
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:43,681
But you guys?

130
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,359
You guys wasted
an entire bus's worth of food!

131
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:48,880
How dare spoiled young brats
like you guys wear the military uniform?

132
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,522
Do you guys think you can
protect your country like this?

133
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,842
Pick up the food

134
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:56,833
that you've thrown away,

135
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,061
and finish them.

136
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:01,342
Move!

137
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,674
Cherishing food and being thrifty

138
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:10,327
are always the
glorious tradition of the military.

139
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,919
We must never forsake them.

140
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:14,434
I hope everyone

141
00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:17,361
can remember the tradition
that I had mentioned just now.

142
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:19,232
The two seats to the right

143
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:20,672
of the third-last row

144
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:22,170
were clean.

145
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,272
Whose seats were those?

146
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,381
It was our seats!

147
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,801
-Your name.
-Xiao Yun Jie!

148
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:34,670
Sir,

149
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:36,404
my name is Yan Po Yue.

150
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:39,069
Bring me the roster.

151
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:47,647
You two came from the same place?

152
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:48,977
So, you two know each other?

153
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:50,384
We were schoolmates in secondary school!

154
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,561
Schoolmates and comrades?

155
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:58,271
Why did you enlist in the military?

156
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:00,359
To serve my country and
contribute my youth!

157
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:02,641
To make contributions
to the prosperity of our motherland!

158
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,480
Be honest with me.

159
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:06,073
To grow strong.

160
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:17,323
Hurry up!

161
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,921
One! Two! Three! Four!

162
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:28,353
Hurry!

163
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:29,986
It'll be nighttime when
you guys finish your laps!

164
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,385
Stop dilly-dallying! Hurry!

165
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,403
What is this?

166
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:41,479
-It's just two eggs, you know?
-Just cut the crap and run.

167
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,119
Buddy!

168
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:45,082
I have short legs!
This is excruciating for me!

169
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:46,551
I have to take
at least a thousand steps for one lap!

170
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,321
I've never suffered like this before
in my entire life!

171
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:49,190
Just shut up.

172
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,760
You guys can enjoy your stroll!
I'm done warming up!

173
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:53,776
Are they humans or horses?

174
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:05,034
Those two kids are pretty interesting.

175
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:07,972
That's what you call terminal lucidity.

176
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,000
Wait for me!

177
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,151
-I can't run anymore!
-Let go of me.

178
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,306
What's your problem? Let go of me!

179
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,401
Let go of me!

180
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:27,143
Stop!

181
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,706
Stop!

182
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:38,153
So, you think you're a great runner?

183
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:40,337
You could even help out
other people while running, huh?

184
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,880
Squad Leader,

185
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,359
did you look closely just now?

186
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,640
He was the one dragging us just now.

187
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,280
I just saw you guys
running hand in hand.

188
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:48,440
Squad Leader,

189
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
I can no longer run.

190
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,679
You're done already?

191
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,855
If you can't run,

192
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:53,144
you can crawl!

193
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,314
Our company commander
has already instructed you guys!

194
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:56,808
If you don't finish your laps today,

195
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:58,305
no one will get to eat!

196
00:19:58,507 --> 00:20:00,747
Finish your laps, even if
it means you have to crawl!

197
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,526
So annoying.

198
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:06,799
What?

199
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:08,272
What did you say just now?

200
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:11,312
Our squad is not organized.
It's annoying to run like this.

201
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:15,857
You're not sick in the head, aren't you?

202
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:18,256
Can I finish their laps on their behalf?

203
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,360
Can you eat and sleep on their behalf?

204
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:26,760
-Sir!
-Speak.

205
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,730
I think there's a problem

206
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:31,809
with the squad's organizing method.

207
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,959
I request a new organizing method.

208
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:36,985
There's a problem with
the squad's organizing method?

209
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:41,536
You can organize the squad then!

210
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,160
I'll see how you can do a better job!

211
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,651
Come.

212
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,730
Everybody!

213
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:11,488
Follow my instructions if you wish
to finish your laps and eat!

214
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,000
I, and Xiao Yun Jie

215
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,448
will be your company commander
and vice company commander for now!

216
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:24,784
I need four platoon leaders!

217
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,040
Who's willing to take up the post?

218
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:30,927
Come on, my brothers!

219
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,559
I need volunteers!

220
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,072
This is a great opportunity!

221
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,439
You get to be the company commander
when you're just a new recruit!

222
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,000
No!

223
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,280
I meant platoon leader!
That's an important post too!

224
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:42,448
Good!

225
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,288
Platoon Leader One!

226
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,096
Platoon Leader One
didn't disappoint us indeed.

227
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,079
Platoon Leader One! Come here!

228
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,160
Right here! That's right!
Stand over here!

229
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,920
Just a little more. That's right!
This is the spot!

230
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,440
Are there any other volunteers?
We have three more slots!

231
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,679
Only three slots left!

232
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:56,306
Come on, raise your passionate hand!

233
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,384
Platoon Leader Two!

234
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,200
Platoon Leader Two, stand there!

235
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,040
That's the spot!

236
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:04,599
We have two more slots left!
This is your only opportunity!

237
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
Platoon Leader Three!
Platoon Leader Four!

238
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,173
-Hurry!
-We have enough!

239
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,439
Nice.

240
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,560
You guys didn't disappoint us.

241
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,000
Everyone expects
great things from you guys!

242
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,345
Platoon leaders, each of you may select
a squad leader and vice squad leader.

243
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,881
Remember, if someone in your squad

244
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,360
runs out of stamina,

245
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,885
you and the squad leader must ensure
he doesn't fall behind, even if it means

246
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,400
you have to carry them, understood?

247
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,295
Understood!

248
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,919
Hurry and move then!

249
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,879
Come on! Show us your passion!

250
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:32,144
You guys can do it!

251
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:33,474
So, these are our heroes.

252
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,841
Seems like we got
ourselves some heroes, huh?

253
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:38,672
Company commander? Platoon leaders?

254
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:40,674
Why don't you guys
be our generals while you're at it?

255
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,880
Squad Leader, you were the
one who told us to instruct them.

256
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,239
Besides, who cares about the ranks?

257
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,560
It's fine as long as
we can finish our laps.

258
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,081
My brothers! As long as you guys follow
Company Commander Yan's instruction,

259
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
you guys will have
a bright future ahead of you!

260
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,800
Let's go!

261
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,175
Let's go!

262
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,143
This is the best.

263
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:56,401
We can do it!

264
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,371
Get in line!

265
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,376
It's our first time being recruits.

266
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,479
It's the best, isn't it?

267
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,760
Yan, this is the best!

268
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,803
Shut up, Vice Company Commander!

269
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:05,987
Yes, sir!

270
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:10,513
Everybody!

271
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:13,755
Let's run!

272
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,079
One, two, one!

273
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,000
One, two, three, four!

274
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,239
One, two, three, four!

275
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,323
Squad Leader,

276
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,601
he's not an ordinary person.

277
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,040
He's actually using the reserve system
established during World War 2

278
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,719
to establish a temporary command system.

279
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,040
I don't care if it's World War 1 or 2.

280
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,272
He has no shame and
thinks he's a big shot here.

281
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:35,855
I'll look for the company commander.

282
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:43,119
One, two, one!

283
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,599
One, two, one!

284
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,948
One, two, three, four!

285
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,000
One, two, three, four!

286
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,640
One, two, three, four!

287
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,880
One, two, three, four!

288
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,079
One, two, three, four!

289
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,199
One, two, three, four!

290
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,656
He addressed himself as the company
commander and got himself an assistant.

291
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:08,073
Li,

292
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,680
this won't do.

293
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:10,920
You need to do something about him.

294
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,276
Do what?

295
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,319
Let them run.

296
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,721
Zhang Tian Yang.

297
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:17,359
Yes, sir.

298
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:18,671
Who recommended these two
to be enlisted in the army?

299
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:20,215
The local armed forces recommended them.

300
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:21,417
They said they had potential.

301
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,680
Staff Officer Zhang of the corps

302
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,640
visited him personally.

303
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:24,872
Where's Staff Officer Zhang?

304
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:25,920
He hasn't returned yet.

305
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,112
He went to Shanxi to receive
the second batch of recruits.

306
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:41,831
We can do it!

307
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:43,558
We can do it!

308
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,431
It smells so nice!
Did you guys smell that?

309
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:50,921
What did you smell?

310
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,839
-Yeah.
-The smell of mutton soup!

311
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,079
Not only are there
mutton cubes in the soup,

312
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:56,202
but there's chili too!

313
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,240
And, there's chili oil
on top of it too!

314
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,520
That's right!

315
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,439
The army cookhouse
had prepared mutton soup for us!

316
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,800
We can have it after we finish our laps!

317
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,239
-Do you guys want some mutton soup!
-Yes, we do!

318
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:06,760
-Do you guys want some mutton soup!
-Yes, we do!

319
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,416
If you wish to have it, follow my lead!

320
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,439
Charge!

321
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,920
Time to have mutton soup!

322
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,972
Wait up!

323
00:25:20,056 --> 00:25:21,643
I feel a pain in my chest!

324
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:24,487
We can do it!

325
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,839
Mutton soup!

326
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,959
Mutton soup!

327
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,386
Good!

328
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,920
We'll finish our tenth lap
after we cross the finish line!

329
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,920
-Hurry!
-Come on! Don't fall behind!

330
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:41,456
We can do it!

331
00:25:41,818 --> 00:25:43,217
People at the back, don't fall behind!

332
00:25:43,297 --> 00:25:44,098
You guys are great!

333
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:46,025
Come on! Stand up!

334
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,999
-You guys can do it!
-Walk one lap and cool down!

335
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,520
-Hurry up!
-Hurry.

336
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,759
Get up and take a stroll!

337
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:54,351
-Yan!
-Let's take a five-minute break!

338
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,760
After that, we'll dig in!

339
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,199
Dig in?

340
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,831
The training isn't over yet!

341
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:01,119
I can't do it anymore!

342
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,961
This has nothing to do
with the rest of you.

343
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:04,737
Only you two are involved.

344
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:06,345
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie.

345
00:26:07,998 --> 00:26:09,089
You guys are great runners, right?

346
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:10,589
Tell me then.

347
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:12,058
How many laps can you two run?

348
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,520
Squad Leader,

349
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,719
you're underestimating us.

350
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,160
We just finished warming up.

351
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:19,884
Stop boasting.

352
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:20,848
Squad Leader,

353
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:22,954
can we run a few more laps?

354
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:24,048
You want to run a few more laps?

355
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:25,275
No problem.

356
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:26,792
Go and get permission
from our company commander.

357
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,119
I wish to run of my own accord.

358
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,368
Why do I need the
company commander's permission?

359
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,239
You guys can dig in first!

360
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:36,481
We'll continue with our training!

361
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:39,370
They're still running?

362
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,640
Look. They're still running.

363
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,119
One, two, one!

364
00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:23,972
Send them some water.

365
00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:26,196
Let them rest after this lap.

366
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:31,839
Hello?

367
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,024
This is Chen Min Tao.

368
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,528
Head to the training ground

369
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:37,001
and send the two recruits
a box of mineral water and some food.

370
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:38,198
Do it immediately!

371
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:52,980
(After many years,)

372
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,669
(I finally realized something
after I became an officer myself.)

373
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:58,155
(If you're one step ahead of others,)

374
00:27:58,538 --> 00:27:59,612
(you're a genius.)

375
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:01,573
(If you're two steps ahead of others,)

376
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,370
(you're a lunatic.)

377
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:05,886
(Only geniuses will receive respect.)

378
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
(Isolation is the only thing
that embraces a lunatic.)

379
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:13,241
(Li Xiang had to make sure
that other people in the company)

380
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:15,377
(knew that we could be thirsty,)

381
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:16,675
(we could starve,)

382
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:18,800
(and we could be tired too.)

383
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:21,909
(Only then, everyone)

384
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,763
(will see us as humans)

385
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,612
(instead of demons.)

386
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
New squad leaders,

387
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:33,315
execute your respective training!

388
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,823
Squad Three! Quick march! About face!

389
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,925
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie, come out!

390
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:46,760
-Yan Po Yue!
-Yes, sir!

391
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,520
Right face!

392
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,105
About face!

393
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:56,825
Right face!

394
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:04,505
This is your first day being a recruit.

395
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:06,565
The military drill,

396
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,487
where did you learn them?

397
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:13,636
You wish to stay silent?

398
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:20,354
Very good.

399
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:30,972
At ease.

400
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,167
Take a break.

401
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,301
(I didn't answer the company commander)

402
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:40,079
(because I was still young back then.)

403
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:42,721
(I was so young that the only thing
I knew was protecting myself.)

404
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:47,239
(The best way to protect oneself
is to reject other people.)

405
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:49,379
(Such rejections)

406
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,894
(had made me the most mysterious
and dazzling recruit in the company.)

407
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:55,542
(Many people had asked me)

408
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:57,745
(why I could run so fast.)

409
00:29:58,970 --> 00:29:59,839
(Out of courtesy,)

410
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,347
(I told them)

411
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:04,292
(it was because
I loved the sound of the wind.)

412
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:08,386
Wait.

413
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,640
Yan, why can't I fold the corner neatly
no matter what I do?

414
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,756
Guys, you two are
already famous within our company.

415
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:18,074
You shouldn't put too much effort in
doing military housekeeping.

416
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,756
Military housekeeping represents
the style of the military.

417
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,722
If we don't put in any effort,
it'll ruin the military's image.

418
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:23,546
You can't be mighty at both
the pen and the sword.

419
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,079
You guys are already
excellent in being soldiers.

420
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,760
You should let other people
excel in doing military housekeeping.

421
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,439
You two are uncontested in this company,

422
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:31,448
except for The Dragon, Tiger, and Dog.

423
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:34,362
The Dragon, Tiger, and Dog?

424
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,959
Whose code names are those?

425
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:37,194
Who do you think?

426
00:30:37,466 --> 00:30:38,546
The Dragon, Tiger, and Dog.

427
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:39,369
Three of

428
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,105
the most revered people in this company.

429
00:30:41,178 --> 00:30:44,199
I only know that our
company commander is The Tiger.

430
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,928
Regarding The Dragon and The Dog,

431
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:48,047
I've never seen them personally,

432
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
especially The Dragon.

433
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:51,338
I heard that even the veterans here

434
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:53,544
fear The Dragon.

435
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:54,714
Most revered people?

436
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:56,128
Revered by whom?

437
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:57,570
I don't believe that.

438
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,162
We must meet them
when we have the chance.

439
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,680
Tian, find out
which company they're from.

440
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,714
No problem.

441
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,009
All new recruits,
gather in the corridor!

442
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,239
Get ready for housekeeping inspection!

443
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,105
My blanket is done for.

444
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,040
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie!

445
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,479
-Yes, sir!
-Come out!

446
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,495
Yes, sir!

447
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,159
Look at what you've done!

448
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:32,095
Your blanket looks like a turd!

449
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,680
Military formation on the outside,

450
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:49,417
military housekeeping on the inside.

451
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:50,667
Don't you two understand that?

452
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,217
The entire squad's performance
was affected because of you two!

453
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,449
Practice folding your blankets
outside the dorm!

454
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:57,531
Do it immediately!

455
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
-Company Commander!
-Speak!

456
00:31:58,802 --> 00:31:59,565
Yes, sir!

457
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,315
Yes, sir.

458
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,199
What do you think?

459
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,359
My goodness. My excellent buddies,

460
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,800
I didn't expect you two to resort
to such drastic measures.

461
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:21,400
How dare you two steal
a veteran's blanket?

462
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,319
Lu Xiao Tian, don't malign us.

463
00:32:23,418 --> 00:32:24,815
These were the blankets
we folded in the morning.

464
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:26,214
You're actually not ashamed
for saying that?

465
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:28,719
-This is better than our squad leader's.
-Is that so?

466
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,596
Xiao,

467
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:30,641
teach us.

468
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Buddy, please think twice.

469
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,800
You shouldn't do that.

470
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,640
This morning, our squad leader
said this looked like a turd.

471
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,199
But now, this looks entirely different.

472
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,000
You guys should think about it.

473
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,400
These aren't your blankets after all.

474
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,239
Lu Xiao Tian,
if these aren't our blankets,

475
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,680
whose blankets are these then?

476
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,600
-Attention!
-Squad Leader!

477
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:17,776
I became a squad leader

478
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,921
through hard work and effort.

479
00:33:21,176 --> 00:33:22,497
I became the squad leader
only for one thing.

480
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:25,120
I just wanted to train new recruits!

481
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,479
I wish to raise batches
of excellent recruits!

482
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,609
But in order to do so,

483
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:29,105
we need to get along.

484
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:30,705
That's the best situation.

485
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,399
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

486
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:35,745
Even though I was asking
if you guys had understood me,

487
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,497
I actually couldn't
understand it myself.

488
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,680
The two steel doors
behind the army cookhouse,

489
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,606
how did they go missing all of a sudden?

490
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:51,698
I'm your squad leader!

491
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
I'm not your parent!

492
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:58,105
Someone saw

493
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,199
you two moving the steel doors!

494
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,369
Where did you two keep them?

495
00:34:04,815 --> 00:34:05,976
Wait, Squad Leader.

496
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:07,987
Who told you that?

497
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,040
That's impossible.

498
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,719
-Besides, why should we do so?
-How dare you find excuses?

499
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:12,494
They're pretty heavy.

500
00:34:13,103 --> 00:34:14,143
They're useless to us.

501
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,612
Yan Po Yue!

502
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,995
Xiao Yun Jie!

503
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,472
Come out!

504
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,597
Come!

505
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,565
The case has been solved.

506
00:34:30,427 --> 00:34:31,370
Company Commander.

507
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:42,817
Who gave you two the guts

508
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,416
to remove the steel doors
that haven't been installed?

509
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,679
Who gave you two the guts to clamp
your blanket between the steel doors

510
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,959
and duped people of the vehicle company
to run over the doors twice?

511
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:54,890
Not only did you two
destroy military assets,

512
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:56,591
but you two also
deceived your superiors.

513
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,120
This is a serious issue!

514
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:00,424
What are you guys thinking?

515
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:01,800
Sir!

516
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,199
We thought the steel doors were scraps!

517
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,919
Are you blind?

518
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,719
Couldn't you tell the doors
were just repainted lately?

519
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,520
Sir! I'm not blind!

520
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,360
I did see the paint, but I didn't
know if it was old or new paint.

521
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,600
You couldn't differentiate
between old and new paint?

522
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Can you differentiate
between new recruits and veterans then?

523
00:35:25,946 --> 00:35:27,577
If you can do so,

524
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:29,179
you should know exactly

525
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,120
what you're supposed to do now.

526
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,081
Sir!

527
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,760
I came up with the idea myself.

528
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:35,347
It's none of his business.

529
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,360
Sir!

530
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,679
It was my idea!
It's none of his business.

531
00:35:46,026 --> 00:35:47,306
You two are united indeed.

532
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:50,777
I'm very touched by your unity.

533
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,040
If so, I'll give you guys another chance

534
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,399
to display your unity!

535
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,980
Move the steel doors
back to the army cookhouse!

536
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:02,879
Show the entire company
what you two have done!

537
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:09,698
We're here. Come.

538
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:12,925
Put it down.

539
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,480
Look at my hands.

540
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:25,841
Look at the red marks.

541
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:27,136
We still have some distance to go.

542
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,620
We can do it. Let's continue.

543
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,560
I can't take this anymore.

544
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,239
Our instructor said

545
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,159
this was a serious issue.

546
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,000
He said he will punish us.

547
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,239
That's fine. Just let him do it.

548
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:44,040
-I couldn't care less about that.
-The punishment will be recorded.

549
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:45,495
And it'll affect our record!

550
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,933
Hurry up!

551
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:52,331
Let me turn around. Here.

552
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,930
What the heck are we?

553
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,919
We should prove ourselves
with our training records.

554
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,560
What if the company commander
doesn't give us a chance?

555
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,879
So what if he doesn't give us a chance?

556
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,879
If he doesn't give us a chance...

557
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:04,959
One, two, three, four!

558
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,840
One, two, three!

559
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,919
Look over there.

560
00:37:07,097 --> 00:37:07,817
Did you see that?

561
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,190
Three, four!

562
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,679
One, two, three, four!

563
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,954
That female officer looks beautiful.

564
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:17,113
Is this your first time seeing a woman?

565
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:18,683
Let's go.

566
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,120
Not bad at all.

567
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,089
So, you guys aren't dead yet?

568
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:31,674
I was a new recruit myself.

569
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:35,360
That captain's name is Ai Qian Xue.

570
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:37,604
She's one of our staff officers.

571
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:41,737
Just now,

572
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,881
you two

573
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:45,728
weren't being loud enough.

574
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,784
I think

575
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:50,284
she didn't

576
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:53,600
hear you guys.

577
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:57,167
-Zhang Tian Yang!
-Yes, sir!

578
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,560
-Gather around!
-Yes, sir!

579
00:37:58,921 --> 00:37:59,972
Halt!

580
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:02,337
With Squad Leader as your center,
dress center, dress!

581
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,561
Eyes front!

582
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:06,761
Xiao Yun Jie.

583
00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:07,815
Yes, sir.

584
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,987
Repeat

585
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:10,933
what you had said just now.

586
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:18,526
Hurry!
