1
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,120
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:31,040
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,680
(Episode 34)

4
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
Cops.

5
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,520
Are you insane?

6
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
What really is inside that box?

7
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,920
You know what's in it.

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,440
If you don't tell me
what the real mission is,

9
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,920
I'll go back right now.

10
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,640
Routine inspection.

11
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,440
Please get out of the car
and show us your ID.

12
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,720
Hi, mister. Please open your trunk.

13
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Stand here.

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,840
Turn around.

15
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
Turn around.

16
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,000
Here's your ID.

17
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,760
Open the door.

18
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,520
Please open your bag for us.

19
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Open it.

20
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,240
Clear.

21
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,840
You two may be aces here,

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,039
but when I go home, I'll be ace too.

23
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
Right? Just wait and see.

24
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,960
When I go home this time,

25
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,039
I'll make my mark
in the business circle.

26
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
What's your plan after you go home?

27
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,480
As the saying goes,

28
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,398
big fish won't stay in
a small pond forever,

29
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm bound to build a great business.

30
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,280
Check this out.

31
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,293
You really grew it.

32
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,519
Of course.

33
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,079
This is what I've been working on
over the past two years.

34
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,033
Saffron.

35
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,640
My parents have tried it.

36
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,479
It's good for blood circulation.

37
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,440
It protects the liver
and relieves depression.

38
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,200
My mum said it has
beautification effect too.

39
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,799
When I go home,
with the connections we built in army,

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,428
plus the funds I got at home,

41
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:23,586
setting up a few saffron farming bases
shouldn't be problem.

42
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,920
Military-grade competence.

43
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
I'll get on Forbes soon.

44
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Honestly, I might not have time
to see you by then.

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,720
But it's fine, I'll save a slot
for you in my busy schedule.

46
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:32,599
Good!

47
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,360
If I have no place to
go after I get discharged,

48
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,040
I'll have to count on you, Mr. Lu.

49
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,641
Yan, when you get discharged,

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
come find me. I got your back.

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
Just now,

52
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,240
you weren't clear enough

53
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,000
when you called me Mr. Lu.

54
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
Call me Mr. Lu again.

55
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,160
Come. As you wish!

56
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,399
Is this what you want?

57
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,720
It's still the familiar force.

58
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Strong!

59
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:01,373
Stop joking now.

60
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,320
No one can hit me anymore
when I go home.

61
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,640
It's enough. Enough.

62
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,520
Since you're so capable,

63
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,280
I'll leave the rest to you.

64
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:50,072
What are you doing?

65
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,681
Leave it in a crowded place.

66
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Chinese soldiers have
made us suffer a lot,

67
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,200
we have to pay them back.

68
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you insane?

69
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Chinese soldiers make you suffer,

70
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,120
not me.

71
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,159
I'm here to make money.

72
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
I won't kill for no reason.

73
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:06,873
If you don't do it,

74
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,200
I'll see you as an undercover cop.

75
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,481
You're crazy.

76
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,319
Did you think Red Scorpion
is that easy to join?

77
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,880
Do you think you can leave
here alive if you don't do it?

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,601
I need to stay alive to
spend the money I earn.

79
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,001
You didn't even give me a dime.

80
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,961
Why should I be your scapegoat?

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,040
(There is bomb in Mengjiang County's
public place. Urgent!)

82
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:09,359
Yan,

83
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
you can go back now.

84
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,920
Be good in the army.

85
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,839
Come find me after you're discharged.

86
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,919
I'll arrange a job for you.

87
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,121
Keep in touch, Mr. Lu.

88
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,160
Please look after me.

89
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,399
I'm afraid that

90
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,200
I may get too busy when I go home.

91
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,679
What if I forget you?

92
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,279
My memory is not good either.

93
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
Well, I'll just leave you here then.

94
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:30,904
Come on, Yan. You're funny.

95
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,000
Attention, someone has
put explosives in public place.

96
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,599
Stop right there!

97
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
Check that trash can!

98
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,320
He's making trouble.

99
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
Bomb!

100
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,399
Bomb!

101
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
It's him! Don't let him get away!

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,160
Bomb!

103
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,600
Bomb!

104
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,679
I'm PAP.

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,120
I'll take care of the bomb.

106
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,401
Evacuate the people now.

107
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,280
Okay.

108
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,960
Bomb! Hurry!

109
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,920
Bomb!

110
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,479
Yan,

111
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,039
-do you know how to defuse it?
-I took the class.

112
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,280
Do you have scissors?
Pliers is fine too.

113
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,880
Will this do?

114
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,799
It has to.

115
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,600
It stopped.

116
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,039
Are they done?

117
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,239
Did they defuse it?

118
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm telling you,

119
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,920
if you still can't defuse it

120
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,480
when it reaches 30 seconds,

121
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,920
I'm definitely going to run.

122
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Thank you for

123
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,960
not letting me face this test.

124
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm bound to fail it.

125
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:07,119
-Why are we still not allowed in?
-What's going on?

126
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
Didn't you defuse it already?

127
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,760
Stay away!

128
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,999
Is there any other way?

129
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,719
Complete the mission.

130
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,079
Go back alive.

131
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,586
Complete the mission. Go back alive.

132
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,401
Complete the mission. Go back alive.

133
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,480
Complete the mission. Go back alive.

134
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,440
(Fire Exit)

135
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,360
Xiao Tian,

136
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,000
just go.

137
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,480
Yan,

138
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,880
you've always got my back,

139
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
today, I got yours!

140
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,440
Xiao Tian!

141
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
-Which way?
-This way.

142
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,919
The report shows that

143
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,880
his internal organs were damaged,
there was major trauma on his abdomen.

144
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,561
He died on the spot.

145
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,240
Has his unit been informed?

146
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,720
What about the suspect? Is he caught?

147
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,679
Not yet.

148
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,919
Yan Po Yue.

149
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,680
Yan Po Yue,

150
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,359
the police would like

151
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,960
to talk to you.

152
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,897
This is very critical to

153
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,360
help the capture of the suspect.

154
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,720
Lu Xiao Tian!

155
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,519
Lu Xiao Tian!

156
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,281
He hasn't finished his work.
Where is he?

157
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:02,746
Are you slacking off here?

158
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,480
I just planted the seeds a week ago.

159
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,112
Are you playing with your saffron again?

160
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,359
Yan,

161
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,920
this is the last time
I came to see them.

162
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,479
I'll leave them

163
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,320
to your care from now on.

164
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,481
Are you going somewhere?

165
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,841
The book says

166
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,559
tomorrow is too far,

167
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,439
we have to take action today.

168
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,119
I should go now.

169
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:49,454
What book?

170
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,000
Where are you going?

171
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,160
You'll see my name on the Forbes list!

172
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,920
Report, sir.

173
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,880
Enter.

174
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,639
Captain,

175
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:27,142
he's here.

176
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,160
You may leave.

177
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,159
Yes, sir.

178
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:41,059
Yan Po Yue,

179
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,434
this is Lu Xiao Tian's mother.

180
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,280
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity, sir.

181
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,440
Xiao Tian always told me
on the phone that

182
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,439
you were his best friend in the army.

183
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,680
The leaders have told me about

184
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,359
what happened.

185
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,770
Xiao Tian was protecting the people,

186
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,440
that's how he...

187
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,160
Aunt,

188
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,454
he not only protected the people,

189
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:35,564
he also protected me.

190
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,032
He saved my life.

191
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,360
I should've been the one to do it.

192
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I should've been the one to defuse it.

193
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,285
It should've been me.

194
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:49,511
Boy,

195
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:51,072
get up.

196
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:52,404
Get up.

197
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,599
I don't blame you.

198
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,640
It's not your fault.

199
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,279
I just want to know,

200
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:02,676
did Xiao Tian say any last words?

201
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,000
He said

202
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,479
you've always

203
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,560
got my back,

204
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,240
today,

205
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,359
I got yours.

206
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,600
My son.

207
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,119
My son.

208
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
I know that

209
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,080
the moment he put on the uniform,

210
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:05,200
he was a soldier of the country.

211
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,080
Whenever there is danger,

212
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:09,485
he should be at the front.

213
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,721
Thank you for cultivating him.

214
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,760
I would like to ask you for a favour.

215
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,240
This is Xiao Tian's diary.

216
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:31,097
I was wondering if you could

217
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,200
copy his handwriting

218
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,240
and write a letter to his father.

219
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,640
Just say his discharge
has been postponed.

220
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,920
He can't go home for now.

221
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
I don't know what else is there to say.

222
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,680
I don't think you can
hide this from him.

223
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,760
I've been keeping Xiao Tian in the dark.

224
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:56,920
His father was diagnosed
with liver cancer a year ago.

225
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,959
He is now living on chemotherapy.

226
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:05,288
His father has come so far

227
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,479
because he has been waiting

228
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,599
for his son to come home to him.

229
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,201
If he

230
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,600
sees me

231
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,000
come home with only a cold medal,

232
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,079
the consequence

233
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,480
will be unthinkable.

234
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,719
Please,

235
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,521
I'm begging you.

236
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,560
Mrs. Lu,

237
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,920
I understood.

238
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,199
Thank you.

239
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,000
Thank you.

240
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Let me walk you out.

241
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,760
Thank you.

242
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,240
I knew this day would come,

243
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,199
I just didn't expect that

244
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,160
it would come so soon.

245
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,840
You can keep the diary.

246
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:51,949
Remember,

247
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,561
make sure to copy
Xiao Tian's handwriting.

248
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,240
While you're working on the letter,

249
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,760
I'll consider it as you're on leave.

250
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,421
When you finish the letter,

251
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,000
go out and take a trip.

252
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,920
Do whatever you want.

253
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,080
(Legacy of Lu.)

254
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,600
(To my descendants and admirers.)

255
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,400
(A diary about my success as a soldier.)

256
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,487
(Lu Xiao Tian, male, the first Chinese
to get on Forbes in the future.)

257
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,400
(September 1st, Friday, Sunny.)

258
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,119
(I received the letter of enlistment
from the armed police forces today.)

259
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,600
(My father was overjoyed.)

260
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,678
(He bought drinks for all
the workers in his factory.)

261
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,640
(All our neighbours
came to congratulate me.)

262
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:55,626
(This is the first time
I gained so much respect for my family.)

263
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:57,046
(When I go to the army,)

264
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
(I'm going to bring them more glory.)

265
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,360
(The book says that)

266
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,479
(people must have a dream,)

267
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,440
(who knows maybe
one day it will come true.)

268
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,160
(September 5th, Tuesday, Sunny.)

269
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,880
(My first day in the army
was a disaster.)

270
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,439
(I met the most horrible leader here.)

271
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,521
(Super Psycho King.)

272
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,760
(He just asked us to run 5 km.)

273
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,169
(I've never run 5 km in my life.)

274
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,840
(What's even more amazing)

275
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,040
(is that I befriended two wild donkeys.)

276
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,760
(One is called Yan Po Yue,)

277
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,680
(the other one is Xiao Yun Jie.)

278
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,680
(Lu Xiao Tian, you're the best!)

279
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,520
(The book says)

280
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,760
(today is cruel,)

281
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,721
(tomorrow is crueller,)

282
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,560
(the day after tomorrow is beautiful.)

283
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,640
(But most people die
at the night of tomorrow.)

284
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,400
(They can't even see
the sunrise next day.)

285
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,880
(After these two donkeys
finished the 5km,)

286
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,760
(they actually requested to run more.)

287
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:03,747
(What's wrong with them?)

288
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,400
(I'll see if they can live
until tomorrow.)

289
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,240
The public security bureau
sent a letter to our detachment.

290
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,880
They commended on Yan Po Yue's
courageous action.

291
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,640
The higher-ups have decided to award
Yan Po Yue a second-class merit.

292
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,920
I hope this will give him
some consolation.

293
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,680
We'll do this.

294
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
Give it to him a few days later.

295
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,519
By the way, I heard that you
gave him Lu Xiao Tian's diary.

296
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:44,604
You even asked him

297
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,165
to copy Xiao Tian's handwriting
and write his father a letter.

298
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,046
That's right.

299
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,106
Don't you think it's a bad idea?

300
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:50,479
He was at the scene, after all.

301
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,760
What he needs now is counselling.

302
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,681
If he can't get through this,

303
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,530
he won't become a real cheetah.

304
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,800
But this isn't easy to get through.

305
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,119
How many of today's kids
can become like us back then?

306
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,401
Liu,

307
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,480
if you keep treating them like children,
when are they going to grow up?

308
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,040
Speaking of which,

309
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:09,707
when he finishes the letter,

310
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm going to let him take a long break.

311
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,560
He needs to make peace
with his emotions.

312
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,640
(Uncle Qiao said that)

313
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,079
(everything you do will be connected
dot by dot into a line in the end.)

314
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,239
(I was assigned to the kitchen squad.)

315
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,439
(Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie
are furious.)

316
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,520
(But it's exactly what I wanted.)

317
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,520
(I mean, it's the kitchen squad.)

318
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,800
(That means I'll get to be the first
to enjoy all the good food and drinks.)

319
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,319
(And I don't need to do
this training that's killing me.)

320
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,719
(And no combat missions either.)

321
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:51,800
(Although pouring slop and
chopping onions could be a little hard,)

322
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,720
(compared to 5km run,)

323
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,279
(these are nothing.)

324
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,760
(Lu Xiao Tian, you can do it!)

325
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,920
Strongest Yan,

326
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,280
you're the coolest!

327
00:29:09,388 --> 00:29:10,599
Carry the slop!

328
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,920
Work harder!

329
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,239
Strongest Yan!

330
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,320
(December 16, Monday, Rainy.)

331
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,560
(Yesterday,)

332
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,400
(I experienced life and death
for the first time in my life.)

333
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,680
(The moment I saw the blood,)

334
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:26,652
(I felt dizzy.)

335
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,840
-Hang in there.
-Lu Xiao Tian, the flash light.

336
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,200
(I really admire Yan Po Yue
and Xiao Yun Jie.)

337
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,479
(They weren't nervous at all
when they faced the robbers.)

338
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,720
(I wish I can be half as brave...)

339
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,720
(No.)

340
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,200
(I wish I had even
a tenth of their courage.)

341
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,640
(You can do it, Lu Xiao Tian.)

342
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,319
You're torturing him.

343
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,840
It's like you're ripping his wounds
open over and over again.

344
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,400
He'll have a breakdown
if you keep this up.

345
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,760
-He won't.
-Won't he?

346
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:10,440
Back then...

347
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,280
When Xiang Fei died back then,

348
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,961
how long did it take us to get over it?

349
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,480
I want him to appreciate
the preciousness of his comrade.

350
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,720
I want him to carve the
pain of loss into this heart.

351
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,680
Only then

352
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,199
can he truly grow up.

353
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,720
Only then would Lu Xiao Tian's
death be meaningful.

354
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,280
-But...
-Report, sir!

355
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,119
Enter!

356
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,280
Captain.

357
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,899
Squadron Leader Lu, you're here too.

358
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,319
-I heard you...
-I gave Lu Xiao Tian's diary

359
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,479
to Yan Po Yue.

360
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,800
Don't you think this is too much?

361
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,760
See,

362
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm not the only one who
thinks this is improper.

363
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:55,120
After all, this is the first time
Yan Po Yue lost...

364
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:56,360
We all have a first time!

365
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,633
(Fan taught me and Yan
to play slingshot today.)

366
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,841
(Yan is so good at it.)

367
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,520
(He learned every skill
in just one afternoon.)

368
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,199
(Kitchen squad had a match today.)

369
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,600
(With Yan,)

370
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,200
(we not only won the first place,)

371
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,680
(we also left a famous dish
to the squad,)

372
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,520
(braised tofu.)

373
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,760
(When we compete again in the future,)

374
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,560
(everyone will definitely
come to have our tofu.)

375
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:34,200
(Yan, keep it up.)

376
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,400
Yan Po Yue,

377
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,000
proper breathing is important
when you run!

378
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,680
Your breathing is irregular right now.

379
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,880
Stop pushing yourself!

380
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,641
I'm on leave now.

381
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,120
I can do whatever I want!

382
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,080
Right, right.

383
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,360
You're on leave indeed.

384
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,840
I've trained all day.

385
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,080
I even strained my knee ligament.

386
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,680
If you want,

387
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,760
I'll just keep running with you!

388
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,520
I'm not thirsty.

389
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,519
It's Cola.

390
00:33:08,992 --> 00:33:10,320
It's in the bottle for a long time.

391
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,320
Its fizz ran out.

392
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,841
Leng Bing liked to drink Cola too.

393
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,600
After she died,

394
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
I tried many ways to forget.

395
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,840
The pain felt like

396
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,600
my whole body was stuck in a swamp.

397
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,000
I was surrounded by darkness.

398
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,400
The more I struggled,

399
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,760
the more I couldn't breathe.

400
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,680
I couldn't tell others
about that feeling.

401
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,239
Once you say it,

402
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,920
it'll only make you feel more weak.

403
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,838
And then?

404
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,359
How did you get over it?

405
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,800
There's no need to get over it.

406
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,559
Because she's always there.

407
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,479
She wouldn't let me cry,

408
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,240
wouldn't let me lose.

409
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,479
She always wanted me to smile.

410
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,359
In fact, to me,

411
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,040
every one of our fallen comrades

412
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,320
has never really left us.

413
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,160
As time passes, you'll realise that

414
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,840
their habits will become your habits.

415
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,560
Whether it's on the battlefield,

416
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,720
or on the training ground,

417
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,480
you'll feel like you can
still see them there.

418
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,120
(Dad,)

419
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,000
(Mum,)

420
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,999
(I received an order
before my discharge.)

421
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,840
(I received a sudden order
from my superior.)

422
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,960
(I'm going on a mission.)

423
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,840
(You're looking forward
for me to come home, right?)

424
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,281
(But I have to follow orders.)

425
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,480
(I may be gone for a long time.)

426
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,800
(But I want to become a hero.)

427
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,840
(Ever since I joined the army,)

428
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,920
(I always thought
our training was hard,)

429
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,185
(and I always slacked off.)

430
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,040
(It's really hard.)

431
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,520
(But looking at my comrades
who are growing up fast day by day,)

432
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,520
(watching them never give up
and fight to the end,)

433
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:19,772
(I feel ashamed of myself.)

434
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,440
(After that, my squad leader told me
that this is called military spirit.)

435
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,399
(Once a solider, always a soldier.)

436
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,800
(Dad,)

437
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:27,799
(Mum,)

438
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,760
(wait for the good news
of my meritorious service.)

439
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,281
You're on a long break now.

440
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,480
When are you leaving?

441
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,439
I'm not leaving.

442
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,439
Go out and take a trip.

443
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Go home.

444
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,560
If you can't get over it,

445
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,761
it'll always be stuck there.

446
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,080
Go home.

447
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,640
Visit your parents who miss you.

448
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,160
In order not to break their heart,

449
00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:11,901
you must live.

450
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,360
This is how I get through.

451
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,240
I still haven't moved on from the pain.

452
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,840
Thank you.

453
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,120
Hang in there.

454
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,840
You must've

455
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
put in a lot of efforts.

456
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,960
It does look like his handwriting.

457
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,280
Captain Qin,

458
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,040
I'd like to go home and visit my family.

459
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,880
You're already on leave,

460
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,280
you can decide on your own.

461
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:34,045
I'll be back in a week.

462
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,880
Whatever you want.

463
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,680
Yue!

464
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:52,213
Aunt Pei.

465
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Yue,

466
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,945
You... When did you get home?

467
00:39:58,087 --> 00:39:58,926
I just got here.

468
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,120
You... You see,

469
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,279
now that you're home,
why aren't you going upstairs?

470
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,040
Really, you. Let me
help you with the bag.

471
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
It's okay. I can manage.

472
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,120
Look at you,

473
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,360
you should've told us
you were coming home.

474
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:09,320
Your dad and I could've picked you up.

475
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,160
Let's go.

476
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,159
Come on. Let's go home now.

477
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,040
This is wonderful.

478
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,480
I didn't expect
you would come home today.

479
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,081
Yan, look who's home!

480
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,560
Come in now, hurry.

481
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,960
Come in.

482
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,880
Why are you home all of a sudden?

483
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
-I'm on leave.
-Come in now.

484
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,600
Come in.

485
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,840
Come.

486
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,360
The kid has finally come home.

487
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Talk nicely.

488
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,200
I was in the army once too.

489
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:55,200
There isn't any holiday.
Why would he be on leave?

490
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,920
When he wasn't home,

491
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,254
you missed him a lot.

492
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,280
Now that he's back,

493
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,799
can't you just talk nicely to him?

494
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,040
Did you get in trouble again?

495
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,520
Alright now.

496
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,640
Come to the kitchen
and help me with the fish.

497
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,520
Come on.

498
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,880
Let's go now.

499
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,561
Yue, sit down first.

500
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,200
Have some fruits.

501
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,039
Take a break.

502
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,200
Dinner will be ready soon.

503
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,080
Dad, Aunt Pei,

504
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm done.

505
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Shouldn't you have more?

506
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,880
Why don't you call the army

507
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,783
and find out what happened?

508
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,999
I called them.

509
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,880
Would I have allowed him
to have dinner if I hadn't?

510
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,361
So, what is really going on?

511
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,361
He did a courageous deed
when he was out on leave.

512
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,880
He helped the public security bureau
dispose of a bomb.

513
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,520
He was awarded a second-class merit.

514
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,760
That's a good thing.

515
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,880
One of his comrades was killed.

516
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,880
Due to mishandling of bomb.

517
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,040
That boy was a year younger than him.

518
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,800
He was just discharged
from the army the day he died.

519
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,321
Oh God.

520
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,000
Did you have enough for dinner?

521
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,200
Yes.

522
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:47,348
Drink with me then.
