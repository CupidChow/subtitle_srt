1
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,105
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:30,985
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,600
(Episode 30)

4
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:36,432
I guess you're the only person
who can say such high-sounding words

5
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,960
while keeping a straight face.

6
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,559
The Cheetah Commando
is always known as the Knife.

7
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,239
We can learn a lot of things
from each other through this drill.

8
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,080
It's good.

9
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,440
Three Shells Qin.

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,120
I know you well.

11
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,480
You turned down airborne forces

12
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,919
and purposely applied
to have lunch at our place.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,041
You merely want
to bring your subordinates here

14
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,360
to check out the command post.

15
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:01,559
Hide and seek is a game for children.

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,921
Attack is the best form of defence.

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,840
Three Shells.

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,160
Drinking old wine from
a new bottle is not fun.

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,119
It depends on whose wine is that.

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,200
Look at your people. Can they stop us?

21
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,320
This is a friendly reminder.

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,867
When the drill starts,

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
tell your men to take it easy.

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,295
Don't let them rush towards death.

25
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,559
The drill had just started

26
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,919
but you'd suffered 50% damage
from the enemy's assault.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,123
You experienced that before, right?

28
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:27,600
I...

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
Take it easy, okay?

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,800
The command post,
Information Automation Center.

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
Communication Station,
Ammunition Depot, helipad.

32
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,520
Captain,

33
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,639
when we're on our way here,

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
we've memorised the places.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,639
Do you have any new idea?

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,985
I need your help.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,080
Let's make a good start.

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,879
His eyes are glowing.

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,480
He must be up to no good again.

40
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,360
Soldiers.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,360
This is the last hot meal available.

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,639
Do you need anything else?

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,640
We're good. Thank you.

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,800
All of you are good, right?

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,441
We'll win for sure.

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,240
Look at the ground.

47
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,041
It's been raining non-stop for a week.

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,279
The ground has become soft.

49
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,759
They only have two hours.

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,200
How far can these Cheetahs go?

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,908
Even if they can
wipe off the footprints,

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,479
they'll nonetheless
leave a trail behind.

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,001
Furthermore,

54
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,039
it's only two hours.

55
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,080
Be it by helicopter or off-road vehicle,

56
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,514
we'll reach there in a blink of an eye.

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,320
They can't go anywhere.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,200
Buddy.

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,040
Is your rifle
equipped with real ammunition?

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
Why aren't you talking?

61
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,240
Is this how you treat your comrades?

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,120
Come on, let me take a look.

63
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,200
What are you doing?

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,480
The rifle is equipped with real bullets!

65
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,559
You should've told me earlier.

66
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,840
We wouldn't have to come this far
if you told me earlier.

67
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,360
Stop pointing the rifle at me.

68
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,199
You...

69
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,119
Is the firing pin block intact?

70
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,720
What if your rifle
discharges by accident?

71
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,559
It's not good if you
accidentally hurt innocent people.

72
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,119
This is just a drill. Relax.

73
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,239
Xiao, don't interfere with his work.

74
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:20,479
See you later.

75
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,320
All the best.

76
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,681
I'm sorry!

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,319
I'm back.

78
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:11,272
What's wrong?
Did you leave something behind?

79
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,879
No.

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,280
It's just that...

81
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
I've missed you.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,600
I mean it.

83
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,321
I was in the detachment.

84
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:20,005
I started here.

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,359
I was in Special Service Company before.

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,759
Which company are you in?

87
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,040
Go now! We're enemies now.

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,838
Enemies?

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,400
Fine.

90
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,440
Are you startled?

91
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
It's not a grenade.

92
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
What does that mean?

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
You'll see.

94
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:13,621
Take a close look.

95
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,119
(Don't cross the line)
According to the rules of the drill,

96
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,961
you have one hour and 35 minutes to go

97
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:19,793
before you're allowed
to cross this line.

98
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,959
Otherwise,

99
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
you're considered as breaking the rules.

100
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,601
What do you want?

101
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,560
Nothing.

102
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,921
I just want to remind you

103
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,679
that besides being
a disciplined soldier,

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,480
you should also be a good person
who is honest and trustworthy.

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,239
For the sake
of Blue Team's honour and dignity,

106
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,160
if anyone ever tries
to go against the drill rules

107
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,923
and attempts to leave the barracks
before the right time,

108
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,560
as a squad leader,

109
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,641
you must stick to your post
and stop them at all cost.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,839
Don't ever let any bad guys

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,241
cross this white line.

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,281
Mind your own business.

113
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,279
I won't go against the rules for sure.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,801
Can you guarantee that
both you and your men

115
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,961
will not break the rules

116
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,119
and cross that white line in advance?

117
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,001
I can guarantee that!

118
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,640
Very well!

119
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,479
I'm relieved then.

120
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,840
My grenade launcher
is loaded with drill rounds

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,480
but your guns are loaded
with real bullets.

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,360
Don't point the rifle at me.

123
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,599
It's quite scary.

124
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Can you see this?

125
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,119
It's fake.

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,080
It won't explode.

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,280
This image is from half an hour ago.

128
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,240
Ask the guards at the base entrance

129
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,401
if everything is all right.

130
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,400
Yes!

131
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,961
Report!

132
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,001
Nothing.

133
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,920
A member of Cheetah Special Forces

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
has been fooling at the entrance
for a while.

135
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,000
But the time is not yet up,

136
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,196
we can't do anything to him.

137
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,678
The wind speed is 0.4 slap,

138
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,841
the distance is 375.20 yuan.

139
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,358
Stay alert!

140
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,039
(Don't cross the line)
Don't cross the line!

141
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,280
Don't cross the line.

142
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,560
I'm doing this for your own good.

143
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,559
If you cross the line out of impulse,

144
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,201
you'll lose your qualification
to take part in the drill.

145
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,720
It's not worth it.

146
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,721
Look.

147
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:02,092
Take a look at the back.

148
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,239
Take a look.

149
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,119
Can you see that?

150
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,361
There's only smoke.

151
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
I can assure you that it won't explode.

152
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,399
Things will be different
if it hits someone.

153
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,840
Don't you dare to fire the rifle
for another time!

154
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,441
I'll do it now!

155
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,239
You...

156
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,840
I'm just kidding with you.

157
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
There are only two shots available.

158
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:29,987
It's empty.

159
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,961
Take a look.

160
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,560
-Let me show you.
-Yan Po Yue!

161
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,638
You may not have seen
this kind of rifle before.

162
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,640
Yan Po Yue!

163
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,920
Chief!

164
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,960
What are you doing?

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Please take a look.

166
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
You may not have seen it
clearly just now.

167
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:46,641
Let me demonstrate again.

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,975
Do not cross the line.

169
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:56,753
My dear Chief,

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,159
the drill hasn't started yet.

171
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,880
You must set a good example
of complying with the rules.

172
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,680
Do not cross the line!

173
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,079
What on earth is going on?

174
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,160
Liu, don't be mad.

175
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,679
The drill has not started yet.

176
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,840
The grenade
is not taken into consideration.

177
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,881
According to the drill rules,

178
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
the Red Team are given an hour

179
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,999
to regroup inside the campsite.

180
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,052
But look at them.

181
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,960
To them, the drill

182
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,000
has already started!

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,039
The Blue Team, on the other hand,

184
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,599
can only go after them two hours later.

185
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,280
Yan Po Yue

186
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,239
made good use of the time gap

187
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,841
and took advantage of the loophole!

188
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
That's why he dared
to stand at the entrance

189
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
and launched a grenade

190
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,840
to bombard the military helicopter!

191
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
What purpose do you serve?

192
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,400
Are you blind?

193
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,000
Why didn't you stop him?

194
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,960
Liu.

195
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,300
You can't put the blame on the guards.

196
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,199
They're merely sentinels.

197
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,320
They have eight main duties.

198
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:52,040
The sixth is

199
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,280
properly handle a situation and
report it in a timely manner on duty.

200
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,760
The guards were determining

201
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,400
the danger level of
Yan Po Yue's behaviour

202
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,359
and dealing with it

203
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,840
before reporting it to their superiors.

204
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,000
This is the correct process.

205
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
I got it.

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
(Blue Team's commander,)

207
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,320
(your helicopter squadron
has to quit the drill.)

208
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,159
(The fuel supply vehicle
was bombarded by a fire bomb.)

209
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,560
Roger.

210
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,201
The flight crew and the ground crew

211
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:20,373
may stop preparing.

212
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,799
They're dismissed.

213
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,840
They're not taking part
in the drill anymore.

214
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,801
Chief.

215
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,040
-This...
-Cut the crap.

216
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,000
Just now, the grenade
fired by Yan Po Yue

217
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,640
has caused the destruction
of all the entire team

218
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,000
due to fuel explosion.

219
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,681
The person in charge told us

220
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,598
that his smoking grenade

221
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,280
was a fire bomb.

222
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,794
Do you know what does that mean?

223
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,479
If this was a real battle,

224
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,960
our helicopter gunships

225
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,121
would have been wiped out

226
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,320
due to that grenade!

227
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
Got it.

228
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:50,719
This is merely a drill.

229
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,280
No doubt Yan Po Yue had
taken advantage of the time gap,

230
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,679
but it's also proven

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,760
that there are defence loopholes

232
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,160
at the base camp of the
Rapid Deployment Brigade.

233
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,160
The future of warfare

234
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,880
will be a combination of efficiency,
sudden occurrence and camouflage.

235
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,039
Our enemies

236
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,326
could be women

237
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,640
or even children.

238
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,239
If they are intelligent
and well disguised,

239
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,400
they can distract the sentinels
and lower their guards.

240
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
It'll cause our troop

241
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,640
to suffer from unbearable damage.

242
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,920
Chief.

243
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,921
The Red Team attacked us with a grenade.

244
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,640
They started the battle ahead of time.

245
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,681
The Blue Team can seek permission
from the conducting team

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,480
to launch an attack against
the Red Team right away.

247
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,838
Contact the conducting team now.

248
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,559
Yes!

249
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:35,586
The Cheetah has put us in trouble.

250
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,361
If we let them escape,

251
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,080
we'd better kill ourselves!

252
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,200
Lie down!

253
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,240
Yan Po Yue!

254
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,960
Yan Po Yue!

255
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,640
Don't shoot.

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,880
Brat.

257
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,280
Aren't you a runner?

258
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,039
Keep running.

259
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,880
We have three squadrons nearby.

260
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,840
You can't escape!

261
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,439
Lu.

262
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,719
He released smoke bomb
to quit from the drill.

263
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,401
Our location might have been exposed.

264
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,640
The ground reconnaissance squad
has chanced upon the Red Team.

265
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,600
(Calling Squad One!)

266
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,800
Roger. Please speak.

267
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:38,152
(Head immediately to Zone 3
where the signal is located)

268
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,520
(and conduct a blanket search.)

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,720
Yes!

270
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,840
Let's go.

271
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,159
The rainy weather

272
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,887
will continue off and on for
at least another three to five days.

273
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,400
At night,

274
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,001
as the ground temperature decreases,

275
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,240
once the rain stops,

276
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,560
the ground will be covered in fog
in a short time.

277
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,920
Therefore,

278
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,999
the Red Team

279
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,639
may launch an attack tonight.

280
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,519
Yes.

281
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
It's drizzling out there

282
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,881
but the Red Team is not familiar
with the surroundings as we are.

283
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,320
They don't dare to go to any place

284
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,640
where they can shelter from the rain,

285
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,280
let alone set up tents at night.

286
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,479
No doubt they're
the most outstanding special forces

287
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,039
and they're good
at surviving in the wild,

288
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,761
but in such a harsh environment,

289
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,919
they will also be losing their strength.

290
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,119
The Blue Team, on the other hand,

291
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,879
is stationed at the base camp.

292
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,560
It's safe to say
that we're not affected at all.

293
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,640
If I were Three Shells Qin,

294
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:32,447
I would never allow a situation

295
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,559
where the enemy has the upper
hand over our troops to go on.

296
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,559
Am I right?

297
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,400
Yes!

298
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,039
Something is going on in the north-west.

299
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,279
The Blue Team supply depot
is not far away.

300
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,400
It is about 300 metres
to the north-west.

301
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,080
Something is not right.

302
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,760
The location of the supply depot
is too obvious.

303
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm afraid it's a trap.

304
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,281
Captain,

305
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,080
I seek permission to recce the area.

306
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,679
Alright. Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie,

307
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,840
you two go ahead and recce the area.

308
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,520
Got it.

309
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,919
Guo Xiao Xiao and Yue Kong, cover them.

310
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,599
-Yes.
-Yes.

311
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,200
Let's go.

312
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,639
(Attention, A05.)

313
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,919
There is a stationed sentry

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,760
on your one o'clock.

315
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,910
There are two mobile sentry squads
of four sentries each. Over.

316
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,760
(Roger.)

317
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:48,679
A05, the two mobile sentry squads
are gone. Over.

318
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,640
Got it.

319
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,001
There is an ambush!

320
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,120
There are only two of them.

321
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,080
They're from Cheetah Special Forces.

322
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,360
It's worth enough for us
to fight against two of them.

323
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,620
There's a sniper! Hide yourself!

324
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,104
(A05!)

325
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,599
Your 10 o'clock is clear.

326
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,961
Leave now!

327
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,319
Watch out for five o'clock direction!

328
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,600
The Blue Team is here.

329
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,846
Let's go!

330
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,149
(Lu, there is too little
concealment here.)

331
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,760
(It's too obvious for eight of us
to move around together.)

332
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,760
Let's break into three teams.

333
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,560
Let's infiltrate in camouflage
and break the siege.

334
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,439
Okay! See you at the old place!

335
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,959
Gao Teng Fei, let's cover them up!

336
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,959
Everyone else, leave!

337
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,839
Leave!

338
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,200
Capture Three Shells Qin alive!
Turn the Cheetahs into kittens!

339
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,199
Charge!

340
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,640
Hop in!

341
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:03,680
Hurry up!

342
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,280
Bring our truck here!

343
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,880
Report! Our truck got stolen!

344
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:23,760
Let's go!

345
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,719
Jian.

346
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,079
We've searched this area for two times.

347
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:37,946
Keep going.

348
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:45,353
(Here's company command post.)

349
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,110
(Calling Squad One.)

350
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,000
Squad One, copy.

351
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,361
Please go on, Squadron Leader.

352
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,839
(Stop searching at Zone 3.)

353
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:53,799
(Everyone has left.)

354
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,640
What?

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,880
That's impossible.

356
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
(What is impossible?)

357
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,850
(They escaped under our nose.)

358
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,920
(I find it inconceivable, too.)

359
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,560
Squadron Leader, I...

360
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,413
Unmanned reconnaissance aircraft
spotted the Red Team at Point C.

361
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,513
Go now to stop them.

362
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,999
I've sent Squad Two to Point C

363
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,920
to set up defence.

364
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,599
Yes, I will get it done.

365
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,801
Come with me!

366
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,721
Let's go!

367
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,680
(As we're facing a systematic search
by the mechanized infantry,)

368
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,840
(we had to break up into three squads)

369
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,040
(and fight on our own.)

370
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,320
(Fortunately,)

371
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,640
(with my familiarity with the
kitchen squad's practices,)

372
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,599
(we soon found the real supply truck.)

373
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,359
Are those supply vehicles?

374
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,520
-That's right.
-The timing is right.

375
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,399
Cover in place.

376
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,559
It's safe to take action now.

377
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,960
They used to be your comrades.
But today, they're your enemies.

378
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,560
Don't make concessions.

379
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,479
-Don't move!
-Stand still!

380
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,601
You're giving me a shock.

381
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,560
What are you doing?

382
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,760
Don't move.

383
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,200
You won't let me go, will you?

384
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,607
You are doing this to me after eating
the braised pork knuckle I made?

385
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,239
Lu Xiao Tian, come down!

386
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,439
Do 100 frog jumps.

387
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,719
Didn't you ask me to stay still?

388
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,640
I'm not moving.

389
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,200
The braised pork knuckle was oily.

390
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,199
Did you do that on purpose
so that we feel sick after eating?

391
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,119
It seems that you're up to no good.

392
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,120
You two are so ungrateful.

393
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,600
I cooked braised pork knuckle for you
out of kindness.

394
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,920
That's enough. Stop fooling around.

395
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,760
I can't do frog jump.

396
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,680
I can't walk later if I do that.

397
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,640
In that case, I won't be
able to carry water tomorrow.

398
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,959
I can't cook without water.

399
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,160
-Shut up!
-You'll be starving if there's no food.

400
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,439
So much crap.

401
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:43,760
Be gentle.

402
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,280
-That's enough!
-Since when did you have to carry water?

403
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,560
Isn't Guo the one who carries the water?

404
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,560
That's enough. Come down.

405
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,839
-Give me your rifle!
-Goodness.

406
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,199
You two...

407
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,479
Hurry up!

408
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,120
What are you doing, Yan?

409
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,040
Give me a hand.

410
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,920
Jump down by yourself.

411
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,040
That's enough. No one is here.

412
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,680
Finally, we three

413
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,680
reunite as a family.

414
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,199
Give me a hug.

415
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,359
What are you doing?

416
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,719
What is going on?

417
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,400
Xiao.

418
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,760
What's wrong?

419
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,680
Stay away from us.

420
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,479
You're giving me a heart attack.

421
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
I thought you were a human booby trap.

422
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,040
There's no booby trap.

423
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Yan, I don't have one.

424
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,359
I'm telling the truth.

425
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,359
Tian, we're in a battle.

426
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,238
We can only reunite after the drill.

427
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:28,959
Yes.

428
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,560
That's right.

429
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,199
You're now a captive.

430
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,959
We two will have to interrogate you.

431
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,785
I treat you two as buddies.

432
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,040
How dare you

433
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,518
interrogate me?

434
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,160
What's wrong?
Are you not admitting defeat?

435
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,239
Which of us can you defeat?

436
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:47,846
Answer me. Where is your squad leader?

437
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,721
Where is Guo?

438
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
I'm here.

439
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,520
-Squad Leader.
-Squad Leader.

440
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,521
You've become darker.

441
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,521
You look stronger, too.

442
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
It seems that you've made progress

443
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,241
in Cheetah Special Forces.

444
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,719
Yan Po Yue, are you crazy?

445
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,961
Yan Po Yue.

446
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,081
I only complimented you a little.

447
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,760
How could you take bullets
for your enemies?

448
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,720
So, how could you put away
your rifle in front of the enemy?

449
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,961
Squad Leader.

450
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,521
You're always our squad leader.

451
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,280
You're our squad leader for life.

452
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,279
Squad Leader.

453
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,399
I fought until the last second just now.

454
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,599
Tian.

455
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,599
Isn't Fan your squad leader?

456
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,760
Squad Leader Fan has retired.

457
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:08,319
Now, the kitchen squad

458
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,920
is led by Squad Leader Zhang.

459
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,840
Stop talking!

460
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,840
My rifle is not loaded with bullets.

461
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,520
Or else, why would I put my rifle away?

462
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
Is it because of the injury
you suffered during the selection?

463
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,520
You think I'm happy with this?

464
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
The kitchen squad needs me.

465
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,080
Squad Leader.

466
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,560
Yan Po Yue, come back!

467
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:58,920
Move.

468
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,961
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,160
I give up on the mission.

470
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,639
You can choose to give up,

471
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,000
but I must carry out my duty.

472
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,481
Yan Po Yue.

473
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,919
What's in your head?

474
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,880
Our mission is to cut off their supply.

475
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,199
Why do you give up on the mission
for no reason?

476
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,160
How could you explain to the rest of us?

477
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,000
Could you bear the consequences?

478
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,399
This is my business.

479
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,600
Yan Po Yue, what are you doing?

480
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,239
I got injured myself.

481
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,521
I deserve it.

482
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,600
I don't need your sympathy!

483
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,640
This is a battle.

484
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,959
I'm your enemy.

485
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,880
Come and catch me.

486
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,399
Come and catch me!

487
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,639
You refuse to fight back, right?

488
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,200
Lu Xiao Tian!

489
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,760
Yes.

490
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,560
Give me the backpack strap.

491
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,240
Tie these two captives up!

492
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,280
How dare you?

493
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,760
Hurry up!

494
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,401
Are you waiting for them to tie you up?

495
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
Yan Po Yue. Xiao Yun Jie.

496
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,680
What is this?

497
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,080
This is Cheetah's badge.

498
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,480
Even though I'm now
in the kitchen squad,

499
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm still a member
of Tiger Special Service.

500
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,040
You think you are doing me a favour

501
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
by not doing anything now?

502
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,440
Do you think we can get even over this?

503
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Listen.

504
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
You don't have to do that!

505
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,999
If you still remember our days

506
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,521
in the Special Service Company,

507
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,400
you should take action now!

508
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,440
That's respect for me!

509
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,721
Are you not taking action against me

510
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,479
because I'm disabled?

511
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,680
Let the disabled prove himself!

512
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,920
-Squad Leader!
-Squad Leader!

513
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520
Yan Po Yue, fight back!

514
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,840
-Fight back!
-Stop fighting, Squad Leader!

515
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,598
Yan Po Yue! I don't need your sympathy!

516
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,440
Squad Leader.

517
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,119
You'll lose your legs
if you won't stop kicking him!

518
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,160
Stop kicking him, Squad Leader!

519
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:10,199
Yan Po Yue, I'm lame in one leg

520
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,000
but I'm still a member
of Tiger Special Service!

521
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,040
Squad Leader, you'll
lose your legs if you keep kicking!

522
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,881
Move!

523
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,319
Squad Leader!

524
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,559
Squad Leader!

525
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,479
Do it!

526
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,079
Don't move!

527
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,040
Do it!

528
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:23,839
Do it!

529
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,800
Don't move!

530
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,559
Tie him up.

531
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,361
Tie him up!

532
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,320
Yan!

533
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,720
Yan!

534
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,280
No one else is here.

535
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,439
We are merely going
through the procedures.

536
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,599
Don't take it seriously.

537
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,560
I won't run away.

538
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,599
Please untie the rope.

539
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,599
Untie it.

540
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Please untie me.

541
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,856
The map is doing us a huge favour.

542
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,719
Is that so?

543
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,405
Let me make myself clear.

544
00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:15,559
I didn't give it to you.

545
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,119
You found it on me.

546
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,841
There are four supply depots,

547
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:26,199
one ammunition depot
and two radar stations.

548
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,079
What do you think?

549
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,640
Don't you think I'm your lucky charm?

550
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,159
You're going to get some merits
when I show up.

551
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,317
-Congratulations.
-Sit properly.

552
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:32,237
Lu Xiao Tian,

553
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,880
whether he gets merit or not,
it's a matter of Cheetah.

554
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,199
It's none of your business.

555
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:35,760
Squad Leader.

556
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,360
After the drill, we'll still be buddies.

557
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm happy for my buddy.

558
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,880
After all, we're a family.

559
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,760
Why don't you surrender to your enemy?

560
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,680
By the way,

561
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,680
where are the others
of the kitchen squad?

562
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,841
Where is Guo?

563
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,360
Why isn't he with you?

564
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,039
He's waiting for the supply
at the supply depot.

565
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,400
Shut up!

566
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,319
Stop!

567
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:02,680
What's wrong?

568
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,839
I need to pee.

569
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,030
Let's go together.

570
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,040
Stay here.

571
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,920
Let me go with you.

572
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,359
Come with me.

573
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,680
I'm good.

574
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,119
You need to come with us.

575
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,000
We need you to watch out for us.

576
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,961
Squad Leader,
should I go and take a look?

577
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,359
It's pointless!

578
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
Is something really wrong?

579
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,199
The map of the Blue Team
was directly given to us.

580
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,400
Don't you think
everything goes on too smoothly?

581
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,000
Perhaps we're just lucky.

582
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,960
Lu Xiao Tian was deliberately bickering
with Squad Leader along the way

583
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,561
to distract me.

584
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,840
And the most important thing is...

585
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,199
What is it?

586
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,880
When I asked about Guo Kui,

587
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,490
Lu Xiao Tian said
that he's at the supply depot,

588
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,923
but Zhang Tian Yang
didn't stop him in time.

589
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,000
Zhang Tian Yang is a veteran.

590
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,531
Even if he's captured,

591
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,439
he won't expose
the mission of his comrades.

592
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,359
It means he's hiding something.

593
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,160
It makes sense.

594
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,079
This is bad.

595
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,240
We're exposed.

596
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,520
We're exposed!

597
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,360
Slow down!

598
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,439
What are you doing on the ground?

599
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,079
Get up!

600
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,000
My hands.

601
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,559
Untie it!

602
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,599
I'm trying.

603
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,960
Will you stop touching my backside?

604
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,199
It's a mistake, Squad Leader.

605
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,920
Untie the rope for Squad Leader.

606
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,080
-Hurry up!
-Untie the rope.

607
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,560
No.

608
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,284
What's wrong?

609
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:13,206
We're exposed.

610
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,920
That's impossible.

611
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,160
I just got so caught up
in the acting that I cried.

612
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,959
Look for them!

613
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Squad Leader!

614
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:20,800
Kui.

615
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,560
What happened?

616
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,079
Well...

617
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,000
Are we exposed?

618
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:24,833
I didn't expect

619
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,760
those two brats have become smart
after joining Cheetah.

620
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,320
I thought we could fool them
by putting up a show.

621
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,079
Who would have known
that they're even better at acting?

622
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:33,560
They even saw through my acting.

623
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,239
My goodness.

624
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,239
Lu Xiao Tian.

625
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,120
Did you leak intel to them?

626
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,239
No, I was so caught up in my acting.

627
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:42,439
Squad Leader and Lu Xiao Tian

628
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,841
acted really well.

629
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,119
They should enrol in
the Academy of Drama.

630
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,480
They may win an award or two.

631
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:47,280
I mean it.

632
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,960
Fortunately,
there were only three of us.

633
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,200
If the whole team was here,

634
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,560
they would've taken a move.

635
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,920
We're even now.

636
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,279
It's time for us to take an action.

637
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:57,586
Xiao Xiao.

638
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,320
You may do it now.

639
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,319
Got it.

640
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,320
I'll distract them
to the woods in the east.

641
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,439
Got it.

642
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,559
Hide!

643
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,480
They're still here!

644
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:16,959
They're at ten o'clock!

645
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:26,079
Guo!

646
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,119
Lead some men to go after them!

647
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:27,680
Sure!

648
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,960
Everyone, come with me!

649
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,761
Hurry up!

650
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,880
Squad Leader, what should we do now?

651
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,677
It's too risky to keep the supply here.

652
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,799
Let's take the supply
back to the base camp.

653
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,040
You two, run back to the camp!

654
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,600
Bai Long.

655
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:44,392
Guo Xiao Xiao is heading 016.

656
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,159
She needs help
as someone is chasing after her.

657
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,040
(Roger.)

658
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
(What is your plan?)

659
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,480
We're looking for the Blue Team's
supply depot and ammunition depot.

660
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,880
Our location

661
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,681
will be shown on GPS.

662
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,200
(All the best.)

663
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,279
Same goes to you.

664
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,881
The map is fake

665
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,839
but the supply on the truck is real.

666
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,520
While the Blue Team is distracted,

667
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,640
we can play by ear.

668
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,840
Later, Squad Leader
will surely send the supply

669
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,479
back to the real supply depot.

670
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,639
We can't do this.

671
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,400
If this continues,
it will become a chase.

672
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,919
We won't be able
to complete our mission.

673
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,838
Captain Leng,

674
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,078
can you reach Qin Feng and others?

675
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,719
The communication device is not working.

676
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,320
After we exposed ourselves,

677
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,960
the signal throughout the area
is jammed by electronic jammers.

678
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:38,553
Where is the map?

679
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:39,354
Give me the map.

680
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,041
Yes.

681
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,959
This area is the area
covered by electronic jamming.

682
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,639
We need to leave the encirclement

683
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,415
in order to get in touch
with the other squads.

684
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,400
There is a river over there.

685
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,000
If we walk along the valley

686
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,840
and swim across the river,

687
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,879
we can leave the encirclement.

688
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,760
That's right.

689
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,040
It's faster that way.

690
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,721
We don't have to worry about
thermographic camera, too.

691
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,961
Hide!

692
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,408
Lu, leave with them first.

693
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:10,328
I'll hold them back!

694
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,040
No way!

695
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,959
Lu!

696
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,479
If they're behind us,

697
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,320
we won't be able to get away from
the chase even if we reach the river.

698
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,560
We haven't accomplished the mission.

699
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,000
You're the captain.
You bear greater responsibilities.

700
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,040
Trust me.

701
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,240
Be careful.

702
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,480
Let's go!

703
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,639
They're over there!

704
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,520
They're over there!

705
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
-Hurry up!
-Go after them!

706
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,481
-Go after them!
-Hurry up!

707
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,600
-Over there!
-They're over there!

708
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,720
All you can do is just hide, Coward?

709
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,121
Throw a grenade and blow them out!

710
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Charge!

711
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,319
You have

712
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,080
used up your grenades
in the ambush, haven't you?

713
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,120
You're out of bullets too.

714
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,040
What about this?

715
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,000
As a token of respect,

716
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,521
I admit, I'm out of bullets!

717
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:50,560
I dare you to come out

718
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,439
so that we can have a fight!

719
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
Everyone says the
Cheetah Special Forces are impressive.

720
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,720
I went to many selections to get
into the Cheetah Special Forces,

721
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,041
but I was eliminated twice!

722
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,481
Come out and fight with me!

723
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,326
Come on!

724
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,160
Do you really want to fight with me?

725
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,840
One word from you

726
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,400
disqualified me from joining the
Cheetah Special Forces back then.

727
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:12,840
I am not going for anything else today.

728
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,740
I just want to prove

729
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,199
if I deserve it.

730
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,440
Come on.

731
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,240
Fire the rifle!

732
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,680
Stop!

733
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,760
Let go of our captain!

734
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,000
You, you,

735
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,919
you,

736
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,959
and you.

737
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,320
All of you are eliminated.

738
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,760
Squad Leader Zhang.

739
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,639
Why are you so late?

740
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Something happened on the way.

741
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:20,960
That's why I was held back.

742
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,961
It's okay.

743
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,840
Has Guo come back?

744
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,640
He's not here yet.

745
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,839
He hasn't come back?

746
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,720
We'll unload the supply first.

747
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,439
Let's go.

748
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,000
Comrades!

749
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:36,680
It's time to unload the supply!

750
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,080
Let's help out to unload the supply.

751
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
What's wrong, Squad Leader?

752
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,960
Nothing.

753
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,120
Let's unload the supply.

754
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,799
Come on, help me out!

755
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,080
I'll carry this.

756
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,441
(A01 calling A05.)

757
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,640
(Please reply
when you receive the message.)

758
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,759
Captain Cao.

759
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,399
(We've reached the edge.)

760
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,321
Have you confirmed the target?

761
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,120
Yes.

762
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,280
This is the biggest supply depot
of the Blue Team.

763
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,949
Okay.

764
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,560
We'll launch a feint in a while.

765
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,641
Listen.

766
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:53,962
(We'll distract the Blue Team)

767
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,292
and you'll take advantage
of the chaos and run away

768
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,119
to prevent
getting involved in the fight.

769
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,960
Got it.

770
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,040
I knew you two would follow us.

771
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,921
Squad Leader.

772
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:11,120
Squad Leader.

773
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,439
That's enough.

774
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,639
Stop acting.

775
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:14,639
Squad Leader.

776
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,080
We're not acting.

777
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,120
Furthermore,

778
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,201
we can't act as good as you two.

779
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,239
That's right.

780
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,919
Don't let them escape!

781
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,600
Xiao, come up!

782
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,479
Who is that?

783
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,360
That brat.

784
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,961
He was trying to blow us both up.

785
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
I have sacrificed.

786
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,041
Fine.

787
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:44,199
I don't regret sending them
to the Cheetah Special Forces.

788
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,441
I'm so proud of them.

789
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:48,239
No, I mean you're so proud of them.

790
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:50,360
You're dead

791
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,520
but it doesn't stop you
from talking, does it?
