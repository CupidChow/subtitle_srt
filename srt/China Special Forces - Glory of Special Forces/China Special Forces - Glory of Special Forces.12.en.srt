00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,080
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,999
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,840
(Episode 12)

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What about the patient in Bed 15?

5
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,760
The patient in Bed 15 has a perforating
gunshot wound to his left chest,

6
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,120
a concussion,
and slightly lower blood pressure.

7
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:40,056
He has undergone the operation.

8
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:41,080
Currently, he's still in a coma.

9
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,879
Observe him closely.

10
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:43,800
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:51,552
You're young indeed.

12
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:55,151
You woke up two hours
earlier than I expected.

13
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,745
Did you save me?

14
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:02,904
You don't need to perform a salutation.

15
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,040
Let me introduce myself.

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,561
I'm Qin Feng from Cheetah Commando.

17
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:20,392
I knew it.

18
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:23,696
You knew what?

19
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:28,080
How do you feel now?

20
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:29,784
I feel pretty good.

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm fine now.

22
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:36,706
Actually, you didn't need to
get injured in the first place.

23
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:40,240
I had to complete my duty.

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,200
Complete your duty?

25
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,920
Fine.

26
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,160
Tell me what's your duty.

27
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:48,601
To serve the people with all my heart.

28
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:51,304
And then?

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,399
To fight bravely
without fear of sacrificing oneself.

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,320
And?

31
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,121
To be the loyal guardian
of the party and the people forever.

32
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,240
You're right.

33
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:06,600
But you forget your most basic duty.

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,560
The waterway that
connects to our border,

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,759
do you know why the Special Service
Company didn't send anyone there?

36
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:23,168
It's because that's our territory.

37
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:25,297
It's impossible for them
to cross the border.

38
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,696
But my men discovered you

39
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,289
and another person fighting back then.

40
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:31,473
You guys have crossed the boundary.

41
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:35,408
That's why my men only observed you.

42
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,041
They didn't act.

43
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,961
No one told me that
the waterway was covered.

44
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:43,605
Do we need to report everything
the Cheetah Commando do to you?

45
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Remember this.

46
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,520
The law of survival on the battlefield

47
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:56,759
is the only law that can
protect you and your comrades.

48
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,712
You should focus on your duty
with everything you have.

49
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,439
In warfare, there are
no constant conditions.

50
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,359
You're talking back right now?

51
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:13,551
Did Sun Tzu's The Art of War tell you

52
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,751
that you're just a pawn?

53
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:17,335
You're not a general.

54
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:19,856
A pawn should do what a pawn should do!

55
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,440
Enough, I'll stop it now.

56
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:27,873
You aren't my soldier.

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,039
When you're able to move,

58
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:31,632
fill in the battle report.

59
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,249
The questions I want to ask
are inside the report.

60
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:34,857
And,

61
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:38,647
have you seen this mark
when you were in the jungle?

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,032
I have.

63
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,551
When the armed drug traffickers
attacked our sentry post last time,

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,280
I saw the same tattoo on them.

65
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:52,712
This is Red Scorpion.

66
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,487
They're a bunch of armed drug cartels
who are active on the borderline.

67
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,840
They're caravans who do kidnapping,
drug trafficking, human trafficking,

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,640
even targeting

69
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,117
other drug cartels within the jungle.

70
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,032
When you see a sign like this,

71
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,016
that means you're in their territory.

72
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,312
You're lucky this time.

73
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,530
You only encountered
normal drug traffickers.

74
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:16,056
If you encountered Red Scorpion,

75
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,961
I'm sure it would've
been terrible for you.

76
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:20,657
I fought them before.

77
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,875
Fan from the Rapid Deployment Brigade
was the one who fought them before.

78
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:27,384
You were just observing them
from the sideline.

79
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:34,496
Chief,

80
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,927
I joined the army in order to
join the Cheetah Commando.

81
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,961
You're pretty impatient, aren't you?

82
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:49,160
It's a pity that the Cheetah Commando
don't like impatient people.

83
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:52,624
Let me give you a friendly reminder.

84
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:56,647
You have more than
a bone and flesh injury on you.

85
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:09,464
Beside you is another wounded personnel.

86
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:11,848
He was injured
as he was trying to protect you.

87
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,880
He's your comrade and squad leader.

88
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,160
I thought the first thing you would do
after you woke up was to ask about him.

89
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:11,255
You guys won today!

90
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:12,728
You guys can have your meals now.

91
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:14,320
The three of you, go now.

92
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:30,272
Why didn't you shoot me directly?

93
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:32,945
I was afraid I might miss.

94
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:36,457
That's fine.

95
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,200
You have plenty of chances
to do so in the future.

96
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:51,829
You two, go and help them out
after you're done moving.

97
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,376
She's pretty good.

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,363
You did a great job teaching her.

99
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,215
Daddy Kun, you told me
to recruit more people.

100
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,880
Out of all the new guys,
this girl is the most exceptional.

101
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,359
What's her origin?

102
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,319
She's a fellow drug addict.

103
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,128
She sold herself away
as she was penniless.

104
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,084
But she escaped.

105
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,605
After that, we caught her
when she tried to steal our drug.

106
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:26,727
Seems like you have
high expectations of her.

107
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,760
Not bad indeed.

108
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:57,541
Bring her here.

109
00:09:58,296 --> 00:09:59,137
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:10,312
I heard that you were the best
with guns among our new guys.

111
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,800
Answer Daddy Kun!

112
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:16,695
He gave me more bullets than the others.

113
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,361
I just practised harder than others.

114
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,360
You were biased.

115
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:27,207
But, she has the best shooting sense
among the new guys.

116
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,480
Have you taught her how to use a knife?

117
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,841
Not yet.

118
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:34,915
Alright.

119
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,225
I'll teach her.

120
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:44,025
This is a Dha.

121
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:46,824
It's the most practical weapon
you can use in a jungle.

122
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,520
Sometimes, it's even better than guns.

123
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:52,056
I don't want to learn that.

124
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,800
If I learn that,
I have to kill someone for you.

125
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,016
Shut up!

126
00:10:57,877 --> 00:11:00,494
If you don't kill them,
they will kill you!

127
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,136
You don't like this place?

128
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,119
-Do you wish to leave?
-I do.

129
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
I'll grant you your wish.

130
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,239
Take this with you.

131
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,252
If you can enter the Kachin Hills
and come back alive,

132
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:29,200
in the future, I'll allow you
to go wherever you want to go.

133
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,560
You said so yourself.

134
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:29,320
Young Master.

135
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:41,864
Young Master,

136
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:45,400
I think Daddy Kun is still on his guard.

137
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:47,778
That lass,

138
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:49,457
she was stubborn.

139
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
Her life is worthless anyway.

140
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,480
It doesn't matter if she dies.

141
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
(So, these are our heroes.)

142
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:36,640
(Seems like we got
ourselves some heroes, huh?)

143
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
Company commander? Platoon leader?

144
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:40,488
Why don't you guys
be our generals while you're at it?

145
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,640
(Report!)

146
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,160
Company Commander!

147
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:47,839
I will join Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie!

148
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,759
When both parties are unafraid of death,

149
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:51,622
death will become unimportant.

150
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,488
Squad Leader,

151
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,719
I owe you one.

152
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:05,687
I will surely repay the favour.

153
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
You guys should leave first.

154
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,657
How do you feel?

155
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,385
How are you? Are you okay?

156
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:38,992
I'm fine now.

157
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Why are you guys here?

158
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,600
We're here to visit our hero.

159
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:43,856
Look at him.

160
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:47,400
Even though he's seriously injured,
he never forgets to care for his buddy.

161
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,840
Such a loyal friend.

162
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,599
You're full of crap.

163
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,639
By the way, we visited
Squad Leader before this.

164
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,680
The nurse said he is fine.

165
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,800
He won't wake up any time soon
since they just sedated him.

166
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,320
This time, you've rendered huge merits.

167
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:03,958
Render what merits?

168
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
You're being humble now?

169
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,679
-Luo Fu Gui was full of praises for you.
-That's right.

170
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,320
-How's Luo doing?
-He's fine.

171
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,520
You don't need to worry about him.

172
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,039
He's staying in
the company's guesthouse.

173
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,567
He's assisting the regiment headquarters

174
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,864
and public security bureau
with their investigation.

175
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,680
Hero Yan, you should stop
worrying about someone else.

176
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,960
You should return to your ward.

177
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,240
-Someone is waiting for you.
-That's right.

178
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,120
-That's right.
-Who's waiting for me?

179
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,288
How did you feel

180
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:49,760
after you killed your first person?

181
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,488
(The knife was stuck between his bones.)

182
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,400
I couldn't get it out.

183
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,200
Back then,

184
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:05,992
I thought I was done for.

185
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:13,556
How did you feel after your second kill?

186
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:19,316
The tip of
the voltage detector pen was blunt.

187
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,345
I only had one chance.

188
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,265
I had no choice but to give it my all.

189
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,033
When I stabbed the pen into his neck,

190
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:28,298
I felt

191
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,490
warm blood gushing out.

192
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:32,344
I'm sorry.

193
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:34,777
I shouldn't have

194
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,486
reminded you of something terrible.

195
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:49,200
So,

196
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:51,240
how did it feel after your third kill?

197
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,435
How did it feel to kill someone?

198
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:10,360
You'll feel the recoil.

199
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:12,538
I felt the handgun's recoil.

200
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:17,686
Okay.

201
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,080
First,

202
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,720
don't give yourself
too much mental pressure.

203
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
It's common for first-timers

204
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:29,199
to experience PTSD
after their first operation.

205
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,199
Especially for a person like you...

206
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:31,505
I don't have PTSD!

207
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,120
It's a battle between life and death.

208
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,960
If they don't die, I'll die.

209
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,000
I did so to protect myself

210
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
and the people.

211
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,400
This is my duty!

212
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,600
Only the weak will have mental trauma.

213
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,120
Those who suffer from PTSD
exhibit different symptoms.

214
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,240
Some of them will show extreme reactions

215
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,840
while some don't show
any external reactions at all.

216
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,480
But it'll affect his life from now on.

217
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,800
This fellow has a great mentality.

218
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:19,120
According to my current diagnosis,
his mental state isn't affected.

219
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,400
But there might be another possibility.

220
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,920
He might take it to extremes.

221
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,120
You need to observe him
after he returns to the company.

222
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,668
Doctor,

223
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
what do you mean by
taking it to extremes?

224
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,040
Compared with shooting the enemy
from a distance on the battlefield,

225
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,719
he engaged them in close-quarter combat,

226
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,400
and he witnessed live people
die in front of him

227
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,599
three times in a row.

228
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,800
This is our first time
receiving a case like him as well.

229
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,382
Young Master,

230
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,680
you're still awake?

231
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,359
Lai, join me for a drink.

232
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:00,248
Young Master.

233
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:09,546
Have you received any news about Miya?

234
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:13,739
No.

235
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,120
Young Master,

236
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
it's been over 10 days

237
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,760
since she entered Kachin Hills.

238
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,000
It's been 15 days.

239
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:24,848
It's impossible for her to return alive.

240
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,959
Prepare a boat for me.

241
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,280
If Daddy Kun asks about me,
tell him that I went to the casino.

242
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:08,960
You missed again.

243
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,600
I missed on purpose so that
you could teach me more.

244
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:18,048
I've used six arrows.

245
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:22,031
Good.

246
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:23,560
You're gutsy.

247
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,760
You're gutsier than the men in here.

248
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,760
I will keep my promise.

249
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,799
As long as you can move
the drugs yourself,

250
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:32,920
you can take any amount you want.

251
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:36,452
You can go wherever you want

252
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,160
as long as it's within my territory.

253
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,680
I will protect you.

254
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,680
Daddy Kun,

255
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,920
please teach me how to use a Dha.

256
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,640
Alright.

257
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:14,320
I'll teach you.

258
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:11,361
Why are you still here?

259
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:13,656
I haven't managed to kill you yet.

260
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,105
You had plenty of chances to kill me.

261
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,713
I'm going to beat you
in a fair fight first.

262
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:23,609
I'll kill you after that.

263
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,000
-Report!
-Come in!

264
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,720
Regiment Commander, this is a notice
from the division headquarters.

265
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:58,440
This is an order from our higher-ups.

266
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,080
Cheetah Commando will expand their team,

267
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,720
and they will select elite soldiers
from different teams.

268
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,720
They're trying to
poach our soldiers again.

269
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,640
They're the most elite special unit of
the Chinese People's Armed Police.

270
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,160
To those kids,

271
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:12,416
this is extremely attractive.

272
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,880
We have to surrender our soldiers
to them without a fight again.

273
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,079
But, we still need to retain
some of the elite soldiers.

274
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:23,000
I've been working beside Qin Feng
for over 10 years now.

275
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:27,113
I think he just wants to poach
all the talents of different teams.

276
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:29,008
There's another notice here.

277
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:31,223
They want us to head to
the division headquarters for a meeting.

278
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:34,753
The division party committee
is confident with the reformation.

279
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:37,808
This military reform
is unlike any other previous reforms.

280
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,599
It's groundbreaking, revolutionary,

281
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:42,599
and it represents a milestone.

282
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,760
Military reform is a turning point
when a country and its army

283
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:47,943
have encountered major issues

284
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:50,574
after they had been developed
until a certain extent

285
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,079
or in the middle

286
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,599
of their development.

287
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,280
It could even be the most important,
effective, and vital choice

288
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,239
that could change the nation's fate.

289
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,640
After this military reform,

290
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,800
the Chinese People's
Armed Police Force's duty

291
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,920
is to handle sudden
social security incidents,

292
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:10,857
prevent and
deal with terrorist activities,

293
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:12,170
protect the rights and uphold the law
as coast guards,

294
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,256
hold rescue operations on the sea,

295
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,118
hold defensive operations,
and accomplish missions

296
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,280
that are handed out
by the Central Military Commission.

297
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,199
I assume everyone here
has received the notice

298
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:21,729
regarding Cheetah Commando's expansion.

299
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:24,280
Regiment Commander Liu
and Political Commissar Xu.

300
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,204
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

301
00:27:28,432 --> 00:27:29,860
After the division
party committee's discussion,

302
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,280
the Rapid Deployment Brigade will be the
key unit of our first military reform.

303
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:39,207
You may speak if you have
any questions or objections.

304
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,520
Not at all, sir!
We will follow your command!

305
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,063
Very good!

306
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,160
I hope the Rapid Deployment Brigade

307
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,760
will serve as an example
for the entire military reform!

308
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:49,977
Yes, sir!

309
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:53,516
Kill!

310
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:54,569
One!

311
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:55,784
Kill!

312
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,871
Two!

313
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,880
Kill!

314
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,852
Three!

315
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,878
Kill!

316
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,000
Kill!

317
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:02,329
One!

318
00:28:02,586 --> 00:28:03,426
Kill!

319
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:04,473
Two!

320
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:05,458
Kill!

321
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:06,384
Three!

322
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,199
Kill!

323
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:08,680
He's a young lad indeed.

324
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,880
He doesn't look like
someone who was injured before.

325
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:13,040
He has rendered a Second-Class Merit.

326
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,960
He seems so fired up.

327
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,640
This lad has a bright future
ahead of him.

328
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,000
I won't be able to see
how he does in the future.

329
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,400
You should observe him for me.

330
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,760
You raised him, you know?

331
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:28,160
Who else can he count on?

332
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:30,060
He's not counting on someone else.

333
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,800
He only wants to count on himself.

334
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Yan Po Yue!

335
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:41,480
Yes, sir!

336
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:52,200
You should tell him.

337
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:55,440
There will be a selection
after three months.

338
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,880
Every unit will recommend
their top soldiers to the selection.

339
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,760
Which unit will I join
after the selection?

340
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,543
That's all I can say.

341
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,439
The others are confidential.

342
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,640
Understood.

343
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,920
Regarding the preparations
you should make,

344
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:16,600
I'm sure you're clear about them, right?

345
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:18,039
Yes, sir!

346
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,440
Look who's back.

347
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,632
Squad Leader!

348
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,394
-Squad Leader!
-Squad Leader!

349
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:40,480
-Your arm is okay now?
-Squad Leader!

350
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,080
Squad Leader, you've lost some weight.

351
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,360
I'm fine. I'm doing great.

352
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:46,200
Po Yue.

353
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,680
I'm fine.

354
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,800
Company Commander, Instructor.

355
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,280
Zhang Tian Yang, reporting for duty.

356
00:29:56,784 --> 00:29:57,585
How's your recovery?

357
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,360
I'm fine now. Look.

358
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,400
You just returned to the team.
You should head back and rest.

359
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,280
Company Commander,
I have something to report.

360
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,360
Speak.

361
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,040
I wish to report it to you in private.

362
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:17,200
You wish to join
the special unit selection?

363
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:18,915
Yes, sir.

364
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:22,719
You've been recuperating
in the hospital for the past few weeks.

365
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,280
Where did you hear about this?

366
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:26,704
Instructor,

367
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,000
the regiment has already
sent a notice to our company.

368
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,560
How could I not hear about this?

369
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:34,513
The selection is very strict.

370
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:36,554
And you've just recovered.

371
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,024
Can you withstand it?

372
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:39,183
Instructor,

373
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,119
the Special Service Company
is strict with their training too.

374
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:44,611
You're something else.

375
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,079
Now that I'm being transferred
to handle civilian work,

376
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:50,184
you're trying to
find a job for yourself?

377
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:52,760
Company Commander,

378
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,120
this has nothing to do with you.

379
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,240
You see, I'm going to be a veteran soon.

380
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:00,842
I wish to give it my all

381
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,481
before I retire from the military.

382
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,639
What if you didn't pass the selection?

383
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,400
I'll come back then. What else can I do?

384
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,000
I will continue to lead them
as their squad leader.

385
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:15,720
I will contribute to our company.

386
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,199
Zhang Tian Yang,
you need to think twice...

387
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,680
Go ahead. I'm giving you
the green light.

388
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,080
Li.

389
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:41,426
I was once a squad leader too.

390
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:45,800
I once had the same opportunity as you.

391
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:48,440
But I failed.

392
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,801
I hope you can surpass me

393
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,520
and pass the selection.

394
00:31:58,047 --> 00:31:58,960
Thank you, Company Commander.

395
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:01,240
Thank you, Instructor.

396
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,040
I've received the order
from our higher-ups.

397
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,600
But we should've
discussed this beforehand.

398
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,200
Liu, you're still the same.

399
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,880
I knew you would say that.

400
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:34,360
But I'm sorry.

401
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,080
This time, there's no room
for discussion.

402
00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:39,282
If you want to say that,
I'll say this first.

403
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,640
You can take some of our soldiers away,

404
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,000
but you mustn't touch certain soldiers.

405
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,560
We went through a lot
to raise them as excellent soldiers.

406
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,239
Fair means before resorting to force?
That's reasonable.

407
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,407
But the issues you're worried about

408
00:32:49,488 --> 00:32:50,527
aren't issues at all.

409
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,720
What do you mean by that?

410
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:54,880
Putting one's skill to practice is
the only way to test the truth.

411
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:57,401
Putting soldiers into the battlefield
is the only way to test their strength.

412
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,960
We judge according to their results.
The better ones will head into battle.

413
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,640
I think you're right.

414
00:33:01,906 --> 00:33:03,360
Although our regiment is
a full-training unit,

415
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,400
after all, we only assist
the border armed forces

416
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,560
to arrest drug traffickers.

417
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,919
Our soldiers don't
fit into your criteria.

418
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,160
Stop lying.

419
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,178
Your regiment is stationed
right at the border area.

420
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,368
You guys might encounter

421
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:17,280
a conflict at any given time.

422
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:19,275
I know all about the missions

423
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,560
your regiment had executed.

424
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,880
Soldiers who had been through
life and death situations

425
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:26,960
are different from champions

426
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:28,360
in the training ground.

427
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,360
You've said everything there is to say.

428
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,441
What can I say?

429
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,585
I only have one condition.

430
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,400
Both the soldier
and his result must be excellent.

431
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,880
Fine.

432
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:41,995
I'll ask them to
prepare for the selection.

433
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,320
But I have one condition.

434
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:45,541
Don't tell me. I can't hear you.

435
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,079
You have to accept this condition.

436
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,240
There's one soldier you mustn't touch.

437
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:51,578
Who is it?

438
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:53,000
Yan Po Yue.

439
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,320
I thought you were referring
to someone important.

440
00:33:56,658 --> 00:33:57,938
Fine. I promise you.

441
00:33:58,056 --> 00:33:59,320
I won't take Yan Po Yue.

442
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,879
You're not taking him?

443
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:05,835
No.

444
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:09,562
Don't try to trick me.

445
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:11,593
I'm not tricking you.

446
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I'm serious.

447
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:15,520
At least for now,

448
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,760
I don't want him to be on my unit.

449
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:21,560
Give me a reason why
you don't want him to be on your unit.

450
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:26,841
Yan Po Yue

451
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,480
has the qualities
to be an excellent soldier.

452
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,560
But he wishes to surpass everyone.

453
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,640
He's selfish and self-centred.

454
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,080
Liu, do you know what's
the most important thing

455
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:41,659
for the special forces?

456
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:42,776
Your belief?

457
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:45,537
To follow the party's order
and be absolutely loyal.

458
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:47,088
That's the most basic thing

459
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:48,992
we need to follow as soldiers.

460
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,199
What else is there?

461
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,760
The special forces

462
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,760
face desperate situations quite often.

463
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,280
The only thing we can believe in
is our comrades.

464
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:01,160
We must have trust in our comrades.

465
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,400
We have to treat them as priorities
instead of ourselves.

466
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:09,080
That's the only issue with him.

467
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,480
Enough. Let's talk about other things.

468
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:13,200
How's your regiment doing?

469
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,360
Were you referring to
the military reform?

470
00:35:20,396 --> 00:35:21,640
What else is there to say?

471
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:24,840
We will obey and follow their commands.

472
00:35:26,785 --> 00:35:27,985
I remember

473
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,600
that your regiment was established
during the liberation war period.

474
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,481
The liberation war where we had to
resist the US aggression and aid Korea,

475
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:37,033
border operations,

476
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:38,210
we've participated in all of them.

477
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,120
We were transferred to
the Rapid Deployment Brigade in the 90s.

478
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,960
Our unit has quite a history.

479
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,907
You guys had rendered countless merits.
It must've been tough.

480
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:52,578
You guys are their direct subordinates.

481
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,240
Did you guys hear any rumours?

482
00:35:55,971 --> 00:35:57,394
We're doing a military reform too.

483
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,376
We will be switching from
the commandos to the special forces.

484
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:01,842
It's a difficult transition too.

485
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:04,875
As for the rumours I heard,

486
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:07,073
it's something within your expectations.

487
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:13,172
Liu,

488
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,483
all of us need time to adapt to this.

489
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:18,907
We need to adapt to it
using the shortest time possible.

490
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,360
Kill!

491
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,360
Kill!

492
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:15,679
Kill!

493
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,026
Kill!

494
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,041
Kill!

495
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,990
Was Yan Po Yue training harder than ever
after he returned to the team?

496
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,799
Harder?

497
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:57,577
He's risking his life to train.
He doesn't sleep at all.

498
00:37:57,962 --> 00:37:59,121
What do you call that again?

499
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,538
I couldn't understand you at all.

500
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:04,507
He's not risking his life to train.

501
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,120
He's burning his life essence away.

502
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,849
How should I describe this to you?

503
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:10,401
Once a clockwork
is installed into a machine,

504
00:38:10,632 --> 00:38:12,072
no one can stop it.

505
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:13,243
He trains until
he forgets to eat or sleep.

506
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:15,312
He doesn't even sleep nowadays.

507
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:21,800
This isn't good.

508
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:24,643
Squad Leader, this is good.

509
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,650
Do you know what this means for him?

510
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,939
He can finally show off his strength.

511
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,240
He killed our enemies
and fulfilled his dream as a hero.

512
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:32,864
He's finally a hero now.

513
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,239
You should let him enjoy it
while he still can.

514
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,760
Let him show off whenever he can.

515
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,559
This is more than
about just showing off.

516
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,859
When I first shot an enemy,

517
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:44,946
I was rewarded for my contribution.

518
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:47,440
I looked fine on the surface.

519
00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:51,108
But it took me half a year

520
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,760
to get over the fact
that I had killed someone.

521
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:55,923
I killed him using a gun, you know?

522
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,153
But look at Yan Po Yue.

523
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,738
He killed three people.

524
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,480
All three of them died in his hand.

525
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:08,361
Full of blood.

526
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,360
I don't believe that
his heart is made of stone.

527
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:17,200
He won't get over it that easily.

528
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,960
Great!

529
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,279
Great!

530
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,360
Squad Leader, are you okay?

531
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:42,480
Guan Yong, you've improved.

532
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,222
Your moves were on point.

533
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,839
I felt your strength.

534
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,720
Yes, sir.

535
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:49,480
Next group.

536
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,545
Go easy on me.

537
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,440
Your hand was tainted with blood.

538
00:39:58,785 --> 00:40:00,680
Please don't kill me later.

539
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,640
Begin!

540
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,480
Seems like your training was for naught!

541
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:25,480
Kill!

542
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,243
Stop!

543
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,407
Stop!

544
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:49,844
Stop!

545
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,320
Stop!

546
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:27,903
Yan!

547
00:41:27,928 --> 00:41:28,688
Go away!

548
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,711
Stop fighting!

549
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:35,200
Yan!

550
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,559
Are you out of your mind?

551
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,560
Yan Po Yue!

552
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,720
He's a comrade, not an enemy!

553
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:05,240
This is typical PTSD.

554
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:07,514
Is there any way to treat him?

555
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,280
I can prescribe some medications to him.

556
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,401
But it's only a temporary solution.

557
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:12,923
Judging by his current situation,

558
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,720
he might suffer a relapse at any time.

559
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:21,987
Doctor, can you cure him?

560
00:42:22,978 --> 00:42:26,160
Why don't you guys bring him
to the army's general hospital again?

561
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,160
I'm fine! I'm completely fine!

562
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,720
Don't touch me!

563
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,120
Company Commander, Instructor,

564
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,280
I'm sorry!

565
00:42:38,273 --> 00:42:39,320
I couldn't control myself!

566
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,960
I promise I won't do it again!

567
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,360
I was wrong! Please punish me!

568
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:52,065
Instructor, I'm begging you!

569
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,680
I'm begging you!

570
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,721
I'll do anything

571
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,080
as long as you don't
suspend me from training!
