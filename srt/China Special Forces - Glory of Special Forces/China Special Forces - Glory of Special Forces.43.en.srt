00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,160
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:31,015
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
(Episode 43)

4
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,480
-Pei Ta Yan.
-Mao Lang.

5
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:38,160
-Su Jian Fan.
-Ren Xiao Chuan.

6
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,880
Reporting for duty!

7
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Xiao Yun Jie, Yan Po Yue, Guo Xiao Xiao.

8
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,721
About face!

9
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,560
I know that over the past few months,

10
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
you all have been working hard.

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,120
You have overcome
all kinds of difficulties,

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,040
and have improved a lot

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,680
academically and physically.

14
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,679
The higher-ups

15
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,200
have expressed very
high expectations for you,

16
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,280
saying that you are the elite of
the elite of armed police forces.

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,702
However,

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Instructor Ai has reported
certain situation to me.

19
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,960
And you know what
situation I'm talking about.

20
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,120
I won't repeat it here.

21
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,920
I would like to stress that

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
healthy competition is

23
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,600
the catalyst to maintain the
driving force to move forward,

24
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
but teamwork

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,218
is equally important.

26
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:35,960
Warrior Competition

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,800
will be held next month.

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,879
Our detachment has received
an honourable task

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,679
to select personnel to represent China.

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,680
The detachment has decided that

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,361
the seven of you

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,399
plus Xu Yang

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,120
will form a participating training team.

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,073
-Pei Ta Yan.
-Yes, sir!

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,560
You're appointed as team captain.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,680
Yes, sir!

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,999
-Yan Po Yue.
-Yes, sir!

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,480
You're appointed as vice captain.

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,480
Yes, sir!

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,800
As the captain and vice captain,

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,480
you both have to play an exemplary role.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,880
I hope

43
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,480
every team member
can perform your respective duty

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
and coordinate with each other.

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,560
A month later,

46
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,520
I want to see a brand new Cheetah team.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,120
Is that clear?

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Yes, sir!

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,840
Captain Lu Tu

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,480
will personally lead the
team during this competition.

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,480
Next, he'll tell you the details.

52
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,160
In line with this competition,

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,480
your studies at

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,240
Special Police Academy
will be suspended for now.

55
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,759
You will start doing intensive training.

56
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,480
Based on the situation
of the competition,

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,280
we have simulated the environment,

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,800
altitude and even humidity
of this competition

59
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
in all aspects

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,320
so that you can adapt to it in advance.

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,360
Therefore, I hope you
can help each other

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,520
and form a united whole
as soon as possible.

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,280
I want you to focus on
improving your weaknesses.

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
Also,

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,840
the event this year
will be different from the past.

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,280
The participated countries

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,720
may join forces or share information.

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,760
So, I want you all to work on

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
your language skills.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,480
Particularly, don't think
that you can excuse yourself

71
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,039
just because your
teammate can speak it.

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
-Xu Yang.
-Yes, sir.

73
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,359
Bring the gift here.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,240
Yes, sir.

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Well, go on.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,840
Open it.

77
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,600
Listen up,

78
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,920
the weapons at the competition

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,360
are issued by the organizers on site.

80
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,624
Therefore, based on our experience,

81
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,760
we've prepared customized
exported gun especially for you.

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,880
It will allow you to get familiar
with it in advance.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
Moreover, in order for us to have
better chance at winning,

84
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,800
with the approval of the higher-ups,

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Special Police Academy

86
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,560
has assigned us an interpreter

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,840
and intelligence analyst.

88
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,920
She'll join us

89
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,640
and travel with us.

90
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,200
-Report, sir.
-Enter.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Gu Meng will come with our team.

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,360
Yes, sir.

93
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,520
Alright now, put it away.

94
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,640
An hour later,

95
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:13,198
pack up your belongings

96
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,799
and gather in front
of the school building

97
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
to depart to the training site.

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
-Dismissed.
-Yes, sir!

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,280
What's the matter?

100
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,159
Detachment Chief,

101
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,642
I'd like to speak with you alone.

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Xu Yang,

103
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,320
come on.

104
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
What's the matter?

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
You feel bitter that I assigned you

106
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,680
as vice captain?

107
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,560
I won't dare to.

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,600
So, you think

109
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,560
those new cheetahs are not
as physically adept as you?

110
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,040
You're worried that they
would be dead weight?

111
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,601
They are outstanding,

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,440
we can learn from them.

113
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,760
But when it comes to accepting them,
I feel a little resistance.

114
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,080
It's understandable.

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
Yan Po Yue,

116
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,600
sometimes people

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,560
can't make the choice
they are comfortable with,

118
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,760
they have to make the right choice.

119
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
During a battle

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,160
many years ago,

121
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,040
I was seriously wounded

122
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,240
and needed an emergency transfusion.

123
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,480
I have Type A blood,

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,400
but due to the poor conditions
on the battlefield,

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,720
there was only Type O blood for me.

126
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,800
Although O blood is the universal blood,

127
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,640
there are antibodies in the plasma.

128
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,000
If too much of it is transfused,

129
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,240
the body will have a rejection reaction.

130
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,480
At that time,

131
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
my body could not
accept the fresh blood.

132
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,360
By the time the battle was over,

133
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,120
I almost died.

134
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,800
But I'm fine now.

135
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,000
They are all inside my body serving me.

136
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,000
So that I can stand here and
talk to you without any problem.

137
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
Yan Po Yue,

138
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,440
accepting Pei Ta Yan and the others

139
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
is the same as transfusing blood to you.

140
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
If you refuse the transfusion,

141
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,760
you will die,

142
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,520
If you accept it,

143
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,920
you will go through a rejection reaction
that is more painful than death.

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,360
But you will live.

145
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,080
As long as you live,

146
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,200
everything can be changed.

147
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,720
I just received an order.

148
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm leaving soon.

149
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:00,186
Now,

150
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,401
I'm here to bid your farewell.

151
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,282
Well, soldiers

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,840
are awaiting orders at all times.

153
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,720
Report, ma'am!

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,080
Come in.

155
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,960
Instructor Ai,

156
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,320
I just received an order.

157
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm leaving soon.

158
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,559
I stopped by to say goodbye.

159
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,720
Bye.

160
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,720
Captain...

161
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
I just want to say I think
I see a desert.

162
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,206
This year's Warrior Competition

163
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,160
set the competition area in the desert

164
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,960
to simulate the most brutal frontline
battlefield of counter-terrorism.

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
Desert area

166
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,160
is open and exposed.

167
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,680
Since it is difficult to
find a reference object,

168
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,360
it's easy to get disoriented.

169
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,200
The loose land can affect movement.

170
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
It's lack of water resource,

171
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,720
and there is a large temperature
difference between day and night.

172
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,320
There is frequent hot sandstorms.

173
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,600
It's difficult to achieve
tactical suddenness.

174
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,560
The few of us are more experienced
in desert combat.

175
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:24,613
So, I believe that...

176
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,480
Captain,

177
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,360
Xiao Xiao,

178
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,840
we've been here before.

179
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,520
We are familiar.

180
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,320
Okay. Your stability training is over.

181
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,520
You'll now begin
tactical shooting training.

182
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,379
(The pre-competition training)

183
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,040
(just freed us from books and tests.)

184
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,640
(The old cheetahs are
bursting with energy)

185
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,960
(to vent out all
our grievances we've suffered)

186
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,880
(at school on the endless training.)

187
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,000
(We want to tell all the cheetah cubs)

188
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,520
(Cheetah is Cheetah.)

189
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,959
(Cheetah is the most
indestructible team,)

190
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,480
(baptized by battles.)

191
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,761
Marhaban.

192
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,159
Marhaban.

193
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,320
Marhaban.

194
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:25,781
It means Hello in Arabic.

195
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,400
How are you doing?

196
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:29,813
It's so hard.

197
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,520
It's 11:30pm now.

198
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,080
You have a training at 6am tomorrow.

199
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,679
How long do you still need?

200
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,640
I need to go through
every part of the gun,

201
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,454
and then recalibrate it.

202
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:46,014
Then,

203
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,884
I have to install new accessories.

204
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,439
It's not as simple as
dismantling and assembling a gun.

205
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,280
Regardless,

206
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,599
you need to have enough rest.

207
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:54,823
How about this?

208
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,159
You have two more hours.

209
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,919
-Report, sir.
-Enter.

210
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,360
Captain Lu, I'd like to request for more
bullets for my extra practice at night.

211
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,760
Who permits you to touch my gun?

212
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,559
It's just regular adjustment
and maintenance.

213
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,840
You think I can't do it myself?

214
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:18,823
Xiao Xiao,

215
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,760
Mao Lang isn't just an expert sniper.

216
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
He's also a firearms expert.

217
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,240
He is very knowledgeable
in both domestic and foreign,

218
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:26,320
light and heavy weapons.

219
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,000
What did you do to it?

220
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,320
I went through your
past sniper test results.

221
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,800
I noticed a pattern.

222
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,400
At a range of more than 400 meters,

223
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,400
your shot always show
a rightward dispersion.

224
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:54,475
This dispersion

225
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,280
increases with distance.

226
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,430
Then, I pulled the footage of your test

227
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,040
and found the problem.

228
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:03,796
It's the trigger pull.

229
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,561
The effect of trigger pull
on shooting accuracy

230
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,400
increases with the range.

231
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
Therefore,

232
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,120
I adjusted the trigger pull of your gun

233
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,680
from the original 4.5 pounds

234
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,240
to the current 3.8 pounds.

235
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,960
This is a sniper rifle,

236
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,560
but also a recon rifle.

237
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,200
Now its trigger pull

238
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,012
isn't just good
for long-range sniping,

239
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,680
it's even better for
close range assault.

240
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,040
Feel it.

241
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,399
Try it.

242
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,440
Every weapon has its own story

243
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:52,109
and its secret.

244
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,680
Their appearance may look the same,

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,120
but the degree of wear and tear
of each part inside,

246
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,760
the twists of each screw,

247
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,270
are different.

248
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,520
This is why

249
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,240
the accuracy of each gun
is slightly different.

250
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,680
And this tiny difference

251
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
is just like the Achilles heel,

252
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,200
it's fatal on the battlefield.

253
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:17,194
The gun has its weaknesses,

254
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:21,680
but it's people, not guns,
that win the battle.

255
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,960
We all have a break-in
period with the gun we use.

256
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:26,680
From adapting to getting used to it,

257
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,031
we keep improving the accuracy

258
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:29,595
to avoid this problem.

259
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:31,720
You are not wrong.

260
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,800
But that is for people
to get used to the gun.

261
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,040
What I want to do

262
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,240
is for the gun to get
used to its shooter.

263
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,680
No matter who picks it up,

264
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:44,960
the shooter will be able to
aim at his target instantly.

265
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
Aiming system in the future

266
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:47,815
is computerized.

267
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:49,715
It'll rely on scientific computing,

268
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,155
rather than personal perception.

269
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,155
Achieving the overall
physical consistency

270
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,195
through personalized adjustment,

271
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:57,440
that is what I'm after.

272
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,120
The lunch boxes have names on them.

273
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,239
Find your name.

274
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,514
(Name: Xiao Yun Jie)

275
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:19,915
This dish is awesome.

276
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:21,475
I've been craving beef lately.

277
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:23,195
Yan,

278
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:24,978
come here. Sit with me.

279
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:31,665
What has gotten to him again?

280
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:33,194
Forget it. Let him be.

281
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,835
Xiao Xiao, let me see your dishes.

282
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,123
You got quite many dishes.

283
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,080
How come none of it is the same as mine?

284
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,680
It's fine. We can share our dishes.

285
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,120
Okay.

286
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:42,994
What are you doing?

287
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:45,515
Do not share your dishes.

288
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:48,154
This is yours.

289
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,114
This is too much.

290
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:53,315
Come on, share it with me.

291
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,495
Eat only the dishes
that are given to you.

292
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:56,475
You have to finish it.

293
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,760
This is an order from your superior.

294
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,199
Whose order is it?

295
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:01,035
Mine.

296
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,245
Is there a problem?

297
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:09,635
Captain Lu,

298
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,440
the dishes are quite abundant,

299
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:13,554
but it's too much.

300
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:15,520
It doesn't make sense
to finish it all by myself.

301
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:16,395
Sit down first.

302
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,120
The rice and dishes in front of you
may make little sense to you.

303
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:24,064
But it's actually the results
of many people's efforts.

304
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:25,864
Our kitchen squad's kitchen

305
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:27,360
has almost become a lab now.

306
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:30,320
The ingredients for each of your meals

307
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,853
are carefully selected and weighed

308
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:34,488
before they are cooked.

309
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:37,434
But why?

310
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:40,457
We don't mind eating big pot rice.

311
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,114
-Pei Ta Yan.
-Yes, sir.

312
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:44,595
Tell them

313
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:46,475
how all these meals are prepared.

314
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:47,648
Yes, sir.

315
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:50,840
I pulled everyone's

316
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:54,120
health information from Cheetah.

317
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,880
Based on each of
your height, weight, age,

318
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:02,080
gender, allergens
and physical indicators,

319
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,440
and taking into account of
your years of service in the army,

320
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:07,834
and your primary duty in the team,

321
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,275
we made a personalized
diet plan for you.

322
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:15,674
Xiao Yun Jie,

323
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:19,159
you just became
automatic rifleman, right?

324
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:23,599
In a combat situation,

325
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,474
in addition to carrying a machine gun,

326
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:27,240
you have to carry a lot
of ammunition as well.

327
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,080
You need to have great
weight-bearing ability.

328
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,800
And if you encounter
an encounter battle,

329
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,880
you need to get to the best concealed
firing position in a short time

330
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,280
to set up the machine gun
to suppress fire.

331
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:42,400
So, your need is to build up

332
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,760
explosive strength and muscle groups
with uniform weight-bearing capacity.

333
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:47,275
In terms of diet,

334
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:50,400
it means you require a lot of protein

335
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
and vitamin B2.

336
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:54,474
So you need to eat more
cucumbers, potatoes,

337
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:55,515
organic cauliflowers.

338
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:57,680
For meat, you need to
eat more beef and pork loin.

339
00:17:57,795 --> 00:17:59,595
As for fish, you can have prawns,

340
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:00,955
carps and eels.

341
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:03,824
Fruit should be mainly bananas, oranges.

342
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:07,186
In addition, you are now
in a period of muscle growth,

343
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:09,816
so extra egg whites

344
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:12,372
are added for you.

345
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:16,635
Then, my diet plan

346
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:19,760
is focused on enhancing vision
and stamina, right?

347
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:20,754
Yes.

348
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,840
Your food mainly
replenish your vitamin A,

349
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:27,280
vitamins B1, B2, B6 and B12.

350
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:29,474
And high carbs that

351
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:30,760
increase glycogen reserves.

352
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:33,954
And you need to avoid eating greasy

353
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:35,155
and indigestible food.

354
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:38,754
The cooking method is
mainly boiling and steaming.

355
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:41,160
We'll juice all the fruit for you.

356
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,600
This facilitates the
absorption of sugar.

357
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:46,675
So good.

358
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,480
Xiao, that's a good one.

359
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:50,034
Go up, go up.

360
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:50,914
Harder.

361
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,514
A little lower.

362
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,795
You're enjoying this. Get up. My turn.

363
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:06,995
How is it?

364
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:08,995
It's okay.

365
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:10,835
Let me tell you,

366
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,146
there is an art in massaging.

367
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:15,035
Our skin is thick,

368
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:17,035
we need to use the
strength of our elbow.

369
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:18,800
Otherwise, it won't press through.

370
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,240
The muscles won't be able to relax.

371
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,960
You're talking too much.

372
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,601
Just tell me if it's working or not.

373
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:26,154
-Yes, it is working indeed.
-Feels different, right?

374
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:29,234
This is a muscle relaxation technique
I learned from Su today.

375
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:30,315
Now I get to practise it on you.

376
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:31,154
Hands off me.

377
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:32,754
You called him Su?

378
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,754
What an affectionate address.

379
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,059
Su.

380
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:44,555
Wait.

381
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:47,074
Let me see your razor.

382
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:52,834
Looks nice. When did you buy this?

383
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:55,954
I borrowed it from Pei Ta Yan.

384
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,114
Xu Yang,

385
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,702
I see what's happening here.

386
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,354
You've been captured by

387
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:04,415
his sugar-coated bullets.

388
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
This is for the cleanliness
of my appearance.

389
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,079
Pei Ta Yan said

390
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:12,701
it is not only about the appearance,

391
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,680
but it also represents the
self-discipline of a soldier.

392
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
Otherwise, we would look bad
when we're abroad.

393
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:19,680
Since when did you become so obedient?

394
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:21,154
You listen to whatever he said.

395
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:22,680
He has got a good point.

396
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,474
And you have to admit that
they really are good.

397
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:28,040
Like today, after Mao Lang
finished adjusting the guns,

398
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,960
our shots were indeed more
accurate than before.

399
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:33,200
They have studied their
respective fields thoroughly,

400
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:35,240
and then, put their strength into
good use to work with each other.

401
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,320
They are different from
common squad of soldiers.

402
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:39,480
They are highly educated.

403
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:41,360
It's true that they
are stronger than us.

404
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,195
Fine, they are strong.

405
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,480
What do you mean
they are stronger than us?

406
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,795
Besides,

407
00:20:48,195 --> 00:20:49,555
I was afraid that they weren't strong.

408
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:51,435
It's good that
this is a challenge for us.

409
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:52,539
It's worth

410
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:54,354
for us to work hard to surpass them.

411
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:55,235
Listen to that,

412
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:56,954
now that's ambition.

413
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:59,195
Save it. I don't want to waste
my time with you anymore.

414
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:00,034
Where are you going?

415
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:01,514
I'm going to look for Yan.

416
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,594
It's so late now.
I need to check on him.

417
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:04,806
By the way,

418
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:06,635
what you just said to me,

419
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,360
you mustn't say it in front of him.

420
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,874
Got it. Don't worry.

421
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:12,635
Return that razor.

422
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,600
It's true that
they are stronger than us.

423
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:27,714
It's rare to see that

424
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,440
you're not memorizing
foreign language or training.

425
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,760
What are you looking at?

426
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:34,234
What is there to see?

427
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:38,158
This is good.

428
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:40,435
You should relax a little.

429
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:41,795
As I said it before,

430
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:43,675
don't strain yourself too much.

431
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:54,555
The pear is sweet.

432
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:56,994
Pear.

433
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:59,234
As a shooter,

434
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,555
you need to enhance your
speed and explosive strength.

435
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:02,515
You should eat more

436
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:04,074
carbs that are easily absorbed,

437
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:06,714
as well as vitamin B, vitamin C,

438
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:09,120
phosphorus and protein.

439
00:22:09,435 --> 00:22:12,114
Like the brown rice you ate today...

440
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:13,274
You're learning. That's good.

441
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:15,355
Keep going.

442
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:18,473
Actually, I think

443
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,840
that Pei guy made a good point.

444
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:23,754
Our training volume is super high now.

445
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:26,915
Our nutrition really
needs to keep up with it.

446
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:30,354
You think they're strong.

447
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:38,080
That's a fact.

448
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:39,716
You can admit it.

449
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,520
I thought we were just growing up,

450
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:49,915
but compared to them,

451
00:22:50,754 --> 00:22:52,234
it feels like we are already old.

452
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
Veterans have the advantage
of being veterans.

453
00:22:56,594 --> 00:22:57,714
Like you said,

454
00:22:57,915 --> 00:23:01,040
no matter how good the equipment is,
it needs someone to operate it.

455
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,074
I just think that

456
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,834
it's a good thing that we
complement each other.

457
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:09,555
Stop competing with them.

458
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,385
I've stopped long ago.

459
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:17,714
It's just that when I looked at them,

460
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,721
I often wonder

461
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,533
who can represent the future of Cheetah?

462
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:24,795
Us

463
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:27,474
or Pei Ta Yan?

464
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,920
You see,

465
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,320
you're still competing with him.

466
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,354
Ta Yan.

467
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:40,555
We'll see who can fly higher at the end.

468
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:15,834
Brave soldiers,

469
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,515
I have before me

470
00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:21,714
teams from special forces
of 16 countries.

471
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:24,795
On behalf of the general assembly,

472
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:28,594
I want to extend to you a warm welcome

473
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:30,195
to the 12th

474
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:34,035
Warrior Special Forces
International Competition.

475
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,515
Our event is

476
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:41,675
one of the leading special forces
competition all over the world.

477
00:24:41,675 --> 00:24:44,760
It started in 2009, and since then,

478
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:48,569
it has drawn
wide attention internationally.

479
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:52,840
And it has also generated
a positive impact.

480
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:56,994
Counter-terrorism is becoming
more and more complex

481
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:59,562
and tense all around the world.

482
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,555
And special forces

483
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:05,114
are a key component of
the combat against terrorism.

484
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,435
This year's contest will be based

485
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:09,714
on skills.

486
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:11,275
The Warrior Competition

487
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:16,395
is a collective effort carried out
by the combat team.

488
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,955
And the project designed
is based on real life situation.

489
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,986
I wish you a great performance.

490
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:26,080
And I declare

491
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,450
that the 12th Warrior Special Forces
International Competition

492
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:32,114
is now open!

493
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,240
What did the chairman say on stage?

494
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:41,800
Do you guys understand?

495
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,080
His English pronunciation
isn't standard.

496
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:45,960
He speaks with an accent.
I couldn't understand it.

497
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,480
Don't communicate if you
don't understand. Talk less.

498
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:49,835
Okay.

499
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,915
Honey, are you here for the game too?

500
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:55,114
My dear, the sand is too hard.

501
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:56,680
Their English sounds standard.

502
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:59,514
I think I understand them.
They're saying girls can't do well here.

503
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:00,394
Right?

504
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:02,315
Come on, honey.

505
00:26:13,395 --> 00:26:14,195
Bye.

506
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:15,594
See you next time.

507
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,400
This communication is good,
better than talking.

508
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,360
I'm showing you an example.

509
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,720
Buddy!

510
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:27,834
Xie!

511
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:28,994
Hi! Hi!

512
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:33,994
Sergei, how are you?

513
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:37,474
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

514
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:39,834
This is Yan Po Yue.
My other good friend.

515
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:40,714
Good.

516
00:26:40,874 --> 00:26:43,320
This is Sergei. I met him in
the last competition.

517
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:45,675
He can't speak English too.
They are my friends.

518
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:49,915
-I mean...
-What is he doing?

519
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:52,074
This is the way they display affection.
At least he didn't try to kiss you.

520
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:53,354
I think she doesn't like me.

521
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:55,074
Yes, yes. How have you been?

522
00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:56,840
Did you come with
the same members from last time?

523
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,560
This time, did you come
here with your old friends?

524
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,319
Okay, okay! Very good!

525
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:07,320
Okay! Whatever you say!

526
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,675
Okay. We need to go take a rest.

527
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:11,600
See you later.

528
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,960
Good!

529
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,994
Okay, okay. No problem. See you!

530
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,920
Who was that guy?

531
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:20,634
Didn't I tell you already?

532
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:22,280
Sergei, from Country R.

533
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:23,807
I met him during the
last Warrior Competition.

534
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,240
You guys have no idea what
each other are talking about.

535
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,120
-Yet you seem like you had fun.
-What fun did I have?

536
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:31,320
His smile was so awkward.

537
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,680
Xiao, so he's an old friend.

538
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:35,560
More like an old rival.

539
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:36,955
Hold on.

540
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:37,874
What's wrong?

541
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:41,315
Is this really necessary?

542
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:43,195
Clear to go. Next.

543
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:44,594
Seriously.

544
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,200
I suspect that there
is something on you.

545
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:48,160
Come on. I just took a shower.

546
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:13,400
A bug.

547
00:28:14,874 --> 00:28:16,400
This is such a dirty move.

548
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:17,635
I'm going to report them to
the organizing committee.

549
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:18,435
It's useless.

550
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:19,915
They will deny it.

551
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:21,880
The moment we stepped foot in here,

552
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:23,840
the game has already begun.

553
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,960
No wonder Xiao Xiao said
don't communicate and talk less.

554
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:30,040
Sergei's affection was all fake.

555
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,000
He's very cunning.

556
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:34,155
He's the strategist in their team.

557
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:35,355
You'll see.

558
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:44,858
I can't believe you found it so soon.

559
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,960
By the way, Yan,

560
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,800
the female officer next to the podium
just now looks quite pretty.

561
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,960
What country do you think she's from?

562
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,019
Have you never seen a woman before?

563
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,200
I'm just initiating a chit-chat.

564
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:10,353
South Korea?

565
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,040
Doesn't look like it.

566
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,040
Japan?

567
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:14,115
No.

568
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:15,754
Southeast Asia?

569
00:29:18,515 --> 00:29:19,754
Her name is Katherine Hu.

570
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:20,595
Chinese-born.

571
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:22,194
She belongs to
Country S's special forces,

572
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,235
proficient in mountain warfare
and sniper warfare.

573
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:27,195
In special forces circle, she is
a famous expert in mountain warfare.

574
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,516
Sounds tough.

575
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:32,155
We should let her fight Xiao Xiao then.

576
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:33,995
Am I right, Xiao Xiao?

577
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:35,954
If she joins the combat,

578
00:29:36,114 --> 00:29:37,994
she will be a very tough opponent.

579
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:40,153
She has a nickname in the field,

580
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:42,315
White Phantom.

581
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,720
Yeah, right. I can also
call her Black Fear.

582
00:29:55,035 --> 00:29:56,515
Hi there, beautiful ghost.

583
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,719
Hi, Jason.

584
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,679
Are we going to meet on the battlefield?

585
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:06,674
Maybe.

586
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:07,834
I wish don't.

587
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:09,874
As soon as the beast
lays his eyes on the beauty,

588
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:11,675
the beast has already lost.

589
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:15,915
For the honour of Country A, you won't.

590
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:17,594
Five consecutive champions.

591
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:19,035
You cannot let it go.

592
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:28,074
The organizing committee
has kept their lips tight

593
00:30:28,074 --> 00:30:29,354
on the content of this competition.

594
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:31,435
Only two things can
be determined so far.

595
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:33,594
First, the difficulty of
the event is increased.

596
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:36,314
Second, it's closely similar to
the actual combat against terrorism.

597
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:37,115
Therefore,

598
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:40,395
scope of the competition content
will be expanded to the maximum.

599
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,874
Like hostage rescue, alley warfare,

600
00:30:43,195 --> 00:30:44,635
combat in confined spaces,

601
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:46,954
precision shooting,
obstacle-crossing shooting,

602
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:49,275
special rescue, rapid transfer,

603
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:50,635
all of these will be involved.

604
00:30:51,555 --> 00:30:53,035
Instead of guessing
the possible content,

605
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,915
we should pay more attention
to our opponents.

606
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:57,555
There are only two opponents that really

607
00:30:57,754 --> 00:30:58,675
need our attention.

608
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:02,555
Country A, claimed to be
strongest military in the world,

609
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:03,994
is also the team that caused us

610
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:05,954
to end up as a runner-up
in the last competition.

611
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:08,555
The other one is Country R.

612
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:10,555
Country R has been defeated
over the past few years,

613
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:11,994
but they have bounced back.

614
00:31:11,994 --> 00:31:14,754
Their strength is increasing rapidly.
They're a tough opponent too.

615
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:35,155
Huzzah!

616
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:36,315
Huzzah!

617
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:39,354
Huzzah!

618
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:13,435
Chinese team,

619
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:14,994
ready so soon?

620
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:17,635
We get ready all the time.

621
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:23,834
Announcement of the game.

622
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:25,834
At 7am today,

623
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,800
a passenger plane was hijacked
by armed terrorists

624
00:32:29,874 --> 00:32:31,435
over S Country.

625
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:34,114
S Country sent fighter jet
to land the plane.

626
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:36,594
This organization has assembled

627
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:39,675
a group of mercenaries
from all over the world.

628
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:43,035
They're well trained and
have rich combat experience.

629
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:47,195
Recently, they have carried out
a series of terrorist attacks

630
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,234
to show their will and mentality.

631
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,035
The plane will land at
the Joint Command Center

632
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:53,994
military airfield in 20 minutes.

633
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:55,915
There are a total of 33 passengers

634
00:32:55,915 --> 00:32:57,714
and five crew members on board.

635
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,679
Unknown number of terrorist.

636
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:01,275
Unknown purpose.

637
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:05,354
We should do all the best.

638
00:33:05,354 --> 00:33:06,714
Thank you, ma'am.

639
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:18,427
Did you understand the mission just now?

640
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:20,114
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir!

641
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:22,475
You understood?

642
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:24,475
Tell me then,

643
00:33:24,874 --> 00:33:25,675
what did she say?

644
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,039
Hostage, right?

645
00:33:34,474 --> 00:33:35,274
Plane.

646
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:36,995
Airplane.

647
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:39,875
Anti-hijacking plane. It's obvious.

648
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:41,994
All you got are two key words.

649
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:45,114
What about the number of passengers
on board, number of crew members,

650
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:46,155
the number of terrorists?

651
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,555
33 passengers on board.

652
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:55,915
Five crew members.

653
00:33:56,195 --> 00:33:57,715
Number of terrorists unknown.

654
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,720
This is the only valuable
information she provided.

655
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,040
The negotiator is currently
talking to the terrorists,

656
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:09,635
but they are playing hardball.

657
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:11,114
The negotiation isn't going well.

658
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:12,833
According to the setting,

659
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,073
the plane that was hijacked

660
00:34:14,074 --> 00:34:16,680
is a modified An-26 passenger aircraft.

661
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,840
This is the interior construction map
of the plane.

662
00:34:20,353 --> 00:34:21,199
Goodness.

663
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:24,514
It's all in Russian.

664
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:25,914
That's right.

665
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:26,955
Prior to the exercise,

666
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:28,920
all projects are kept confidential.

667
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:31,640
The organizer only gave us
drawings marked in Russian.

668
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:35,153
Can you translate it into Chinese?

669
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,435
English is fine too.

670
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:39,753
It'll take 40 minutes to
translate it into Chinese.

671
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,799
We only have 10 minutes
to work out our operation plan.

672
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:45,360
Stand up. I'll take it from here.

673
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:55,793
This is a modified An-26B

674
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:59,915
short-to-medium-haul aircraft
designed by Antonov

675
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:03,794
of the former Soviet Union.

676
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,961
Its fuselage is 23.8 meters long,

677
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,400
its wingspan is 29.2 meters,

678
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:18,195
and its wing height is 8.5 meters.

679
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:20,794
There is an aircrew hatch,

680
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:22,554
which is 1.4 meters high

681
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:25,235
and 0.6 meters wide.

682
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,074
For the first day of the competition,

683
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:33,834
each team will have to assault

684
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,000
a hijacked passenger plane.

685
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:37,834
On board of the plane,

686
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,604
there are 33 passengers,

687
00:35:41,074 --> 00:35:43,074
but the number of terrorists

688
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:44,755
is unknown.

689
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:47,715
The score and the tactical point

690
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:51,074
will be based on the faster
the completion time,

691
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:56,834
the higher number of
terrorists killed or captured,

692
00:35:57,034 --> 00:36:01,475
the lower number of injuries or
casualties among the hostages,

693
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:05,595
and the lower number of
team members eliminated.

694
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:07,955
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

695
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:08,955
Good luck!

696
00:36:11,274 --> 00:36:12,675
The increase in difficulty from

697
00:36:12,675 --> 00:36:14,034
previous anti-hijacking drills is

698
00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:16,114
first, we are not familiar with

699
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:17,394
old model Soviet aircraft like this.

700
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:19,475
Second, it was flown in from
other country and forced landed.

701
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:21,275
We must take into account
the factors of that other country.

702
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:22,114
Third,

703
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:24,395
we are still unclear about
the terrorists' ultimate purpose.

704
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:25,274
Any opinion?

705
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,234
This plane's cargo hold is very large.

706
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,480
Can we sneak into the cargo hold
from the bottom of the plane,

707
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:39,274
and break in through
the floor door and other hatches

708
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,480
at the same time?

709
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
We are still uncertain about
the modification of this aircraft.

710
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:48,514
An-26 was designed to be

711
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:50,314
a standard military cargo plane,

712
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,675
but the aircraft we're dealing with here

713
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:55,040
could be a passenger plane,

714
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,360
or a transport plane,

715
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,880
or an airdrop plane.

716
00:36:58,074 --> 00:36:58,874
Therefore,

717
00:36:59,415 --> 00:37:00,640
this idea isn't feasible.

718
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,400
Gu Meng,

719
00:37:02,915 --> 00:37:03,880
when the event starts,

720
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:06,594
return to the command centre
immediately and use the laser microphone

721
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:08,434
to eavesdrop on the whole process
of other teams' mission.

722
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,114
I need you to collect
as much as possible

723
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:12,395
all the instructions, communication,

724
00:37:12,395 --> 00:37:13,995
number and frequency of shots fired

725
00:37:14,114 --> 00:37:15,674
by the other teams during the mission,

726
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:18,354
including the number
of meals and cutlery

727
00:37:18,354 --> 00:37:19,874
given to the hostages and terrorists.

728
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,475
Filter out the most useful information.

729
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:22,515
-Yes, sir.
-Wait.

730
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:29,120
Don't you think this is a little nasty?

731
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,320
Vice captain,

732
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,000
this isn't a sporting event,

733
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,320
this is war.

734
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,199
The first priority of special warfare
is to gather as much

735
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:39,354
accurate intelligence as possible
before the battle.

736
00:37:40,915 --> 00:37:42,160
We split into three groups!

737
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,120
Two assault teams, one sniper team.

738
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,759
-Team A, Pei Ta Yan, Ren Xiao Chuan...
-Yes, sir!

739
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,034
-Su Jian Fan.
-Yes, sir!

740
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:49,474
In charge of security gate break-in.

741
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,920
Team B, Yan Po Yue.

742
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:54,715
Yes, sir.

743
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,834
-Xiao Yun Jie.
-Yes, sir.

744
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:57,874
-Xu Yang.
-Yes, sir.

745
00:37:57,874 --> 00:37:59,154
In charge of cargo hold break-in.

746
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:01,114
-Sniper team. Guo Xiao Xiao.
-Yes, sir.

747
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,395
-Mao Lang.
-Yes, sir.

748
00:38:02,475 --> 00:38:04,760
Cover both sides outside the cabin.

749
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:05,880
Is that clear, everyone?

750
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:06,920
Yes, sir!

751
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,520
The combat readiness time is over.

752
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,240
The R team goes first.

753
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,760
The other teams gather.

754
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,796
And the tactical discussion stopped.

755
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:21,874
Copy.

756
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,514
Don't move!

757
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:35,914
Go!

758
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,360
Go!

759
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:40,834
Go!

760
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,114
If you don't get back, I'll kill him!

761
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,995
I'll give you one minute
to leave this plane

762
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,039
if you want to stay alive.

763
00:39:55,554 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm not joking, get back!

764
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:58,920
One minute.

765
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:28,440
There are over 30 people on the plane.

766
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,921
If you don't get back,

767
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:32,475
I'll kill everyone per minute.

768
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:34,080
I'll kill everyone!

769
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,161
With what?

770
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,280
The air in your hand?

771
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:43,400
Forced attack!

772
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,840
This is the determination
as a fighting nation.

773
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,320
2 minutes and 30 seconds. They're fast.

774
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,920
Their method is rough,

775
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,800
the result can't be gentle.

776
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,200
There is no way our country's
pilots won't put up a fight!

777
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,360
Loser!

778
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,081
From breaking into the cabin
to killing every terrorist,

779
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:47,640
it took them less than five minutes.

780
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,240
They have

781
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:50,360
broken records.

782
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:52,082
Be patient.

783
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,400
See what the organizing
committee will say.

784
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,760
Sir.

785
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,360
I declare

786
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,800
that Team R has completed the mission

787
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,840
in 4 minutes and 34 seconds.

788
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:14,675
All four terrorists were killed.

789
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,880
And there were no casualties
on the side of the team members.

790
00:42:21,354 --> 00:42:22,154
However,

791
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:24,720
there were four injured hostages.

792
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,240
And among them, one got a broken arm.

793
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:30,953
Our medical team examined

794
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:34,240
the passenger with broken arm.
And found out

795
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,120
that his injuries was caused
by the team members.

796
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,321
Also, Team R has used anaesthetics

797
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:43,040
on the injured passengers.

798
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:45,880
This is extremely dangerous.
