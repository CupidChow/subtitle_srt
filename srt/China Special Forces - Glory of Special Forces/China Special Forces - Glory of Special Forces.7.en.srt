00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,040
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,076
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:33,840
(Episode 7)

4
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,239
Here comes the third test.

5
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,320
In the midst of a war,

6
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,239
you're required to build a stove,
start a fire and cook.

7
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:40,400
You need to cook
four dishes and one soup.

8
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,400
The company that
prepares a complete meal first wins.

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,040
Sure.

10
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,800
Let's do it here.

11
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,440
Guo.

12
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,639
Four of you,

13
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:46,800
go there.

14
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:47,480
Yes.

15
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,840
Squad leader.

16
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,320
Let me build the stove.

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
We need a smokeless stove.

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,400
Do you still remember how to do it?

19
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,519
I don't remember.

20
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,480
How can you forget?

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,519
I really don't remember.

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,040
I...

23
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,120
As long as it's a competition,

24
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,680
I'll make sure we win.

25
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,160
You little brat.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,960
One, two, three, four...

27
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,559
All right, stop digging.

28
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,680
Get the woods ready.

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,560
Guo.

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,040
-Guo!
-Yes?

31
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,440
Set up the fire.

32
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,440
Squad leader.

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,240
Squad leader.

34
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,200
Say it.

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,919
We can't set up the fire.

36
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,640
What's wrong?

37
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
We lost the solid alcohol.

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,160
How did that happen?

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,280
I have no idea.

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
It was there when we're in the fight.

41
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,360
We must've lost it somewhere.

42
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,479
Now...

43
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,440
That's all we have.

44
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,679
What are you...

45
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,080
What are you waiting for?

46
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,199
Go find some branches.

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,519
I'll go now.

48
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,199
Tian Bao, let's go.

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Don't just stand here idly.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,279
Go get some branches!

51
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,080
Push it in.

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,636
Push it in.

53
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,997
You're blocking the opening.

54
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,119
You need to lift it

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
and leave a gap so that air can go in.

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,040
Has the fire started?

57
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,239
Hurry up!

58
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,000
Hurry up.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,600
Company One's stoves are working.

60
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,119
Only one of our stoves is working.
What should we do?

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,920
Whose fault is this?

62
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,839
Whose fault is this?

63
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,640
You can't blame me, right?

64
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:03,086
Yan Po Yue!

65
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,800
Here!

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Put the ingredient in.

67
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,839
The water is not boiling yet.
We can't put in the ingredient.

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,598
We're running out of time.

69
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,440
We can't afford to wait any longer.

70
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,040
Bring it over.

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
-What are you doing?
-That's tofu.

72
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,280
We're required
to cook four dishes and one soup.

73
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,520
Now, you're only making soup.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,320
What about the dishes?

75
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,559
Can we do that?

76
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,920
Fine, we don't have a choice anyway.

77
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,760
Let's do it.

78
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,080
-Are you serious?
-Do it.

79
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,920
Here, give it to me.

80
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,040
We need more meat.

81
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,360
Come on, make the fire bigger.

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
We're behaving in a brash way.

83
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,239
Report, Staff Officer Zhang.

84
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,799
Company One Kitchen Squad
is done with cooking.

85
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,600
Based on the requirement
of four dishes and one soup,

86
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,559
we've completed the meal.

87
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,520
We have scrambled eggs with tomatoes,

88
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:55,720
sauteed shredded pork with green pepper,

89
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
braised beef with potatoes,

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,079
and blanched lettuce.

91
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,160
Lastly, we have rice
to go with seaweed soup.

92
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,320
Not bad.

93
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,320
Time spent
is one hour and thirty minutes.

94
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,240
What about Company Two?

95
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,839
Report, Staff Officer Zhang.

96
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,160
Company Two Kitchen Squad
has completed the mission.

97
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,120
We have braised eggplants,

98
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
braised pork,

99
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
stir-fried winter melon
with dried shrimps,

100
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,280
and fried eggs with onions.

101
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,880
Lastly, we have rice
to go with egg soup.

102
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:34,869
Time?

103
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,119
Time spent is one hour
and thirty minutes.

104
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,840
What about Special Service Company?

105
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,560
It's a coincidence.

106
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,000
It also took them one hour
and thirty minutes.

107
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,840
Since the amount of time
spent is the same,

108
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
we have to access
in term of the flavour.

109
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,640
Report!

110
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,239
We didn't have enough fuel.

111
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,800
As we're running short of time,

112
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:54,040
under Yan Po Yue's suggestion,

113
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,600
we made four different types of

114
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,320
braised tofu.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,399
Yan Po Yue.

116
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,959
Here!

117
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,920
Share your view.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,519
Yes!

119
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,560
This is the first dish.

120
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:04,880
It's braised with dried bamboo shoots
and soy sauce with low heat.

121
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:06,343
The dried bamboo shoots are tender
while the tofu is flavourful.

122
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,903
It's delicious and the aftertaste
lingers for a long time in mouth.

123
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:09,903
It's known as braised tofu
with dried bamboo shoots.

124
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:14,582
This is the second dish.

125
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,343
It's made from pork, sugar and honey.

126
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:18,783
It's golden in colour
and it's appetising.

127
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:20,903
It's known as braised tofu
with sweet pork.

128
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:22,200
This is the third dish.

129
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:24,063
It's made from potato and egg.

130
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:27,503
It's known as

131
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:31,982
braised tofu with potato and egg.

132
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:36,862
This is the fourth dish.

133
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,063
It's cooked with rice wine and fermented
glutinous rice to bring up the flavor.

134
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:39,903
It's known as

135
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:41,422
braised tofu with wine.

136
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:43,223
We have also prepared another dish.

137
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:46,382
It's tofu soup
with fresh prawn and scallion oil.

138
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:52,223
What does that mean?

139
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:54,822
You're required to
make four dishes and one soup.

140
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:55,943
Aren't all of them the same?

141
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:57,822
Staff Officer Zhang.

142
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,183
Though the main ingredient
in the dishes is the same,

143
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:00,422
it tastes differently in each dish.

144
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,640
Give it a try.

145
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:02,783
Try it.

146
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,480
Please taste it.

147
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:37,840
Come on.

148
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,680
Come and give it a try.

149
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
Try it.

150
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:46,840
I'll announce the result now.

151
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,142
Company One and Two

152
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:50,543
completed the mission
within the stipulated time.

153
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,600
The Special Service Company

154
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,240
cooked four dishes with tofu

155
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,400
but they're indeed
four different dishes.

156
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,560
The Special Service Company
didn't violate the rules.

157
00:08:57,822 --> 00:08:58,640
I hereby announce

158
00:08:59,103 --> 00:08:59,942
all three companies

159
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,520
have completed the mission
at the same time.

160
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,720
The dishes are rich in flavours
and nutritious at the same time.

161
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,160
They can supply
adequate nutrients during war.

162
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,040
All three companies

163
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:08,240
get even in this test.

164
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,240
Very well!

165
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,560
The last test

166
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,520
is to cross the blockade set up
by the enemy

167
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,520
and send the dishes

168
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,120
to the command post of each company.

169
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,679
It's never-ending.
The test came one after another.

170
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:26,463
Why are we involved in the fight?

171
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:27,582
We're the kitchen squad.

172
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:29,223
Can't we just focus on cooking?

173
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:29,942
Slow down.

174
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,863
We're at the defense area
of Company One.

175
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Don't move!

176
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:45,160
Stay alert, everyone.

177
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,680
Help!

178
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,360
Did I step on a landmine?

179
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,640
Why am I so unlucky?

180
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Don't worry.

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Squad leader.

182
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,560
I think I've just
stepped on a landmine too.

183
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:22,440
Stay alert.

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
You stepped on a lump of cow dung.

185
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,440
You're startled for nothing.

186
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,360
Move forward, now.

187
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:52,833
Squad leader.

188
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:54,880
The grass is trampled.

189
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:56,742
I think there's an ambush ahead.

190
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,182
Should we keep going forward?

191
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:01,223
Stay here.

192
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:03,423
Yan Po Yue and I
are going to scout the trail.

193
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,400
Be careful, Yan.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,622
Li.

195
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,118
(Observer)

196
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:09,343
Company One's line of defense
is really long.

197
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:10,622
We need to find the breach

198
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:11,663
and make a clean sweep
of their command post.

199
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:12,742
Check out the west cliff.

200
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:13,903
That's the weak spot for defense.

201
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:18,863
Attention, Platoons Two and Three.

202
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:19,783
Gather the force.

203
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:21,622
Attack from Spot E.

204
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,000
What's going on?

205
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:26,560
Report!

206
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:27,800
The communication equipment
has stopped working.

207
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,840
It's due to electronic interference.

208
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:31,182
Find the signal source
and clear the interference.

209
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:31,920
Yes!

210
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,520
Work harder, everyone!

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
Before lunch,

212
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,000
we'll make a clean sweep of the
Special Service Company's command post.

213
00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:00,463
Security team!

214
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:01,262
Here!

215
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:02,103
Form defence!

216
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:03,103
Yes!

217
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,582
Hurry up. Follow my lead!

218
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:08,742
Think that you can make a clean sweep
of our command post?

219
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:10,360
Dream on!

220
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:11,201
Both of you,

221
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:12,863
transfer Staff Officer Ai
to a safe place.

222
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:13,582
-Yes.
-Don't worry about me.

223
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:14,502
-Yes.
-Get back to work.

224
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,400
Let's go for the big battle.

225
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,640
You think you can fool me with landmine?

226
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,480
You've met your match today.

227
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,680
Fan.

228
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,382
You didn't teach me this skill before.

229
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,440
Can you stomach all the skills at once?

230
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
You'd better master
cooking skills first.

231
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,303
Fan, be gentle!

232
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:26,103
Be gentle!

233
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,200
Cut the crap.

234
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:28,413
Stay still.

235
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
Come clean to me.

236
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,800
Where is your command post?

237
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,040
That's enough. Don't go too far.

238
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,023
You're just a cook.

239
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:39,182
We're nevertheless soldiers.

240
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,240
Now,

241
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,360
you're just captives!

242
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,639
Stop messing around! It's expensive!

243
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,881
Can you afford to pay if you break it?

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,041
Who are you bluffing?

245
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:58,622
It's clear at one sight.

246
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,457
Take a look.

247
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:01,062
Look at these red dots.

248
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,903
These are the deployment of Company One.

249
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
It's pointless to find out
about the deployment now.

250
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:07,182
The battle has come to an end.

251
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:08,720
We're merely on patrol duties.

252
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:09,742
Our main force

253
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,800
has laid their fingers on the Special
Service Company's command post.

254
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:12,702
Now,

255
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:14,920
I'm certain they're almost gone.

256
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:16,400
Are you guys delivering food to them?

257
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:17,863
You don't have to go there anymore.

258
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,463
Just go back
and have lunch at the cafeteria.

259
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:22,062
Sure.

260
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,463
Keep boasting.

261
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:25,142
We cut off the communication

262
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:26,702
with a drone jammer.

263
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,859
Your main force

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,880
has no idea that the command post
has been ambushed.

265
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:31,000
Now,

266
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,622
they're still hiding in the trench.

267
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:34,903
Who is the captain of your main force?

268
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:36,423
Squad Leader One,

269
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:37,582
Xiao Fei!

270
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:39,582
Very well.

271
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:41,582
The Dragon, Tiger, and Dog.

272
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:44,343
Who is that lad to be ahead of me?

273
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,960
Finally, I get to meet him today.

274
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,159
Two of you!

275
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,840
Go!

276
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,680
Go further!

277
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:09,160
Go!

278
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,520
I...

279
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,120
Li Xiang!

280
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,440
You're coward!

281
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:25,382
I dare you to come out!

282
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:26,800
We'll have the ultimate showdown!

283
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:28,182
Comrades!

284
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:29,702
Staff Officer Ai is here,

285
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:30,742
don't embarrass yourself!

286
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:31,622
Today,

287
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:33,000
we must get out of the ambush!

288
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes!

289
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,841
Do it!

290
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:44,080
Squad leader.

291
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,818
What?

292
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:46,480
If this continues,

293
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,360
the main force of our enemy will
gain the upper hand in no time.

294
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,040
Go now.

295
00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:51,920
Get me the grenade launcher.

296
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:52,920
What?

297
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Get me the grenade launcher!

298
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:57,120
Yes!

299
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,040
Young kid.

300
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,343
Do you know what is this?

301
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,960
QLZ-87.

302
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:05,502
It's an automatic grenade launcher.

303
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:07,062
The good thing about this thing

304
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:08,423
is that it's light

305
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:09,983
but powerful.

306
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:11,423
The downside

307
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:14,223
is that the muzzle velocity
is really slow.

308
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,880
It runs at slightly more
than 100 meter per second.

309
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,119
Do you get it?

310
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,303
The curves...

311
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,081
The speed of the launched grenade

312
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:29,463
is not much faster

313
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:31,663
than the speed of the steel ball
you shoot with a slingshot.

314
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,040
It's just a slingshot in bigger size.

315
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,120
That's right!

316
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:46,040
You're a real man.

317
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:48,080
It's time to make an appearance.

318
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:55,142
Calling!

319
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,223
-Calling!
-How is it going?

320
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:57,142
Is the launcher here yet?

321
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,201
The communication is off!
I can't reach them!

322
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:17,982
After them!

323
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:18,840
What about the command post?

324
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:19,663
We'll crush them first!

325
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:38,382
Be careful.

326
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:45,479
Squad leader.

327
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,160
What's wrong?

328
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,262
I think I stepped on a landmine.

329
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:29,040
Fan!

330
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:31,440
Calm down!

331
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,222
Yan Po Yue!

332
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:35,800
Yan Po Yue!

333
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,640
I'm here.

334
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
How many of them did you put down?

335
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:56,859
Report, squad leader!

336
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:58,200
Five of them!

337
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
If we put down
Squad Leader Xiao and his comrade, too,

338
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,480
then Company One
is completely wiped out.

339
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:07,360
What are you doing?

340
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,680
Abide by the drill rules.

341
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Now, you're merely a dead body.

342
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
Yan Po Yue.

343
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,280
Don't let me see you again.

344
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,960
All you need to do is
to stop going to the cafeteria.

345
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,720
Lift your hand.

346
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,320
Calm down.

347
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:48,261
How many more grenades do they have?

348
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:49,183
Report, squad leader.

349
00:19:50,183 --> 00:19:50,982
They have seven grenades.

350
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,360
Look at this.

351
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,640
There is a huge red dot at the edge.

352
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,960
That's Company One's command post.

353
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:03,320
Let's make a clean sweep of it.

354
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Why is it so quiet?

355
00:20:24,462 --> 00:20:25,120
Are they gone?

356
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:26,680
Time for lunch!

357
00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:29,663
Chiefs! Leaders!

358
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,080
It's time for lunch!

359
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:32,622
Have it while it's still hot!

360
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:33,823
Hurry up!

361
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's still hot!

362
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,080
Could it be a trap?

363
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:41,840
Let me take a look.

364
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:42,659
Staff Officer Ai.

365
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,339
You...

366
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,177
Don't worry.

367
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,178
Staff Officer Ai!

368
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,040
Be careful!

369
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:50,943
That's right.

370
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,280
Over here.

371
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,240
Here?

372
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,440
Harder!

373
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:55,543
You have high pain tolerance.

374
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,378
Sir.

375
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:02,520
It's time for lunch.

376
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:08,800
How did you come here?

377
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,280
Nothing much, we came here
without much hustles.

378
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:12,982
Set up the tables and get lunch ready!

379
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,760
Yes!

380
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:14,520
It's time to eat!

381
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,080
Let's set up the tables!

382
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,200
Come on!

383
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:18,360
The battle has ended.

384
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,479
Let's eat!

385
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,120
Come on, comrades.

386
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:27,160
Where is Xiao Fei and the gang?

387
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,040
Xiao Fei...

388
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:29,360
I guess they're in the captive camp now.

389
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:33,862
Comrades, the battle has ended!

390
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:34,502
Come on, let's eat!

391
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,663
We don't have enough food!

392
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:37,262
Captives are not entitled to lunch!

393
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:38,742
First come, first serve!

394
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,400
-It's time for lunch.
-Hurry up!

395
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,960
Hurry up! Come on!

396
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,200
It's time to eat.

397
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,681
Hurry up! Have it while it's still hot.

398
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,680
It's been a long day.

399
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:49,423
Hurry up!

400
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:50,222
Come on!

401
00:21:52,982 --> 00:21:54,303
It's time to eat! Hurry up!

402
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:55,183
Hurry up!

403
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:56,543
Speed up!

404
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:57,663
Why are you hesitating?

405
00:21:57,703 --> 00:21:58,303
Come on!

406
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,840
Squad Leader Fan.

407
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,698
Here!

408
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:04,222
How did you do that?

409
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:06,280
Yan Po Yue!

410
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:06,978
Here!

411
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,120
He did it!

412
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,160
I did it under my squad leader's lead!

413
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,280
This is the first fight of

414
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:22,800
the Dragon, Tiger and Dog.

415
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:24,382
It's unexpected

416
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,239
that Dog won.

417
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:28,703
All thanks to your lead,
Company Commander!

418
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:31,423
We seized Company One's
communication devices

419
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,342
and raided their command post.

420
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,280
The drill result is out.

421
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:35,303
Special Service Company won!

422
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:37,600
Very well!

423
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,360
Now, you can have lunch at ease.

424
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:44,680
Very well!

425
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,920
Yan Po Yue.

426
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,160
Congratulations.

427
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:49,160
You wiped out
the enemy's base, once again.

428
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,280
It's an honour

429
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,400
to have you

430
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,200
on our side.

431
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,120
Let's eat.

432
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,399
Come one, let's eat.

433
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,680
Company Commander, this way.

434
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:03,400
Report, Regiment Commander!

435
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:04,027
Say it.

436
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,881
Special Service Company
counterattacked Company One.

437
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,120
Company One lose many soldiers.

438
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,440
They're unable to fight anymore.

439
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
It's only been three and half an hour.

440
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,400
It's faster than what I imagined.

441
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:15,382
Company One cut off

442
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:16,720
Special Service Company's
communication in total.

443
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:18,703
They're attacking the command post.

444
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,560
At that juncture, the main force
of Special Service Company

445
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:21,640
appeared all of a sudden.

446
00:23:21,982 --> 00:23:23,200
How did they get the news?

447
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,600
Contact Staff Officer Ai now.

448
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,400
We're still trying
to recover the communication.

449
00:23:27,316 --> 00:23:28,000
Forget it.

450
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:29,783
Get me the driver.
We'll go there on our own.

451
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:30,640
Yes!

452
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,000
Why are you sitting so close to me?

453
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,840
Don't you feel warm?

454
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
If someone attacks us now,
all of us will be wipe out at once.

455
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,679
Am I right?

456
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:46,026
Get up!

457
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,120
The Regiment Commander is here.

458
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,200
Stand up!

459
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:52,160
Salute!

460
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,160
Where is the Special Service Company?

461
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,161
They're up there.

462
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,440
More tofu and less meat
is good for your health.

463
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,822
Li.

464
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:29,280
All thanks to Yan Po Yue this time.

465
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
If it weren't for him,

466
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:31,560
we would have been wiped out.

467
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,800
The Regiment Commander is here.

468
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:36,342
Stand up!

469
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:40,480
Salute!

470
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:44,280
Sit down.

471
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,160
Good day, Regiment Commander.

472
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,360
What are you eating?

473
00:24:48,423 --> 00:24:49,543
-Tofu.
-Tofu.

474
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:50,440
It looks delicious.

475
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,241
Have you eaten, Regiment Commander?

476
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,960
I haven't eaten.

477
00:24:52,622 --> 00:24:53,360
Fan Jing.

478
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:54,183
-Here.
-Please take a seat.

479
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:54,880
Regiment Commander.

480
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:55,682
Kitchen squad!

481
00:24:55,763 --> 00:24:56,400
Get me a bowl and chopsticks.

482
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,320
-Yes!
-Yes!

483
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:58,560
Take a seat.

484
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:00,903
You...

485
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,440
All the dishes are made from tofu.

486
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,120
Is this a tofu feast?

487
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:06,120
Report, Regiment Commander.

488
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,880
The dishes are quite delicious.

489
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,920
Eat more.

490
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,440
Give me some soup.

491
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:13,262
In this drill,

492
00:25:13,382 --> 00:25:15,462
Company One cut off Special Service
Company's communication in total.

493
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,199
How did the main force get the news

494
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,320
and turn things around?

495
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:22,200
Yan Po Yue!

496
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,960
Here!

497
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:23,880
Report, Regiment Commander.

498
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
He was the one who cooked the dishes.

499
00:25:25,502 --> 00:25:26,640
He was also the one
who delivered the news.

500
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,102
Even Company One's command post

501
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:29,720
was completely destroyed by him.

502
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:30,880
I don't deserve the compliment,
Staff Officer Ai.

503
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,760
Everyone in the kitchen squad
has contributed.

504
00:25:33,423 --> 00:25:34,502
I'm just a cook.

505
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:36,303
I merely fulfilled my duty.

506
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,720
Chief.

507
00:25:38,783 --> 00:25:39,462
Enjoy the food.

508
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,800
Regiment Commander.

509
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Please eat. You may talk
to him after lunch.

510
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,680
She's right. The tofu
is quite delicious.

511
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,359
It's Special Service Company's
signature dish.

512
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:02,640
Those who eat it
always win speedy success.

513
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:07,823
Braised tofu!

514
00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:11,622
Everyone asks for tofu only.

515
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:13,823
There are other dishes.

516
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:15,183
Can't you ask for something else?

517
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:15,901
Squad leader.

518
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:16,903
We just want braised tofu!

519
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,382
Braised tofu!

520
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:21,640
Braised tofu guarantees speedy success!

521
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:23,823
I'm speechless.

522
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,142
Was it cooked by Yan Po Yue?

523
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:26,023
It has to be cooked by Yan Po Yue.

524
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,080
(As the saying goes, "Battalion is
always there but soldiers come and go".)

525
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:30,382
(It's never crossed my mind
that I would create a signature dish)

526
00:26:30,543 --> 00:26:32,423
(for Special Service Company.)

527
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:33,862
(From then on,)

528
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:35,063
(whenever new recruits join the army,)

529
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:37,303
(one night before the drill,)

530
00:26:37,703 --> 00:26:40,703
(everyone in Tiger Special Forces
will ask for braised tofu specifically.)

531
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,760
(Braised tofu)

532
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,080
-(guarantees speedy success!)
-Guo!

533
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:44,703
How long will the steamed bun
take to be ready?

534
00:26:44,742 --> 00:26:45,382
Twenty minutes!

535
00:26:45,423 --> 00:26:46,742
I think it's not enough.
I'm preparing for another batch.

536
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:48,183
Hurry up. We need more braised tofu.

537
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,399
Got it!

538
00:26:55,102 --> 00:26:56,183
My poor waist...

539
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:59,440
You sprain your waist
when you're carrying things.

540
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
You get a cramp when you chop
vegetables. What are you capable of?

541
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:03,720
Why don't you replace Yan
and be the cook?

542
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,920
You don't need a sledgehammer
to crack a nut.

543
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:08,622
A capable cook like me

544
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:10,183
should set up my own restaurant.

545
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:10,862
Think about it.

546
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:12,423
If we can turn this place
into a restaurant,

547
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,680
with the amount
of customers we have,

548
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,481
it's just a matter of time for us
to go on Forbes billionaire list.

549
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:17,480
Work hard, Yan.

550
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,120
We'll name the restaurant
Yan's Kitchen.

551
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,880
Sure.

552
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,640
Squad Leader Fan.

553
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,181
Staff Officer Ai.

554
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:32,783
It's raining heavily.
Why do you come here?

555
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,502
I'm working on the drill report.

556
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,882
I need confirmation on the details.

557
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,120
I want to talk to Yan Po Yue.

558
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,840
Is it okay?

559
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:45,342
Sure.

560
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,622
No problem at all!

561
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:48,382
Yan Po Yue!

562
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,023
Here!

563
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:51,742
Go now.

564
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:54,120
Share all the details
with Staff Officer Ai.

565
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,040
I haven't finished cooking
the braised tofu.

566
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,880
Just leave it!

567
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:57,840
Go now!

568
00:27:58,742 --> 00:27:59,360
Okay.

569
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,920
Do you know

570
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:18,862
who wrote this letter?

571
00:28:20,102 --> 00:28:20,960
I don't know.

572
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,920
But I would like to apologise to you.

573
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,862
I think the person who wrote the letter

574
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,337
didn't do it with ill intention.

575
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,018
Keep it.

576
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:33,262
You don't need help from anyone.

577
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:36,320
You can get what you want on your own.

578
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:42,800
Thank you.

579
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,920
When you have your feet on the ground,

580
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:47,360
you feel at ease.

581
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:58,120
Staff Officer Ai.

582
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,920
I've always wanted to ask you something.

583
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:07,982
It's okay
if you don't answer the question.

584
00:29:08,155 --> 00:29:08,920
Ask away.

585
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:11,920
With your educational background
and ability,

586
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:14,063
you can work at a better place

587
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,783
and play a greater value.

588
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,023
Why do you stay
in Rapid Deployment Brigade?

589
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,840
It's just a random question.

590
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,240
I'm sorry.

591
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:28,240
It's not a secret.

592
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,760
That's because my elder brother

593
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:36,520
used to work here too.

594
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,760
(The drill)

595
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,960
(was followed by seven days
of heavy rain.)

596
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,841
(The training in the camp has stopped.)

597
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
(This is the most leisure week
for the recruit company)

598
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,961
(since they joined the army.)

599
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Xiao, here you are.

600
00:30:14,742 --> 00:30:15,600
Are you busy?

601
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:16,982
No.

602
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,382
We're getting ready for lunch.

603
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:19,504
Do join us if you want.

604
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,801
I'll have late lunch today.

605
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,560
Well...

606
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:23,440
I'm going...

607
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,959
I need to use the washroom.

608
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,160
Both of you may start eating first.

609
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,200
The weather for the past few days
has been unusual.

610
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,663
The rain comes and goes.

611
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
Is that your lunch?

612
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:40,240
It's enough.

613
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,480
Yan.

614
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,160
You've earned some merits this time.

615
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,600
Everyone sees you

616
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,160
in a different way now.

617
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,121
I didn't notice that.

618
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,823
Can't we go back to the old time?

619
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:01,862
Nothing has changed.

620
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:04,342
We're comrades.

621
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:06,303
Comrades?

622
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:08,142
Are we just comrades?

623
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,943
Are we just comrades? Tell me.

624
00:31:14,063 --> 00:31:15,080
Look at me.

625
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,840
I was transferred
to combat platoon's squad alone.

626
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I've had enough torment.

627
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:19,262
Now, look at how you treat me.

628
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,681
Think about it...

629
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,000
You're now in combat platoon's squad.

630
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:24,240
You should take a rest
during lunch break.

631
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,680
Keep your regular hours so that
you can catch up with the training.

632
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,240
Are you chasing me away?

633
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:31,423
Tell me, are you chasing me away?

634
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:33,342
It's raining heavily now.

635
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,161
I'm sure we're
having theory classes in the afternoon.

636
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,440
You perform better than I do.

637
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:40,663
I mean it. Psycho King
transferred me instead of you.

638
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:41,600
He did that on purpose.

639
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,840
He's trying to provoke you.

640
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,720
I'm not provoked.

641
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:46,903
Are you sure?

642
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,920
Yan.

643
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:51,720
It's not easy to return
to combat platoon's squad.

644
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,800
But your performance
in the drill was outstanding.

645
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,280
You just have to go to
the Company Commander at the right time

646
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,280
and say something nice.

647
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:01,183
I know you're too proud to do that

648
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:02,943
but at times, you need to do something

649
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:04,703
to protect your dignity.

650
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:07,142
Respect needs to be earned,

651
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:09,063
not begged for.

652
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,120
I almost choked to death.

653
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:35,063
My family sent it to me from hometown.

654
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:36,622
Try it.

655
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:37,823
It's made of beef.

656
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:39,142
I'm done.

657
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:43,622
Aren't you obsessed with chilli?

658
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:45,222
I have pimples.

659
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:46,262
Taking chilli will make them worse.

660
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,783
Do you think Yan Po Yue's performance
in the drill was extraordinary?

661
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:56,943
Are you proud of him?

662
00:32:58,502 --> 00:32:59,982
You created the opportunity for him

663
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,901
so that he could enjoy the limelight.

664
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:02,760
That's not true.

665
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,280
He is capable in the first place.

666
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,120
It's not like he's completely
useless and incompetent.

667
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,140
He's a wolf

668
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,120
but you insist to keep the wolf
as a pet dog in the house.

669
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,920
That's a waste.

670
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,840
Why don't you transfer him back?

671
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:15,960
Be it Squad One

672
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,520
or Squad Two, it's fine.

673
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,240
Let him speak for himself.

674
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:26,880
You...

675
00:33:27,342 --> 00:33:28,040
By the way,

676
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:30,502
Guo Kui is going to town
to get food supply.

677
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:31,342
Along the way,

678
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,840
pick up two individuals for me.

679
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,400
When you reach there,

680
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,520
call this number.

681
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,040
Who am I picking up?

682
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:45,920
My mum

683
00:33:46,382 --> 00:33:47,760
and Xiao Ting.

684
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:50,142
Your mum and wife are here.

685
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,279
They came all the way here.

686
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:52,943
Watch your language.

687
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:54,102
We're not married yet.

688
00:33:54,102 --> 00:33:55,000
You can't address her as my wife yet.

689
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,801
It's just a matter of time.

690
00:33:58,462 --> 00:33:59,543
What you said

691
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,320
is not wrong.

692
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
Thank you for picking us up, Guo.

693
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,521
-Don't mention it.
-It's raining heavily.

694
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,319
Don't worry.

695
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm going to town to get food supply.

696
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,103
I merely pick you up on the way.

697
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,120
Guo, have some water.

698
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,560
It's okay. I don't need it.

699
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,639
Thank you for the offer, Mrs. Li.

700
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:27,622
You're welcome.

701
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:30,103
You'll see the Company Commander soon,

702
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,063
He always talks about you.

703
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:01,303
This tunnel

704
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:02,303
has been here for a while.

705
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:03,462
It's under maintenance.

706
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,222
Guo, drive slowly.

707
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:06,222
We're not in a rush.

708
00:35:06,343 --> 00:35:07,623
Don't worry, Madam Li.

709
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:09,023
I'm an experienced driver.

710
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:16,023
My goodness!

711
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:18,462
The truck is going so fast.

712
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,543
It must have exceeded the speed limit.

713
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:22,462
Truck drivers work day and night.

714
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:24,303
They don't even
have enough time to rest...

715
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:37,662
Stay here. Let me check out the truck.

716
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,280
Sure. Be careful.

717
00:36:02,182 --> 00:36:03,422
Hello!

718
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,280
Can you speak?

719
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,200
Hello!

720
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,159
Don't fall asleep! Stay awake!

721
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,280
Mrs. Li.

722
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:22,262
Lend me your phone.

723
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:22,960
Okay.

724
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,600
Take it.

725
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,400
Squad leader!

726
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,240
What happened?

727
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,720
An accident took place
in Tunnel One.

728
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:41,700
Guo Kui's supply vehicle is stuck there.

729
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,697
Is Guo okay?

730
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,520
He is okay

731
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,880
but Company Commander's mum and fiancee

732
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:45,942
are with him!

733
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,440
I've reported to the company.

734
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,760
The Company Commander is in a meeting.

735
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:50,742
After all, we're told to pick them up.

736
00:36:50,823 --> 00:36:51,902
We have to be there first
no matter what.

737
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,480
Mrs. Li.

738
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Take care of Madam Li.

739
00:37:01,783 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm fine.

740
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:04,262
Xiao Ting, help them out.

741
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,040
Sure.

742
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,280
Guo!

743
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:10,783
I'm a nurse.

744
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,720
Let me help you.

745
00:37:11,742 --> 00:37:12,422
Okay.

746
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:18,320
Hang in there.

747
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,640
Don't fall asleep!

748
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,360
Here.

749
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,360
Can you move?

750
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,680
Sir...

751
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,240
Thank you.

752
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,840
Here, give me your hand.

753
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,600
My legs are stuck.

754
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:14,400
Guo Kui!

755
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:15,902
Are you okay?

756
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:16,680
Yes.

757
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,200
Where is Madam Li?

758
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:19,640
She's in the car.

759
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
I told her to stay in the car.

760
00:38:21,436 --> 00:38:22,320
Yan Po Yue!

761
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:24,320
Take good care of Mrs. Li and Madam Li.

762
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,720
Come here. Grab it.

763
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,000
-Let me help you.
-I'm coming.

764
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,599
Slow down!

765
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,280
Be careful, Yan!

766
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:41,000
Hold my shoulder.

767
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,440
Here.

768
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,880
Yan, take his hand.

769
00:38:44,982 --> 00:38:45,583
Give me your hand.

770
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,360
Give it to them.

771
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,680
One, two, three!

772
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,640
Grab him tightly.

773
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,280
Here, Mrs. Li.

774
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,520
Slow down!

775
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,640
It's collapsing!

776
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,320
Run now!

777
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:10,742
Mum is still in the car!

778
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:11,623
I'll save her!

779
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:12,063
Run!

780
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:13,160
Run now!

781
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,160
Yan!

782
00:39:15,702 --> 00:39:16,303
Yan!

783
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:17,143
Yan Po Yue!

784
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:34,902
Yan!

785
00:39:36,982 --> 00:39:37,783
Yan!

786
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:38,623
Hurry up!

787
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:39,462
Slow down!

788
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:42,343
Mrs. Li!

789
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:43,702
Yan!

790
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:44,823
Mum!

791
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:45,502
Mrs. Li!

792
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,720
Let me in!

793
00:39:48,662 --> 00:39:50,103
I want to go inside!

794
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,280
Jin Cun, take care of Mrs. Li!

795
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,000
Mrs. Li!

796
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:54,143
Let go of me!

797
00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:55,023
Mrs. Li!

798
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,103
Yan!

799
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:03,742
Guo!

800
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:05,383
Report to the Company Commander now!

801
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:06,702
Be careful!

802
00:40:07,383 --> 00:40:08,383
Be careful!

803
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,639
Squad leader!

804
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:36,182
Guo!

805
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:39,502
Is anyone here?

806
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:15,823
Is anyone here?

807
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:44,662
Mum!

808
00:42:44,702 --> 00:42:45,462
What is going on?

809
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:46,742
Xiang!

810
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:47,623
Xiao Ting!

811
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,880
Mum is trapped inside with a soldier.
