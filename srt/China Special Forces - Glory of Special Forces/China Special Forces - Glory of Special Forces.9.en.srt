00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:31,100
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 9)

4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,920
You've talked to each other?

5
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,600
I won't be stubborn anymore.

6
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:47,772
Special Service's achievements today
are all thanks to you.

7
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:48,813
Let me be blunt.

8
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,361
I don't want to let you go.

9
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:51,865
Besides,

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,240
I want you to have no regrets
for your years of hard work.

11
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,480
Each generation has
its own talents risen.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
Although I'm only in my thirties,

13
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,361
as a company commander,

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
I'm considered old.

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm glad that I got to witness

16
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,880
the new generation of soldiers
walking into the barracks.

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,719
Under the training of this melting pot,

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,720
they have gradually acquired
the perseverance of soldiers,

19
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,160
until they grow up to be the
new guardians of the Republic.

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,080
I'm gratified.

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,280
I can

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,441
leave smiling.

23
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,054
How is Yan Po Yue?

24
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,520
He's tough.

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,920
He'll be discharged after
a few days of recuperation.

26
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:39,839
No matter what he did before,

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,960
I scorned at him.

28
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,961
But perhaps

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,639
I had underestimated
his faith and dreams.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,960
He wants to go higher.

31
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:48,592
I want to do that too.

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
But I'm not him.

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
He is younger

34
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,420
and more persistent than me.

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
Faith is more than just words,

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,000
he needs to fight for it.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,001
He fought for it.

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,240
He has been fighting for it.

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,480
You changed your mind about him

40
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,401
because he saved your mother, right?

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,920
He saved my mother.

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,320
I'm grateful to him.

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,520
He should be rewarded
for his contribution.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,200
Yan Po Yue.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,241
Company Commander.

46
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Get in.

47
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Sir,

48
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,280
this isn't the way to the regiment.

49
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,960
Who said we're going back
to the regiment?

50
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,080
Are you all healed up?

51
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Report!

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm robuster than before.

53
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,120
Come with me.

54
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
(China)

55
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,840
I passed by here every day
during my patrol

56
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,479
when I was in border defence force.

57
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,480
I want to show you this place.

58
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,680
Thank you, sir.

59
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,480
You saved my mother,

60
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,200
I should be thanking you.

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,840
It's my duty.

62
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,839
Ting and I

63
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,104
were high school classmates.

64
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,960
We met again after ten years.

65
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,440
And we started dating.

66
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,040
It's been six years since then.

67
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,440
She's been waiting for me
to go home and marry her.

68
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,041
But

69
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,400
due to the unique nature of army work,

70
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:43,920
or rather,

71
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,800
I don't want her to be
like other army wives

72
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
who can only stay in the army
for a month every year

73
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
and then go home.

74
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
Over and over again.

75
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,600
I kept thinking that
after I get demobilized,

76
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,719
I would give her a decent wedding

77
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,960
and start a happy family with her.

78
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,560
And I was always determined to do that.

79
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,760
But every time I went back to the army,

80
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,840
I felt reluctant to leave.

81
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,440
Just like that,

82
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,880
I hesitated over and over again.

83
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,720
I kept her waiting

84
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:26,280
for six years.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,800
My mum has had enough of the fact that

86
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,000
her son has been wasting
a nice girl's time.

87
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
They came here

88
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,480
with only one goal in mind,

89
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,520
bring me home.

90
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,360
As the application for
cadre demobilization

91
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,160
is usually submitted
at the end of the year,

92
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,800
and then it'll be reviewed by
relevant departments.

93
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,640
Once the year is over,

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,320
it'll drag on for another year.

95
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,960
That's why

96
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,640
they put their own lives in danger
to come and find me in the army

97
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,200
during the rainy season.

98
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
When I was in the hospital,

99
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,360
I pushed open the door of the ward,

100
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
and saw

101
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,480
the most important woman
in my life lying there.

102
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,920
If you hadn't created a miracle,

103
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,879
I might never

104
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,960
be able to see her again in my life.

105
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,680
When my mum yelled at me,

106
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,240
all I could feel was

107
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,080
gratefulness.

108
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,560
I'm grateful that

109
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,280
the company I lead

110
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,400
has a soldier like you.

111
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,920
Actually,

112
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,000
I knew it from the first day you joined

113
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,880
the recruit company,

114
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,840
You have strong foundation.

115
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
You were trained.

116
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
You are stronger than
the veterans in the regiment.

117
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,039
I know that

118
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,280
you are bent on joining that unit.

119
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Why?

120
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,840
That's the unit my dad was in.

121
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,920
In the face of life and death,

122
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,800
regular people will have some changes.

123
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,480
But not you.

124
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,920
Whether it's saving lives
or killing enemies,

125
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,000
as long as it's
a life-and-death situation,

126
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,040
you'll become very excited.

127
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,320
I've considered myself a soldier

128
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
since I was eight.

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,080
From the time you thought of
yourself as a soldier,

130
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,600
you have no comrades.

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,760
You're used to fighting alone.

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,640
However, in the real battlefield,

133
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
the more you want to show your strength,

134
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,880
the more you will ignore your comrades
who are fighting alongside you.

135
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,600
This makes it difficult
for you to go far.

136
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,640
To go far,

137
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,560
I must be even stronger!

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,640
Everyone has their own perspective.

139
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,000
Time will tell.

140
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,520
There are more than 10 days
to the Chinese New Year.

141
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:23,040
After the festival,

142
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,160
report to Squad One.

143
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,999
Really?

144
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,960
Will someone who is leaving

145
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
lie to you?

146
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,961
When I made this decision,

147
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,640
I had

148
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,601
a lot of mixed feelings.

149
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,600
I wanted to talk to someone so bad.

150
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,881
But after looking around,

151
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
I actually

152
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,640
chose to talk to you in the end.

153
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Do you know why?

154
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,800
Veterans like us,

155
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,079
some of them

156
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:22,840
were dragged home by their families,

157
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,560
some

158
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
found a way to be transferred

159
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,200
as they couldn't see a future and hope,

160
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,560
some were demobilized,

161
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,720
and some

162
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,720
were here for too long that

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,840
their bodies have fallen ill and

164
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,120
had to be discharged.

165
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
All the brothers

166
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,280
who entered the army with me back then,

167
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,680
I'm the only one left.

168
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,559
And now,

169
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,640
even

170
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm leaving.

171
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,920
I am leaving!

172
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,040
Yan Po Yue.

173
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,520
Yes, sir!

174
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,560
People of our generation

175
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:29,840
are gradually exiting the stage,

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,600
but this is our land,

177
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:34,320
we must keep it guarded.

178
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,280
Yes, sir!

179
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,720
At all times and in all circumstances,

180
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,783
you must stand up straight,
never bend down!

181
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,840
Our land will not
be violated by anyone!

182
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,440
You must pass on the
glory and dignity of a soldier,

183
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,800
the spirit of Special Service
from generation to generation!

184
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
I want you

185
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
to be honest to a veteran

186
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,360
who has decided to leave,
but hasn't officially

187
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,960
taken off his uniform.

188
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,320
Can you

189
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
do it?

190
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,920
I can!

191
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,080
They say any soldier who has eaten
Special Company's braised tofu

192
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,479
can win battles.

193
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,440
See this?

194
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,640
Some people are unconvinced.

195
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:45,864
Try it.

196
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,159
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,560
What do you think?

198
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,960
This is made especially for me.
It's different indeed.

199
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,920
Let me get a taste of
this braised tofu too.

200
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,440
I ordered many dishes.

201
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:07,561
Try other dishes too.

202
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,799
Try this meat.

203
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,240
But this Mapo tofu and stir-fried
tomato and scrambled eggs

204
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
taste better if it's cooked in big pot.

205
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,279
Right?

206
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,360
Staff Officer Ai, try it.

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,880
Did you see that?

208
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:30,713
He just glared at you.

209
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,719
Okay.

210
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,592
Congratulations on your transfer
to combat squad.

211
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
You heard?

212
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
The whole regiment heard, okay?

213
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,767
A tiger is leaving
Tiger Special Service,

214
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,440
but they got another one joining them.

215
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,720
I've got too much on my plate lately.

216
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,960
I'll officially join them after
I finish all the works.

217
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:51,246
Here.

218
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,120
(Practice hard and strive to be strong)
During the festival,

219
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,961
the entire company will be
on operational readiness.

220
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,519
As people are getting more relaxed
during holidays,

221
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,160
we must be more vigilant

222
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,399
to prevent any unforeseen event.

223
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,321
During this festival,
my company will be responsible

224
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:12,579
for the security and mobile defence of
the regiment's gate guards,

225
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,593
regimental headquarters,
armoury and other areas.

226
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:19,153
Spending the festival in the army,
each squad and platoon

227
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:22,713
should maintain daily schedule
and arrange reasonable rotating shift.

228
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,839
Yes, sir!

229
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,609
It's New Year's Eve.

230
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:26,770
This year's New Year's Eve dinner

231
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,012
will be prepared by soldiers
from Squad One, Two and Three,

232
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,840
together with the kitchen squad.

233
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,880
We'll make dumplings.

234
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,039
But we're not just making dumplings,

235
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,280
it'll be a friendly competition
between squads,

236
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,200
leading by each squad leader.

237
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:39,593
There's prize for the winning squad

238
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
It's easy to see which squad wins
in terms of speed,

239
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,999
but in terms of taste,
who will be the judge?

240
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,440
Well, a simple solution.
Each squad will judge each other.

241
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,039
After the dumplings are cooked,
divide them into three portions.

242
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,039
You can't eat the dumplings
made by your own squad,

243
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,362
the soldiers from the other
three squads will taste them.

244
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,800
You'll collectively vote for

245
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,441
the best presentation, best tasting

246
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,040
and fastest winner.

247
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,401
Are you confident to win?

248
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,670
We are!

249
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,080
Instructor.

250
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,680
-Everyone's here.
-We're waiting for your fillings.

251
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,880
-What do you think?
-You're generous with the meat today.

252
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,866
Well, of course!

253
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,720
It's the New Year.
The food must suffice.

254
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,600
Squad Leader Fan,

255
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,760
some of men went to the outpost today.

256
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,760
We're short-handed.

257
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,000
Why don't you let Yan Po Yue help out?

258
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,520
It's not the New Year yet.

259
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,640
He's still my soldier.

260
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,480
Just for a few hours.

261
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,360
-Yan Po Yue!
-Yes, sir!

262
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Come here.

263
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,560
Yan Po Yue...

264
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,400
Which squad would you like to help?

265
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,720
I'll go wherever you want me to go!

266
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,081
Squad One is short-handed.

267
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,040
They need you to peel all the garlic.

268
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,720
Yes, sir!

269
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,520
A grown up child doesn't obey
his parents anymore.

270
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,241
Get to work!

271
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,480
Here come the tomatoes!

272
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,680
-Put here.
-Okay.

273
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,600
-You can do it!
-You can do it, sir!

274
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,881
♫ Celebrate the new year with joy ♫

275
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,720
♫ Every family comes to
 celebrate the festival ♫

276
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,880
Whoever eats these blessing dumplings
that are made by me,

277
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
I wish him all the best for the year.

278
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,640
Yes!

279
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,181
We must be combat ready.

280
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,560
We mustn't let our guard down,
or we will bleed.

281
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,199
Happy Chinese New Year.

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,480
This is called walk the talk.

283
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,720
-It's too salty.
-Enough.

284
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,720
Okay, it's super salty.

285
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,721
Let me make them

286
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:06,361
a grief-stricken dumpling.

287
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,600
It's green and eco-friendly.

288
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,640
Come, let's spice things up.

289
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,319
♫ Unity is power ♫

290
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,734
♫ Unity is power ♫

291
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,199
♫ This power is iron,
this power is steel ♫

292
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,440
♫ Harder than iron,
stronger than steel ♫

293
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,719
♫ Firing at the Fascism ♫

294
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,840
♫ Wipe out all undemocratic systems ♫

295
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,560
♫ Toward the sun and freedom ♫

296
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:44,832
♫ New China shining bright ♫

297
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,080
Sit!

298
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,200
- Here come the dumplings!
-Yes!

299
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,760
Celebrating the new year!!

300
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,841
-Eat dumplings!
-Celebrating the new year!

301
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,719
The final event of
our festival competition,

302
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,359
that is, eat!

303
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,041
Dig in. Go on.

304
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,080
-What are you waiting for?
-Dig in.

305
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
-Come on.
-Dig in.

306
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:06,480
If you don't start eating,
I'll see it as you've all forfeited!

307
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,080
Xiao Yun Jie.

308
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:10,053
Yes, sir.

309
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,254
Take the lead for Squad One.

310
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,399
You go first.

311
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,192
Okay then.

312
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,321
I'll take the lead for Squad One.

313
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,239
Yes!

314
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,960
How is it?

315
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Yan,

316
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:29,408
this festival dumpling is super salty.

317
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,079
It reminds me of my mum.

318
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,199
What's everyone else waiting for?

319
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,920
Squad leaders take the lead, dig in!

320
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,799
Come on, let's dig in!

321
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,880
When other people make dumplings,

322
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,120
it's dumpling with wasabi,

323
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,520
but for you brats from Squad Two,

324
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,760
it's wasabi with dumpling!

325
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,019
Every one of it is burning.

326
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,600
You Squad Three has gone too far.

327
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,400
Looks like everyone is very happy
to spend festival together.

328
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,580
Rise!

329
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:55,865
Left face! Right face!

330
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,121
Salute!

331
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,520
Down!

332
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,439
Happy New Year, Chief!

333
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:02,959
-Sit down.
-Sit!

334
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,320
Very nice.

335
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,560
It's dumplings.

336
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,960
Who made them?

337
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,880
We all made it together.

338
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
Eat up then.

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,720
Eat it while it's warm,
or it'll get soggy.

340
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,920
Let's eat!

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,081
Let me try one.

342
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,880
What's the matter?

343
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,840
May I have one?

344
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:27,033
-Yes.
-Yes.

345
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:28,594
That's right. It's such a nice food.

346
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,761
I have to try it too.

347
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,199
This dumpling tastes...

348
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,319
Tastes very nice.

349
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:49,560
Have some water, sir.

350
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:51,046
It's fine.

351
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,960
You guys carry on.

352
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,120
I should get going.

353
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,961
Sir! Sir!

354
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,601
You guys stay and eat with them.

355
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,040
Regiment Commander
didn't talk much today.

356
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,320
It's such a joyful atmosphere.

357
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,121
I suppose it's beyond words.

358
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,360
Give me water.

359
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:18,880
These little brats.

360
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,920
Half of the filling is salt.

361
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,920
Regiment Commander has left.
Loosen up!

362
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,160
Dig in!

363
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,160
Instructor and I
will take the lead then.

364
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,280
I love dumpling.

365
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,920
Company Commander! Give him water!

366
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,920
Sir, sir!

367
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,600
Who made that?

368
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,570
Why is it so spicy?

369
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,800
Company Commander, Instructor,

370
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,640
I'll apologize!

371
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,920
Everyone added something
into the dumplings.

372
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,479
We just wanted to spice things up
a little, but then it started

373
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,719
to get out of hand.

374
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,214
Oh, Zhang Tian Yang,

375
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,800
you usually are
the most disciplined one.

376
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,719
It's making dumpling,

377
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,880
not making biological weapon.

378
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,000
In front of a powerful enemy...

379
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,828
Give him water!

380
00:22:07,922 --> 00:22:08,722
Take another sip.

381
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,999
We shall fight to the death!

382
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,520
Kitchen squad!

383
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Yes, sir!

384
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:21,892
Mix all the remaining dumplings together

385
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,280
until no one can tell
the difference, understood?

386
00:22:23,361 --> 00:22:24,280
Yes, sir!

387
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,640
Let me re-set the rules of
the competition.

388
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,000
You are not allowed to spit out

389
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,680
any of the dumplings you eat.

390
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,440
Whichever squad finishes first

391
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,481
is the winner.

392
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,560
Is that clear?

393
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,441
Yes, sir!

394
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,360
Okay!

395
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:40,120
Special Service's

396
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
New Year's Eve dumpling eating contest

397
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
begins now.

398
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,280
Ready, eat!

399
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,760
Eat! Eat!

400
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,040
Don't chew, just swallow!

401
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,119
Water. The filling came out.

402
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,280
Slow down.

403
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,080
Hold on, hold on.

404
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,839
Liu, have some water to go with it.

405
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,199
-Give me a pair of chopsticks.
-Don't chew, just swallow.

406
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:02,599
-One more!
-Here.

407
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,439
-One more!
-Here.

408
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:05,319
Just swallow it.

409
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,040
Drink water, drink it.

410
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,640
The filling came out.

411
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,640
I see the place is well organized.

412
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,680
I thought I was in a five-star hotel.

413
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:53,072
Sir.

414
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Finish your last shift
in the kitchen squad.

415
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,399
You're in Squad One now.

416
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,720
I got out from kitchen squad.

417
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,480
No matter where I am,

418
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,119
I won't embarrass you.

419
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,999
Don't give me that.

420
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,920
Take off your apron and come with me.

421
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,560
Do you know what I'm best at?

422
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,520
Minelaying.

423
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,839
This thing about mines,

424
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,720
it can kill lots of people.

425
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,640
I wasn't going to teach you,

426
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,120
but judging by your attitude,

427
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,200
you'll go to
the real battlefield one day.

428
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
By then, if you don't know this skill,

429
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,560
you might step into other's trap.

430
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,520
This morning,

431
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,640
I laid a minefield

432
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,199
in this forest.

433
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,399
I've laid all the land mines,
booby traps I know.

434
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,159
Walk out of this forest,

435
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,360
and you'll learn everything.

436
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:49,920
(If you want to learn minelaying,)

437
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,920
(you have to learn demining first.)

438
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,040
(Understand the minelayer's mind,)

439
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,800
(and you'll know how to
dismantle his mine.)

440
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,881
(There's a pattern for
defusing normal mines.)

441
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,400
(But when it comes to booby traps,)

442
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:26,959
(the deminer will have to depend on
his own experience and perception)

443
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,000
(to complete the removal.)

444
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,280
(Your enemies will create
all kinds of illusions,)

445
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,479
(so don't easily believe what you see.)

446
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,040
(An expert minelayer has no pattern.)

447
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,240
(Any so-called pattern is anti-pattern
that paralyses the opponent.)

448
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,801
(Protect your hands.)

449
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,119
(Remember the slightest touch
to all parts)

450
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,360
(so that these touches are
imprinted in your nerves.)

451
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,160
Impressive!

452
00:28:04,112 --> 00:28:05,120
You brat.

453
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,240
You came out two hours
earlier than I estimated.

454
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,561
A tonic wine from Lu Xiao Tian,
made from saffron he planted.

455
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,360
It's good for bruises and scrapes.

456
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,360
But that brat was afraid that

457
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
if he sees you, he will cry.

458
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
He insisted that I give this to you.

459
00:28:27,693 --> 00:28:28,522
Sir,

460
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,199
thank you.

461
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:35,814
You thank me?

462
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,680
It's me who should be thanking you.

463
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,119
For what?

464
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,039
You don't owe me anything.

465
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,719
Your perseverance

466
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,881
shows me

467
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
what dreams look like.

468
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,800
When I was a recruit,

469
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,040
I was crazier than you.

470
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,360
I wanted to be the first in everything.

471
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,040
And they gave me a nickname,

472
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:05,520
Mad Dog.

473
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:10,680
I joined the combat squad.

474
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:13,176
During a drug bust,

475
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,840
I hit a booby trap.

476
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,000
I injured my back.

477
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,280
I suffered from sequela.

478
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,835
That's how I ended up in kitchen squad.

479
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,040
It's been three years.

480
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
I didn't expect

481
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,840
I would get to know a coyote like you.

482
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,320
This minelaying skill should be used

483
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,720
only when it's absolutely necessary.

484
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,160
Keep in mind that

485
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,720
the one who lays mines

486
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,520
will one day step on the mines he laid.

487
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,400
Yes, sir.

488
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,800
Keep running forward!

489
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,600
Don't look back!

490
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,320
Soldiers who do not train are not
considered to be doing their duty,

491
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,240
soldiers who are not well trained
are not considered qualified soldiers.

492
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,121
One, two, three, four!

493
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,920
One, two, one!

494
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,760
One, two, one!

495
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,841
-Instructor.
-Rise!

496
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,800
Salute!

497
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,400
-Vice Squad Leader.
-Yes, sir.

498
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,160
-Where is your squad leader?
-Instructor,

499
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,760
squad leader has been summoned
by company commander.

500
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,839
Yan Po Yue is officially transferred

501
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,760
from kitchen squad to
Squad One starting today.

502
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,641
Yes.

503
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,159
-Xiao Yun Jie.
-Yes, sir.

504
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,721
Help Yan Po Yue tidy his things.

505
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,680
Yes, sir.

506
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,040
Goodbye, Chief.

507
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,000
Come, give it to me.

508
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:38,165
I'll lay it for you.

509
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
When squad leader heard
you're coming,

510
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,008
he reserved a bed for you.

511
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,440
This is his bed.

512
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,359
When he heard you're joining us,

513
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,040
he said he wanted to be
nice to new member,

514
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,080
so he gave you his bed.

515
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,360
I appreciate this.

516
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,560
Squad leader has slept
on this bed for three years.

517
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,040
Why should you have it
the moment you came?

518
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,760
I'll keep this for you.

519
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,080
Vice Squad Leader,
this is squad leader's order.

520
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,439
If you have a problem,
take it up to him.

521
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,000
Don't use him to pressure me.

522
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,439
I've been nice enough that
I didn't bring up company commander.

523
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,200
He's a hero who saved
company commander's mother.

524
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,480
I heard about that too.

525
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,400
You took advantage of that
landslide that day, didn't you?

526
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,960
What? You wanted to
join our squad so badly

527
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:30,205
that you'd rather risk your life?

528
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,360
Watch you mouth!

529
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,680
Vice Squad Leader,

530
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,920
are you afraid of me joining you?

531
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:38,241
Of course I am.

532
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,160
Everyone knows you, Yan Po Yue,
are ambitious and competitive.

533
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,440
If you make a complaint,
you're going to drag us down.

534
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,880
One, two, one.

535
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,000
One, two, one.

536
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,920
Yan Po Yue,

537
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,680
the skills competition is next week.

538
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,721
I'll see you there.

539
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,201
Hang in there!

540
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,920
Continue!

541
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,399
One, two, one!

542
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,160
Good!

543
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440
(Like Actual Combat)

544
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,681
The first match is shooting.

545
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,903
Why are you doing push-ups?

546
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:26,823
Vice Squad Leader,

547
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,880
I'm nervous.

548
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,121
What are you nervous about?
You have Buddy and I.

549
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Enough. Stop it.

550
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,720
Come on.

551
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,721
Vice Squad Leader.

552
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
I've asked around.

553
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,800
No one wants to team up with
Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie.

554
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,080
I thought it should be a group of three?

555
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,240
It's okay.

556
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,760
I'll pass the word around.

557
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,880
They won't even have a chance
to join the match.

558
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,999
It's fine.

559
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,319
Even if they can join,

560
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,600
I have a backup plan.

561
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,921
Rise!

562
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,840
Dress right, dress!

563
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,960
Eyes front!

564
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,480
At ease!

565
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,760
Li.

566
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,841
Li.

567
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:07,986
Company One Commander.

568
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:09,379
Company Two Commander.

569
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,240
Yes.

570
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,360
Instructor,

571
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,039
it took you so long to get here.

572
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,920
Turns out that you invited some guests.

573
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,000
I ran into them when I came out.

574
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:19,941
When they heard that Special Service
is having a competition,

575
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,640
they almost glued onto me.

576
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,560
We're just here to watch the fun.

577
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,800
I heard that the soldiers of
Special Service are all like tigers.

578
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,960
Tiger fighting seems interesting.

579
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,960
Okay. Today,

580
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
I'll show you

581
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,399
what is called a tiger fight.

582
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,680
This whole company competition

583
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,830
is also to test the results
of your practical training.

584
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,760
I hope you can show me the
feistiness of Special Company.

585
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Can you do it?

586
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,081
Yes, sir!

587
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,440
The first match, live firing.

588
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,800
As always.

589
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,400
Three soldiers a group.

590
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,120
The team that finishes first
in each round advances.

591
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,520
Instructor, announce the entry list.

592
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,440
When I call your name...

593
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,000
(Due to Tiger Special Service's
special purpose and pride,)

594
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,320
(other than the training syllabus,)

595
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:08,320
(there is also the training
and assessment programme)

596
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,800
(customized by the chief officer.)

597
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,360
(Its intensity is inversely proportional
to the chief officer's kindness.)

598
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,439
(Unfortunately,)

599
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,160
(our chief officer here is)

600
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,600
(Psycho King.)

601
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,759
-Zhang Tian Yu.
-Here!

602
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,000
Group Four.

603
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
-Hu Hai Tao.
-Look at him.

604
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I just ate. I can't look at him.

605
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,120
We're still one person short.

606
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,040
Should we ask around?

607
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,000
Don't bother.

608
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,200
No one will team up with us.

609
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,920
I kind of miss Lu Xiao Tian now.

610
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,080
Group Six.

611
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,360
Yan Po Yue.

612
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,360
Here!

613
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,200
Xiao Yun Jie.

614
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,160
Here!

615
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,561
-What about your third teammate?
-Report, sir!

616
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,840
We only have two members.

617
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,760
Company Commander, according to the
rules, they should have three members!

618
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,640
The two of them are not
qualified to participate!

619
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:53,920
-Yan Po Yue!
-Yes, sir.

620
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,919
According to the rules, you have to
find another person to team up with

621
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,121
for the competition.

622
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,720
Report!

623
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,440
I'll team up with Xiao Yue Jie
and Yan Po Yue!

624
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,680
Line up!

625
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,040
Yes, sir!

626
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,639
Group Seven.

627
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,120
-Kang Jia.
-Here!

628
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,760
-Ye Sen.
-Here!

629
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:16,960
The first challenge.

630
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,800
Fixed target rifle marksmanship test.

631
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,440
All in position!

632
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,840
Rifle check!

633
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,840
Rifle check completed!

634
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,120
Get in firing position!

635
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,440
Ready!

636
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,720
Shoot!

637
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Squad Leader,

638
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,240
you made the right choice
to team up with us.

639
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,960
Cut it out.

640
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,800
You two seemed pitiful.

641
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,640
It's sad to see you two
lost the qualification.

642
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,680
Fine, fine.

643
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,000
Don't worry, sir.

644
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,480
We'll prove to you that

645
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,000
you made the right choice.

646
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
-Report target!
-Shooting done!

647
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,320
Target No.1.

648
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
9.2 points, 8.2 points, 10.1 points.

649
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,359
Target No.2.

650
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:15,040
8.3 points, 9.1 points, 10.1 points.

651
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,240
Target No.3.

652
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,879
10.1 points, 9.2 points, 8.1 points.

653
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,933
There are only three bullets.

654
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,280
What does this mean?

655
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,640
Knock down five bottles
with three bullets.

656
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,880
This is impossible.

657
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,680
Ready to shoot!

658
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,600
Shoot!

659
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:53,085
Well done!

660
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,479
Well done!

661
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:55,719
Impressive.

662
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,360
Yan,

663
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,439
are you seriously cheering for him?

664
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:01,280
Grenade launcher marksmanship test.

665
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Grab the gear!

666
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,799
Left face!

667
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:09,476
Quick march!

668
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,079
Bravo! Bravo!

669
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,880
Bravo! Bravo!

670
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,520
Li,

671
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,800
why do you have so many tricky moves?

672
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,840
It's a competition.
Of course it has to be fun.

673
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
In actual war,

674
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
no chariot will stop there foolishly,
waiting to be hit.

675
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,320
When it's our companies' turn,

676
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,880
we're going to try your move.

677
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,680
You guys are engineer company.

678
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,760
Don't tell me you're going
to move the mines around,

679
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,400
and see which soldier digs faster.

680
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,080
Bravo! Bravo!

681
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,480
Bravo! Bravo!

682
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,600
Find one that you're familiar with.

683
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,960
I'll take this.

684
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Rifle grenade launcher?

685
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,119
That isn't easy to use.

686
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,639
Have you practised before?

687
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,053
Just once.

688
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,719
I feel a connection to this guy.

689
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:23,800
Next group,

690
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,399
rifle shooting.

691
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,680
Get in firing position!

692
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,600
It's deviated.

693
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,080
Report!

694
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:49,315
Yes?

695
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,759
Permission to change my rifle.

696
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,280
Reason?

697
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
The sight is deviated.

698
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,241
On the battlefield,

699
00:39:55,491 --> 00:39:57,851
can you guarantee that all the guns
you get are accurate?

700
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,546
-No.
-Shut up and carry on then.

701
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,240
-But sir...
-You think only your gun is deviated?

702
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,280
Commander arranged this on purpose.

703
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,519
I told you,

704
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,199
don't underestimate this event.

705
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,800
The only thing you can trust
in actual combat

706
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,319
is the skills that
you have honed over time.

707
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,919
Petty tricks won't help you.

708
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,920
Done.

709
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,360
Target No.2, shooting done!

710
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,601
I lost.

711
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:52,622
It's fine.

712
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
It's your turn.

713
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,000
Yan,

714
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,400
are you confident?

715
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,360
I'll try.

716
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,219
Well done! Well done!

717
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,369
Stop clapping.

718
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,120
He shot it all!

719
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,639
He shot it all, sir!

720
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,240
He shot it all!

721
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,439
Yan Po Yue shot the grenade
from kneeling position.

722
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,565
When they train,
it's usually in prone position.

723
00:42:26,646 --> 00:42:28,119
But when facing a moving target,

724
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,799
kneeling position is more advantageous.

725
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,159
Well done! Well done!

726
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,560
Company Commander, Instructor,

727
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,159
Group Six's total score ranks the first.

728
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,440
Okay.

729
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,640
The morning session has ended.
We'll continue in the afternoon.

730
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,479
Yes, sir!
