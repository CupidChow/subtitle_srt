2
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,040
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,760
(Episode 16)

4
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,680
If you want to talk about friendship,
leave rules out of it then.

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,680
Cut the crap.

6
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,200
Just say if you'll give it to us.

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,600
I won't give it to you two,

8
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
just Squad Leader.

9
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,960
Cut the crap.

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,239
None of you can live.

11
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:52,680
Hua Ping, doesn't that
car look familiar to you?

12
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,240
Isn't that the commando's car?

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,600
These punks must have stolen their car.

14
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,320
And you want to join the commando?
Dream on.

15
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,920
Hearing you say that,

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
why am I feeling so good?

17
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,840
Let's go.
We're going to report them.

18
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:09,032
Just you wait.

19
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,760
I say,

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,720
why even bother
fighting for the supplies?

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,840
You should just rob the command post.

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,880
Squad Leader, seriously.

23
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,280
Nothing good will come
from leading these two punks.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Get in the car.

25
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Get in the car?

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,200
We're leaving without the supplies.
Get in.

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,960
But why, Squad Leader?

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,120
Stop asking!

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,481
Squad Leader is so thin-skinned.

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,240
He lost his cool so easily.

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
He was hiding something.

32
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,520
If we really exchanged fire just now,

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,240
they were the underdogs.

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,880
He mainly did that
to protect Yan Po Yue.

35
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,600
Then, why didn't you
attack them just now?

36
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,400
If we really exchanged fire,

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,280
we didn't have the upper hand either.

38
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,440
At least two of our men
would be taken out.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,000
Which two do you think it would be?

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,240
It's okay. Let them go.
They won't last much longer.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,960
Didn't you notice
your squad leader's leg just now?

42
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
His leg?

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,640
What about it?

44
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,440
His leg is injured.

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,120
He's limping.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
I don't think it's because of hunger.

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,680
Squad Leader's leg was injured before.

48
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,600
Are you the one who took the supplies?

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Pity,

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
it was that car just now

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,040
took the supplies.

52
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,440
I wonder who shoots faster
between the two of us.

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,760
You won't shoot us.

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,680
Why?

55
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,520
You would've shot us already
if you wanted to.

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
Why wait until now?

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,520
You're out of bullets, aren't you?

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
I never thought

59
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,720
I would meet a smart one.

60
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,040
Well, Xiao, shoot him.
What are you waiting for?

61
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,520
Although you are wearing a mask,

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,720
I still remember you.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,400
Hi, Bai Long. I'm Xiao Fei.

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,760
Have we met before?

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,161
In the 2013 selection,

66
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,200
you were the inspector
of the commando,

67
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,240
and you were their best soldier.

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,920
This is odd.

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,200
Why are you in this competition too?

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,560
You will find out,
if you can make it till the end.

71
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,080
Zhou Zi Jian, give him two magazines.

72
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,680
Xiao, we don't even
have enough for our own.

73
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Hurry up.

74
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,680
-Here you go.
-Give him some food.

75
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,960
We don't have enough food.

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,400
Be generous.

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,480
This is all...

78
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,480
We don't have enough.

79
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,920
Fine. Take it all.

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
This is

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,720
our gesture of respect to
a veteran of special force.

82
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,720
True respect comes from heart.

83
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,520
I never take advantage of people.

84
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,124
What do you want?

85
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:02,053
Collaboration.

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
The three of us
will cooperate with you.

87
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,240
At this point,
all the remaining participants are pros.

88
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
If we work together,

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,599
I'm sure we'll have a happy ending.

90
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,040
Does this mean he agrees?

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,600
We're winning.

92
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,959
Why aren't you sleeping?

93
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,401
I couldn't sleep.

94
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,600
Squad Leader,

95
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,080
you should sleep.

96
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:01,320
I'll take the watch.

97
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,760
I'm not sleepy.

98
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,720
Are you tired?

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
No.

100
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Are you tired of this?

101
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
Pardon me?

102
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,320
Leaving them the supplies

103
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,252
is the same as forfeiting voluntarily.

104
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,280
Even if we make it till tomorrow,

105
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,079
we won't even have the strength to run.

106
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,759
We're from the same company.

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,161
I couldn't bring myself to shoot them.

108
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,281
I know you couldn't,

109
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,959
but I could.

110
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,560
We were standing so close to them.

111
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:45,760
If we had opened fire,

112
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,401
how could you be sure
you would get out of there alive?

113
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
Well, they couldn't get away either.

114
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:51,120
Did we work so hard

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
and come to this hellhole

116
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,045
just to hurt each other

117
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,779
and end up
going back together miserably?

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
We still shouldn't have
let them off lightly.

119
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:04,240
Why didn't you shoot then?

120
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,200
When we teamed up,

121
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,799
I promised you

122
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
I would listen to your orders.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,800
I know what's on your mind.

124
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,120
You took a bullet for me before,

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,400
so

126
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,481
I have to listen to you.

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
If you choose not to listen,

128
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,400
there's nothing I can do too.

129
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Squad Leader,

130
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:40,183
next time,

131
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,398
don't stop me.

132
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,080
Can I really stop you?

133
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
There aren't many participants left.

134
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,520
I will be

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,319
one of the six winners.

136
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,520
It must be the sniper from just now.

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,640
What's wrong with him?

138
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,400
Isn't him giving away his position too?

139
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,201
He's using us as bait

140
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,960
to lure all the fish out.

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,600
I got three here.

142
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,880
Mine too.

143
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Mine too.

144
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,440
We're dead, Yan.

145
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:44,640
We're surrounded.

146
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,320
Yan Po Yue,

147
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,080
don't forget what you just said.

148
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
You two must be

149
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,120
among the six winners!

150
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,120
Squad Leader!

151
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,200
What is he trying to do?

152
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,520
He's drawing the enemies away.

153
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,720
We got to save him.

154
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,120
He's trying to help us win.

155
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,200
Don't waste his efforts.

156
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,879
One ran away to draw fires,

157
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,120
the other two aren't helping him.

158
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,200
Aren't they from the same company?

159
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,640
They shouldn't be broken up.

160
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I really do want this soldier.

161
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,920
But his knee...

162
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
It's such a pity.

163
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,440
Let's make a bet.

164
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,799
My Lone Wolf
will eliminate them all tonight.

165
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,920
I'll put a bet on you

166
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,115
If that really happens,

167
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,120
what's the point of this then?

168
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,160
When tomorrow comes,

169
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,520
only Bai Long and Lone Wolf are left.

170
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,119
Relax.

171
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,079
I can't run away.

172
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,920
You two teams

173
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,159
are from the same unit, right?

174
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
Yes.

175
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,600
It's nice to see that

176
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,106
you're not fighting against each other.

177
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,281
If we're in a real battlefield,

178
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,600
only your comrades are reliable.

179
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,919
Are you going to forfeit yourself

180
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,160
or do you want some help?

181
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
I'll save you the trouble.

182
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,840
I'll do it myself.

183
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,240
Good luck joining Cheetah.

184
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,640
Thank you.

185
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
Come.

186
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,641
Help me up.

187
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,361
See for yourself.

188
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,121
I really can't move.

189
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,720
What is going on?

190
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,280
Sorry, guys.

191
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,200
You just moved my body.

192
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:25,960
And you accidentally triggered
the booby trap under my body.

193
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,320
Booby trap?

194
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Also known as suicide bomb.

195
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:30,500
You tricked us!

196
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,078
Hold on, man!

197
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,400
Hold on, hold on.

198
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,880
There is camera here.

199
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,239
They're watching through the camera.

200
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,760
Fighting is against the rule.

201
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,960
We're all dead now.

202
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,840
You drew us away to
protect your teammates.

203
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,920
Is it worth it?

204
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,119
Look at my leg,

205
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,000
I can't go on.

206
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Before leaving,

207
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,880
I wanted to make my death
count for something.

208
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,520
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,040
It's so dark here, yet he still hit me.

210
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:13,800
Where did the bullets come from?

211
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,360
There is a sniper on the other side.

212
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:16,640
Accept your fate.

213
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,080
The sniper is in
a very concealed position.

214
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,119
I'll walk out and be the bait,

215
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,439
let him expose himself.

216
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,439
He's very composed.

217
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:37,912
He won't shoot
without absolute certainty.

218
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,800
What should we do then?

219
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,679
We can't keep hiding here like this.

220
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,760
It's foolish to challenge the patience
of a sniper and a stone.

221
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,439
Because a sniper is a stone.

222
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,080
Seriously, this is not the time

223
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,480
to talk nonsense.

224
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,280
We don't even know
if Squad Leader is still alive.

225
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,880
Five minutes later, put your helmet up.

226
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,920
When you hear a gunshot,

227
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,200
set this off.

228
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
What about you?

229
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,640
I'm going down to try my luck.

230
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,360
Ten.

231
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,960
Nine.

232
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,240
Eight.

233
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,719
Seven.

234
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:22,559
Six.

235
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:23,917
Five.

236
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,360
Four.

237
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,159
Three.

238
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
Two.

239
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,133
One.

240
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,840
Yan!

241
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
Yan, where is he?

242
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,040
He got away.

243
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,720
What's wrong with your hand?

244
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:19,735
He bit me.

245
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,080
He bit you?

246
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,320
So many people are eliminated at once.

247
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:36,680
I bet we don't need to wait until dawn.

248
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,081
Only a few are left now.

249
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,840
Squadron Leader.

250
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,720
Save the formality.

251
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:48,920
All of you, get in.

252
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,920
Your supper this time
is hot noodle soup.

253
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,000
There's plenty for you.

254
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,600
I know that

255
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,960
every soldier who is eliminated
doesn't want to leave.

256
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
But you have no choice.

257
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,199
This is the rule.

258
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,920
Come on.

259
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:17,520
Hurry up.

260
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,280
It's okay. Train well
and come back again.

261
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,360
Squad Leader! Squad Leader!

262
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,000
Drive.

263
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,440
What?

264
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,320
Aren't you going to say something?

265
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,599
I'm a corpse now.

266
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,080
Go back and review this.

267
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,120
Come back again.

268
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,200
Drive!

269
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,800
Squad Leader?

270
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,520
Squad Leader!

271
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:43,560
♫ Are you ready ♫

272
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,840
♫ Soldiers, brothers ♫

273
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,079
♫ When that day really comes ♫

274
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,433
♫ Rest assured, homeland ♫

275
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
♫ Rest assured, loved ones ♫

276
00:21:54,598 --> 00:21:58,757
♫ I will march on bravely for victory ♫

277
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,880
♫ Are you ready ♫

278
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,880
♫ Soldiers, brothers ♫

279
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,959
♫ When that day really comes ♫

280
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,160
♫ Rest assured, homeland ♫

281
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,119
♫ Rest assured, loved ones ♫

282
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:15,479
♫ I will march on bravely for victory ♫

283
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,440
That's his choice.

284
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,560
He chose to be eliminated?

285
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,800
Those soldiers in the truck just now

286
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,080
were all eliminated by him.

287
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,200
It's worth it.

288
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,560
But we came together.

289
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,959
Do you want to go back together?

290
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,200
I don't want to.

291
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,000
It's the pick-up truck.

292
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,520
Looks like many are out in one night.

293
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,760
There is probably
only a few left out there.

294
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,280
Ten men.

295
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,160
According to the rules, we have to
get to the designated area in an hour.

296
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,040
The target should be a warehouse.

297
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
There are ten men left.

298
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,200
Other than the four of us,

299
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,240
there are six left out there.

300
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,400
Seven.

301
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,960
What does that mean?

302
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,640
This is as far as I can take you to.

303
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:22,520
You'll have to rely on yourselves
to enter the central area.

304
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,080
Long,

305
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
we're so close now.

306
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,800
Put it down!

307
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,160
Six winners. We all can win.

308
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
Good luck.

309
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,240
Long!

310
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,440
I...

311
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
Xiao,

312
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,040
let's attack together.

313
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,160
Take him out.

314
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,160
You go.

315
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:10,828
My initial intention is that

316
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:14,079
he wouldn't take the initiative
to shoot us, for the sake that

317
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,800
we were on the same team.

318
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,960
This is the place.

319
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,960
It's too quiet.

320
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:44,141
Are we the first to arrive?

321
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Is the competition ended?

322
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,200
I don't think so.

323
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,279
Let's go inside and check it out.

324
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,000
Someone is here before us.

325
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,560
Let's take them down.

326
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,750
Careful.

327
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,277
There may be traps.

328
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Quite a party.

329
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,200
Are Bai Long and Lone Wolf

330
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,000
planning to wait for these guys
to wear themselves out?

331
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,560
Lone Wolf won't do this.

332
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
So does Bai Long.

333
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,920
If I hadn't run out of bullets,

334
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,600
you wouldn't have been able to shoot me.

335
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,960
Impressive.

336
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,080
You're good.

337
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,480
Really good.

338
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:23,871
I'll give you another chance.

339
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:24,812
See you in Cheetah.

340
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,080
Just eliminate two more guys,

341
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,480
and the selection is over.

342
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,520
There's a guy out there waiting
for us to wear ourselves out.

343
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,480
I'll take care of him.

344
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,760
You only need to eliminate
one more guy here,

345
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,240
and the battle is over.

346
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,080
What is this brat trying to do?

347
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,559
He is out of bullets.
How is he going to fight Lone Wolf?

348
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,599
Exactly.

349
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
Is he trying to get himself killed?

350
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,920
It's the grand finale.

351
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,720
Let's enjoy it with patience.

352
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm out of bullets!

353
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Come out!

354
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,520
You've been hiding for two days!

355
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
Let me see what you look like!

356
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,880
Are you a coward?

357
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,880
What are you afraid of?

358
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,600
I know you're aiming at me!

359
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,640
Are you this gutless?

360
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,720
Are you a coward?

361
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,080
I'm standing right here!

362
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,400
Can't you aim right?

363
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,480
Shoot here!

364
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,320
Or here!

365
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,280
Are you this gutless?

366
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,160
Are you a gutless turtle
or a ninja turtle?

367
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,120
You gutless turtle!

368
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,040
Are you just going to
hide in your turtle shell

369
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
and wait for the selection
to end?

370
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,360
Are you this gutless?

371
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,080
I'm out of bullets.
What are you afraid of?

372
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Fire a shot!

373
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:27,280
Show me where you are!

374
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,160
Come on!

375
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,160
It's over just like that?

376
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:44,047
This is no fun.

377
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,199
I don't think it's over.

378
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,000
The smoke is coming out.

379
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,920
Clear as day. Only six are left.

380
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,440
It can't be that simple.

381
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,240
It's me.

382
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,160
Xiao, it's me.

383
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,320
Yan Po Yue is right over there.

384
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:19,280
Let's round him up,

385
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,440
put an end to this drill.

386
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,600
Go.

387
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
I'm sorry.

388
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,680
It's over!

389
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,440
Come out!

390
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,239
Xiao, we're a team.

391
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,480
We're comrades in arms.

392
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,840
Competition is just like war.

393
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,141
It's cruel.

394
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,040
All is fair in war, my friend.

395
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:26,945
Let bygones be bygones.

396
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:29,877
We are comrades in arms from now on.

397
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:30,879
No, thanks.

398
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,039
Squad Leader Xiao,

399
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,160
we don't want to be your

400
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,639
comrade in arms.

401
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,080
What does that mean?

402
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,879
Haven't you eliminated
other people before?

403
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,280
But we'll never shoot one of our own!

404
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,840
Be smart!

405
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,320
What is our purpose here?

406
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,039
To join special forces!

407
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:51,119
This is just a temporary team!

408
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:53,479
We're from the same regiment!

409
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,359
Is that temporary too?

410
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,720
My friend,

411
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,720
mark my words,

412
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,239
no one can stay in
the same troop forever.

413
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,240
How could you say that?

414
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,160
Do it yourself or I will.

415
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,880
What does that mean?

416
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,200
It's over.

417
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,120
It's not over for me.

418
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,640
You're a girl.

419
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,440
You want to see me.

420
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,400
Here I am.

421
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,200
May I have your name?

422
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,200
Guo Xiao Xiao.

423
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,560
Aren't you curious

424
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,280
where my smoke is coming from?

425
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,640
This is a red smoke bomb

426
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,160
I made with sugar and some soil
with nitrate from around the toilet,

427
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,440
plus a little chemical substances.

428
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:23,279
What do you think?

429
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,080
Its smoke looks like the smoke from

430
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,760
the smoke pack we carry
around our waist, right?

431
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,679
This brat.

432
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,080
Interesting.

433
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,520
You asked for this.

434
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,320
Yan!

435
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,199
Stay back!

436
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,440
I waited three years
for this opportunity!

437
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,800
I was betrayed

438
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:01,680
by my own teammate at the end last time!

439
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,880
This time, I have to win!

440
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,360
My squad leader

441
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,480
sacrificed himself to save us.

442
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,240
As a squad leader,

443
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,680
you shot your own comrades!

444
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,401
Stop lecturing me!

445
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,040
Bullshit!

446
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,800
(The competition is over.)

447
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,840
(Congratulations to the
five winners of the assessment.)

448
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,720
Bai Long.

449
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,640
Captain.

450
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,680
Welcome back.

451
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,040
Bai.

452
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:38,893
You managed to find nitrate around
the toilet. Where did you learn it from?

453
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,120
I wasn't just sitting around
at home over the past few years.

454
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,280
Lone Wolf.

455
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,520
Xiao Yun Jie.

456
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,439
Xu Yang.

457
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,239
Zhou Zi Jian.

458
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,880
Congratulations to you three.

459
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,520
Report!

460
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
I should be qualified too!

461
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,240
You want six men.

462
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,720
I'm the sixth!

463
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
You're eliminated.

464
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,679
They sabotaged me.

465
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,200
The rule stipulated that
the last six people are the winners.

466
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,080
I

467
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,600
am the sixth!

468
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,360
Xiao Fei,

469
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,080
I read your profile.

470
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,000
You've been an outstanding
non-commissioned officer for four years.

471
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,320
You won the first place in
the regiment's combat competition.

472
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,840
In your recommendation letter,
praises of you take up to three pages.

473
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,640
You are outstanding,

474
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,360
but there will

475
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,440
never be a place for you on my team.

476
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,600
Why?

477
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:50,199
Why?

478
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,360
Because you're not worthy!

479
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,080
For us, our comrade's life is
more important than our own.

480
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
And what did you do?

481
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
In order to win,

482
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,640
you killed your comrade!

483
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
This is betrayal!

484
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,200
Even if you got into the top six,

485
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
I would never let you
set foot in Cheetah!

486
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,720
This is not fair!

487
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,880
Last time...

488
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,800
At the end of the competition last time,

489
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,433
I was shot from behind

490
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
by my own comrade and eliminated!

491
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,160
That comrade of yours, Mao Huai Qing

492
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,160
was eliminated too.

493
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,439
Alright now.

494
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,600
Have a nice meal and go home.

495
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,120
This is not right!

496
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:56,080
You're being partial.

497
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,720
You're being partial!

498
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,920
Our smokes came out at the same time.

499
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,360
If he can stay, why can't I?

500
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,920
When did I say I would keep him?

501
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,440
All of you, just wait and see.

502
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,200
We will meet again one day.
