1
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,165
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,000
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,720
(Episode 17)

4
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,720
This isn't right!

5
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,760
You're being partial.

6
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,440
You're being partial!

7
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,640
Our smokes came out at the same time.

8
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,080
If he can stay, why can't I?

9
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,639
When did I say I would keep him?

10
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,119
All of you, just wait and see.

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,040
We will meet again one day.

12
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,199
Just you wait!

13
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,441
Stop.

14
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,160
When did I tell you to leave?

15
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,120
Regarding the words I said just now,

16
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,600
I hope all of you can remember them.

17
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,233
You guys need

18
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,960
to carve the words
"Comrades above all else"

19
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
into your mind.

20
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Although we may sacrifice our lives,

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
we must do it at the right place.

22
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,720
Understood?

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
Yes, sir!

24
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:03,160
Yan Po Yue, come here.

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,641
You're something else.

26
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,280
You actually hung on until the very end.

27
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,520
However,

28
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,480
your match with Xiao Fei
ended in a draw.

29
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,320
If I take you in right now,
someone will be unsatisfied.

30
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,480
I will fight for it next time.

31
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,360
You're pretty ambitious.

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,881
I have a chance for you right now.

33
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,640
Do you wish to take it?

34
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,639
Actually, I didn't plan on
taking in any female soldiers this time.

35
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
But her skills and techniques
make it hard for me to refuse.

36
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Sir, I'm a sniper!

37
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,320
I know that.

38
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,960
But you need to understand this.

39
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,640
A special combat unit may end up
infiltrating deep into an enemy's base.

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,640
Every member needs
to have perfect chemistry with the team.

41
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,440
Sir, I'm a sniper!

42
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,079
Are you saying

43
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,480
that you don't need a team
because you're a sniper?

44
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,840
Guo Xiao Xiao, I admit that
you're an excellent soldier.

45
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,520
You're better than
any other snipers I had seen.

46
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,400
But this alone cannot
dispel my doubts on you.

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,680
You're a female soldier.

48
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,760
Not only is it hard for you
to integrate yourself into the team,

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,720
but you might also be
the weakest link of the team.

50
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,399
Yan Po Yue,

51
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
tell me this.

52
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,560
In the event that she was
captured by the enemies,

53
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,560
what should I do as
the captain of the team?

54
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,760
Should I give up on her?

55
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
Or should I give up

56
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,480
on the mission that we're executing

57
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,959
and initiate a risky rescue operation
with our brothers?

58
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:57,600
Sir!

59
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,920
You'd given us the answer just now!

60
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,160
Comrades above all else.

61
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,640
That's the correct answer.

62
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,840
But don't try to be
a smart alec in front of me.

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,160
You do learn from me pretty fast.

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,800
Let's not waste any time here.

65
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,840
There's only one slot.

66
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
Yan Po Yue, Guo Xiao Xiao,

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,880
you two will have a match.

68
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,400
The winner will take the slot.

69
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,519
Spread out.

70
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,280
Yan.

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,280
Come on.

72
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,200
I give up.

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,920
She has already passed the selection.

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
I don't have the right to
make her compete with me.

75
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,440
What I need to do is to return
and train until I drop.

76
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,040
After that, I'll come back.

77
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,480
I've lost today,

78
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,400
but I won't lose forever.

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,880
Xiao,

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,520
Zhou Zi Jian,

81
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,800
you guys have joined
the Cheetah Special Forces now.

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,320
Don't let me catch up with you outside.

83
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,200
Yan Po Yue, are you sure about this?

84
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,160
Yes, sir!

85
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,200
Will you regret it?

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,320
No, sir!

87
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,280
Guo Xiao Xiao,

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,921
your codename is Lone Wolf.

89
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,680
When you were answering
the questionnaire,

90
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,720
you wrote that you had no teammates
and that you didn't need one.

91
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,120
If so, please answer
my question right now.

92
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,920
Do you need a teammate?

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,360
Do you want a teammate?

94
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,680
Yes, sir!

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,840
Alright, the test is over.

96
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
Don't be too harsh on them.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,880
It's fine now.

98
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,520
This is just a mental test.

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,040
I had been through the same.

100
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,280
These two fellows
love to frighten people.

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,382
Let's go.

102
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,600
Yan Po Yue.

103
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:21,120
We're planning to take in
six members this time.

104
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:24,240
Coincidentally, you're the last one.

105
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,040
Congratulations.

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,400
I will strive to be the first.

107
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:44,360
Gather around.

108
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,040
Have your meal in the vehicle
and prepare to return home.

109
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:19,920
(Bai Long,)

110
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:21,200
(an elite anti-terrorism soldier,)

111
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,240
(a legend within the Cheetah Commando.)

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,760
(He was once an instructor.)

113
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,520
(He retired after serving in
the military for many years.)

114
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,240
(He's enlisting in the army for
a second time for unknown reasons.)

115
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,120
(Guo Xiao Xiao,)

116
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
(her codename is Lone Wolf.)

117
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
(She's a sniper who was transferred here
from the peacekeeping special unit.)

118
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,680
(She has participated in numerous convoy
and oversea peacekeeping missions.)

119
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,440
(She has rendered numerous merits.)

120
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,079
(Compared with them,)

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,440
(what Xiao Yun Jie, Zhou Zi Jian,
and I had done were nothing.)

122
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:49,657
Captain,

123
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:52,520
Are these helicopters
meant for our detachment?

124
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,040
Since the special forces
has expanded its forces,

125
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,320
in order to increase our mobility
and assault capability,

126
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,600
they assigned
this helicopter to our squadron.

127
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,759
Sir, what's our training
programme for today?

128
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
What's with all the questions?

129
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,320
Just shut up.

130
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,160
You guys have never witnessed
this scene before.

131
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,160
All of you, come here.

132
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,280
Check your helmet!

133
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,920
I will only demonstrate it one time.

134
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,160
Look closely.

135
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,954
We can't do this.

136
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,960
It's at least 3m from the ground!

137
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:05,651
Your training begins now.

138
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,000
This is your first topic.

139
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,360
Low-altitude jump descent in hover.

140
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,640
Are we supposed to jump directly?

141
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,241
Didn't he demonstrate it
to you just now?

142
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,280
Sir, we haven't trained for this before.

143
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:16,760
Cut the crap!
This is a part of your training!

144
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,630
Look closely!

145
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:19,480
I'll demonstrate it
to you guys one last time.

146
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,360
No need for that.

147
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,880
One, two, three, four!

148
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:50,040
Assemble!

149
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,080
Assemble!

150
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,840
Captain,

151
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:29,760
Captain Leng,

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,720
great job.

153
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,880
Instructor.

154
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:33,440
I've picked six members.

155
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,439
Where are the rest?

156
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,361
There are 50 of them in this batch.
All of them have arrived.

157
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:38,476
Don't you think
you're being too ruthless?

158
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
These chaps had just arrived, you know?

159
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,329
Will they be able to withstand this?

160
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,050
It's not that easy to join our unit.

161
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,103
Just prepare some snacks for them later.

162
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:47,025
Are you ready?

163
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,800
Sir,

164
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm ready!

165
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,800
Hurry up! Where's your energy?

166
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:05,547
Everybody!

167
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:06,913
At ease!

168
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:08,371
Attention!

169
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,594
Dress right, dress!

170
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,400
Eyes front!

171
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:16,153
Count off!

172
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,880
One. Two, Three. Four. Five.

173
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:19,280
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

174
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:19,840
Full attendance!

175
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,120
-Squad ready!
-Attention!

176
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,000
Captain.

177
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,000
Instructor.

178
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:26,000
Squadron Leader.

179
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:28,320
What do you think about them?

180
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:31,644
They're so-so, I guess.

181
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,360
I don't want that!
I want elite soldiers!

182
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,040
Yes, sir.

183
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:36,440
Their true nature
will be revealed after a run.

184
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:38,080
Lu Tu!

185
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:39,520
Yes, sir!

186
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:40,616
I'll leave the rest to you!

187
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,384
Yes, sir!

188
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:47,880
Everyone, my name is Lu Tu.

189
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
I don't care what your names are.

190
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,120
From now on, your name will be a number.

191
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,200
All of you were recommended
by your squads for the selection.

192
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,320
And all of you had survived
the high intensity

193
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:01,800
practical combat.

194
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:02,840
That means

195
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,947
you guys have already obtained

196
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:06,600
a ticket to the special forces training.

197
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:08,120
As reserves,

198
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,400
you guys must not

199
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:11,000
inquire about

200
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,000
each other's initial squad,

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,360
age, name,

202
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,760
and personal details.

203
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:18,705
From now on,

204
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,560
all of these are military secrets.

205
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:22,880
Understood?

206
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:24,040
Yes, sir!

207
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,480
Besides, although you guys
had passed the assessment,

208
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:30,280
you guys still have a long way to go

209
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,880
before you can become a true member
of the special forces.

210
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,443
The elimination rate of this training
is more than 80%.

211
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,702
You might even die from this.

212
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,320
If any one of you is afraid
or wishes to quit,

213
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,400
you may step forward right now.

214
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:45,499
It's not a problem.

215
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:46,978
We will send you back
to your initial squad.

216
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,132
Anyone?

217
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,039
-Sir! We will never quit!
-We will never quit!

218
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:51,800
Very good.

219
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,000
But I hope that after the training,

220
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,760
the same number of people
will stand in front of me!

221
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,320
Our training begins now!

222
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,280
Attention!

223
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,160
All of you, listen up!

224
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:13,923
The last person will be eliminated!

225
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,640
Run!

226
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,720
Run!

227
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,240
One! Two! Three! Four!

228
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,160
Hurry up! All of you!

229
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,000
Those at the back! Don't fall behind!

230
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,200
Look at you useless buffoons!

231
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,880
Yan,

232
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,120
losing out to Bai Long
is reasonable for us.

233
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,760
But now, we can't even best a woman?

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Stop talking. Save your energy.

235
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:59,316
Do you guys see
the backpacks on the ground?

236
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,120
One for each of you! Hurry up!

237
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,200
Two of you are private first class?
Am I mistaken?

238
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,720
What? Do you have any opinions about it?

239
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,040
Out of everyone here,
only you two are private first class.

240
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,680
The rest are at least corporals.

241
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:26,880
You guys must've relied on
your connections to join this unit.

242
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,600
Who are you trying to insult here?

243
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:30,491
What? Let's spar
if you have doubts about us.

244
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:33,217
Talking is useless. Let's see
who'll reach the finish line first.

245
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,160
Xiao, hurry!

246
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:42,146
Those at the back, hurry!

247
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:44,491
Look at how useless you are!

248
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:45,866
All of you, listen up!

249
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,538
If you can't hang in there, just quit!

250
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,240
Judging by your conditions,

251
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,000
you'll die when you join
the Cheetah Special Forces!

252
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,120
Those at the back, don't fall behind!

253
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:57,840
Faster!

254
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:03,760
I'll say this again!

255
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:06,320
If you can't hang in there, just quit!

256
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,720
One! Two! Three! Four!

257
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:28,720
The captain said

258
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,880
that you guys have
mud and soil all over you!

259
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,120
He told us to give you guys a shower
before entering the base!

260
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,719
Yan, why are you stopping?

261
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,280
What are you doing?

262
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:08,280
We can't run fast with
all the mud and soil on us.

263
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,960
We need to use the water
to our advantage.

264
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,439
Comrade,

265
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,680
do you have shampoo?

266
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:29,200
Yeah! Get us some bath towels
and body shampoo while you're at it!

267
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
Using water alone isn't clean enough!

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,400
Do you guys really think
that this is a shower?

269
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,154
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

270
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,758
Thanks!

271
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,840
Number Six, you're pretty smart.

272
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:44,280
Hurry! Let's take a shower too!

273
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,320
They cut the water supply!

274
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,680
Spray us!

275
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,800
Let's chase after them!

276
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,120
Why did they cut the water supply?

277
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,639
Let's go!

278
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,800
He did it on purpose!

279
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,560
He even asked them
for a bottle of shampoo!

280
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:10,520
(The favourite thing that
military officers love to do)

281
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,400
(is to teach the new recruits
a shocking lesson)

282
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
(when they first enter the camp.)

283
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:19,120
(No matter how advanced
the military is,)

284
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,680
(this tradition will never change
as it is imprinted onto their DNA.)

285
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,920
Captain, they've passed Point A.

286
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,600
(Cao Ben is waiting for you at Point B.)

287
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,760
Is there a surprise?

288
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,520
(Yes, there's a huge surprise.)

289
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,497
Understood.

290
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,920
All of you, hurry up! You're too slow!

291
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,080
Hurry! Look at your stupid faces!

292
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,440
Even my granny
runs faster than you guys!

293
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:58,840
She's more energetic than you guys!

294
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,520
I have good news for you all.

295
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,800
It'll lift your spirit.

296
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,640
The battalion commander
is right in front of you guys.

297
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,000
He has prepared fresh meals for you all.

298
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:10,040
If you're behind, you won't even
get to take a sip of the vegetable soup!

299
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,800
Yan, let's hurry up.

300
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm starving. We haven't eaten
for the entire day.

301
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,520
Can we believe in his words?

302
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
Anything is fine as long as it's edible.

303
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,280
Hurry up! You're so slow
even when you get to eat!

304
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,800
Take out your meal containers.

305
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,160
We have enough for everyone.

306
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,920
More.

307
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,310
Once you're done, you can
eat at the opposite side.

308
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:04,360
Next.

309
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,240
Your meal container.

310
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,920
Why are you standing there?

311
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:10,360
You want more?

312
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,480
Leave. There are
other people behind you.

313
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,280
Eat up. These are high in protein.

314
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:15,600
They can replenish your stamina quickly.

315
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,720
I don't want this.

316
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,560
Come back!

317
00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:29,600
Is this even edible?

318
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,200
Of course it's edible.

319
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,458
It's just a little bit disgusting.

320
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:34,880
Are you two eating them or not?

321
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:36,640
If you're not eating, pour them back!

322
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,839
This is too disgusting.

323
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:56,499
What? You guys have no appetite now?

324
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,160
Look at our female soldier!

325
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,440
All of you, look at her!

326
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,555
Listen up.

327
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,760
She's a sniper who can
go on an operation alone

328
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,520
without an observer.

329
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,600
She once survived three weeks

330
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,160
with just a packet of hardtack
in the jungles of Africa.

331
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,099
You guys can ask her about

332
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:18,680
the best thing she have had
during that period.

333
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:36,867
Number 25,

334
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,959
what did you eat when
you were in the jungles of Africa?

335
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:43,244
Ant eggs.

336
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:46,160
How did you take care
of your sodium intake then?

337
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,680
I licked stones and consumed soil.

338
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,200
Aren't you afraid of stomachache

339
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:54,017
or parasitic infections?

340
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:55,960
I drank kerosene.

341
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,840
I can't finish them. You can have them.

342
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,680
Me too.

343
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:18,960
Thanks.

344
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,009
You drank kerosene? But why?

345
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,201
If you drink a teaspoon of it
every 12 hours,

346
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,400
it can kill the parasites
within your body.

347
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,680
It can also provide you
with a limited relief of dysentery.

348
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:31,210
However,

349
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:33,562
that thing doesn't taste good.

350
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,543
But in an environment without
any medical supplies and assistance,

351
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,040
to find a tiny amount of kerosene
in abandoned kerosene barrels

352
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,440
is considered extremely lucky

353
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:43,080
for snipers like us.

354
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:46,320
Are you sure you don't want them?

355
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:49,118
You won't be able to withstand this
if you don't eat.

356
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:00,240
Use your teeth more
instead of your tongue.

357
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:01,960
Just like this.

358
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,760
These are fried and seasoned.

359
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,400
They're considered a delicacy already.

360
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,160
So, you ate them raw
when you were in the jungle?

361
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,480
That's right.

362
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:46,682
Don't stand on ceremony.

363
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,120
I'm full now.

364
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,680
You should eat some. If not,
you'll run out of stamina.

365
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,640
Just eat them!

366
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:54,280
Fine, I'll keep them for supper.

367
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,720
Remember to return the meal container
to me when you're done.

368
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,760
Now, we're even.

369
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,920
We'll go our own ways from now.

370
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,120
Snack time is over! Assemble!

371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,160
Don't fall behind!

372
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,080
Remember!
The last person will be eliminated!

373
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,320
Hurry up!

374
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:31,985
Catch up with the people
in front of you!

375
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,480
The last two people at the back,
are you two taking a stroll?

376
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:36,520
Hurry up!

377
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:44,867
If you can't take it anymore,
get on the vehicle!

378
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,600
We'll send you back to your hometown!

379
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,321
Yan, you mustn't throw up!

380
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:54,720
You won't have the strength to run
if you throw up!

381
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:55,800
Okay!

382
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,640
I still have some empty seats here!

383
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,240
How is it?

384
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,120
Does anyone want to get on the vehicle?

385
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,720
Over my dead body!

386
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,080
If so, you'd better hurry up!

387
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
Another one of them threw up.

388
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:27,233
They're wasting our food.

389
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:30,000
We need to jot that down.
His body is weak.

390
00:25:32,445 --> 00:25:33,200
Do you want one?

391
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,239
Wait,

392
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,240
we've returned to the same place.

393
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,400
Did they bring us to the wrong place?

394
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,881
Hurry up!

395
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,371
Look at your surroundings.

396
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:13,667
Take a close look.

397
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:16,309
It looks familiar, right?

398
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:18,120
Don't you think
the scenery is great here?

399
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:20,320
Since the scenery is amazing,

400
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,760
I just had to bring you guys
back here again.

401
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:29,760
I'll leave the rest to you.

402
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:30,782
Alright.

403
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,915
Look here!

404
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:35,914
My name is Cao Ben.

405
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,640
I'm one of the drill instructors here.

406
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,760
I have something to tell you guys.

407
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,160
Actually, we were close to our base

408
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,524
when you guys were
having snacks just now.

409
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,240
But I suddenly remembered

410
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:47,280
that a new batch of supplies
was coming in.

411
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,980
Since all of you are full now,

412
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:51,560
you guys can move the supplies for us.

413
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Everyone,

414
00:27:03,243 --> 00:27:06,080
please move these supplies
back to the base.

415
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:07,760
Each of them weighs 15kg.

416
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:11,080
Since all of you are
the cream of the crop,

417
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:13,840
I'm sure this little box

418
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:18,080
poses no problem to you guys.

419
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,720
You guys will see the base

420
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:21,240
after you pass the hill to the east

421
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,241
beyond the place
where you had your snacks.

422
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,880
We'll wait for you guys over there.

423
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,504
By the way,

424
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,201
the last person will be eliminated.

425
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,680
Let's go.

426
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,960
He still has stamina left?

427
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,799
He's such a monster.

428
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,360
What's wrong, Jian?

429
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,360
Just give up if you're out of stamina.

430
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:47,120
How could I surrender
when you guys haven't?

431
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:55,128
This is too heavy!

432
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:55,977
Let's go.

433
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:15,040
Captain,

434
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:17,676
they've already run 40km.

435
00:28:18,177 --> 00:28:19,976
I know that. Do you have any objections?

436
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:21,760
Guo Xiao Xiao is a woman.

437
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:24,520
You should train her according to the
standards of female soldiers.

438
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:28,092
I almost forgot about that.

439
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:29,920
Take a look at Number 25.

440
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,280
I remembered that you passed
the special forces assessment

441
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:34,480
even though it was set up according to
the standards of male soldiers.

442
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,360
I was the one who transferred her here.

443
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,600
You shouldn't overtrain her
before she enters the base.

444
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
You're right.

445
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,840
It's precisely because you were the one
who had transferred her here

446
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,641
that she should persevere.
She shouldn't embarrass you.

447
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,280
This is the last one.
Are you sure you don't want any?

448
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:15,468
Yan!

449
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,319
How do you feel?

450
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:20,266
Are you okay?

451
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,500
Time waits for no one! Let's hurry!

452
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,750
Help me out!

453
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,389
One, two, go!

454
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,440
How is it? I assume the first person
should arrive soon.

455
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,050
Seems like
there's no doubt about it now.

456
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,240
Number 19.

457
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,720
Captain.

458
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:28,880
Good job.

459
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:30,452
Get him some water.

460
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,235
Yes, sir.

461
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,520
Here.

462
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,920
Bai Long, that's enough.

463
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,760
Go now. They'll be back soon.

464
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,601
Prepare to fall in.

465
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:34,080
The last two people,

466
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,040
Number 37 and 43 arrived
at the same time.

467
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,640
Captain, what should we do about this?

468
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,119
Gather and fall in within 10 seconds!

469
00:32:52,406 --> 00:32:54,486
Sir, I arrived first.

470
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Sir, I arrived first!

471
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,920
Two of you, remove your badge.

472
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,960
Sir, but why?

473
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:05,120
Both of you are eliminated.

474
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,320
Sir,

475
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:08,600
I thought you said only
one person would be eliminated?

476
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,800
Do you guys know

477
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:15,200
why both of them were eliminated?

478
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:19,196
During the march,
Number 37 rested for 5 minutes

479
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,319
while Number 43 rested for 3 minutes.

480
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
The rest of you didn't stop moving

481
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,759
no matter how tired you were

482
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,199
for the past five hours.

483
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,920
That's why both of them

484
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:33,689
couldn't catch up with the rest of you.

485
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,240
They were the ones
who eliminated themselves.

486
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,851
When they felt dead tired,

487
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,314
they must have thought

488
00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:44,320
that taking a short break
wouldn't matter.

489
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:46,818
They thought they could catch up
with the people in front of them.

490
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,160
But they were wrong.

491
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:51,217
A five-minute break

492
00:33:52,482 --> 00:33:53,602
can only solve

493
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:56,721
your desire for rest.

494
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,720
Your uniform is soaked.

495
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,519
Your body temperature and
physical fitness will decrease rapidly.

496
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,080
So, if they continued the march

497
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:07,841
after taking a break,

498
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:10,984
it would only make them more exhausted.

499
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,119
One of them rested for three minutes.

500
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,919
The other one rested for five minutes.

501
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,439
No matter how hard they tried
to catch up with you guys,

502
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,280
they'd never be able to catch up.

503
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:26,434
I'm sure you all had heard about
The Tortoise and The Hare.

504
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,560
On the race track,

505
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
the hare has
an absolute advantage over the tortoise.

506
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,119
It could've won the race

507
00:34:35,077 --> 00:34:36,400
as long as it took a shorter nap.

508
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,322
But on the battlefield,

509
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,855
all your opponents are professionals,

510
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,681
even elite soldiers.

511
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,840
All of them have been through
hellish training just like you guys.

512
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:49,218
Facing such opponents,

513
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,600
you will die

514
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,440
even if you commit a tiny mistake.

515
00:34:55,612 --> 00:34:58,571
If you wish to survive
on a cruel stage like this,

516
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,220
you need to learn how to be a tortoise!

517
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,640
You must never stop moving forward!

518
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:07,120
You must extract
every bit of your strength!

519
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,760
You mustn't let down your guard

520
00:35:09,404 --> 00:35:10,400
and fall behind!

521
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:13,320
If not, even if I do not
eliminate you here,

522
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,600
the battlefield will eliminate you.

523
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Understood?

524
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:20,160
Yes, sir!

525
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,120
Halt!

526
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,200
Do you guys wish to train like them?

527
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,240
Yes, sir!

528
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,480
You guys still have
a tall mountain to climb!

529
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,600
You'd better not think that
you can stay with the special forces

530
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,040
just because you're inside Base 125.

531
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:07,217
Remember!

532
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,560
The last person will
always be eliminated!

533
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,125
(Chinese People's Armed Police Force)

534
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:01,904
Dress right, dress!

535
00:37:03,076 --> 00:37:04,156
Eyes front!

536
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:06,080
Everybody.

537
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:07,243
From now on,

538
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,560
your freedom will be
severely restricted.

539
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,506
You're not allowed to leave the building
without an order.

540
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,602
Understood?

541
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:13,600
Yes, sir!

542
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,840
Now, we will assign you guys
to your respective dorms.

543
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:17,280
After you get your dorms,

544
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,720
you guys will receive your new codenames
in Cheetah Special Forces.

545
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,880
19,

546
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,960
32,

547
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:22,880
18,

548
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:23,800
and 15.

549
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:24,720
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

550
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:26,280
Did you guys hear me?

551
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,240
19!

552
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:28,000
32!

553
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:28,920
18!

554
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:29,880
15!

555
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,800
Yes, sir!

556
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,680
Dorm One!

557
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:32,560
Yes, sir!

558
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:34,640
06,

559
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:35,880
08,

560
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,760
28,

561
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:37,720
and 10.

562
00:37:38,004 --> 00:37:38,747
Yes, sir!

563
00:37:38,828 --> 00:37:39,480
Dorm Two.

564
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,240
Yes, sir!

565
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:41,000
32.

566
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,840
Yes, sir!

567
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,880
Fall out!

568
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,000
Yes, sir!

569
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,615
What's the matter?

570
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,040
Do you have any opinions
regarding the dorms you're getting?

571
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:53,120
Speak!

572
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,252
No, sir!

573
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,360
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

574
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,000
No, sir!

575
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,067
What's with your squinting eyes then?

576
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,880
200 push-ups. Begin.

577
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:01,120
Yes, sir!

578
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,960
Let's continue.

579
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,280
09,

580
00:38:09,482 --> 00:38:10,160
02,

581
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:11,120
20,

582
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:12,121
and 12.

583
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:12,960
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

584
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,840
Dorm Three.

585
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,680
Yes, sir!

586
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,760
We finally have a bed.

587
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:19,160
Yan, don't you think so?

588
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,160
Yan?

589
00:38:24,499 --> 00:38:25,840
What's on your mind?

590
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,656
I've been waiting too long

591
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,341
for this day to arrive.

592
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,039
I know how you feel.

593
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,200
It feels surreal, right?

594
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,704
Just like how I'm feeling now.

595
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,098
After I took a shower
and laid on my bed,

596
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,840
it felt surreal to me too.

597
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,880
From the kitchen squad

598
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:45,475
to the special forces,

599
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:47,040
it does feel surreal.

600
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:53,360
But compared with those veterans
selected from other special units,

601
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:54,640
we're lacking in a lot of things.

602
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,000
We won't be able to compensate for them
by being smart alecs.

603
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,140
Don't think too much.

604
00:39:00,273 --> 00:39:01,960
Don't you know who we are?

605
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:04,520
It's better late than never, right?

606
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:07,640
Number 09, Number 11.

607
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,196
Squad leaders, are you guys
done with your showers?

608
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:11,440
What squad leader? That's in the past.

609
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:13,240
All of us came here to be tortured.

610
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,920
We stayed in the ruins for three days,

611
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,240
and we ran across the hills
from morning until evening.

612
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,600
All of us smelled like crap.

613
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,575
Yeah.

614
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,160
Since we're in the same dorm,

615
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,961
let's hold a celebration.

616
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,640
Not bad at all.

617
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,560
Where did you get them?

618
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:27,832
I smuggled them in.

619
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:29,600
My mother bought them for me
when she visited me last time.

620
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,280
Come.

621
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,720
Initially, I was thinking of

622
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,000
-Thanks.
-consoling myself with them

623
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,040
if I failed the selection.

624
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,600
I didn't expect myself
to bring them all the way here.

625
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,480
Number 11, you're a great guy.

626
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:41,280
Finders keepers.

627
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,288
Take them out!

628
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,320
Were you a weasel in your past life?

629
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,790
-Why are you everywhere?
-What are you guys doing?

630
00:39:46,777 --> 00:39:48,880
Xiao Yun Jie, you're consuming food
inside the dorm at late night.

631
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,259
This is a serious offence, you know?

632
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:51,959
-I'll report you to our captain.
-Go ahead.

633
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,960
You can have this.

634
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,000
You can have mine.

635
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:56,360
You should've done this long ago.

636
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,120
Here.

637
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,401
Beef jerky? I didn't know
you guys were a bunch of kids.

638
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:03,561
Don't eat it then.

639
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,560
What can you do about it?

640
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:06,602
Delicious.

641
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:09,953
Your dorm is pretty harmonious.

642
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,041
I wonder how Lu Tu
assigned the dorms to us.

643
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:13,560
Can't he just assign them to us
in ascending order?

644
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,000
I guess 200 push-ups
weren't enough for you.

645
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,560
That guy who was together with us,
that Bai Long...

646
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:21,259
He's Number 30 now.

647
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,280
Lu Tu was showing him plenty of respect.

648
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,940
But that Cao Ben,

649
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:26,880
he showed a strange expression
when he looked at him.

650
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,720
Say, you're a huge guy with a huge body.

651
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,920
But why are you such a busybody?

652
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,520
Do you think I'd talk to you guys
if Gao Zhun wasn't eliminated?

653
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,440
Haha.

654
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,160
At least we came from the same squad.

655
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,080
You guys came from the same squad?

656
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,160
I'm the vice squad leader.

657
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Your squad is pretty good.

658
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:42,375
It's a pity

659
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:44,040
that our squad leader didn't make it.

660
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,320
I heard that Number 30

661
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:51,240
was originally a veteran
in the Cheetah Special Forces.

662
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:53,490
If so, why did he participate in
the selection again?

663
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,320
Who knows? He's extremely arrogant.

664
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,000
Even though we're staying in
the same dorm,

665
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:58,450
he doesn't speak to us at all.

666
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:00,424
You don't understand why?

667
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:01,400
It's because you're too annoying.

668
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,520
Xiao Yun Jie, I think
I'm being too nice to you.

669
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,239
-Lights out? I'll leave first.
-You should return.

670
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:08,880
I'll wait for you.
You're no match for me.

671
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,141
Time to sleep.

672
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,185
It feels nice to sleep on a bed.

673
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:18,760
I wonder how they will torture us
during our training.

674
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,520
They can do whatever they like.

675
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:22,160
We've already got through
the initial process.

676
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,280
We don't need to fear the rest.

677
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:26,000
Have you guys ever heard of

678
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,520
the Cheetah Special Forces'
Four Noes And One Without Principles?

679
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,279
Four Noes And One Without Principles?

680
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,880
No intimacy,

681
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:33,000
no feelings,

682
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:34,080
no conditions,

683
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,040
no compromise of standards,

684
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:35,960
without any dignity.

685
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,000
I guess the days ahead of us
will be tough.

686
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:40,720
Good night.

687
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:49,016
Yan,

688
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:51,377
you were so quiet just now.
Are you asleep?

689
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,800
-Not yet.
-Good night.

690
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,021
Good night.

691
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:56,073
I'm going to have a nice dream.

692
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,073
Braised pork with vermicelli...

693
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,840
These fellows are enjoying
their beauty sleep, huh?

694
00:42:18,313 --> 00:42:20,794
I can even hear their snores from here.

695
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,047
Alright. It's 3am now. Let's begin.

696
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:31,280
Assemble! Do not turn on the lights!

697
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,267
What's wrong?

698
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:34,520
It's an emergency assembly! Get up!

699
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,640
Hurry up!

700
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,240
Number 11, hurry up!

701
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,920
At 3am? They're doing this on purpose!
