(Episode 8)

4
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,480
-Mum!
-What's the situation?

5
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,880
Xiang.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,800
Ting.

7
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,720
Mum is still inside, and a soldier too.

8
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,360
Li, Li, don't panic.

9
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,120
I know! I'm not panic!

10
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,399
-Li!
-Commander!

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,360
-Xiang!
-Mrs. Li, Mrs. Li, let us handle this.

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,279
-Xiao Yun Jie!
-Commander!

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,120
-Second Squad Leader!
-Yes, sir!

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,239
-Take Mrs. Li to the car.
-Yes, sir!

15
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,439
-First Squad Leader!
-Yes, sir!

16
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,360
-Seal off the area.
-Yes, sir!

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,760
Second and Third Squard, come with me!

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,319
Go! Go!

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,839
Go! Go!

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Here.

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
Tian, what's the situation?

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,080
Yan is inside.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,679
Sir, be careful!

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,680
Sir!

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,719
Squads and platoons, split up and
search for the possible rescue routes.

26
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:15,880
Yes, sir!

27
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
Madam.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm coming.

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,200
Where is Ting?

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,680
They got out of here.

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,480
Don't worry.

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,160
Commander and
the other guys are out there,

33
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,719
trying to figure out a way to save us.

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,520
I...I can't move.

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,879
Madam, hang in there.

36
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,320
Madam, just hold on.

37
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,000
What time is it?

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,960
Madam, I don't have the answer.

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,120
I don't know either.

40
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,040
I just want to see Xiang.

41
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,480
Why is it so hard?

42
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Don't worry.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,480
We'll make it out.

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,240
And you'll be able to see Commander.

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,650
Madam, give me a minute.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
I'll go and get you some water
from the trunk.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,719
-Give it to me.
-Dig!

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
Dig!

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Pass it over.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,760
Take it.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,520
Careful, careful.

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,280
Sir, we've confirmed it.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,520
The trapped victims are Special Service
company commander's mother

54
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,840
and Yan Po Yue.

55
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,238
First Battalion, Second Battalion,
depart to the rescue at once.

56
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,959
Third battalion on standby,
ready to move.

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,959
All units directly under
the regiment, gear up.

58
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:25,799
Yes, sir!

59
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,319
Also, get the medical unit to
set out immediately,

60
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,536
get ready to tend to the wounded.

61
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,359
Yes, sir!

62
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,799
The length of this tunnel is 1.5 km.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,320
The field survey shows that

64
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,400
the entire tunnel is adjacent
to the mountain wall.

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,320
And there are many rocks
on the mountainside.

66
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,199
Squad Leader Fan,

67
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,760
where is the supply truck located?

68
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:49,679
Here.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,142
This is where the car flipped over.

70
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:54,399
This is the collapsed area.
It's very near.

71
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,720
Is forklift excavation possible?

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,640
Forklift won't be able to get in.

73
00:04:57,683 --> 00:05:00,440
And direct excavation will
trigger the fall of the rocks above.

74
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,320
What about manpower?

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,320
Political Commissar,

76
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,120
the inside of the tunnel is
currently blocked by rubble.

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,920
Small-scale collapses still
occur at some locations.

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,480
Yes, we are short of manpower.
Reinforcements are needed.

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,000
Have you contacted
a professional rescue team?

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Yes.

81
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,359
But heavy equipment will take
at least 20 hours to arrive.

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,960
How is Li Xiang doing?

83
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,920
He's still digging.

84
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,960
He's very emotional.

85
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,320
What other solutions are there?

86
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,600
I have two in mind.

87
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,160
The first solution.

88
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,440
Blow up the collapsed area
with explosives.

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,760
Adopt manpower and excavation equipment
to enter the area.

90
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,920
It's too dangerous

91
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
and slow.

92
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,799
What is your second solution?

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Human-wave tactics.

94
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,239
Excavate with conventional tools.

95
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:37,279
Carry out deep excavation from the
top of the collapsed part of the tunnel.

96
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,160
Blocks that are shovelled out
will be carried out by manpower.

97
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,720
But in the process, not only
must everyone ensure speed,

98
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,319
we must remain alert
at all times as well.

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,998
In the event of a rockfall or landslide,

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,320
we must withdraw immediately.

101
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,000
Looks like this is the only way to go.

102
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,480
I found some water.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,960
Here. Drink slowly.

104
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,839
Young man, you should drink some too.

105
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,559
I'm fine. You should have some more.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Madam, hang in there a little longer.

107
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,799
I'll bandage you now.

108
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,119
Madam, it may hurt a little.

109
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,561
Done.

110
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
Thank you, young man.

111
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,440
It's the least I could do.

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,880
Xiang bought me this phone.

113
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,320
He usually doesn't allow me to call him.

114
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,480
Now that I want to call him,

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,600
I can't get a signal.

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,561
Madam,

117
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,440
Commander will
definitely get us out of here.

118
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,480
He will.

119
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,679
Madam, the tunnel is going to
collapse again! We have to go now!

120
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,480
Young man,

121
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,880
you go without me!

122
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,760
Madam! Let's go!

123
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:38,959
Hurry!

124
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,000
Madam, are you okay?

125
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,480
-I'm fine.
-Come.

126
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,081
Easy.

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,840
Is your leg okay?

128
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,959
I'm fine.

129
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,320
(Sorry.)

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,919
(The number you have dialled
is temporarily unavailable.)

131
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,599
(Please try again later.)

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
No one has been here for a long time.

133
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,160
Young man,

134
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,200
what's your name?

135
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,430
My name is Yan Po Yue.

136
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,600
How long have you been in the army?

137
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,039
I was enlisted last year.

138
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,040
Since we can't get out,
you should sit down and rest.

139
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,881
Talk to me.

140
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,640
Are you in Xiang's company?

141
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,960
How is he doing?

142
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Great.

143
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,120
He's doing really great.

144
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,359
How is he treating you?

145
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,481
Nice.

146
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,039
He's being nicer to me than
my own father is.

147
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,520
My boy, Xiang,

148
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,959
has been kind-hearted
since he was little.

149
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,280
He's always nice to everyone he meets.

150
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,880
When he met someone,

151
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,073
he blushed before he could say anything.

152
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,759
Instructor, look!

153
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
The rocks and soils
have started to loosen.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,760
(Command post. Command post.)

155
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
This is command post. Please speak.

156
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,327
(Regiment Commander,
the soil above the tunnel is loosening.)

157
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,408
(Landslides may occur any time.)

158
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
(We're trying to stop it.)

159
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,159
(Rescue units under the tunnel
are advised to evacuate immediately.)

160
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,041
Command post roger that.

161
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,120
Regiment Commander,

162
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,560
the rescue teams have dug five metres,
we're approaching target range.

163
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,119
Continue the rescue mission at this
point would be tantamount to suicide.

164
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,640
Landslides can occur at any second.

165
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,120
Regiment Commander,

166
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,320
I suggest to withdraw the
rescue team immediately.

167
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:13,159
And continue the mission
after the rain stops.

168
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,640
Otherwise, not only will
we not be able to save them,

169
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,999
more lives will be put at risk.

170
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,241
This is Liu Chuan Ming.

171
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
All units are ordered

172
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,561
to withdraw.

173
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,040
Everybody, pull back now!

174
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Signs of landslides are seen!

175
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,680
Evacuate now!

176
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Li,

177
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,720
landslide may happen at any time.

178
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,760
It's too dangerous.

179
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,320
We have to evacuate now.

180
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,680
Everyone, evacuate immediately!

181
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm not leaving! I'm not leaving!

182
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:40,400
-Me neither!
-Me neither!

183
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm not leaving!

184
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
This is an order!

185
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,600
All of you! Run and get out of here!
Now!

186
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,760
Pull back now!

187
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,520
First Squad Leader, you guys go first.

188
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,280
Third Squad Leader, make a way out.

189
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,080
Evacuate now!

190
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
Yan is still inside!

191
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,640
You can't go!

192
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,640
Stay!

193
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,080
Yan is still inside!

194
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,159
Everyone, get out of here!

195
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:12,400
-Now!
-I'm begging you!

196
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,121
I'm begging you.

197
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,520
Don't go.

198
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,360
Yan.

199
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,440
Save him!

200
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,480
Save him!

201
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,440
The air vent has collapsed.

202
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,761
It's filled with rocks.

203
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,039
Completely blocked.

204
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,599
Without ventilation,

205
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,960
we will run out of oxygen.

206
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,840
Madam, give me your phone.

207
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,439
Madam, are you okay?

208
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,480
I'm fine.

209
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,040
All rescue units have been withdrawn.

210
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,280
The worst situation has occurred.

211
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,120
Rescue excavations

212
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
have to be suspended.

213
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,840
Due to the continuous heavy rain,

214
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,560
the area has showed signs of landslide.

215
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,040
It may be triggered at any time.

216
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,400
When

217
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,880
will the rain stop?

218
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,520
We checked the weather.

219
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,880
The rain will stop two days later.

220
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,600
What about

221
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,160
the professional rescue unit?

222
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,880
We've reported to the higher-up
and Ministry of Works.

223
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,120
Tunnel engineers have also arrived.

224
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,160
However,

225
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,520
judging from the current situation,

226
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,560
even after the heavy equipment
has arrived, it still won't work.

227
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,360
If we continue,

228
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,040
it'll only cause more casualties.

229
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,040
Regiment Commander.

230
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,039
I request...

231
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,080
I request

232
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
to abort the rescue.

233
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,161
Only by aborting the rescue

234
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,800
can we avoid greater casualties.

235
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
As a soldier,

236
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,920
what I should do at a time like this

237
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,120
is to prevent the situation
from getting any worse.

238
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,881
However,

239
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,120
as a son,

240
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,280
as the elder brother of Yan Po Yue,

241
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,440
please allow me

242
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,000
to act on my own for once.

243
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,800
Regiment Commander, Political Commissar,

244
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,360
I have to try.

245
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,159
Hello?

246
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,839
(Mum, are you okay?)

247
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:17,132
(This isn't her.)

248
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,320
(Madam is next to me.)

249
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,279
Don't hang up.

250
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,599
You mustn't hang up.

251
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,960
Xiang,

252
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:29,526
it's Yan Po Yue.

253
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,920
He's with mum.

254
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,200
(Yan Po Yue,
what's the situation there?)

255
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,600
Madam is slightly injured.

256
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,519
On her leg.

257
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,200
The bleeding has stopped.

258
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,600
Her bone should be fine.

259
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
(Is there any water? And food?)

260
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,600
We have a bottle of water.

261
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,000
No more food.

262
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:46,705
(You must conserve water.)

263
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,160
(Only drink one capful at a time.)

264
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,240
I got it.

265
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Company Commander,

266
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,280
where we are trapped,

267
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,880
I think we're running out of oxygen.

268
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,560
(Yan Po Yue,
this is Regiment Commander.)

269
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,039
Yes, Regiment Commander!

270
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,080
(What is the situation around you?)

271
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:10,513
We are inside one of
the tunnel's safety door.

272
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,480
We're trapped.

273
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,839
The door is blocked by rubble.

274
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,240
The air vent is blocked too.

275
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,880
(Okay.)

276
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:19,560
(We'll get you out of there
as soon as possible.)

277
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,309
(Reduce movement, save your strength.)

278
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
(Contact us once every hour.)

279
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,120
Yes, sir!

280
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,520
(Save the battery.)

281
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
That'll be all for now.

282
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,519
Madam,

283
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,640
Commander is just outside the cave.

284
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,079
Our regiment commander
is here too.

285
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:45,440
They're looking for ways to save us.

286
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,400
We'll get out of here.

287
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,720
We will.

288
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,760
Let's have some water.

289
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,320
-Okay.
-But we can only drink a little.

290
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,559
Only one capful at a time.

291
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,440
Okay.

292
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,479
Here, drink slowly.

293
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,640
You should drink some too.

294
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,760
-Never mind.
-Drink it.

295
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,239
-I'm not thirsty.
-Drink, drink it.

296
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:39,358
This section of the tunnel
has three safe rooms.

297
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,560
Normally used by
road maintenance staff for rest.

298
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,640
Here, here, and here.

299
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:45,799
The locations are dispersed.

300
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,920
Can we confirm which one they are in?

301
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,760
He isn't sure of the location he's in.

302
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,800
Due to the signs of landslides,

303
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,280
large equipment can't go up there.

304
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,201
We are now left with manpower option.

305
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:56,966
Regiment Commander, Political Commissar,

306
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,999
the Blue Sky Rescue Team
sent by the province is here.

307
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,680
Sir, I'm Cheng Gong of
the Blue Sky Rescue Team.

308
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,920
Thank you so much for your help.

309
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,559
The current situation doesn't look good.

310
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,559
Regiment Commander!

311
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,760
Any news from Yan Po Yue?

312
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,880
He hasn't called.

313
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,400
The rain's too heavy.

314
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,086
Construction of the retaining wall
is very slow.

315
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:26,080
The signs of landslides are
becoming more noticeable.

316
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,840
We're ordered to send
more men over to help.

317
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:29,680
All my men are here!

318
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,840
They are all above the tunnel
digging a passage down.

319
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:34,239
Sir, we should deploy all
those who are left behind.

320
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
Except for the sentries,
all men deploy!

321
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:36,960
Yes, sir!

322
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,880
Staff Officer Ai,
do you have any other ideas?

323
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,120
If we put a few trucks across

324
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,959
the top of the landslide area,

325
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,520
it'll buy us more time.

326
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,959
Drive all the cars up there.

327
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,400
Load the trucks with rocks.

328
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,600
Turn them into temporary retaining wall.

329
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:55,119
-Yes, sir!
-Go now!

330
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,160
Two movements are not standard.

331
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,041
Again.

332
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,640
Faster.

333
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,540
Faster.

334
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Faster. Faster.

335
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,400
Don't help him.

336
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,919
Lift the wood up.

337
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,040
Keep running!

338
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:11,053
Why?

339
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,960
Why?

340
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,120
Because you're not strong enough.
Far from enough!

341
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,800
You had a nightmare?

342
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,280
I'm fine.

343
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,560
Yan,

344
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,959
it's useless.

345
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,080
We can't just do nothing and wait.

346
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Madam.

347
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,040
Madam.

348
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Madam, are you okay? Madam?

349
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,800
Madam.

350
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
Are you okay?

351
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,680
Madam, wake up.

352
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,400
I can't breathe.

353
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:21,416
We're running out of oxygen

354
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,479
in this room.

355
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,280
We're in safe room No.3.

356
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,481
I have to tell them.

357
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,520
Be careful of the truck on your way up.

358
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,960
Down! Down!

359
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,361
This way!

360
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,721
Watch out for the truck.

361
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:12,038
Go, go, go! Keep up!

362
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,000
Hello?

363
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,479
Hello?

364
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,479
Hold on.

365
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,840
Hello?

366
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:25,527
Hello?

367
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,600
Yan Po Yue?

368
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,920
Safe room No.3.

369
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,199
Safe room No.3.

370
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,520
Okay, I heard you!

371
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,480
(Yan Po Yue,)

372
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,319
(you must hang in there.)

373
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,960
If you make it out alive,

374
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,120
I... I will...

375
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:41,620
I'll buy you dinner!

376
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,159
You hear me?

377
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,160
Hold on tight!

378
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,720
Hold this.

379
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,560
Come on.

380
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
Two more men here!

381
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,841
Complete the mission.

382
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,040
Go back alive.

383
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,240
Complete the mission.

384
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Go back alive.

385
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,320
Complete the mission.

386
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,880
Go back alive.

387
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,120
Sir! Sir!

388
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,840
The trucks won't be able
to hold it off much longer.

389
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,240
The landslide is about to strike.

390
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,760
-How long do we have?
-Two minutes at the most.

391
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,080
Maybe we should retreat first.

392
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,119
Madam,

393
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,880
stay awake.

394
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,561
We have to go back alive.

395
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,520
This way, this way. Hurry!

396
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,560
Yes, sir!

397
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,840
We're here.

398
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,120
Sir, I heard a noise.

399
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200
It's from here.

400
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,560
Everyone, stop moving!

401
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:56,787
They're here! Hurry!

402
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,480
Hurry! Hurry!

403
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,720
They're here! Hurry!

404
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,200
Hurry!

405
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,720
Hurry up! Move faster!

406
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,200
Yan Po Yue! Yan Po Yue!

407
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,119
Sir, we found them!

408
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,040
Yan Po Yue!

409
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,000
Yan Po Yue!

410
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,393
-Madam!
-Mum!

411
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,960
-Yan, can you still move? Hang in there!
-Quick! Go down the tunnel!

412
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,879
Hurry! Hurry!

413
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,240
Move fast! Move fast!

414
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Slow down, slow down.

415
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,360
-Easy, easy.
-Slow down.

416
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,080
-Untie the rope.
-Untie it.

417
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,120
-Stretcher!
-Stretcher!

418
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,320
Easy, easy.

419
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,600
Carry her out first.

420
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,840
-Yan!
-Yan Po Yue!

421
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,720
-Yan Po Yue!
-Hurry! Grab the rope!

422
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,280
-Yan Po Yue!
-It's coming down!

423
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,481
Everyone, get out of here!

424
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,000
-Grab the rope!
-Yan Po Yue!

425
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,359
Get them out of there!

426
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,439
-Come up, Yan Po Yue!
-Yan Po Yue!

427
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,400
We're out of time!

428
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,000
Yan Po Yue is still in there!

429
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,359
Yan Po Yue!

430
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,880
I need to get out.

431
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,394
I need to get out.

432
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,680
What's wrong, Madam?

433
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,560
Regiment Commander.

434
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,079
Madam, I'm Regiment Commander.

435
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,280
You have to save Yan Po Yue.

436
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,119
Don't worry, Madam.

437
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,040
We'll save him.

438
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,840
Yes, Madam.

439
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,880
Please lie down.

440
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,199
I told him to go without me.

441
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,280
He got so anxious
that his eyes were red.

442
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,400
And he yelled at me that

443
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,280
the soldier here is not dead yet,

444
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,520
it's not your turn to play the hero.

445
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,160
Don't worry, Madam.

446
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,720
We will get our soldier back!

447
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,960
We will!

448
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

449
00:31:39,006 --> 00:31:40,246
You're not in the mood to eat?

450
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,760
Will you have any strength
if you don't eat?

451
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
 How are you going to save him
if you don't have strength?

452
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,760
Eat! Finish it!

453
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,080
Lu Xiao Tian, give him
another steamed bun.

454
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,560
Finish your food.

455
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,400
Take a big bite!

456
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,200
Get back to digging after this!

457
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
One, two, three.

458
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,160
One, two, three.

459
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,080
One, two, three.

460
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,760
Come on.

461
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,360
Dig!

462
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,839
Harder! Harder!

463
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,760
Watch your hand.

464
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,240
Push it!

465
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,600
Hurry.

466
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
Xiao.

467
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,159
It's been one whole day.

468
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,360
Yan Po Yue!

469
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,080
Who do think you are?

470
00:33:37,502 --> 00:33:39,359
You've undergone hardcore training
since you were little,

471
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,080
and you've learned
to survive in the wild.

472
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,760
You asked me to join the army with you,
and here I am.

473
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,560
So many of us have been digging
for all day long!

474
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,000
Who do you think you are?

475
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,680
You're trapped by a few stupid rocks.

476
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,720
You got the audacity to say
you would be King of Recruits!

477
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,881
I'm going to laugh at you forever!

478
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,680
Aren't you the strongest?

479
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,761
Aren't you going to teach me anymore?

480
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,160
Where are you?

481
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,680
How can you not keep your word?

482
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm better than you!

483
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,918
We're all trying to save you!

484
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,719
Stop messing with us!

485
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,959
Come out! Come out!

486
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,001
We had a deal.

487
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,360
I'll buy you dinner when you get out.

488
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,040
Come out now!

489
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,080
Come out now! Do you hear me?

490
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,000
Come out!

491
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,119
Let's all shout together.

492
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,440
Let him hear us!

493
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,919
Yan Po Yue, come out!

494
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,840
Yan Po Yue, come out!

495
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,199
Yan Po Yue, come out!

496
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,120
Yan Po Yue, come out!

497
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,399
Yan Po Yue! Yan Po Yue!

498
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
Yan Po Yue!

499
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:59,199
Yan Po Yue, come out!

500
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,080
He's here!

501
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,639
Yan!

502
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,600
-Yan Po Yue!
-Quick. Careful!

503
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,279
Easy.

504
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,439
One, two, pull!

505
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,439
Easy, easy.

506
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,239
Come!

507
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,640
Make way!

508
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,760
Be careful.

509
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,880
Careful! Watch your foot!

510
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
Easy, easy!

511
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Watch your foot!

512
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,159
-Careful.
-Yan.

513
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,679
I knew you're still alive.

514
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,920
I'll live.

515
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
Hang in there, Yan Po Yue!

516
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,200
Hang in there!

517
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,320
Stretcher!

518
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,200
Comrades,

519
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,240
the emergency rescue
and disaster relief this time

520
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,120
was under time-pressure and challenging.

521
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,000
The situation was critical.

522
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,280
(PAP Regiment 247 Emergency Aid And)
Special Service Company initiated

523
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,280
(Disaster Relief Commendation Ceremony)
the contingency plan immediately,

524
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,281
sending rescue teams
to the site promptly,

525
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:00,920
arranging emergency aid
and disaster relief,

526
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,119
rescuing the trapped military family.

527
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,640
Special Service Private Yan Po Yue
in particular, despite the dangers,

528
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,281
his courage and spirit of heroism

529
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,520
have left a deep impression.

530
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,920
After a concerted effort
by the whole regiment,

531
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,199
we not only removed the danger,

532
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,034
the military family was rescued as well.

533
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:19,195
This is the kind of soldier

534
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,720
our regiment needs most,

535
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:24,040
a role model for today's soldiers!

536
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,240
Sir.

537
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,760
I want water.

538
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,281
What time is it?

539
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,321
See for yourself.

540
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,240
Are you here to visit me

541
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,440
or yell at me?

542
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:00,880
Lung infection.

543
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
Severe dehydration and hypoxia.

544
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,160
If you were found any later,

545
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,160
this would've been your funeral,

546
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,601
Martyr Yan Po Yue.

547
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,560
I'm fine.

548
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,720
You're still smiling?

549
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,000
Others may not know
what you're thinking,

550
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,080
but I know.

551
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,560
I just wanted to save her.

552
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,600
Is that really all you wanted?

553
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,480
Someone has to do it.

554
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,920
Why couldn't it be me?

555
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,080
Yes.

556
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,600
You're a hero now.

557
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,240
The whole regiment now
sees you as a great hero.

558
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,200
I just want to be the strongest soldier.

559
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
I learned it from you.

560
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,919
You little brat.

561
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,720
Mark my words.

562
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,040
No matter how tough you are,

563
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:49,762
you can't always be this lucky.

564
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,280
Your parents gave you life.

565
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,240
It's not for you to waste it!

566
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,800
He's yelling.

567
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,321
He just woke up. Don't talk long.

568
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,280
-He needs more rest.
-Yes, Squad Leader Fan.

569
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,280
The apple is so sweet.

570
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,920
It's a pity that there is only two.
I'll have one for myself.

571
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,200
Xiao and Tian are here too.

572
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,920
Who should I give the last one to?

573
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:46,840
Forget it.

574
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,319
I'll keep it all to myself.

575
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,720
You have to give me, of course.

576
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,120
We're close.

577
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,840
Are you okay?

578
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,280
In that case,

579
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,719
who should I give this hero-exclusive

580
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:03,759
and wish-you-good-luck bone soup

581
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,960
that is made overnight to?

582
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,838
Don't just put in bones.

583
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:09,199
Add some ginseng and sea cucumber too.

584
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,000
Want to eat ginseng and sea cucumber?

585
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,399
Then, your injury isn't enough.

586
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,560
You have to undergo
post-partum confinement.

587
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:15,480
That's right.

588
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,481
Seeing that your eyes are radiant,

589
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,720
and you're still handsome,

590
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,040
Squad Leader's tough medicine
works pretty well.

591
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,240
More like laxative.

592
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,078
He's being such a buzzkill.

593
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,879
Your flattery doesn't work on him.

594
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,399
Yan, let me tell you something serious.

595
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,360
I have a good news and a mediocre news.

596
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:38,680
Which one would you like to hear first?

597
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,880
-Either one is fine.
-The good news first then.

598
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:42,598
Word of your heroic deeds

599
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,080
has spread around the regiment.

600
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,719
Now you just need to
wait for your merit award.

601
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,920
We'll be assigned to
the same squad one day.

602
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,320
What about the bad news?

603
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,520
You're such a wuss.

604
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,280
Company Commander
is going to be transferred.

605
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,760
He's leaving?

606
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,480
What about Special Service then?

607
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,960
It's not that soon.

608
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,120
By the time the order comes,
it will be next year at the very least.

609
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,680
It's good. No one will pick fights
with you anymore, right?

610
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:17,600
Company Commander is happy too.

611
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,240
As a celebration, I've decided
to eat a lychee.

612
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,120
Put it back!

613
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,360
Fine. Why do you care?

614
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,560
This is a gift for Yan, you know?

615
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,761
You always take people's food.

616
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,520
What's wrong with you?

617
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,800
(Hearing that Company Commander
is leaving,)

618
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,600
(it didn't make me happy.)

619
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:41,159
(It's like I'm losing a rival.)

620
00:41:42,026 --> 00:41:42,920
(Because of him,)

621
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,440
(I was forced to grow,)

622
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,481
(to feel frustrated, to feel anger)

623
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,280
(and to persevere in setbacks.)

624
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,200
(I'm beginning to miss this feeling.)

625
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,400
I've read your transfer report.

626
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,559
I know that

627
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,880
this incident has a huge impact on you.

628
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,760
I understand it.

629
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,320
Although you have personal reasons,

630
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,159
I still hope you can give
this a careful consideration.

631
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,321
I did.

632
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,600
I can't be an ostrich anymore.

633
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,480
I'm 32 years old.

634
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,920
I've been together with
Zhang Ting for six years.

635
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,480
We've discussed
about marriage several times.

636
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,360
She's been waiting for me
to go back and marry her.

637
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,521
For soldiers,

638
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,080
a stable life is a luxury.

639
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,000
My mum has had enough of the fact

640
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,320
that her son has been wasting
a nice girl's time.

641
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:40,560
So, she personally brought
her future daughter-in-law here

642
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,040
to look for her son.

643
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,200
At the moment when
these two women departed,

644
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,320
the common goal
they set for themselves is

645
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,520
to bring me home.
