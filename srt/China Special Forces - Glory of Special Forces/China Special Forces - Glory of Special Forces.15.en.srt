2
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,971
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,800
(Episode 15)

4
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
Shots fired at seven o'clock.

5
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,400
Yun Jie, I'll guard the window.
I'll leave the door to you.

6
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,280
Yes.

7
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,600
Squad Leader, we have
guests at one o'clock.

8
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,400
I'll take care of it.

9
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,121
Let them in.

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,880
Understood.

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,680
Squad Leader, another group is coming.

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,199
They're at twelve o'clock.

13
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,640
They will encounter...

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
Yun Jie, be patient.

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
Let them fight with each other.

16
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,640
Report!

17
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,800
Group Three is eliminated!

18
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,280
Where is Group Seven?

19
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,520
They're a bunch of cowards.

20
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,800
They're plotting a skirmish.

21
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,120
Depleting manpower blindly is useless.

22
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,120
I think they're waiting for an ambush.

23
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Many skilled soldiers
take part in this selection.

24
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,440
If they solely rely on ambush,

25
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
they can't go far.

26
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,600
If I fire the rifle now,

27
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,919
all of them will be eliminated.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Make sure you hit the targets
all at once.

29
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Listen to my instruction.

30
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,120
Three.

31
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
Squad Leader.

32
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,520
We shouldn't hit them.

33
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,560
Why?

34
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,960
According to the rules,

35
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,880
murdered enemies
are not taken into consideration.

36
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
Only those who survive
are taken into consideration.

37
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,320
Yan, if we eliminate all of them,

38
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,119
our survival chances
will increase. Am I right?

39
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:15,640
We have 47 hours to go

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,280
before the selection ends.

41
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,799
If we continue fighting,

42
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,880
what are the chances
of us surviving the trial?

43
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,880
Keep the rifle.

44
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,360
Squad Leader.

45
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,440
Yan.

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,040
What should we do now?

47
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,640
Since yesterday,

48
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,320
I only had two to three hours of sleep.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,880
Are you two not sleepy?

50
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,440
I'm sure he is not sleepy

51
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
but I'm a little sleepy.

52
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,720
Xiao, you and Squad Leader
may take a nap.

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
I'll take a nap when you're up.

54
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,000
Since they're fighting with each other,

55
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,720
we'll take advantage on both sides.

56
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,320
Isn't it obvious that
we're merely being cowards?

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,120
Yun Jie, take a rest.
We need to maintain physical strength.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,559
Po Yue, wake me up in two hours.

60
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,880
What is going on?

61
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,800
How dare they take a nap?

62
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:50,239
It seems that

63
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,120
Group Seven will sleep
for the rest of the trial.

64
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
They're keeping calm in chaos.

65
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,800
I think they're
taking the chance to cheat.

66
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,000
We mustn’t allow that to happen.

67
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,480
Come on.

68
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Send some supplies to Group Seven.

69
00:06:03,073 --> 00:06:03,840
Yes!

70
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,360
Squad Leader, Xiao, wake up!

71
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,420
What's wrong?

72
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,434
Are our enemies here?

73
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,960
Check out the sky.

74
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,920
It's supply! Let's grab it!

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,840
Let's go!

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,840
Squad Leader.

77
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,920
Why don't we snatch the supplies?

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,240
When the blue coloured smoke rises,

79
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,360
it can be seen within
the radius of one kilometre.

80
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,720
Everyone will see it.

81
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,800
Even if we grab the supplies,

82
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,799
we won't be able to take it
without getting ourselves killed.

83
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,120
If someone is here
to grab the supplies,

84
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
do we kill them?

85
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:10,800
It depends on the number of people.
We'll kill them if necessary.

86
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,399
There are three people ahead of me.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,799
They're at the highland
at three o'clock.

88
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,400
There are at least two people.

89
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,560
Hold on. Don't move yet.

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
Take the supplies and run!

91
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,559
Stop hiding! Come out!

92
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,119
Where did you get the truck?

93
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,760
Squad Leader Xiao found it!

94
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,000
It's so convenient to move around
in the truck!

95
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,200
We're from the same squad.

96
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,039
We don't attack our own people.

97
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,440
Stay alive!
I'll see you in the final round.

98
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,000
What is so proud about finding a truck?

99
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,560
Lu Tu.

100
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:47,280
You're here.

101
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,160
Captain.

102
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,280
Calm down. Why are you in a hurry?

103
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,400
The person that you recommended
has not made an appearance.

104
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,200
If she's made the appearance,

105
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,280
I bet others wouldn't
even have the chance to show up.

106
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:06,440
You're over confident.

107
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,119
Let me share a secret with you.

108
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
In this trial,

109
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,360
I sent someone really skilful.

110
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,560
Do you mean Yan Po Yue?

111
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,520
No way!

112
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,680
He is arrogant and conceited.

113
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,318
He cares about nothing
but to show himself off.

114
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Calm down. What he said

115
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,760
reminded me of his younger self.

116
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,880
Who are you referring to?

117
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,000
What if he enters the final round?

118
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,400
We'll discuss about that
when it happens for real.

119
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,679
There are so many ways

120
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
to chase him out.

121
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Here comes my special guest.

122
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,240
Someone is here!

123
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,240
Where are they?

124
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,040
Don't get startled so easily.
No one is here.

125
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Be careful.

126
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,000
Cowards, come out now!

127
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,760
The chance to take part in the trial
is hard to come by

128
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,039
and I'm eliminated for nothing!

129
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,919
I admit defeat

130
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,239
but you should at least show up.

131
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,320
Let me see you!

132
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,199
You have the guts to fire the rifle
but you don't have the guts to show up!

133
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,480
You're a coward!

134
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
Where are your teammates?

135
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,040
What do you think?

136
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
How is my special guest doing?

137
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,080
He's indeed something.

138
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,760
The best of the bunch

139
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,120
is nurtured in the regular troop, too.

140
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
In order to transform the commando
into special forces,

141
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,600
comprehensive military capability
is necessary.

142
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,880
We need to select the best of the best.

143
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,079
He was so close to them,

144
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,279
yet he managed
to ambush them while moving.

145
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,159
I guess even his breathing is trained.

146
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,120
Furthermore, he's experienced
in actual combat.

147
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,960
But as far as I'm concerned,

148
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,400
among the participants,

149
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,760
none of them can do that.

150
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,200
He isn't a participant in the trial.

151
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,840
He's merely going through the motions.

152
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,560
Don't tell me it's him.

153
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,640
Let me make myself clear.

154
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,000
I recommended him.

155
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,920
Did you take him back?

156
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Why did you stop?

157
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,680
I need to answer the call of nature.

158
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,880
You gave me a shock!

159
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,000
Hua Ping, come with me.

160
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,080
You're indeed from the same regiment.

161
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,479
You guys even
answer the call of nature together.

162
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,360
Just in case anything happens, we can
keep a close watch of the surrounding.

163
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,520
Don't move!

164
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,119
Are we not going to hit them?

165
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,760
He's not from our regiment.

166
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,200
He can only blame himself
for being unlucky if he's eliminated.

167
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:05,240
Buddy, may I know your name?

168
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,880
I'll train harder
whenever I think of you.

169
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,640
Bai Long.

170
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,960
Okay, I got your name.

171
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,160
As expected, he's Bai Long.

172
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,080
He joined the army in 2008

173
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,240
as a member of Cheetah Commando.

174
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,400
Throughout his service in the army,

175
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,559
he took part in serious anti-terrorist
mission on many occasions.

176
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,920
He received many awards
because of that.

177
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,520
He's known
as the divine dragon of the commando.

178
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
But he's retired back in 2015.

179
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,320
What is he doing here?

180
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,520
If Bai Long hears your
compliments for him,

181
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,280
he'll be really happy.

182
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,240
But he's retired.

183
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,400
Does this conform with the rule?

184
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,080
Is he joining the army
for the second time?

185
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Not only is Bai Long a great soldier,

186
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,800
he's also a great son.

187
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,840
Back then,
his mother was terminally ill.

188
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,600
Bai Long discharged himself
from service to take care of his mother.

189
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,080
He stayed by her side
until she passed away.

190
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,840
This is the second time
he applied to join the army.

191
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,480
Why didn't he apply
to join the commando?

192
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,800
I can't do anything.

193
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,400
That's what he requested.

194
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Initially,

195
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,160
the higher up has agreed
to let him rejoin the commando.

196
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,880
But he insisted on fair treatment.

197
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,880
He said that he's left
the army for some time.

198
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,440
Be it his stamina or battling skills,

199
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
he requires reassessment.

200
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:25,626
As you know,

201
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,559
Bai Long has a one-track mind.

202
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,240
But allowing Bai Long
to take part in the trial

203
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,960
is more or less unfair to others.

204
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,080
He's so experienced in actual combat.

205
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,200
Look.

206
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,147
It took us a long time
to find a few talented soldiers.

207
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,400
He'll wipe them out in no time.

208
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,960
What else can we do?

209
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,400
Anyone who chances upon Bai Long

210
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,881
can only blame themselves
for being unlucky.

211
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,313
Why did you stop me from attacking him?

212
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
Do you think you are a match for him?

213
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,680
He's discovered us a long time ago.

214
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,440
Why didn't he fire the rifle at us?

215
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,480
I have no idea.

216
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:57,760
That person is something.

217
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,120
If we miss this chance,

218
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,880
it'll be difficult for us
to get rid of him.

219
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,120
We'll keep him alive

220
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,439
so that he can get rid of our opponents
on behalf of us.

221
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,279
We're the only two surviving.

222
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,839
We can form alliance with others.

223
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,160
Bear it in mind.

224
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,280
When you're chased after by a tiger,

225
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,399
you don't have
to run faster than the tiger.

226
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,680
You only need to be slightly faster
than the people beside you.

227
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,840
That's enough.

228
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,239
Will you do this to me?

229
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:22,519
Don't worry, I won't do that to you.

230
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:24,479
We're buddies from the same regiment.

231
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,481
Slow down!

232
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,961
If you don't have the guts to eat it,
you should leave it to me.

233
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,079
What a waste.

234
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,040
You have no guts to eat it.

235
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,680
Weren't you excited when you caught it?

236
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,040
Squad Leader.

237
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,320
I thought we would grill it.

238
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,640
If we light a fire,

239
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,880
we'll become someone else's target.

240
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,239
Someone is lighting a fire.

241
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:08,453
Darn it!

242
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,280
Someone is coming!

243
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,080
This way!

244
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,080
Darn it!

245
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,880
Run!

246
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,320
Run!

247
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,760
Run!

248
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,640
I didn't even have time
to catch my breath!

249
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,520
Yan Po Yue!

250
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
Check the window and see
if it's safe for us to go out.

251
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:40,640
It's safe.

252
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,280
Xiao Yun Jie, cover everyone.

253
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,360
Yan Po Yue, jump out of the window!

254
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,480
Squad Leader!

255
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm okay. Hurry up!

256
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,920
Hide away!

257
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,000
If we're given two steamed buns now,

258
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,320
I'll wipe them out in no time!

259
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,040
Why didn't you ask for something else?

260
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,240
You shouldn't have
thrown the pigeon away.

261
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
You can only regret now.

262
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,080
It's a big fire.
I wonder how it started.

263
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,120
Squad Leader, we're not prohibited
from setting fire, right?

264
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,600
Are you saying that
someone set the fire on purpose?

265
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,720
What else could it be?

266
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,560
Something bad happened!

267
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,561
It's sniper!

268
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,161
It's sniper!

269
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,080
Fortunately, we ran away.

270
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,720
It's time for them to be attacked.

271
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:06,640
Yan Po Yue,

272
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,080
can you locate the sniper?

273
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,121
If he fires one more time,

274
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll be able to locate him.

275
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,719
Come out.

276
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
Fire one more time.

277
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,520
Squad Leader.

278
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,840
I can't take it anymore.
The smoke is killing me.

279
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Run away like how I taught you!

280
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,801
Understand?

281
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,080
Not bad.

282
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,960
The sniper didn't have time to aim.

283
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,200
He's at the rooftop
of the building in the northeast.

284
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
Hurry up! Run in different directions!

285
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,440
So, you're hiding over there.

286
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,480
Darn it!

287
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,040
We exposed our location. Back off!

288
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,800
Squad Leader.

289
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:46,439
Are we not going
to fight against the sniper?

290
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,240
We have two more days to go.
What is the rush?

291
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's go.

292
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,360
The sniper is quite efficient.

293
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,680
Who is that?

294
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,000
She's recommended by me.

295
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,720
Not bad.

296
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,281
She's quite skilful as a sniper, but...

297
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,840
But what?

298
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,199
She's too arrogant.

299
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,200
She doesn't even
have an observer with her.

300
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,160
Even if she's skilful,

301
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,040
no way she can last until the end.

302
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,960
Unless...

303
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,280
Unless she can form alliance with others

304
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,360
and work hand in hand in the battle.

305
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,680
I have faith in her.

306
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,120
We'll wait and see.

307
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,920
Look at you two.

308
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,520
You two bring in
your own recommendation.

309
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,240
This trial

310
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,081
is full of hidden talents.

311
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
She is not any ordinary talent.

312
00:23:38,245 --> 00:23:39,520
In her regiment,

313
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,520
her nickname is Lone Wolf.

314
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,400
Don't fire the rifle.

315
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,880
I don't have any malicious intention.

316
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,240
The two shots that you fired just now

317
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
were indeed eye-opening for me.

318
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
If we were not in a trial,

319
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,680
I would love to seek guidance from you.

320
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,000
In general, snipers are
good at long range shooting

321
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
but not good at melee attack.

322
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
However,

323
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,000
I can tell that you're extraordinary.

324
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,680
Am I right?

325
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,999
Under normal circumstances,

326
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,520
after choosing an ambush location,

327
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,000
snipers will make predictions in advance

328
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,640
on the spot where a melee attack
may take place.

329
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,760
They'll bury remote control bomb
around the area

330
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,240
to ensure their safety
when they're alone.

331
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,800
I think you've done the same, right?

332
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm not here seeking for trouble.

333
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,199
Please don't act rashly.

334
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,880
Think about it.

335
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,720
Two groups will be chosen in the finale.

336
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,240
We don't have any conflicts of interest.

337
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,400
I have two other members in my groups.

338
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,480
If you're agreeable,

339
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,520
I'll ask them to come up and join us.

340
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,120
They admire you, too.

341
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,240
I'm serious.

342
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,600
Come out.

343
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,240
Relax.

344
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,760
Put down your rifle.

345
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,381
If he intends to attack you,

346
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,920
you two would have lied
on the ground by now.

347
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,360
Put it down!

348
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,480
To date,

349
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,319
one third of the participants
are eliminated.

350
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,079
You're safe

351
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
because you're capable.

352
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,760
However, there's something
more important.

353
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,561
The spot that you chose

354
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,640
is not easy to discover.

355
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,199
At the moment,
there are many participants.

356
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
This strategy is still intact.

357
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,359
However, when it's the final round,

358
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,279
the participants will reduced.

359
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,560
It's almost impossible to avoid
melee attack when the time comes.

360
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,880
Things will become
more difficult for you.

361
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,480
Now, I've a win-win solution.

362
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,600
You'll in charge of long-range shooting

363
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:21,239
while the three of us
will keep you safe.

364
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,239
I promise, we'll end up well.

365
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,239
I bet you're not left with sufficient
supplies and ammunition.

366
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,520
I know of a supply point nearby.

367
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,200
The three of us will work together
to get us some supplies.

368
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,360
You can have all the ammunition.

369
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,400
Buddy, you can let us
know your requirement!

370
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,320
Is he a dumb?

371
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:09,240
Stop!

372
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,920
Yan Po Yue, how far is it?

373
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,800
Two kilometres.

374
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,280
Stay alert.

375
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,240
Darn it.

376
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,000
Squad Leader.

377
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,439
Don't worry. It's just a bruise.

378
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,920
We've walked for
a long distance after all.

379
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
I'll be fine after taking a break.

380
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Let me help you.

381
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Hang in there.

382
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,800
Can you hang on?

383
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,880
Are you kidding me? We've come so far.

384
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,400
I'll hang in there
as long as my head is still intact.

385
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,560
Something is going on.

386
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,440
What happened?

387
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,400
I think someone is targeting us.

388
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:16,560
Where are they?

389
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,240
Look at that stand-alone building.

390
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,800
I saw someone passed by the window
on the second floor just now.

391
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,159
How many are there?

392
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,881
I'm not sure.

393
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,320
Squad Leader,
should we fight against them?

394
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:29,360
It's getting late.

395
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,240
We won't survive the night
if we don't fight.

396
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,760
Don't worry.

397
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,440
Let's go!

398
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,920
Xiao, we're tricked!

399
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,680
I searched high and low
but I didn't find any bomb!

400
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,801
I should have killed him
with a shot just now!

401
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,480
If we ever tried to fire a shot at him,

402
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,760
he would have shot us down by then.

403
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,559
Who is he?

404
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:04,712
I didn't see him at the assembly
in the morning.

405
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,399
Don't bother to find out his identity.

406
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,839
He refused to work with us.

407
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,720
We'd better pray that
he doesn't work with others too.

408
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,419
Once he forms an alliance with others,

409
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,720
it'll be difficult to deal with him.

410
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,560
It's getting late.

411
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,240
We need to settle down.

412
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,200
Let's go back to the truck.
No where is safe.

413
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,519
There is a man by the window.

414
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,480
I'm not sure about
the first floor and rooftop though.

415
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,480
There could be people.

416
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,641
Attack now.

417
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
No way, they're
at a higher position than us.

418
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,880
If we attack them now,
we'll get into danger.

419
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
They have the geographical advantages.

420
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,800
If we manage to take the building down,

421
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,960
it'll do us good.

422
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,400
We can ambush soldiers
that pass by the building.

423
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,640
They're having the same thought as you.

424
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,320
Get ready to attack.

425
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,040
-Are your legs okay?
-Don't worry. I'm fine.

426
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,800
Are we going to fight against them?

427
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:25,000
It's getting dark!

428
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,601
Things will be so much more complicated
if we attack them at night.

429
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,400
The stand-alone building
is eye-catching.

430
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,200
We can protect ourselves
as we see clearly in the broad daylight.

431
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:31,746
But if we take down
the building at night,

432
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,160
we may be caught by others in no time.

433
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,120
Hide away!

434
00:31:39,006 --> 00:31:40,486
Someone discovered us! Attack them!

435
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,240
Xiao!

436
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,000
Xiao Yun Jie!

437
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,000
Be careful, Xiao!

438
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,880
Squad Leader, let's part ways
and meet up with Xiao in the middle.

439
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,520
Okay!

440
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,240
Yun Jie!

441
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:48,640
Are you okay, Squad Leader?

442
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,520
I'm okay.

443
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Come on. It's time for those
who are eliminated to get on the truck.

444
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,800
Squad Leader.

445
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Can we have some food? We're famished.

446
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:03,353
Here.

447
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,479
What are we having for dinner? Hotpot?

448
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,840
No way. We're going for grilled lamb.

449
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,680
Sure.

450
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,361
Comrades, hang in there!

451
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,840
We're going back for good food!

452
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:12,760
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

453
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,520
Your tummy is growling.

454
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,599
My tummy is not growling. It's yours.

455
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,497
Stop talking. Save up on your energy.

456
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,399
Squad Leader.

457
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,920
Ever since we left the camp,

458
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,882
we haven't eaten anything.

459
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,761
I know where we can get food.

460
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,640
Where?

461
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,880
You saw it earlier.

462
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:54,720
You mean...

463
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,680
Do you mean the truck that picks up
the eliminated participants?

464
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,720
Robbing the truck is against the rules.

465
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,520
Squad Leader.

466
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,320
Is that against the rules?

467
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,080
I don't deny that there is no such rule.

468
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:16,760
Let's think about it.

469
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,399
Let me make myself clear.

470
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,240
You're only allowed to take the food.
Don't ever think of truck hijacking.

471
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,200
Squad Leader, you're talking rubbish.

472
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,359
How do we get the food
without hijacking the truck?

473
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,080
We'll play it by ear.

474
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,599
There's something else.

475
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:40,726
We'll do it.
You'll stay here and take a rest.

476
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,919
What are you thinking?
No way I'll let you do that.

477
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,559
Goodness, who is so immoral?

478
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,840
They blocked the road.

479
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,240
What are you doing?

480
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,120
Let go of me!

481
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,880
You're going against the rules!

482
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,280
This is against the rules!

483
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:27,040
What are you doing?

484
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,880
Open your mouth.

485
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:36,159
Is it really okay?

486
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,440
We don't have a choice!

487
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,280
What about him?

488
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:54,519
We'll leave him here.

489
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,440
What?

490
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,720
Yan! Squad Leader!

491
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,920
There is nothing in the truck.
I only found two bottles of water.

492
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,041
Buddy, where do you keep the food?

493
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,920
No food.

494
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,800
Why are there food in the other trucks?

495
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,320
They're kind-hearted.

496
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:12,200
I'm not going to take care
of your tummy, rubbish!

497
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,359
Let go of me now!

498
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,680
What should we do?

499
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,560
We'll drive the truck around
to look for food.

500
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,199
Squad Leader,
do you have any objections?

501
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,480
You promised
that you won't hijack the truck.

502
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,159
We don't have a choice.

503
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,800
You two are making troubles!

504
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
This brat is doing it again.

505
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,025
He attacked his own people.

506
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,680
Captain.

507
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,280
Does truck hijacking
consider as breaking the rules?

508
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,879
What is the aim of the trial?

509
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,079
It's a survival game.

510
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,680
Did he leave the assessment area?

511
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:05,532
No.

512
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,320
That's right.

513
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,881
The truck is within the assessment area.

514
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,560
During the trial in the past,

515
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:14,280
many participants went out of control
due to hunger.

516
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,560
However, this is the first time

517
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,719
someone hijacked the truck.

518
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,120
Yan Po Yue...

519
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,320
He's making use of the loophole
to his advantage.

520
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,640
He merely lives by his wits.

521
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,760
It depends on how
he makes use of his wits.

522
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,560
I think it's quite well done.

523
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,240
They're not prohibited
from truck hijacking.

524
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:43,333
Squad Leader!

525
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,920
There are supplies at four o'clock.
Can we take it?

526
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,600
We've hijacked the truck anyway.
Of course we'll take the supplies.

527
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,320
Squad Leader, I love the instruction!

528
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,560
There is a supply.

529
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,880
What is the rush?

530
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,080
We'll kill them
before the sun goes down.

531
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,359
Xiao, when we're there,

532
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,800
we two will go down to get the supply.

533
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,840
Get back to the truck
once we get the supply!

534
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:14,001
Squad Leader, you'll
drive the truck to cover us.

535
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:14,919
Yan!

536
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You're quite good at giving commands.

537
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,040
We'll hit anyone who stands in our way!

538
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,680
The truck will cover us up!

539
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,640
Watch out! There's grenade!

540
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:13,531
We're almost there. Get ready.

541
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,360
They're fighting!

542
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,839
Get ready!

543
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:21,520
Take the supply! Now!

544
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,360
Qiao, run!

545
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,320
Put it down.

546
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,199
Stay away from the supply.

547
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,040
It's bait.

548
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:47,479
Hide away. Now!

549
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,239
Let's go.

550
00:39:57,919 --> 00:39:59,919
Xiao, why are we keeping him?

551
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,120
We'll keep him as the target.

552
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:01,880
You!

553
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,120
Keep quiet. Turn around.

554
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,360
Buddy.

555
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,401
I can eliminate you with a shot.

556
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:13,426
If you work with us,

557
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,659
you may continue
taking part in the trial.

558
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,120
What do you think?

559
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,000
Let's go.

560
00:40:38,365 --> 00:40:39,165
Go there.

561
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,579
Stop there. Open the supply box.

562
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,779
Throw the supply to us.

563
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,520
Don't fire the rifle!
We're from the same regiment!

564
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,480
Yan Po Yue! Xiao Yun jie!
Don't fire the rifle!

565
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,960
Come on, do it. Why do you stop?

566
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,359
What's going on?

567
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,040
Why don't you attack them but us?

568
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,480
We're from the same regiment.

569
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,520
So what?

570
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,919
Do you know where we are now?

571
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Only the fittest survives
and the winner takes it all!

572
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,800
You're not abiding the rules!
I'll lodge a complaint against you!

573
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,200
Shut up. You're dead.

574
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,920
Let the living person talk.

575
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,560
You guys received supply earlier.

576
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,600
That's right. We gave you the supply.

577
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,200
We deserve to get
some supplies this time.

578
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,399
I think

579
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,000
those who arrived first
should have the supplies.

580
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,840
Squad Leader,

581
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,080
we reached here first.

582
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,560
Since you're calling him Squad Leader,

583
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,400
it's about our friendship
in the same regiment.

584
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,440
If you want to talk about friendship,
leave rules out of it then.

585
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,401
Cut the crap.

586
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,000
Just say if you'll give it to us.
