(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:31,040
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,720
(Episode 36)

4
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:35,320
Go for it, Yan!

5
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,120
Nice!

6
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:54,600
Fight back, Yan!

7
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Well done!

8
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,361
I admit defeat.

9
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,880
With your skill,

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,240
you are not even qualified
as a sparring partner.

11
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
He had never admitted defeat before.

12
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,320
Why do I have a feeling that his
talents will be wasted if this goes on?

13
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,241
What is on Captain Qin's mind?

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,879
Is it true that he won't allow
Yan Po Yue to take part in the contest?

15
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,080
His behaviour

16
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,481
is totally within my expectation.

17
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,480
Why is it within your expectation?

18
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,320
He's adjusting.

19
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,440
You mean, just like the old you?

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,240
I'm worried that
he'll overshoot the mark

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,600
and never rise again.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,240
Hurry up.

23
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,839
Let's talk.

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,920
Is it about Yan Po Yue?

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,000
Should we find a way to help him?

26
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,600
It's a golden opportunity
to prove himself.

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
-Yes.
-But look at him.

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,519
I know him well.

29
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,560
If he doesn't want to do it,
no one can convince him.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Give him some time.

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
Let's take a break.

32
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,280
Xiao Xiao!

33
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,720
Captain Leng.

34
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,240
You didn't realise my presence
even though I was so close to you.

35
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,480
That shouldn't have happened.

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
Don't think about anything
that is unrelated to the contest.

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,160
Focus on the training.

38
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,921
Captain Leng, please do me a favour.

39
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,360
Is it about Yan Po Yue?

40
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,360
I know that Captain Qin
don't see eye to eye with him

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
but he's really capable.

42
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,681
Can't we let him be the reserve player?

43
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Captain Qin and you...

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,040
He should be here.

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,199
Where are you?

46
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,320
You're physically present here
but are you focusing on training?

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,400
Captain Leng.

48
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't get me wrong.

49
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm concerned about him
just because he's my comrade.

50
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,280
Never be distracted during training,

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,160
including emotions, too.

52
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,160
Or else, you'll be eliminated next.

53
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,680
Yes.

54
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Not bad.

55
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,000
Select the top eight participants who
have scored the highest overall marks.

56
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Yes.

57
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:19,000
Captain Qin.

58
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,400
What about Yan Po Yue?

59
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
How is his performance lately?

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
He's exceptionally down to earth.

61
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,200
Captain Qin.

62
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,160
He's been doing logistics support work
for a long time.

63
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,601
Isn't it a waste of talent?

64
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,121
Moreover,

65
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,240
Yan Po Yue is indeed
a great soldier in the making.

66
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,800
If the situation continues,
his talents will be wasted.

67
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,760
All right, I got it.

68
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,239
Get ready for the contest.

69
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

70
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,080
I'll get going then.

71
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,001
Okay.

72
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,480
Is there anything else?

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm wondering

74
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,880
if Yan Po Yue
can take part in the contest

75
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,679
as a reserve player?

76
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,721
Let him see the world.

77
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,479
He's still young.

78
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,480
He will have plenty of chances
in the future.

79
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:10,720
He's young but he requires experience.

80
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,600
The peak of a member of special force

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,559
only lasts for a few years.

82
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,160
Moreover, he's low-spirited
at the moment.

83
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,921
If we don't give him
some motivation, he'll...

84
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,600
When he solves his problem,

85
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,225
I'll make arrangement for him.

86
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,873
Lately,

87
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,040
everyone has worked hard.

88
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,680
Firstly, I would like
to congratulate you guys.

89
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,879
Through this training,

90
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,880
you have all done well

91
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,361
in all your assessments.

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,920
Your results are not bad.

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,400
It's a shame

94
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,881
that the participants

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,120
are limited to eight people.

96
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:46,773
The eight participants

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,841
are filtered and selected

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,320
from various assessments.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
They are the best among the best

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,317
in Cheetah Commando.

101
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
They're representing Cheetah Commando

102
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,201
and China People's Armed Police Force

103
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,090
in the Warriors
International Special Unit Contest.

104
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,440
In the contest,

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,080
you'll meet the top
special forces soldiers

106
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,760
from all around the world

107
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,360
and have a match with them.

108
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:09,480
Therefore, this time around,

109
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,159
I'm sending Leng Jing and Lu Tu

110
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
to lead the team.

111
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,560
Lu Tu.

112
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,399
Yes!

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,252
Announce the list of contestants.

114
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,120
Yes!

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,399
I'm going to announce

116
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,320
the list of the contestants

117
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,361
of the Warriors
International Special Unit Contest

118
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,239
which will take place three days later.

119
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,840
Bai Long!

120
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,438
Yes!

121
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,320
Yue Kong!

122
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,079
Yes!

123
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,560
Xiao Yun Jie!

124
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,560
Yes!

125
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:33,007
Guo Xiao Xiao!

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,840
Yes!

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Gao Li Qiang!

128
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,560
Yes!

129
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,599
Wang Yi!

130
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,400
Yes!

131
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,481
Liu Yu!

132
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:39,122
Yes!

133
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,840
Bai Long!

134
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
Yes!

135
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:41,359
You're the leader.

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,960
Yes!

137
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:42,679
Gao Teng Fei!

138
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:43,320
Yes!

139
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:44,000
Sun Jia Cheng!

140
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:44,799
Yes!

141
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
You're the reserve players.

142
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,921
Report!

143
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,641
What's wrong?

144
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,680
Captain Qin!

145
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,840
My score is in the top eight
in each assessment.

146
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,600
Why am I just a reserve player?

147
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,481
Sun Jia Cheng.

148
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,640
Do you have a problem with that?

149
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,280
Are you dissatisfied?

150
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,560
Report!

151
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm dissatisfied!

152
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,359
You're not dissatisfied with them!

153
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,999
You're dissatisfied with me!

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,960
Sun Jia Cheng, come here.

155
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,879
Yes!

156
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,841
Launch an attack on me

157
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,559
with your greatest skills.

158
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,360
Get up.

159
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,999
Do you have any other problem?

160
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,839
Report!

161
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:39,913
No.

162
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:40,680
Fall in!

163
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,559
Yes!

164
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,439
Bear it in mind!

165
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
In Cheetah Commando,

166
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,520
I want the strongest team,

167
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,480
not the strongest individual!

168
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,840
No matter how strong a person is,

169
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,263
if they don't work with their comrades,

170
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,880
they'll ruin the entire team

171
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,440
due to their arrogance and obstinacy!

172
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,600
On the battlefield,

173
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,600
they'll sacrifice their comrades!

174
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,480
I hope you'll always bear this in mind.

175
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,800
During the contest,

176
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,040
stay united,

177
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,921
do your best

178
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,640
and win glory for our country.

179
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,480
What is Cheetah Commando's slogan?

180
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:25,801
Be fearless and fight side by side!

181
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,000
Today, they announced
the list of contestants.

182
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
You're one of them, right?

183
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,281
Yes.

184
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,713
Guo Xiao Xiao is one of them too, right?

185
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,480
That's great.

186
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,640
Yue Kong and Bai Long
are surely in the list.

187
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,880
Don't you have other view?

188
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,440
All of you are selected.

189
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
It means I've done a good job
in providing logistics support.

190
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Even Sun Jia Cheng of Squad Three
is selected.

191
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,880
You said you don't mind waiting.

192
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,119
The battle is starting soon.

193
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,239
What are you waiting for?

194
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,760
If you want to help me out,

195
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,960
I'll bring you all the shoes available

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,320
in Cheetah Commando.

197
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,760
Sure. Bring it on!

198
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,600
That's enough.

199
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
It's my work.

200
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
If you do it for me,

201
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:51,640
what else can I do?

202
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
Is this what you're supposed to do?

203
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,360
How long has it been?

204
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
The punishment has been long enough.

205
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,561
You said you'd think about it.

206
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,160
Have you thought it through?

207
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,320
I've thought it through.

208
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
I don't work hard
for my own gain and loss anymore.

209
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,160
I've gradually toned down.

210
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm quite happy with myself.

211
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,519
Work hard?

212
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,880
Do you take brushing shoes
as your goal?

213
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,080
What a joke.

214
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,080
That's right.

215
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,239
I used to be a joke.

216
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
Now, I'm doing everyone a favour.

217
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,000
I feel quite at ease.

218
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,760
Yan!

219
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,160
I beg of you!

220
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
Will you come back?

221
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,079
Be fearless

222
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,799
and fight side by side.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Only when our comrades
fight side by side with us,

224
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,000
we become fearless.

225
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,961
I've finally understood
the meaning of comrades.

226
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,479
When my comrades are around,

227
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm willing to do anything.

228
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,959
What else is there to clean?

229
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,000
Bring it to me.

230
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,440
I don't need your help.

231
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,199
Just let me know if you need help.

232
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
I didn't show you
enough concern in the past.

233
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,960
Yan!

234
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,920
I just want you to be kind to yourself.

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,800
We should fight for what we deserve.

236
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,440
You...

237
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,518
Don't you forget

238
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,880
the reason you joined Cheetah
in the first place.

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,080
I didn't forget it.

240
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,600
You, on the other hand,

241
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,560
should worry about yourself.

242
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
What's wrong with me?

243
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,280
You...

244
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,640
You're the least experienced
among the contestants.

245
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,920
Start preparing for the contest
when you're free.

246
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
Do some research
on the foreign special forces soldiers,

247
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,560
especially their firearm structure
and combat strategy.

248
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,160
I've made some notes.
I'll pass it to you tomorrow.

249
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,560
Are you not going to try again?

250
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,200
Soldiers are bound to obey orders.

251
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,600
You,

252
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
focus on the contest.

253
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,840
Don't worry about me.

254
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,880
Sure.

255
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,840
It's a deal.

256
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,041
If I win in the contest,

257
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,960
we must take a few photos
and send them to your father.

258
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,640
We'll tell him that we win together.

259
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,521
It's time to sleep.

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,360
Hold on!

261
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,880
Why do you leave me behind?

262
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,800
Gosh.

263
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,479
Yes.

264
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,200
(Please register at the entrance)
I'm coming back in a week.

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
Don't worry.

266
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,400
I'll make sure I call you first
once I'm back, okay?

267
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,000
You and Dad must
take good care of yourselves.

268
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Tell Dad to smoke less.

269
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:12,200
I promise I'll go home
for Chinese New Year this year.

270
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,039
Yes.

271
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,039
It's been a few years
since I last went back.

272
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,560
What are you sneaking up on?

273
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
You should go to bed.

274
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
Hold on. Xu Yang.

275
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:45,440
What's wrong?

276
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,519
Can you see what I wrote?

277
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:49,527
Nothing.

278
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,079
Go to bed.

279
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,360
Go now.

280
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,559
Captain Qin.

281
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,000
You work really hard.

282
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,200
It's my job.

283
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,080
Not bad.

284
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,559
The list of the contestants is out.

285
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,600
Have you heard about it?

286
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,440
Yes.

287
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,400
Many people have stepped forward
and wanted to do you justice.

288
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,760
They almost broke my office door.

289
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,198
What do you think?

290
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,359
Do you have any view?

291
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,559
Yes.

292
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,333
Tell me.

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,160
This is my note.

294
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,601
It contains

295
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,439
the temperature at the contest area
for the past ten years,

296
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,920
the humidity, wind speed, wind direction
and other nature elements.

297
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,688
Your English is quite good.

298
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:18,511
I learned it in high school.

299
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,839
I've forgotten most of it.

300
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,880
I used Baidu

301
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,799
to translate the terms one by one.

302
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,160
I've also made remarks
on the local food culture,

303
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,160
customs,

304
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,400
medical condition and dos and don'ts.

305
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,640
Do you think I'm not prepared for this?

306
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,360
Report.

307
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,400
I'm just doing my job

308
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,040
in providing logistics support.

309
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,400
We need one more person
from the logistics support team.

310
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,880
Do you want to tag along?

311
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,640
I obey the command.

312
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,360
Very well.

313
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,440
Focus on your work

314
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
and wait for their victory.

315
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,800
Yes!

316
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,160
Yan Po Yue.

317
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,920
Here!

318
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,920
Are you

319
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,840
completely emotionless?

320
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,240
I'm a soldier.

321
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,320
I should do my duty as a soldier.

322
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
It's about arrangement for Yan Po Yue.

323
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,840
Do we need to adjust anything?

324
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,640
The list of contestants
has been announced.

325
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,079
What is there to adjust?

326
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,480
Can't he join
the logistics support team?

327
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,599
What's wrong with you two?

328
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,001
Do you feel less confident

329
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,640
without Yan Po Yue in the team?

330
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,359
I can't deny that Yan Po Yue's
individual skills are very good.

331
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,400
Lately, he's changed tremendously.

332
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,120
In the future,

333
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,920
he probably will become
the best soldier in Cheetah.

334
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,400
But as the best soldier in the making,

335
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,560
he must be trained more rigorously

336
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:31,320
for a longer time.

337
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,320
The more he withstands now,

338
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,600
the better the rebound
will be in the future.

339
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,800
I stopped him from taking part
in the contest

340
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,640
because I want him to understand

341
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,360
that once he misses out the chance,

342
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,040
there's no way to start again.

343
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,600
The same applies to life.

344
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,600
Once you lose something,

345
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
it'll never come back.

346
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,040
If Yan Po Yue can accept this fact,

347
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,040
he'll cherish each and
every chance in the future.

348
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,921
He's injured! He can't go far. Come on!

349
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,559
Sure!

350
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,319
Is the administrator here?

351
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:33,452
I'm here.

352
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,121
Are you busy?

353
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,359
Anything?

354
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,079
Squad Seven is having a combat training.

355
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,439
Have you heard about it?

356
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,400
In the Special Unit Contest,

357
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,319
Yue Kong and Guo Xiao Xiao of Squad Nine

358
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,840
won the first place in sniping.

359
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,520
By the way,

360
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,560
weren't you in Squad Nine before?

361
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,960
Yes.

362
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,720
Take it.

363
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:15,432
Sure.

364
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:16,720
I'll get going then.

365
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,439
Hello, this is the armoury.

366
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,160
Yes!

367
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,079
Yes!

368
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,599
The result
of the Special Unit Contest is out.

369
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,121
In sniping contest,

370
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,720
we won.

371
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,760
Very well.

372
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
What is so well?

373
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,239
We didn't win as a team again!

374
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,920
Come here.

375
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,160
Take a look at this.

376
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:00,360
It's the battle topographic map.

377
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,480
Our men

378
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,599
were defeated at this spot.

379
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
It led to

380
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,961
a drastic drop in the marks.

381
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,240
That's why we didn't
win the championship.

382
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,400
They were at this spot at that time.

383
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,919
They were facing vigorous attack
by Country A's contestants at the front.

384
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,520
At the same time, Country B's
contestants ambushed them from the back.

385
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,239
They were attacked from both sides.

386
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,760
Hence, we suffered great losses.

387
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,400
That's the usual habit of Country A.

388
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,641
When our team was enticed
into entering the mountain pass,

389
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
they had already fallen into the trap.

390
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Do you know them well?

391
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,040
I did some research before.

392
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,400
Country A's team is swift to act.

393
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,800
They have a habit of attacking
their targets from the front.

394
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,319
They're powerful fighters
but their strength doesn't last long.

395
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,839
Country B's team is nicknamed the Hyena.

396
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,439
They like to play dirty.

397
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
They hide in the shadows
to steal other people' fruits

398
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,000
and build up their strength.

399
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,320
This spot.

400
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:59,280
If someone had placed a bait
to lure Country A's contestants here,

401
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,240
they would have come into
Country B's attack region.

402
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,320
Then, Country B would have
switched their target from Squad Nine

403
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,000
to Country A.

404
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,200
Go ahead.

405
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,000
Country A had the upper hand

406
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,160
due to geographical advantage.

407
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:17,239
If their direction were changed,
they would run into Country B.

408
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,800
In this case, they wouldn't be
at the advantage.

409
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,959
They would become

410
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,880
an easy target to Country B instead.

411
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,280
Of course,

412
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,640
besides that,

413
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
what's more important is...

414
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,199
What's more important is that

415
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
in the previous contest,

416
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
Country B saw the hope of winning

417
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,640
but Country A intercepted.

418
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,000
When enemies run into each other,

419
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:39,079
their eyes would blaze with hatred.

420
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,079
In that case,

421
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,600
the crisis would have been solved

422
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,760
and we would have the upper hand.

423
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,560
I regret it now.

424
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,880
I should have sent you to the contest.

425
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,640
Captain Qin.

426
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,800
My proposal

427
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,120
is an assumption based on the map.

428
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,720
Practicality and adaptability
on the battlefield

429
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,240
won't be so simple.

430
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,119
Since when have you become so humble?

431
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,199
I believe in my comrades.

432
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:08,280
Their moves were safer.

433
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Analyse this for me.

434
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:13,439
If you were in the contest,

435
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,160
would you choose the risky move

436
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,680
or the safe one?

437
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,761
I would seek unity of action.

438
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,119
Come in.

439
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:37,680
Instructor.

440
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,360
Yan Po Yue, that's all.

441
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,200
You may leave now.

442
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,200
Yes.

443
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,080
He can't take it anymore.

444
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,513
Was he protesting?

445
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,010
Our effort has paid off.

446
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,519
The pick over thousands of choices

447
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,905
has to work in
the logistics support team.

448
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,720
When do you plan to stop pressing him?

449
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,440
This is Deputy Director Ding
of the City Council.

450
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,520
These are comrades
from the narcotics squad.

451
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,719
Next, we will ask

452
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,119
Deputy Director Ding to give
a brief overview of the case.

453
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,040
It's an urgent situation.

454
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,160
Therefore, we'd like to seek help
from the Cheetah Commando

455
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,800
to assist us in our mission.

456
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,457
We have received an order
from the higher-ups.

457
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,920
The Red Scorpion has been characterised

458
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,680
as a drug trafficking
organisation with terrorism..

459
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,040
Anti-terrorism is the duty
of the armed police forces.

460
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:28,521
We will definitely give
our full cooperation.

461
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,199
Now, please tell us the exact situation.

462
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,359
With the continued suppression
of drug trafficking at the border,

463
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,839
drug traffickers have been
struggling to find a new route.

464
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,000
(Ma Yin Tao)
This is the undercover agent we sent.

465
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,400
He was killed two days ago.

466
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,920
According to the last piece
of information from him,

467
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,841
we have the identity of Red Scorpion's

468
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,160
mysterious buyer from
the mainland this time.

469
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,398
(Red Scorpion's mysterious buyer)
His name is Shu Hai.

470
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,959
He's a drug dealer in Southern Yunnan.

471
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,199
His clan is very powerful.

472
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,840
This man is known to have
made his fortune from mining.

473
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,040
He used to work as a blaster
at mining well.

474
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
He's familiar with
dynamite and the operations.

475
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,160
So, it is likely that explosives

476
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:11,800
such as detonators
are hidden in his home.

477
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,520
This is a very difficult and
dangerous arrest operation.

478
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,400
It's only worthwhile

479
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,920
if we arrest him alive.

480
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,160
We may alert him
if we go for the usual operation.

481
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,881
Local drug traffickers
are just like slippery eels.

482
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,400
When we're taking actions against them,

483
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,355
various factors must be considered.

484
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,120
That's right.

485
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,638
If we can catch him,

486
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,320
we can follow the trail

487
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,480
and uncover the Red Scorpion's
smuggling lines.

488
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,120
Chief of Staff.

489
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,840
Yes.

490
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,880
We've decided to send
Squad One of Special Forces

491
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,039
to assist you in the arrest operation.

492
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,623
He's the captain of Squad One, Qin Feng

493
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,200
and he's the instructor, Liu Nan.

494
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:49,520
Thank you for your help.

495
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,400
It's our job.

496
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:51,353
Please share with us

497
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,920
the other information
about the suspect in details.

498
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,640
Report!

499
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,440
Sit down.

500
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,640
Yes!

501
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,541
We always say that

502
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,560
train an army for a thousand days,
use it for an instant.

503
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,821
After each of you joined Cheetah,

504
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,999
your food, necessities
and training costs together

505
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,560
are higher than the cost of supporting
a conventional combat squad.

506
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,440
Now,

507
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,319
it's time for you

508
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
to prove your worth.

509
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,200
This man

510
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,600
is the target of this operation.

511
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,558
Who will do the profile analysis?

512
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,440
Report!

513
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,520
Say it.

514
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,359
Male,

515
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,280
approximately 180cm high,

516
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,520
body weight between 70 to 75kg,

517
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,640
about 40 years old.

518
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,559
Based on his outfit, skin colour

519
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,000
and surrounding,
it's safe to assume that

520
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
he lives near the border
on a permanent basis.

521
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,479
He is not highly educated,

522
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,840
and he is left-handed.

523
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:55,039
Anything else?

524
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,439
He is a businessman,

525
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,439
a new money.

526
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,600
That's all.

527
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:02,199
Sit down.

528
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,319
Can anyone else

529
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,480
tell me more information?

530
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,920
Yan Po Yue.

531
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,400
Here!

532
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,600
Share your view with us.

533
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,081
Yes.

534
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,359
Can we zoom in the photo?

535
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,200
More.

536
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,920
Okay.

537
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,519
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

538
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,080
He's dangerous.

539
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,761
How can you tell it?

540
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,920
Not everyone can become a new money.

541
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,441
To be a new money,

542
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,600
one needs to be rich.

543
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,401
When someone suddenly becomes rich,
he will start showing off.

544
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,040
But it is rare for anyone to
show off in such a remote village.

545
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,880
Therefore,

546
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,319
he may be too stupid

547
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,079
to know the hatred towards the rich

548
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,681
and not be afraid to die.

549
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:01,138
But apparently,

550
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,359
someone who could be
selected as our target

551
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,639
doesn't fall into this category.

552
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,955
Therefore,
there is only one possibility.

553
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,200
He's too smart.

554
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,199
Through this method,

555
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,960
he's trying to pass a message

556
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,999
to everyone around him.

557
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
What kind of message is that?

558
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:20,892
Gold chunky necklace,

559
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,441
watch,

560
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,063
and gold ring.

561
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,686
He wants to tell everyone through these

562
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,958
that he can make
a lot of money in a short time.

563
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:32,880
Getting involved in pornography,
gambling and drug trafficking

564
00:30:32,906 --> 00:30:36,319
are three of the best ways for someone
to get rich in a short period of time.

565
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:37,853
I think

566
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,000
he's trying to tell others

567
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,159
that selling drugs

568
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,359
would make you
rich overnight like I did.

569
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,480
Yan Po Yue's analysis is very good.

570
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,480
Is there anything else?

571
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:04,760
His body tends to deviate towards
the right when he's walking.

572
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,759
This means that he must
have injured his left leg before.

573
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,480
He's not born left-handed.

574
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,561
He's right-handed.

575
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,439
Look at this.

576
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,601
His right hand

577
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,280
has a yellowish stain that seeps into
the skin and is difficult to wash off.

578
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,760
He has calluses on his fingers, too.

579
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,880
It shows that he spent a lot of
time with guns and sulphur.

580
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,240
In my opinion,

581
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,400
due to corrosiveness of sulphur,

582
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,360
the skin on his right hand
has become stiff and insensitive.

583
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
That's why he started
using his left hand.

584
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,680
Hence, the range of movement
of his right hand is great.

585
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,961
This man was severely injured before.

586
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,599
He has long been exposed to explosives,

587
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,040
but he's good at pulling mind tricks
and he looks innocent when he smiles.

588
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,000
Undoubtedly,

589
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:41,880
he's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

590
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,000
That's all from me.

591
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,081
Yan Po Yue's

592
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,119
analysis is great.

593
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:00,199
This man is Shu Hai.

594
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,240
He's from Red River.

595
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,001
He's the biggest drug trafficker

596
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,320
in southern Yunnan.

597
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,319
He took advantage of family ties,
local ties and internal gang rules

598
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,760
to build a well-structured
criminal gang

599
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,119
with a clear division of labour

600
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:16,199
that combines drug production,
transport and trafficking.

601
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,960
They sell firearms and drugs.

602
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
They're gangsters cum drug traffickers.

603
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,560
In order to oppose the
public security authorities

604
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,000
they used air, rail and road

605
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,560
to transport drugs nationwide

606
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,280
in a multi-directional way.

607
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:27,400
The public security department

608
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,385
had sent undercover agents to try to
get close to him on several occasions.

609
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
but with no success.

610
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,160
All the comrades sent there

611
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,880
have gone missing in action.

612
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:37,160
No one knows if they're still alive.

613
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,760
Over a decade ago,

614
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,840
Shu Hai worked as a blaster
at a mining well.

615
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:45,719
He's familiar with explosives

616
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,359
and he's closely associated with
the mercenary near the border.

617
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,080
In addition to producing
and trafficking drugs,

618
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,959
he also smuggles firearms.

619
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,719
That's why he has a lot of guns and
ammunition stocked up around him.

620
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:54,933
Shu Hai

621
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,079
is cunning

622
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,239
and vigilant.

623
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,440
Not only is he protected by many people,

624
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,680
he also manipulates the villagers
to cover himself up.

625
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,039
Worse, he has been
adopting goddaughters.

626
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,280
He holds these underaged girls
as his hostages and shields.

627
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,440
If we send regular troops
to arrest him,

628
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,041
not only will we alert him,

629
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,441
we'll also turn the operation
into a chaos.

630
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,120
Hence, this arrest operation

631
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
will be conducted by Cheetah.

632
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,879
I'll lead Squad Seven to arrest him.

633
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,319
In the process,

634
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,441
if we encounter any form of
resistance by force,

635
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,299
we're allowed to fire the rifle
and kill him on the spot.

636
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,600
Do you get it?

637
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,800
Yes!

638
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,192
Yan Po Yue.

639
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,076
Yes!

640
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,360
Join Squad Seven in action.

641
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,600
Do you hear me?

642
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,681
Yes!

643
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,041
Report.

644
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,280
Why do you take me along
in this operation?

645
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,479
Why are you reporting?

646
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,360
I am

647
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,439
worried that you will get mouldy
since you've spent too much time

648
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,080
in the armoury.

649
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,839
Buy some fruits.

650
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,921
How much are these bananas?

651
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,400
It's three yuan for half kg.

652
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,281
I'll take this.

653
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:35,680
Thank you.

654
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,840
Alright. Thank you.

655
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,119
Let's go.

656
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,639
Let's find a place to eat.

657
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
Boss, we would like to order some food.

658
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,799
Yun Cai.

659
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,519
Come to the kitchen.

660
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,079
Misters,

661
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
what do you want to order?

662
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,932
Do you have any recommendation?

663
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,559
We sell snacks.

664
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,080
I wonder if you are used
to eating our snacks.

665
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,719
We'll have two bowls of rice noodles.

666
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,480
Okay.

667
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:27,120
Two bowls of rice noodles.

668
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,480
Are the two of you

669
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,599
here for a trip or work?

670
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,920
We're here for sightseeing.

671
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,080
You're here for sightseeing?

672
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,640
How did you come up with the
idea of visiting a remote village?

673
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,233
I like to go on self-drive trips.

674
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,480
I dislike crowded places.

675
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,520
I love visiting villages.

676
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,360
It's fun.

677
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,800
Judging from your accent,

678
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,600
you're from the north, right?

679
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,400
You're wrong. We're from Chengdu.

680
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,480
Young man,

681
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,200
why are you so quiet?

682
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,199
He?

683
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,840
He got a stomach flu two days ago.

684
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,759
He's feeling unwell.

685
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,441
That's right.

686
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
The border is humid.

687
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,880
Have you adapted to the environment?

688
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,320
It's okay.

689
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,360
This village

690
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:25,520
looks more prosperous than
any of the neighbouring villages.

691
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,960
This area is surrounded by mountains.
The landscape is great

692
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,760
but there is not much space
for planting.

693
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,440
On top of that,
the weather is inconsistent.

694
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,754
The roads have not been
repaired for so many years.

695
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,481
The villagers barely
make enough to feed themselves.

696
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:44,453
Thank you.

697
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,319
Alright. Thank you.

698
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,960
Give it a try.

699
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,761
It's delicious!

700
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,921
Go home after sightseeing.

701
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,080
This place is not interesting.

702
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,719
Okay, thanks.

703
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,341
Take a look.

704
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,000
This house must have been here
for some time.

705
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,840
This is a nice place.

706
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,760
Hello.

707
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,360
Captain.

708
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,280
Should we go looking for our target now?

709
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,000
Do you know where our target is?

710
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,721
Don't we have the information?

711
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,600
After lunch,

712
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,200
let's have some tea.

713
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,241
Let's go.

714
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
This view is not bad.

715
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,960
Please enjoy.

716
00:38:00,997 --> 00:38:01,719
Alright. Thank you.

717
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,399
Thank you.

718
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,481
Here.

719
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:11,959
After taking a stroll,

720
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,521
did you notice anything?

721
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
Tell me.

722
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,040
What did you see?

723
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,040
Firstly,

724
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,561
the locals are not
very welcoming, friendly

725
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:25,642
or even wary of outsiders.

726
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,200
The restaurant owner looked like
he was chatting to us,

727
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,799
but was actually trying
to find out what we were up to.

728
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,200
The houses in this village
are old and shabby.

729
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
This means that
the local people are very poor.

730
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,080
But in the centre of such a poor place,

731
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,360
there is a commercial street
that begins to take shape.

732
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,319
Keep going.

733
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,988
Logically, the local tourism
is not developed.

734
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:45,109
The locals should rely on agriculture.

735
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,001
However, along the way,

736
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,400
the young people that we saw

737
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,839
are not working in the farm.

738
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,160
They're wandering around
the village, doing nothing.

739
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,639
I can feel that people in this village

740
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,599
are impatient.

741
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
All the answer

742
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,280
is behind me.

743
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,160
Here.

744
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,200
Can you see the
three-storey building in the distance?

745
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,043
It's heavily guarded.

746
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,761
Those bodyguards are nothing.

747
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,840
That place

748
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:25,680
is protected by two layers
of iron fence.

749
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,520
On top of the iron fence,

750
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,320
there are barbed wires.

751
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:32,760
Barbed wires look like springs.

752
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,159
It's built up layer by layer.

753
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,760
If someone hit the wire,

754
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,000
they'll be warped up by the wire.

755
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
The more they struggle,

756
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,960
the tighter the wrap is.

757
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,760
Can you see the solar panels

758
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,360
and wind turbines?

759
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,200
They must have turned the iron fence
into an electric fence.

760
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,320
There are CCTVs around the building.

761
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,760
The cameras are placed intersecting.
There are no blind spots.

762
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,481
Those are the details that we can see.

763
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,600
The most troublesome ones

764
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,441
are those we can't see.

765
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,241
You mean, the human mind.

766
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,600
At the entrance of the villa,

767
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:21,760
there is a white Porsche sports car.

768
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,760
The car is taken care of
by a specific person.

769
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,080
It's squeaky clean.

770
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,919
Shu Hai is using this
eye-catching sports car

771
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,920
to excite the young people of the
village to follow him into the madness.

772
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,000
After all, a successful example
is right before them.

773
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,799
The shortcut to wealth is right here.

774
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,120
How many of them can resist
the temptation of getting rich overnight

775
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:48,700
and continue struggling in life
by working in the farm?

776
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,000
Shu Hai

777
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,080
is an evil-minded smarty-pants.

778
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,440
He'll make use of others
to reach his goal.

779
00:40:58,399 --> 00:40:59,679
All the villagers here

780
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,879
are inextricably tied to him.

781
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,080
Even if they're not working for him,

782
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,920
they must have accepted his help before.

783
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,440
As time passes,

784
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,159
these villagers

785
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,639
have become his shields to cover him.

786
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,040
They become very wary

787
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,720
whenever a stranger appears.

788
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,761
That's why you asked

789
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,961
Squad Seven to stay hidden
in the mountains

790
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,200
since we arrived.

791
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:27,320
That's right.

792
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,599
I can guarantee

793
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,053
that if all our men come in,

794
00:41:31,512 --> 00:41:32,792
Shu Hai will be gone

795
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,720
before we reach the entrance
to the village.

796
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,881
When we deal with a cunning foe,

797
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,280
regular measures are not applicable.

798
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:43,239
We must take him down in one go.

799
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,240
So, you have brought me here today

800
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,952
because you already
have a plan for the next step?

801
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Shu Hai doesn't simply make appearance.

802
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:54,720
However,

803
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,920
people who make money with illegal means

804
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,220
have a common problem.

805
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,720
They are superstitious.

806
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,800
According to the information,

807
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,440
on the first day of every lunar month,

808
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,320
Shu Hai will pray at the temple
on the mountain.

809
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,160
Tomorrow

810
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:10,693
is the first day of the month.

811
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,440
No matter how heavily guarded
Shu Hai's fort is,

812
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,880
once he's out of his house,

813
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,840
arresting him

814
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,280
is not too difficult for us.

815
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,040
You're here today

816
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,160
to test the locals.

817
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,640
We can only shoot the target,

818
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,240
but not the villagers.

819
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,680
You now have the full picture.

820
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,080
I'm worried

821
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,680
that if we come in with troops tomorrow,

822
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,520
there will be an unexpected incident.
