1
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:31,040
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,760
(Episode 39)

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,080
I hate you,

5
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,480
but I envy you more.

6
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,600
I'm glad that
I'm still a Chinese soldier.

7
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
I've unlocked the fence for you.

8
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,479
You're on your own.

9
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,160
Dispatch me in the first battle.

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
Victory will be assured.

11
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,881
What is my dagger doing here?

12
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,720
I should be asking you

13
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,240
why Yan Po Yue

14
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,359
would have your dagger.

15
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:32,527
How would I know?

16
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
This dagger

17
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
was pulled out from my brother's body.

18
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,440
So what?

19
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,120
Maybe it was you who took my
dagger to frame me, who knows?

20
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:41,200
Say that again!

21
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,320
What's wrong with you?

22
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,760
Lai.

23
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,744
Yan Po Yue...

24
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,600
I should've just
killed him at that time.

25
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,479
Yes.

26
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,040
Who was the one who stopped me
from killing Yan Po Yue?

27
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,041
Xing Tian,

28
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,440
he got away under your watch.

29
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
Don't try to frame me!

30
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,000
If you were me,

31
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,840
who would you think did it?

32
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,160
It's him.

33
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,161
He's a member of
the Chinese People's Armed Police Force.

34
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,640
He's an undercover cop!

35
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,880
Are you crazy?

36
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm the one who brought him back.

37
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,080
Why would I go through all that trouble?

38
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,600
You just want to set me up!

39
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,119
None of Xin Min's men

40
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,480
can be trusted.

41
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
I've been wondering

42
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,920
if one of you was an undercover cop,

43
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,120
why would you go through
all that trouble to bring him back?

44
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,240
Life is worth more alive than dead.

45
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,400
You taught me that.

46
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,022
You both passed the test

47
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,440
Go.

48
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,640
When I handed you the gun yesterday,

49
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,360
it was unloaded.

50
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,040
But you knew that, right?

51
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,400
The criminals we face

52
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,721
(Martyr Yue Kong)
are very vicious and cunning.

53
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,799
But fighting drug-related crime

54
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,841
is our unshirkable responsibility.

55
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,400
In recent years,

56
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,080
our public security officers and
armed police officers

57
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,296
have blocked the largest passage for

58
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,680
the transportation of drugs from
Southeast Asia to our territory.

59
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,600
Cheetah's soldiers are constantly
fighting in the pristine jungle,

60
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,240
leaving criminals terrified.

61
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,041
The criminals now realise that the
Chinese People's Armed Police Force

62
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,080
is an unbeatable force.

63
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
Cheetah Commando

64
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,720
has made great contribution.

65
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:03,760
Salute to all martyrs.

66
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,960
Hats off!

67
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,560
Ready, fire!

68
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:19,440
Fire!

69
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Fire!

70
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,080
(From the day I joined
the armed police forces,)

71
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
(I knew)

72
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:36,240
(that our life belongs to the country,)

73
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,719
(the people.)

74
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
(In the most critical moments,)

75
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,880
(we never back down,)

76
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,801
(nor do we hesitate.)

77
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,120
(We have learned to)

78
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,160
(work together)

79
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,360
(and shoot our way out of desperation.)

80
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,361
(In the future,)

81
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
(we will become even stronger.)

82
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,880
Guo Xin.

83
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,560
The best shooter among her squad.

84
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,680
She's willing to be a spotter.

85
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
So what if she is the best?

86
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,520
Even if you say yes to this,

87
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
she may not say yes.

88
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:19,265
Report, sir!

89
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,152
Enter.

90
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:28,009
Captain Qin.

91
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:29,053
Captain Leng.

92
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,880
Xiao Xiao,

93
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,079
do you know why I called you here?

94
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,166
Yes, ma'am.

95
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,920
Have a look.

96
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,760
I don't need it.

97
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:45,600
I prefer to work alone.

98
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,160
This isn't about what you prefer.

99
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,800
These posts are fixed in the army.

100
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
And this is for your own good.

101
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,880
If you truly have
my best interest at heart,

102
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
please don't assign me another spotter.

103
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,920
Guo Xiao Xiao,

104
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,240
in combat,

105
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,320
snipers are the strongest,

106
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,880
but at the same time,
they are also the most vulnerable.

107
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,160
If anything happens,

108
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,880
two persons

109
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
can take care of each other.

110
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:23,436
Captain Qin,

111
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,520
you should know better than me.

112
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,160
Those who wanted to take care of me

113
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,400
are gone.

114
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,040
Xiao Xiao,

115
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,480
we hate this too, but comrades
sacrificing for each other is...

116
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,240
I don't want anyone to sacrifice
themselves for me anymore!

117
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm only fit to fight alone.

118
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,040
Sir, ma'am, please approve my request.

119
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,920
Okay.

120
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
I understand what you want.

121
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,800
I'll consider it carefully.

122
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:05,680
Go back first.

123
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
Yes, sir!

124
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,920
That's it?

125
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,240
That's it.

126
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:26,639
This doesn't comply
with the regulations.

127
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,440
But assigning a spotter to her now

128
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,600
will only add to her pressure!

129
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,960
I'll talk to her again.

130
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
I knitted

131
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,201
this scarf for Leng Bing.

132
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,040
I used to see her

133
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,120
sending you food

134
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,200
and clothes happily.

135
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,960
She didn't know how to knit a scarf.

136
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,240
So, she kept pestering me to teach her.

137
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,320
She said she wanted to
give it to you on your birthday.

138
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,080
I guess you can say

139
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,280
I'm fulfilling her wish for her.

140
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,920
After she passed away,

141
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
I became Lone Wolf.

142
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,440
After I joined Cheetah,

143
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,760
I thought maybe I could change,

144
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,080
but then Yue Kong...

145
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,320
I'm scared now.

146
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,480
Maybe this is my destiny.

147
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Captain Leng,

148
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,520
I really can't have a partner anymore.

149
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,680
Leng Bing,

150
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,120
Yue Kong,

151
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,320
they are all gone forever

152
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,280
because they were trying to protect me.

153
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,680
If I have a partner again in the future,

154
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,400
I will definitely be distracted.

155
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
I'll always worry about
not being able to protect him.

156
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,560
I won't be able to focus in the mission.

157
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,640
They were killed in action.

158
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,680
It's not your fault.

159
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,559
I wish I was the one
who got killed, not them!

160
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
I... We fought together,

161
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
I thought I was no longer a lone wolf.

162
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,960
But in the end,

163
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,320
I couldn't even
give them a proper goodbye!

164
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,040
Whether you blame me or not,

165
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,720
what difference does it make?

166
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,280
Wait.

167
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,080
You knitted

168
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,600
this scarf for her.

169
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,040
Let me put it on you for her.

170
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,560
If she could do it all over again,

171
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,960
she would still choose to protect you.

172
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,760
What we can exchange between us

173
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,960
is life and fearless courage.

174
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,800
(Martyr Xiang Fei)

175
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,560
Under that situation,

176
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,840
other than using yourself
as a shooting tripod,

177
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,320
was there really nothing else
you could do?

178
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,320
You wanted a reason
to set yourself free.

179
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,440
Congratulations.

180
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,800
You did it!

181
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,320
What's wrong?

182
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,840
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,600
I didn't participate in Operation Cobra

184
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,440
because of my personal reason.

185
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,080
I failed to protect Captain Xiang.

186
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,920
And I blamed it on you.

187
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,680
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,040
It's not your fault.

189
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,840
Xiang Fei

190
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,840
was our big brother.

191
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,680
At the same time, he was also
a Chinese soldier.

192
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,360
As a captain,

193
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,040
he did what he should
do on a battlefield.

194
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,000
So did I.

195
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
You'll always be

196
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,920
the captain of Squad Nine.

197
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,560
Bai,

198
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,640
I can't go into battle anymore.

199
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
I will go.

200
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,200
I want you to bring everyone back alive.

201
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,960
Don't worry.

202
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
You will

203
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,800
always be my best friend.

204
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,720
Our brothers have become cannon fodder.

205
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,360
You have to pay for their burial fee.

206
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
They were your men.

207
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:30,200
Why should I pay?

208
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,080
Our brothers died for you.

209
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,599
Shouldn't you take some responsibility?

210
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,119
I'll pay.

211
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,880
Why didn't you just kill them?

212
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,360
I've had enough of
those two old farts' yak.

213
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,120
In this area, only three gangs
including us are in this business.

214
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,120
If we take them out,

215
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,920
the government forces
will focus their fire on us.

216
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,320
We want to expand our business,

217
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:15,800
but we lost a lot of men

218
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,480
in the battle at the border.

219
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,480
And you killed Deputy Chief Li.

220
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,320
Many of his men have run away.

221
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,560
We'll recruit more men then.

222
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,159
There is no more men to recruit
in the nearby villages.

223
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,960
We'll recruit in the
farther village then!

224
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,320
The government forces and
guerrillas are in war every year.

225
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,800
The men either joined the army,
or ran away.

226
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,560
It's really hard for us
to recruit more men.

227
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,160
Since we can't recruit adults,

228
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,601
we'll recruit children then.

229
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,120
Anyone who is capable of holding a gun

230
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
will join us!

231
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,720
Stop there! Stop!

232
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,000

233

-Armed drug traffickers.

Lai,

271
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
why did you capture all these children?
What do we need them for?

272
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,240
The younger the children,
the more useful they are.

273
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,520
Look,

274
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
when I was their age,

275
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,000
I already killed two people.

276
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,760
Kun Sheng taught you to do that?

277
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,377
If you had been starving
in the dark for days,

278
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,265
someone suddenly

279
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,079
let you out.

280
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,960
Then, he fed you and clothed you.

281
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,000
Who

282
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,440
do you think he is?

283
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,800
God.

284
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,760
That's right.

285
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,360
God.

286
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,880
I am their God!

287
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,280
Daddy Khun

288
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,280
used to be my God in the past.

289
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,519
Now,

290
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,760
I am going to be their God.

291
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,040
A lot of men here grew up that way!

292
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,760
The younger the kids are,

293
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,720
the more they will rely on you
and trust you.

294
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,360
The more deadly
the bullet they shoot will be

295
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,720
when they grow up.

296
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,880
Who is there?

297
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,960
Show yourself!

298
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:34,719
What are you doing here?

299
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,520
Dad asked me to keep an eye on you.

300

Hu!

301
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,560
You couldn't contact them?

302
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,080
I forgot to tell you.

303
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:56,800
I turned on the jammer.

304
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,560
It's him!

305
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,200
It's him. He told me
to steal the dagger.

306
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,440
Please let me go!

307
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,720
I really don't know anything!

308
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Please!

309
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,120
Please let me go!

310
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,880
Please let me go!

311
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,800
Stay still.

312
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,600
Xing Tian,

313
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,280
you're a monster created by Kun Sheng.

314
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,920
Even after Kun Sheng died,

315
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,040
you're still living in his shadow.

316
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
Mr. Undercover Cop,

317
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,560
do you know why I didn't expose you?

318
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,560
Does that still matter?

319
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,760
There were always undercover cops
placed around me.

320
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
Even if it weren't you,
there would be someone else.

321
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,360
Getting rid of you isn't hard at all.

322
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,080
But if they send in a new guy,

323
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,240
I will have to investigate him again.

324
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,360
But today is different.

325
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,440
If you send them the evidence
of me killing Chinese citizen,

326
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,720
the Chinese government and
the local government

327
00:27:04,742 --> 00:27:06,840
will join forces to come at us.

328
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,520
Sorry.

329
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:12,480
This is as far as your job here goes.

330
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,800
Given your fighting capability,

331
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,360
you might be able to
kill one or two men,

332
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,200
but there is no way
you can get out of here today.

333
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,280
You can't get away.

334
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,680
That's in the future!

335
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,240
Don't worry.

336
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,600
I won't kill you.

337
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,000
Life is worth more alive than dead.

338
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,920
With your life in our hands,

339
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,760
the missiles won't fall on our roof.

-At 3:00am today,

342
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,400
we received our informant's
GPS tracking signal.

343
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:57,839
It has been on the move.

344
00:27:58,339 --> 00:27:59,819
So local government forces
went over to check it out.

345
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,560
A woman's body was found by the river.

346
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,344
The deceased was
a border citizen from Country M.

347
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:05,301
She was abducted by Red Scorpion
three months ago.

348
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,974
We found our informant's locator
in her hair.

349
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,600
Where was the deceased found?

350
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,680
Here.

351
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,960
From the time she died
until her body was found,

352
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,439
there was about three hours apart.

353
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,760
Based on the speed of the current
in the early morning hours,

354
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,319
the area where the victim
was killed and dumped

355
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,320
is around here.

356
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,758
The location where the signal
first received is from

357
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,279
the left side of the river channel.

358
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,680
It's likely that Red Scorpion
has installed signal jammer.

359
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Our undercover agent
couldn't send out the intel.

360
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,040
He could only tell us
the location this way.

361
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:35,200
This area is covered in dense jungle
and extremely secluded.

362
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,040
Estimate the jamming area immediately.

363
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,120
Try your best to narrow it down.

364
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,001
Yes, sir.

365
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,760
We've been out of contact with
our informant for 20 hours.

366
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,360
Informant Xiao Fei was previously
under the armed police forces.

367
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,080
He became an anti-narcotics
officer after his discharge.

368
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,440
If his cover was blown,

369
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:49,920
his life could be in danger at any time.

370
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,492
And Xing Tian may escape at any time.

371
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,280
So, Operation Red Scorpion
will have to start early.

372
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,560
Our troops have been
assembled at the border.

373
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,040
During our joint operation this time,
we must destroy Red Scorpion

374
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:02,119
and capture Xing Tian alive.

375
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,560
We owe this to China.

376
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,240
Qin Feng.

377
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
Understood, sir!

378
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,400
-Lu Tu.
-Yes, sir.

379
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,400
Assemble Squad Nine.

380
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,520
-Get ready to set out!
-Yes, sir!

381
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,320
(Country M has made request
to our country)

382
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
(to jointly eliminate Red Scorpion.)

383
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,640
(Our mission this time
is part of a joint operation.)

384
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,600
(Considering that it's the border area,
this is a special mission,

385
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,880
(the higher-ups and the government of
Country M have been in close contact.)

386
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:48,315
(We have coordinated Country M)

387
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,800
(to authorize us to operate
in a mutually agreed area.)

388
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,080
(They will be in charge of
blocking the major travel routes)

389
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,000
(in the operational area
in the country.)

390
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,320
(Red Scorpion has many
eyes and ears in the area.)

391
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,719
(To keep our operation in secret
and hide our identity,)

392
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,320
(we have to dress differently
to deceive them.)

393
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,320
(Come back)

394
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,400
(safely.)

395
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,680
(Recon Sniper Team,
Recon Mission Day 3)

396
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,320
(Target Spotted)

397
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,226
(Xing Tian, Terrorist drug trafficking
organisation leader)

398
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,360
It's Xing Tian.

399
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
Tiger Head, Tiger Head.

400
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,920
Target 1 is confirmed
to be back to nest.

401
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,800
Over.

402
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,840
(Copy that.)

403
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,320
(Has Target 2 been located?)

404
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,800
(Over.)

405
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,120
(Not yet.)

406
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,120
(Over.)

407
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,880
The communication is unstable.
I'll go around to the north-east.

408
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,360
Be careful.

409
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:56,445
I'll be fine.

410
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,280
Has the patrol team returned?

411
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,160
Hasn't.

412
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,320
They will probably return an hour later.

413
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,320
Tell them to patrol the
opposite mountain again.

414
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,679
Look carefully.

415
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,680
Something may be happening.

416
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,960
(Tiger Claw Two.)

417
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:43,720
(Someone is coming.)

418
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,600
(Take cover.)

419
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,480
Tiger Head, Tiger Head.

420
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,399
Our position may have been compromised.

421
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,280
Move to second sniper position now.

422
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,800
I see you still won't talk.

423
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,799
Keep him alive.

424
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,080
Don't kill him.

425
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,798
Tiger Head, Tiger Head.

426
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,520
Location of the hostage,
Target 2, is confirmed.

427
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,880
Request for quick backup.

428
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,160
(Tiger Head copy.)

429
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Target has been found.

430
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,921
Go into the river in 30 seconds.

431
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,160
(Tiger Fang One,)

432
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,400
(the edge of the gate is
close to the C4 building,)

433
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,440
(suitable to sneak in.)

434
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,560
(B1 clear.)

435
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,600
(Enter the gate,
go south for 80 meters,)

436
00:35:47,972 --> 00:35:50,252
(turn left for 40 meters and you
will reach the intended location.)

437
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,800
(Watch out for C2 and B4.)

438
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,120
(It's patrolled by sentries.)

439
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,440
(There are four patrolmen)

440
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,400
(passing by the connection
of B1 and B2.)

441
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,880
(Clear. Good to go.)

442
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,280
(Two on the tower.)

443
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,880
(One has heavy machine gun.)

444
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,000
Leave them two to me.

445
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,080
(One man on the first floor
of the east corridor,)

446
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,600
(fully automatic assault rifle.)

447
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,160
(One on the rooftop,)

448
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,520
(fully automatic assault rifle.)

449
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,800
At least two in the room.

450
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:56,719
Weapons unknown.

451
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,280
Two men at the door,

452
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,639
armed with assault rifles.

453
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,720
One man on the second floor.

454
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,840
One man on north-west corner of B2.

455
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,960

(two men are passing by
north-west corner of B2.)

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,400
B2 clear.

459
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:47,772
(Tiger Fang Two, three o'clock.)

460
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,000
(A01 to A11 all clear.)

461
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,400
(No men seen at the moment.)

462
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,000
Signal everyone
to start moving together.

463
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,880
(All units, confirm your target.)

464
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,479
Tiger Fang One, target confirmed.

465
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,680

Tiger Claw One, target confirmed.

00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,920
Get ready to move.

471
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:02,712
(Three.)

472
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,560
(Two.)

473
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,320
(One.)

474
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,160
(All clear on target's location.)

475
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,120
Wake up.

476
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,960
Identification code, please.

477
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,320
Dispatch me in the first battle,
victory will be assured.

478
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,200
Identity confirmed.

479
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,160
Target 2 has been saved.

480
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,080
Emergency medical treatment required.
No. 3, take care of him.

481
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,960
(Roger that.)

482

Tiger Head, drone signals are jammed.

483

Hurry!

485
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:42,072
Rocket-propelled grenade!
