00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,125
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:33,720
(Episode 3)

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,800
Only the three of them are not back yet.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
It shouldn't be.

6
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,800
Are they lost?

7
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,490
Let's just wait a little longer.

8
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:06,107
We're under heavy fire!

9
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
We made two attempts
to charge but we failed!

10
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,467
Yes, sir!
We'll reorganize another attack!

11
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:26,827
The frontline command post
is right in front.

12
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:28,467
Let's go.

13
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,720
Chief,

14
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:30,628
you said it yourself.

15
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,880
The drill isn't over yet.

16
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:42,788
Here.

17
00:02:43,107 --> 00:02:43,907
The gauze.

18
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:48,587
There isn't any bullet.

19
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,121
Who are you trying to
scare with an empty gun?

20
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:52,428
You can keep it for yourself.

21
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:55,488
Thanks for leading the way, Chief.

22
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,600
Pass this to the commander.

23
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:15,428
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:19,027
Report! We found Special Service's
frontline command post.

25
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:24,747
Get the attack drones ready.

26
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:25,628
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:31,948
Let me do it.

28
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,468
-This is their command post.
-Let's charge in.

29
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:04,548
And the victory is ours.

30
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:07,268
Charge what? It'll get us killed.

31
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:10,320
Someone will surely be killed,
but it might not be us.

32
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:25,787
Grab the weapons.

33
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,001
Silly boy.

34
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,588
Shush. Don't blow our cover.

35
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,187
-What does that mean?
-What does that mean?

36
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:53,268
Lift the curtain.

37
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,080
-You could've just said it with words.
-Now is not the time to act cool.

38
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,839
Freeze!

39
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,641
You have been captured!

40
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:24,828
Why are you all standing up?

41
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,148
They said they want to...

42
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:27,108
Special Service has begun
its counterattack.

43
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Sit back down!

44
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:36,428
Stand up!

45
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,388
-I said, stand up!
-Get out!

46
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:40,027
We are not going out.

47
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:40,948
We are already here.

48
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,988
Dispatch me in the first battle,
victory will be assured!

49
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:50,868
Special Service is
making a final attempt

50
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,028
to breach our defence.

51
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,028
Only two minutes left.

52
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,000
They won't make it here.

53
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
Charge!

54
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,347
You have been captured.

55
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:04,387
Go away.

56
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:09,788
-You have been captured.
-Don't touch me. Go away.

57
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,999
You are captured.

58
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Go away.

59
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:14,667
Comrade.

60
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,360
-Comrade, you have been...
-Go away.

61
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
I said, get out and
stop messing around.

62
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:19,708
Didn't you hear me?

63
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:21,507
But you guys have been captured.

64
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,355
What should we do, Yan?

65
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,988
Our captives are totally ignoring us.

66
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:44,547
The drones are reaching the
command post of Special Service.

67
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,747
-Destroy it.
-Yes, ma'am

68
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,507
You'd better look up and watch this!

69
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,507
Stop!

70
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:26,907
Drop your gun! Drop your gun!

71
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:31,947
Do you have any idea where this is?

72
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:33,737
Do you have any idea what you have done?

73
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,360
Are you crazy?

74
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,321
Are you crazy?

75
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:43,187
-You got smoke coming out.
-You too.

76
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,479
I told you.

77
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
You have been captured.

78
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:53,187
Report, Vice Company Commander.

79
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:54,748
What is it this time?

80
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:56,068
Signal of the enemy's
command post is gone.

81
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,067
The drill team has determined it
to be destroyed.

82
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:00,067
What?

83
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,107
The drill team has sent a notice.

84
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
We won.

85
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:15,947
Drop your gun!

86
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,308
Victory! Victory!

87
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,428
How did we win?

88
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,508
Attention!

89
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,227
Dress right!

90
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:32,268
Eyes front!

91
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:33,361
First row, count off.

92
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,960
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

93
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:36,426
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

94
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:37,426
Second Squad Leader!

95
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,400
Yes, sir!

96
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,307
Are they still not back yet?

97
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:44,148
Report, Commander!

98
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:45,308
No.

99
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:46,666
It's so late now.

100
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:47,988
Where could they possibly be?

101
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:50,028
-First Squad Leader!
-Yes, sir!

102
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:51,517
Take some men,
we're searching the starting point!

103
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,067
Yes, sir!

104
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,147
-Second Squad Leader!
-Yes, sir!

105
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:55,268
Take some men to search
the train station and bus stop!

106
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,120
Commander,

107
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,468
they can't be deserters.

108
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,028
That's not for you to say!

109
00:08:59,028 --> 00:08:59,828
We'll do this.

110
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,307
I'll take some men and
search the train station.

111
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,667
You guys concentrate
the search on the hills.

112
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,987
Instructor, if this gets out,

113
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,348
it'll get complicated.

114
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:06,507
People will think they deserted!

115
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:07,708
You think I don't know that?

116
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,108
We need to find them first.

117
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:12,987
We'll figure out

118
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:14,068
the rest afterwards.

119
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,929
Yes, sir!

120
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,508
-Get the squad ready to depart.
-Yes, sir.

121
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,067
Chief, at 3:19am,
according to the rules of the drill,

122
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,281
Special Service won.

123
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,120
Please announce the
results of the drill, sir.

124
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,320
This is the main direction
of our attack.

125
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:33,708
The enemy's command post is located

126
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:35,908
five kilometres behind the position.

127
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:37,427
The original plan was

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
for the Third Platoon to feint

129
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,307
while the First and
Second Platoons to outflank

130
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:42,547
and attack the command post.

131
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:44,547
As our company was suddenly exposed,

132
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,427
our main force got pinned
in a firefight with the enemy.

133
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,920
All our three platoons were
stuck and we couldn't retreat.

134
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:49,747
At this moment,

135
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:53,228
you made a decision.

136
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:56,268
You sent an elite team

137
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,588
over the mountain to the enemy's den

138
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:00,307
and took them down.

139
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:03,418
The drill team thus ruled that
the victory goes to our company.

140
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:05,427
What do you think?

141
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:08,187
As a vice company commander, my
tactical analysis isn't too bad, right?

142
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:11,376
Vice Company Commander,
is this a joke?

143
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:12,538
Are you trying to mock me?

144
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:14,387
How is this mocking you?

145
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:15,907
Your tactics were
flexible and versatile.

146
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,987
The team wasn't sent by me.

147
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:18,908
What did you say?

148
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:21,468
I did not send any team to
ambush the command post.

149
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,067
I thought it was you.

150
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,507
I didn't send anyone either.

151
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,880
That doesn't make sense.
I just finished taking roll call.

152
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,588
All my soldiers are here.

153
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,395
If it wasn't you,

154
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:31,867
who could it be then?

155
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,920
Our regiment is located
close to the border

156
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:39,228
and the companies are highly dispersed.

157
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:40,588
Long line of points.

158
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,468
When it comes to stability maintenance

159
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:44,387
and counter-terrorism mandates,

160
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,931
we need strategic troops

161
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,760
that are skilled at multi-route attack.

162
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:49,867
However,

163
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,594
not three soldiers.

164
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,108
You mean

165
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,627
there's something
wrong with their tactics?

166
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,668
Special Service consists of 105 men,

167
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:01,828
excluding the command post,

168
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:04,148
nearly 100 men were
pinned down in position.

169
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:05,987
Yes.

170
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:09,067
The enemy command post
set up by our drill team

171
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:10,268
was hidden in a col,

172
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:11,626
very well concealed.

173
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,547
If it was spotted by the drones,

174
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:15,387
they would have sent more troops,

175
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,028
not just three.

176
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:18,747
Therefore,

177
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,348
it's the victory of the three soldiers,

178
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:22,867
not of the Special Service.

179
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:23,947
I need

180
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:25,708
an explanation at daybreak.

181
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,108
Do you have enough water?

182
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:38,268
Yes, yes.

183
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:40,588
-Thanks, Chief.
-Is it good?

184
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:41,588
Yes, it's delicious.

185
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,588
Our regiment's food is so nice.

186
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,668
Have some more today,

187
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:47,947
maybe you won't be
able to eat it anymore.

188
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:52,588
What does that mean?

189
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,760
On March before last,

190
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,268
two recruits got into trouble.

191
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,067
They were dismissed right away.

192
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,233
Chief, what did they do?

193
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,480
Nothing serious.

194
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:02,947
They drove the army truck

195
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:04,667
back to the camp without
permission during a field training.

196
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:05,588
They got dismissed for

197
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,308
just driving a truck without permission?

198
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:09,708
I think we should be fine.

199
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:10,747
It's different case.

200
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:13,108
We didn't drive any truck,
we just took a free ride, at most.

201
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,828
Besides, we just won a battle.

202
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:15,908
We might even get a reward.

203
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,588
You disregarded the military discipline

204
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:20,107
and interfered with the drill,
causing major consequences.

205
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,307
What you did is worse than them.

206
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,082
Li, they're back.

207
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:40,187
Staff Officer Zhang.

208
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:42,908
Thank you, thank you.

209
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:44,627
Sorry for the trouble.

210
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:45,588
It's fine.

211
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:46,708
Recruits messing up,

212
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,640
it's normal.

213
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,187
But capable of messing up like this,

214
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:50,108
it's extraordinary.

215
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:53,828
Regardless of others,

216
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:56,387
what did the higher-up say?

217
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,240
They are waiting for opinion.

218
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,616
Your opinion.

219
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:04,468
Li!

220
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,679
Li!

221
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:08,747
I'll go get him.

222
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:15,187
Get off the car!

223
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:17,187
Instructor!

224
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,239
Instructor.

225
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,028
Did Special Service win the drill?

226
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:24,908
Is everything okay?

227
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,067
Am I complimenting you?

228
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:26,987
Zhang Tian Yang!

229
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,960
Instructor.

230
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:31,948
Bring them back to the
headquarters and await orders!

231
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:32,778
Yes, sir!

232
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:34,867
You three.

233
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:36,323
Left face!

234
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,387
Turn to the right! Quick march!

235
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:42,387
Didn't we do a good thing?

236
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,761
Got any smokes?

237
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:51,388
I didn't bring any.

238
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,147
You'd rather kick stones

239
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,028
than smoke.

240
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:01,067
Stumbling block.

241
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,521
They are not stumbling block.

242
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,307
Especially Yan Po Yue.

243
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:14,228
That kid is a grindstone.

244
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,680
He won you over so soon.

245
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:19,108
Loser.

246
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:21,987
It isn't just me,

247
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:23,759
the whole regiment

248
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,440
including the regiment commander
and the political commissar

249
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,920
were asking about the three of them.

250
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:29,468
You must've helped him
unplug the power too.

251
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,507
Who led them there?

252
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,387
I thought the three of them

253
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,027
were just mere new recruits at first.

254
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:36,507
Who knew

255
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:37,987
I'd misjudge them?

256
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:40,468
You've been getting too
cosy working in administration,

257
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:42,387
your counter-reconnaissance
ability has declined.

258
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:45,788
But this time,

259
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:46,867
you've hit the jackpot.

260
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:48,627
With the three of them,

261
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:50,507
Special Service will
become even stronger.

262
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,480
What stronger?

263
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:56,667
What did the higher-up say?

264
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,187
Regiment commander said

265
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,428
he would listen to
Special Service's opinion.

266
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:04,716
Political commissar's exact words
were cultivate them well.

267
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,961
How should I do that?

268
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,427
You show me how I should do that.

269
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:12,228
I'm off.

270
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,867
You really left me speechless.

271
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:30,987
Everyone was looking for you
in the middle of the night.

272
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:32,547
We even searched the train station!

273
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,468
You were supposed to be doing
your night terrain assessment.

274
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:36,148
Yet you ended up at the drill centre.

275
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:38,426
You three are unorthodox indeed.

276
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,187
What are you looking at?

277
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,560
Do you want to join them?

278
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:44,348
We'll talk inside.

279
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:48,908
Come in.

280
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,559
Right face!

281
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:01,148
Did you think you
made a big contribution?

282
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,108
That you got famous?

283
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:03,867
Report! No, sir!

284
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:04,867
Whose idea was it?

285
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:05,828
Report!

286
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:06,747
It was my idea.

287
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:07,947
Report!

288
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,028
The three of us discussed
the idea together.

289
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,307
The responsibility isn't his alone.

290
00:16:11,307 --> 00:16:12,348
Why did you do that?

291
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:13,588
A misunderstanding.

292
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,080
Report!

293
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:17,028
The truth is we got lost.

294
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:18,867
We tried to hitch-hike
back to the company,

295
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:20,668
but we didn't realise we'd
stray into the drill centre,

296
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,067
we had no choice but to go for it.

297
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,067
Report!

298
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:24,908
We made a mistake!

299
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,708
We will write an extremely
deep reflective report,

300
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,360
seriously reflect on
and analyse our action.

301
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,468
Comprehensively review ourselves from
the depths of ideological consciousness.

302
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,920
They run so fast,
will you be able to keep up with them?

303
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:45,945
Report!

304
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,108
It'll take me more efforts.

305
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:50,747
When you fall behind,

306
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:52,708
will they stop and wait for you?

307
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:55,747
Report! I will try harder
to keep up with them both!

308
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:58,747
They'll die faster too.

309
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:01,107
Are you still going to follow them then?

310
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:09,108
I will make judgments as I see fit.

311
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,538
My decision is

312
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:38,427
three days of administrative custody.

313
00:17:38,547 --> 00:17:39,508
Reflect on your actions.

314
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,680
Just three days?

315
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,400
I can give you a few more days
if you want to.

316
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:46,628
No, it's long enough.

317
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:47,468
Thank you, sir.

318
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,362
-Dismissed.
-Hold on.

319
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:50,908
Let me talk to them.

320
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:52,467
Your ideological awareness
is insufficient.

321
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:54,467
As your instructor,
I have a responsibility.

322
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,440
It's time for lunch.

323
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:56,468
Aren't you hungry?

324
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,027
I'm famished.

325
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,427
Let's just leave it at that for now.

326
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,041
-Dismissed.
-Yes, sir!

327
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:06,588
Right face!

328
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,828
Quick march!

329
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,628
What does that mean?

330
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:18,187
What do you mean?

331
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,388
It's time for lunch.

332
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,388
Don't lie to me.

333
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,307
That's it? It's over?

334
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:25,068
The regiment commander said

335
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:27,027
the decision of their penalty is ours.

336
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:29,788
The political commissar said
we should cultivate them well.

337
00:18:30,187 --> 00:18:31,107
So what else can I do?

338
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:52,627
This is much better
than I thought it would be.

339
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,748
People have to

340
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:55,467
learn to adjust themselves
to different circumstances.

341
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,508
We can do a post-war review
during these three days.

342
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,680
That's right. We, Po, Yun, Tian,

343
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,667
have survived such a legendary night.

344
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:05,388
These three days should be
relaxing and enjoyable for us.

345
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:06,947
Honestly,

346
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:08,947
I'm honoured to be aboard

347
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:10,468
your ship of rebellion.

348
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:20,108
Commander,

349
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:23,267
so this is over just like that?

350
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,188
Yes.

351
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:25,988
What else can we do?

352
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,867
-No disciplinary action for them?
-Would disciplinary action be useful?

353
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:30,067
Hold your tongue.

354
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,708
I'm afraid I can't.

355
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:37,547
Didn't you notice Yan Po Yue's eyes?

356
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:40,667
His eyes?

357
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:42,228
What about his eyes?

358
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:44,828
-There is hunger.
-They just had lunch.

359
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:46,027
He's hungry again so soon?

360
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:49,272
His eyes are hungry.

361
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:52,348
They are full of dreams.

362
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:53,788
To put it bluntly,

363
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:54,826
it's desire.

364
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:56,177
And you don't have

365
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,468
this desire.

366
00:20:58,435 --> 00:20:59,235
I

367
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,081
used to have it.

368
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:04,187
What about now?

369
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:06,508
I don't have it anymore.

370
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:07,868
I'm too old

371
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:09,107
to get a chance.

372
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:10,228
But

373
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,881
he's still young.

374
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,267
He'll leave here one day.

375
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:15,907
Special Service and
Rapid Deployment Brigade

376
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
are just a stepping stone in his life.

377
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,788
His strong desire makes him

378
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:24,108
ignore the people and events around him.

379
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:25,721
He doesn't care about anyone

380
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,239
but himself.

381
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,308
Commander.

382
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,147
Actually, I think as much of him

383
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:32,628
as you do.

384
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:34,828
However,

385
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,547
he doesn't want us.

386
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:40,188
What happened this time

387
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:42,267
can't be a misunderstanding,

388
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:44,067
it's a plan.

389
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:46,187
Yan Po Yue's plan.

390
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:47,547
That explains it.

391
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,480
Those two boys had every opportunity
to leave when they realised that

392
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:52,074
they had reached the drill site.

393
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:54,187
Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie

394
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:56,508
would definitely not let go of
the opportunity to stand out.

395
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:59,467
They must be thinking about trading
this opportunity for an even bigger one.

396
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:02,468
They caught the attention of regiment
commander and political commissar.

397
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,424
It's half success for them.

398
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:07,548
What about the other half?

399
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,147
The other half

400
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:12,144
is in Special Service.

401
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:14,108
Well, if

402
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,667
they could survive.

403
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:22,121
Report!

404
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,639
Enter!

405
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:33,668
Regiment Commander.

406
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:37,296
Are you sure you want to
invalidate the result of this drill?

407
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:38,428
I am certain.

408
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,108
The results of this drill
have an direct impact on

409
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:42,748
company's training performance
throughout the year.

410
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:44,027
And company training performance

411
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:46,387
has a direct impact on the promotion
of company commanders.

412
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:48,308
You've been a company
commander for three years.

413
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,667
You do know this, don't you?

414
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:50,628
I know.

415
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:51,947
However,

416
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:53,787
Special Service would not

417
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:55,588
play tricks to win.

418
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:00,508
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie,

419
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:02,228
what do you think about them?

420
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:04,868
In terms of military qualities,

421
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,267
they are exceptional soldiers.

422
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,027
After what happened at the drill,

423
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:10,748
no company will want them,

424
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:12,668
concerning that they won't be
able to control them.

425
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:13,755
Special Service

426
00:23:14,468 --> 00:23:15,268
will take them in.

427
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,268
But I have my own arrangements.

428
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:19,387
I hope the regiment won't interfere.

429
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:22,187
When did our regiment ever
interfere with your company's affairs?

430
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:24,348
These two soldiers want a chance.

431
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:25,818
Now

432
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:27,748
you've known their names,

433
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,267
and this is the chance they sought for.

434
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:42,914
This dude

435
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:44,147
is pretty tough.

436
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:46,988
Did you find out who he is?

437
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:48,827
He's one of the legendary
Dragon, Tiger, and Dog.

438
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:49,787
Guess who he is.

439
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:51,947
He's the Dragon.

440
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:55,988
Xiao Fei, commander of Squad One,
Platoon One, Company One.

441
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:57,067
His surname is also Xiao.

442
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:58,427
You're Second Place Xiao.

443
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:00,147
He is First Place Xiao.

444
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:01,508
Look at my muscles.

445
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:04,628
Give up. He's ranked number
one in individual combats.

446
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,828
Shooting, machinery, projectiles,

447
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:07,988
he aced all the training.

448
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,187
(Even Psycho King)

449
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,588
(looks weak compared to him.)

450
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:12,788
(Is he really that good?)

451
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:14,368
(How is he still just
a staff sergeant then?)

452
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:15,748
(His individual qualities are good,)

453
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,760
(but his leadership skill isn't great.)

454
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,200
He had his heart set on
joining the special forces.

455
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:22,228
And they rejected him
for three years in a row.

456
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:23,468
No one knows why.

457
00:24:23,468 --> 00:24:25,267
He's been pushing hard every day.

458
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:36,788
I get tired by just looking at him.

459
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,520
Really.

460
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,079
He only has these two moves.

461
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:42,067
Yan,

462
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:43,840
you just can't sit idle.

463
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,000
Why are you competing with him
at this late hour?

464
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,907
It's not because of him,
it's because of myself.

465
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:50,947
Yan, you really don't have to do this.
Why bother with him?

466
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,988
He's right.

467
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,440
Yan, enough. It's almost 200.

468
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:12,147
Seriously, Yan.
You're the best in the company.

469
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:14,147
You're Strongest Yan, okay?
So stop now. You'll hurt yourself.

470
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,067
Take a break.

471
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,921
Tian.

472
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,187
Somebody! Someone is running away!

473
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:56,947
Somebody! Someone is running away!

474
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:58,787
Somebody! Someone is running away!

475
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:11,907
(I know that)

476
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:13,868
(everyone has a past.)

477
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:16,587
(The harder you try to forget it,)

478
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:18,147
(the more you remember it.)

479
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:20,868
(When the past becomes a scar,)

480
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:22,898
(all I can do is)

481
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,547
(let the present be the past.)

482
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:28,313
(Regardless of sadness and happiness,)

483
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:29,708
(run!)

484
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,561
Who are you competing with

485
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,868
in the middle of the night?

486
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:46,868
Come on, let me relax your muscles.

487
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,520
You had to push yourself.

488
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,196
Xiao, Xiao.

489
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,639
Come over here now.

490
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,187
Yan, are you okay?

491
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:00,347
Yan?

492
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:01,228
Yan?

493
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,108
Yan? Yan!

494
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,388
Yan, are you okay?

495
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:06,089
Go get help! Go!

496
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:07,307
Somebody!

497
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:08,227
Yan?

498
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:10,027
Somebody, help!

499
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,708
Yan, are you okay?

500
00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:13,108
-Hang in there.
-Help!

501
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,160
Move!

502
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:15,868
Doctor, help!

503
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:16,747
Help!

504
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:17,868
This is our soldier.

505
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:18,947
I think he's dehydrated.

506
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:19,867
Look at him.

507
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,641
I'll wait outside, Doctor.

508
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Staff Officer Ai, sorry about that.

509
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:30,987
It's fine.

510
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:32,628
Was that Yan Po Yue?

511
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:33,747
Yes.

512
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,067
What's wrong with him?

513
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,267
Injured in training?

514
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,600
No.

515
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:38,866
He was locked in confinement.

516
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:40,446
But this brat was trying to act tough.

517
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,240
He spent the day working out in cell
without eating or drinking anything.

518
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:45,267
He is dehydrated,
and he's having muscle spasms.

519
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:06,937
The doctor just went out.

520
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,927
He said it's nothing serious.

521
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,000
It's just dehydration
and low blood sugar.

522
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:12,352
You'll be fine after rehydration.

523
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,152
Thanks, Chief.

524
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,480
You're acting tough again.

525
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,599
I suppose it went too far this time.

526
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:23,376
Chief,

527
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:25,976
after my infusion,

528
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:28,543
may I return to the cell?

529
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,513
The force is a whole.

530
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:35,608
If you keep trying
to be in the limelight,

531
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:37,928
you're the only one who will suffer.

532
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,479
Chief,

533
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:42,373
I will keep that in mind.

534
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:46,133
I need to get some more sleep.

535
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,330
Thank you.

536
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,201
I can't see you out.

537
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,593
I was so close to
putting it into my mouth.

538
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:49,348
And the noise woke me up.

539
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:51,388
Xiao,

540
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,560
were you dreaming of food too?

541
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,960
What dishes were in your dream?

542
00:30:55,544 --> 00:30:57,705
Braised pork with sausage.

543
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:59,868
Oil dripping lamb skewers.

544
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:03,588
The music woke me up
before I could take a bite.

545
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:07,787
It's so early in the morning.

546
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,280
They don't need music for training.

547
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,010
It's not for the training.

548
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,239
It's the commissioning
ceremony for recruits.

549
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,388
Seriously?

550
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,348
It's the ceremony.

551
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:37,536
Salute!

552
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,547
Down!

553
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,760
Confers rank to new recruits!

554
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:07,071
Squad Leader!

555
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,067
Squad Leader, are the recruits
out there receiving their rank?

556
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,040
Yes.

557
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,468
But we are recruits too.

558
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:15,988
Why haven't we been informed?

559
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:17,849
I can't let you out without orders.

560
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,319
Squad Leader, don't go!

561
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,127
Oh no.

562
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,627
We're forgotten.

563
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,519
Completely forgotten.

564
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,329
Yan, don't you fear it?

565
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,318
Less.

566
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:39,147
Pardon me?

567
00:32:39,228 --> 00:32:41,748
He means he's fearless.

568
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,200
That means it doesn't bother you.

569
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,840
Are you out of ideas too?

570
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:46,468
Psycho King said

571
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:47,567
three days.

572
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,681
Today is the third day.

573
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,400
We'll wait.

574
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:52,706
Wait for what?

575
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:54,027
It'll be too late by then.

576
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,264
When the assignment is done,
what about us then?

577
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:58,407
We'll go home then.

578
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:00,628
Psycho King must have come around

579
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,760
and thought that our punishment
was too lenient.

580
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:03,947
It's over.

581
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,440
Your administrative custody is ended.

582
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:10,268
Get suited up.

583
00:33:10,497 --> 00:33:11,457
Come with me.

584
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,680
March!

585
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,103
Halt!

586
00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:35,547
Right face!

587
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:38,713
Eyes front!

588
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,480
Instructor,

589
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:56,067
three non-commissioned
recruits have arrived.

590
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:57,167
Your orders, sir!

591
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,080
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie, Lu Xiao Tian.

592
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,080
Yes, sir!

593
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:03,560
You three missed your
commissioning ceremony.

594
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:05,023
I will make up for you now.

595
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:16,995
Left face!

596
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,879
Attention!

597
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:26,948
I hereby decree,

598
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,839
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie, Lu Xiao Tian,

599
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:31,019
after politically

600
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
and physically screened,

601
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,148
are eligible for enlistment.

602
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:36,832
They are hereby authorized to
be awarded the rank of Private.

603
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:48,008
Tidy up your appearance!

604
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:55,785
Attention!

605
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:59,747
Wearing this rank gives you
an additional responsibility,

606
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,720
a responsibility that
belongs to a soldier.

607
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,879
Raise your right hand
and pledge with me.

608
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,987
I am People's Armed Police Force.

609
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I pledge...

610
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,120
I am People's Armed Police Force.

611
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,360
I pledge...

612
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
To obey the leadership of
the Communist Party of China,

613
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:22,188
to dedicate to the people.

614
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,662
To obey the leadership of
the Communist Party of China,

615
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:26,707
to dedicate to the people.

616
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,868
To obey orders, to abide by discipline,

617
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
to devote myself to my duties,
to work hard.

618
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,520
To obey orders, to abide by discipline,

619
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,040
to devote myself to my duties,
to work hard.

620
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,680
To train hard to
improve my military skills,

621
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:39,707
to be a loyal defender of
the Party and the people.

622
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,547
To train hard to
improve my military skills,

623
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,987
to be a loyal defender of
the Party and the people.

624
00:35:44,252 --> 00:35:45,307
Under any circumstances,

625
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:46,948
never to betray my country

626
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,868
or defect from Armed Police Force.

627
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,400
Under any circumstances,

628
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:51,948
never to betray my country

629
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:54,108
or defect from Armed Police Force.

630
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,027
Deponent, Chen Min Tao.

631
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:57,908
Deponent, Xiao Yun Jie.

632
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,668
Deponent, Lu Xiao Tian.

633
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,840
Deponent, Yan Po Yue.

634
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,240
Private Yan Po Yue,

635
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,159
Xiao Yun Jie, Lu Xiao Tian,

636
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:11,809
you are assigned to
Special Service Company.

637
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:13,447
You shall report for duty immediately.

638
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:14,467
Yes, sir!

639
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:21,706
Sir,

640
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,910
we've walked past the dorm.

641
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,307
No talking in line.

642
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:26,107
Turn right.

643
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,400
One, two, one.

644
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:39,808
One, two, one.

645
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:41,828
Eyes front!

646
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,267
One, two, one.

647
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:48,868
One, two, one.

648
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,000
Ignore him. Keep walking.

649
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,800
Little Bean, the first grader!

650
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,267
Escapes from beating!

651
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,348
Little Bean, the first grader!

652
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,227
Escapes from beating!

653
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,120
Come in.

654
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:27,848
Halt!

655
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,200
Left face!

656
00:37:31,536 --> 00:37:32,616
Are we having an extra meal

657
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,560
before we join the team?

658
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,720
Stop with the jokes.

659
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,120
Straighten up.

660
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,041
Squad Leader Fan!

661
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,680
Fan Jin!

662
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:43,760
-Squad Leader Fan!
-I'm here!

663
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,920
I've brought them here.

664
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,760
Leave them outside.

665
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,520
Out of my way! I'm busy.

666
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,639
But...

667
00:37:50,787 --> 00:37:51,668
Alright then.

668
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,707
I'll let you get back to work.
We'll get out of your hair.

669
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:58,296
Go stand at the door.

670
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,760
You guys have been assigned to
Special Service's kitchen squad.

671
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:08,872
That's Squad Leader Fan.

672
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,520
From now on,

673
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
you'll take orders from him.

674
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,320
Report!

675
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:15,707
Due to my growing environment,

676
00:38:15,914 --> 00:38:18,188
I'm fairly inept at cooking.

677
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:20,906
I know basically nothing about cooking.

678
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:22,581
But of course, I'm not afraid
to take on a challenge.

679
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,450
I'm just afraid that after our
soldiers eat it, they might...

680
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,280
Lu Xiao Tian!

681
00:38:26,065 --> 00:38:27,505
This is the party branch's decision.

682
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:29,168
I'll talk to the party branch then.

683
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:30,873
I have that right, don't I?

684
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:34,057
Yes, you do!

685
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,280
Report it to Squad Leader Fan first.

686
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:37,536
Escalate it level by level.

687
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,840
Yan Po Yue! Yan Po Yue!

688
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:44,975
Sir, he...

689
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:46,512
Let him be.

690
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,199
So he is Yan Po Yue?

691
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,413
Sorry, Squad Leader Fan.
I'll bring him back.

692
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:51,305
Yan Po Yue!

693
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:54,388
An idiot like him

694
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:56,787
will learn his lesson once
he goes on a mission and bleeds.

695
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,160
Do you two want to reflect this too?

696
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,960
Report!

697
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,067
Obeying orders is the duty of a soldier!

698
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,159
Good.

699
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,240
Go and empty that bucket of slop.

700
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:09,068
The other one,

701
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,041
peel that basket of potatoes.

702
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:13,267
Report! I volunteer
to peel the potatoes.

703
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,387
He'll take care of the slop.

704
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:20,547
♫ The tough bullet has eyes ♫

705
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:24,227
♫ The sharp bayonet
is tainted with blood ♫

706
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,200
♫ Striking like strong winds ♫

707
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,787
♫ Protecting The Great Wall ♫

708
00:39:31,948 --> 00:39:35,588
♫ A strong company is full of heroes ♫

709
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:39,356
♫ A tough soldier is robust ♫

710
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:40,647
Report, Commander!

711
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:42,391
Yes?

712
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:45,188
I'm the top recruit in the
comprehensive assessment!

713
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:47,447
I know.

714
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,280
Why?

715
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:52,908
Can I get a new word?

716
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:53,931
Why?

717
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:55,640
Whatever reason you think it is,

718
00:39:56,904 --> 00:39:58,265
it's what it is!

719
00:40:06,255 --> 00:40:07,215
Do you have anymore

720
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:09,729
why?

721
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,312
Report!

722
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:14,991
No, sir!

723
00:40:15,485 --> 00:40:16,285
Good!

724
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,828
I will make Special Service proud!

725
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:19,428
Is that all you have to say?

726
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,423
What else?

727
00:40:25,831 --> 00:40:26,631
Commander,

728
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:28,048
goodbye!

729
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,480
Sorry, sir.

730
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,919
I couldn't stop him.

731
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,376
He wasn't finished.

732
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,447
Let's see what he'll do.

733
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,151
Is this potato?

734
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:52,985
More like apple's core!

735
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,680
Give it to me.

736
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:56,281
I'll teach you just once.

737
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,576
Watch and learn.

738
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,160
Report!

739
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,948
Special Service recruit, Yan Po Yue,
reports to kitchen squad!

740
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:14,792
Li Xiang sent you back, didn't he?

741
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:18,068
You didn't even get a
chance to talk, did you?

742
00:41:21,286 --> 00:41:22,760
-Keep peeling!
-Yes, sir!

743
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:27,672
What can you do?

744
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:29,067
What do you need me to do, sir?

745
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:31,855
Cooking dishes, rice and steaming buns.

746
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,279
Report! I don't know
how to do any of those!

747
00:41:34,712 --> 00:41:35,631
You don't know?

748
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,631
Nobody is born knowing everything!

749
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:42,706
Dinner is at 6pm!

750
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:44,307
Stir fried pork with onion.

751
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,360
Change your clothes.

752
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:46,742
Slice that basket of onions.

753
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,839
Are you embroidering?

754
00:42:12,855 --> 00:42:13,976
Dinner is served at 6pm.

755
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:16,176
We have to start cooking
the latest by 5:30pm.

756
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,400
What are you doing?

757
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:31,227
Yan, this is your first time.

758
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,080
Don't cut your fingers.

759
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,721
Stop.

760
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,760
Did you cut this?

761
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,719
Does this look edible to you?

762
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,791
Step aside!
