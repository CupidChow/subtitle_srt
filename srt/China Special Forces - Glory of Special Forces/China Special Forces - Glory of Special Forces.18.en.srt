1
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,160
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,100
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:33,760
(Episode 18)

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,559
At 3am? They're doing this on purpose!

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,920
29.

6
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,240
Tell us why you are
the last to get here.

7
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,120
Report, sir!

8
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,200
I was too tired, I didn't hear it.

9
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,920
Too tired?

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,720
Tiredness is not a justification.

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,399
Your enemy

12
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,559
won't show you any mercy

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,440
just because you're tired.

14
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:22,222
Before this,

15
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,040
you received conventional training,

16
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,160
because you

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,240
were dealing with conventional warfare,

18
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,720
but from now on,

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,279
you are going to deal with
unconventional warfare.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,320
Since it is unconventional warfare,

21
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,080
there are unconventional approaches
and unconventional training.

22
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,360
You used to be axes,

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
hammers,

24
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
but here,

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,600
you have to become sharp blades,

26
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,360
sharp knives!

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,680
27!

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
Where are you looking at
when I'm talking?

29
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:52,601
Is 28 that good-looking?

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
Report, sir!

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,080
-We're from the same squad.
-So what?

32
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,387
Is that supposed to be cool?

33
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,000
Report, sir! No, sir!

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,079
28, did I permit you to talk?

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,680
Are you so eager to help your comrade?

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,160
In the future training,

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
you'll form a team of two!

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,760
You don't get to pick your own teammate,

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,720
it'll be assigned by your instructors!

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,520
In all training,

41
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,760
both of you must pass.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
If one of you fails,

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,680
both of you

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
will start again from the beginning!

45
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,600
As you can see,

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,040
on the other side of
the training ground,

47
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,560
there is a farewell platform.

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,923
Whoever can't take it anymore
and wants to quit,

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,919
just put your helmet and
number plate there,

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
and you can go.

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,840
Before you leave,

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,641
you have to shout

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,067
I give up!

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,840
You have to let everyone hear it!

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,400
Today's training

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,160
starts now.

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,240
The group with the worst performance,

58
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,520
will be kicked out!

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Lu Tu.

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,280
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,279
All of you, right face!

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,960
Double march!

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,160
(The grouping was planned.)

64
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
(Our instructors intentionally
put two people who have conflicts)

65
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
(and don't see eye to eye together.)

66
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,480
(Xiao Yun Jie was assigned to Bai Long.)

67
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
(And I)

68
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,600
(was assigned to Lone Wolf.)

69
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,739
(The first training course,)

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,640
(combat training.)

71
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:36,882
(Requirement,)

72
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,194
(knock out the opponent.)

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,320
Come on!

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
27! 31!

75
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,360
Are you guys doing breathing exercise?

76
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
Report, sir!

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,880
I don't hit women!

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm your enemy!

79
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,440
Come on!

80
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
That's the spirit!

81
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
Keep going!

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,840
Die!

83
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,520
You just won't give in, right?

84
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,440
Tap out. Tap out.

85
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,679
Stay put.

86
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,600
Those who are lying down
stay on the ground.

87
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,320
Those who are standing
continue to stand.

88
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,198
-Your next training course...
-Report, sir!

89
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:47,178
30.

90
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,040
What's your problem?

91
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,720
Before the next course,

92
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:52,120
I'd like to fight you!

93
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,600
A reserve

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
isn't in any position to make requests.

95
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
This isn't a request!

96
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,760
This is a challenge!

97
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,520
30, you and the instructor
know each other?

98
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,680
The others,

99
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,160
did I permit you to move?

100
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,365
Bai Long,

101
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,040
this is the training ground.

102
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
-Quit it.
-Stay out of this.

103
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Out of my way.

104
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
You can say no!

105
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,720
In front of everyone!

106
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
I'll fight you!

107
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,600
Consider it a demonstration training.

108
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,040
Yan.

109
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,000
Which one of you won?

110
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,640
We're evenly matched.

111
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,560
Want to go another round?

112
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,320
Why is Bai Long
challenging the instructor?

113
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,720
This is his reenlistment.

114
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,560
They probably have a history.

115
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,400
Did I permit you to talk?

116
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Demonstration training.

117
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,600
Lu Tu.

118
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,599
Captain.

119
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,039
Is this fun?

120
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,400
They certainly think this is fun.

121
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,719
What about you?

122
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,760
Honestly,

123
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,559
it's been a long time
since I last saw them fight.

124
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
I kind of miss this.

125
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,840
Bai Long!

126
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,840
Yes, sir!

127
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,840
Are you tired?

128
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:50,041
No, sir! Treating training
like actual combat is standard!

129
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:51,676
You two are letting these young soldiers

130
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,853
watch you fighting like
you're in actual combat,

131
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,320
do you think this is proper?

132
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Report, sir!

133
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,760
This is a demonstration training!

134
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
A veteran

135
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
and an instructor

136
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:02,720
are trying to beat each other to death.

137
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,120
What kind of demonstration is this?

138
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:06,480
Don't you forget that

139
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:09,120
there is another form of address
between you two,

140
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
it's comrade!

141
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:13,600
I know that

142
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,680
most of you here have never been

143
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
in a desperate situation,

144
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,480
never been besieged by enemies,

145
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,840
never experienced war.

146
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
At moments like that,

147
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,840
other than your unwavering faith

148
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,920
and determination,

149
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,480
your comrades are
the only ones you can rely on!

150
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,679
Your life is yours,

151
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,560
but also each other's!

152
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:40,472
Next training course,

153
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,719
you shall understand more deeply about

154
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,761
the meaning of the word comrade.

155
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,001
Split into pairs.

156
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,360
One

157
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,680
will carry the other on his back

158
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,160
and run back to Base 125!

159
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,960
-Cao Ben!
-Yes, sir!

160
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,640
You love demonstrations, right?

161
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,200
Bai Long will carry you!

162
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,640
Bear this in mind.

163
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,840
Comradeship is forged through

164
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
blood and sweat!

165
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,400
I want you to really experience it.

166
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,560
Everyone!

167
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:11,846
Hop on.

168
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,280
I'll carry you.

169
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,199
Hurry up!

170
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Put me down!

171
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,160
-What are you doing?
-There's no way I'll let you carry me.

172
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,680
Can you do this?

173
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,880
Come on.

174
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Hop on.

175
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,800
-Report, sir!
-Speak.

176
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Who should I carry?

177
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,160
-You have no one to carry?
-Yes, sir.

178
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,080
Come, carry me.

179
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes, sir!

180
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:57,886
Faster.

181
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,120
What's wrong? Are you out of strength?

182
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:01,765
Come on. Let's sing a song.

183
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
♫ Unity is power ♫

184
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
Ready, sing.

185
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,720
♫ Unity is power ♫

186
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Hurry up!

187
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,520
Are you okay?

188
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,880
Just stay still!

189
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,800
Stop trying to act tough.
Just let me carry you!

190
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,560
That's never going to happen!

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,800
Hang on tight!

192
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,280
(This isn't heaven,)

193
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,800
(nor is it hell.)

194
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,800
(This is just a long journey.)

195
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,160
(We have many people
travelling together.)

196
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:28,840
(But once you fall behind,
you can't never catch up.)

197
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,120
(I don't want to be left behind.)

198
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,400
(Because at the end of the road,
there are my dream)

199
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,120
(and dignity.)

200
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,080
Fall in.

201
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,160
All of you, keep a distance of
one meter from the ones around you.

202
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,400
Dress right, dress!

203
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,440
Eyes front!

204
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
Get ready to do push-ups.

205
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,120
Go.

206
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,080
Next training course,
apex ladder climbing.

207
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,040
Two persons a team.

208
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,319
If one of you falls,
your result is considered invalid.

209
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,880
Both of you will have to
climb again from the bottom.

210
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,280
The worst-performing team

211
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,120
-will be eliminated!
-9.

212
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes, sir!

213
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,840
-11.
-Yes, sir!

214
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,320
Go!

215
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,200
Yes, sir!

216
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,720
Stop!

217
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,800
Is that the way to climb?

218
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,640
And you called yourselves elite?
Get down!

219
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,880
Faster!

220
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
-Get back in line!
-Yes, sir!

221
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,600
Watch how I do it.

222
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,920
Let me show you.

223
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,920
-Do you know how to climb now?
-Yes, sir!

224
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,040
It's easy, right?

225
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,360
Yes, sir!

226
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay. Since it's easy,

227
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,040
come on, let's spice it up for them.

228
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,840
Look how dirty you all are.

229
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,120
We've prepared
detergent specially for you

230
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,440
so that you can clean yourself up.

231
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,680
28.

232
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,520
Yes, sir!

233
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,800
-30.
-Yes, sir!

234
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,840
The rest,

235
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,400
keep doing push-ups.

236
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,733
Why do you split your legs so far apart?

237
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,919
Are you cheating?

238
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,119
This is too slippery.
My hands are slipping!

239
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,840
Hurry up!

240
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,521
Since you're in Cheetah,

241
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,200
you'll just have to stick through it.

242
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,200
Whoever thinks he can't take it anymore,
just stand up and report to us.

243
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,280
We can eliminate you anytime.

244
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
Faster!

245
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,760
You are all elites sent by your units.

246
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,239
An elite should act like an elite.

247
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,560
27!

248
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,760
-Yes, sir!
-31!

249
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,799
-Yes, sir!
-Go!

250
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,520
Hold on tight, don't fall.

251
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,520
You're the one who might fall.

252
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,120
Give me your hand!

253
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,080
I won't fall.

254
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,560
All of you.

255
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,600
At ease!

256
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,160
Attention!

257
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:10,520
-Number off!
-One. Two, Three. Four. Five.

258
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,199
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

259
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,040
All here.

260
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,080
Captain,

261
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,880
we have 48 participants,
they are all in attendance.

262
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,160
-Your orders, sir!
-At ease.

263
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:21,999
Yes, sir!

264
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,840
At ease!

265
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,520
Listen up!

266
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,565
At ease!

267
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:29,188
Today's training

268
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,880
is neither good nor bad.

269
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,680
It's passable.

270
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,359
-Lu Tu!
-Yes, sir!

271
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,599
Give an extra bucket of water

272
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:36,814
to each dorm tonight.

273
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,200
-Yes, sir!
-Report, sir!

274
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:38,921
Speak!

275
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:42,320
We haven't eaten anything
since morning.

276
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,960
That's why I gave you
an extra bucket of water.

277
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,240
When you're hungry,

278
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,520
just drink water.

279
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,760
Got it?

280
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,072
Report, sir!

281
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,439
-Speak!
-Our training intensity is so high.

282
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
How can we continue
without eating?

283
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:55,480
You should be grateful
that we gave you water.

284
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:57,926
I know that many of you don't understand

285
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,480
what it means to fight a lone battle.

286
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
If you don't understand,

287
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,440
ask your comrades
who have such experience.

288
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:07,093
Here, you won't find any love
from company commander

289
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:08,547
or care from squad leader.

290
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,360
Whoever can't stand the hunger,

291
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,480
you can quit anytime.

292
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,280
Does anyone want to quit?

293
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,440
Since no one wants to
quit on your own accord,

294
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,160
we will announce it then.

295
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,680
Cao Ben!

296
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,640
Yes, sir!

297
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,760
Who is the worst performer today?

298
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,800
Report, sir!

299
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,340
36 and 41's team.

300
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,371
-36!
-Yes, sir!

301
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
-41!
-Yes, sir!

302
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,080
Step out of line!

303
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,800
This is the end

304
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,440
of the training for the two of you.

305
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,880
Report, sir!

306
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,358
It's not that we're incapable,

307
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:53,719
we're just too hungry.

308
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
Report, sir!

309
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,601
Can we have another chance?

310
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,160
I wish I could.

311
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,600
In war,

312
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,160
your enemy won't give
you a second chance.

313
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,400
Everyone has
different body constitution.

314
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,760
And it will react differently

315
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,800
in different extreme circumstances.

316
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,800
Go back.

317
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,000
Go back to the post that
is more suitable for you.

318
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,160
Cao Ben,

319
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,440
serve them dinner tonight.

320
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,320
-And send them away tomorrow.
-Yes, sir.

321
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,120
-36, 41!
-Yes, sir!

322
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,760
-Get back to your line!
-Yes, sir!

323
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,680
-Lu Tu!
-Yes, sir!

324
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,560
Take the team back!

325
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
Yes, sir!

326
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,599
All of you.

327
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,760
Right face!

328
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:39,013
Right turn! Quick march!

329
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,280
One, two, one.

330
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,920
One, two, one.

331
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,840
(Chinese People's Armed Police Force)

332
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,640
Save your strength.

333
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:09,814
Smashing table consumes energy too.

334
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,320
Even sleeping seems strenuous.

335
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,793
We might as well just stop breathing.

336
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,800
I do want to join Cheetah Commando,

337
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:16,867
but I need food more.

338
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,520
It's not that easy to join the commando.

339
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Even the soldiers who were fighting

340
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,680
the Japanese back then were
given a piece of sweet potato.

341
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,280
You need to learn your history again.

342
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,160
A piece of sweet potato
was the most they could get.

343
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,440
I'm fine with sweet potato.

344
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
27, 28, say something.

345
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,720
What is there to say?

346
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,320
About not eating?

347
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,640
Well, we all don't get to eat.

348
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,840
It's good, it's fair.

349
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,880
Consider this a diet.

350
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,880
You're just resigning
yourself to adversity.

351
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
11, don't get agitated.

352
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,760
27, what do you think?

353
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,360
Which unit were you from?

354
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,560
Detachment 181.

355
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,160
What about you, 9?

356
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
Detachment 29.

357
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,120
Both are ace units.

358
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,840
What about you two?

359
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,520
We're from

360
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,040
Regiment 247.

361
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,560
I heard that this regiment
has been reorganized.

362
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,000
To be precise,
it's been reorganized and moved.

363
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,080
We don't even know
where our old unit is now.

364
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,600
So,

365
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,520
we have no way back.

366
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,814
It's okay, it's okay.

367
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,320
When you two pass the training,

368
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:22,880
you will stay here.

369
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,960
Everyone's got their
own problems to deal with.

370
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,720
If I can't make the cut this time,

371
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,520
I'm retiring.

372
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,680
Lights off and sleep.

373
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,560
This is killing me.

374
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,080
What's wrong?

375
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:57,426
Guys,

376
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,760
aren't you afraid to sleep?

377
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,200
Just sleep.

378
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
If we don't sleep now,
we'll die tomorrow.

379
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,440
We can't be really asleep.

380
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,093
We have to stay alert.

381
00:24:07,174 --> 00:24:07,974
He's right.

382
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,160
If they call for another
emergency assembly again,

383
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,120
careful that we might be the next
to get eliminated.

384
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,521
I don't care anymore.

385
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,800
I have to sleep now.

386
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm going to have a feast of braised
pork leg and pork intestine in my dream.

387
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,160
How is the training of

388
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,360
women's squadron going?

389
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,000
It's going as planned.

390
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,760
So far, everything is going great.

391
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,920
That's good.

392
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,120
What about your training team?

393
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:50,527
How many are gone?

394
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,080
Two at the first day.

395
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,480
At this rate,

396
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,840
in less than a month,

397
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
you'll have no one left.

398
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,320
We have requirements.

399
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,400
Weren't you the one who picked them out?

400
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,600
Don't worry.

401
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,120
Guo Xiao Xiao

402
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,240
is doing great.

403
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,680
She is always doing great.

404
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,159
But someone isn't.

405
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,520
On the training ground today,

406
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,920
Bai Long challenged Cao Ben.

407
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,200
Exchange of skills
will help them improve.

408
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,440
My bad.

409
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,180
I shouldn't have used
the word challenge.

410
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,680
To be precise,

411
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,080
he is resenting.

412
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,259
Some people resent that
they can't have what they want.

413
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,560
Some people resent that they
can't get rid of what's stuck with them.

414
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Bai Long's emotions

415
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,440
are beyond his control after all.

416
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,720
What does he have to resent about?

417
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,680
Loss.

418
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,480
Captain,

419
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,240
are you talking about Bai Long or me?

420
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,600
You are not participating in
the regular training before Hell Week.

421
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,400
Why would I be talking about you?

422
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,840
What is lost is lost.

423
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,680
It's forever gone.

424
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,640
Xiang Fei will live forever
in our hearts.

425
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:27,680
Don't say his name.

426
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,360
But this name is a wound
in all of our hearts.

427
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,880
Everyone has the power
to heal ourselves.

428
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,400
Wound will eventually become a scar.

429
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,760
People have different
self-healing ability.

430
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,320
And wound may get inflamed too.

431
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:46,960
Three years ago,

432
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,040
after Cobra Operation,

433
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,120
Bai Long was discharged.

434
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:51,760
But he's back now.

435
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,479
I thought...

436
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,080
I always thought his wound was healed.

437
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,000
Captain, I'm done here.

438
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,520
Goodbye.

439
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,440
Get up! Get up!

440
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,640
What's going on?

441
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,720
Gas!

442
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,080
It's too dangerous. Open the door.

443
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,720
Hurry!

444
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,160
The door is locked!

445
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,799
No.There's too much smoke.

446
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,760
Just opening the window isn't helpful.
We're going to suffocate any minute.

447
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,920
Pour water on the towel!

448
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,440
We're out of water!

449
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,760
We drank it all!

450
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,560
Pee!

451
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:37,787
Come! This way!

452
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,680
Hurry!

453
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,560
27, what took you so long?

454
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,880
How did you get out?

455
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,000
Report, sir!

456
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,239
We broke down the window and jumped out!

457
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,400
That's destruction of public property.

458
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,280
Do you know what's
the punishment for that?

459
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,000
There was no other way out.

460
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,201
No other way out?

461
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,199
31, how did you get out?

462
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,640
Report, sir! The key was hidden
in the window crevice!

463
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
I opened the door and got out!

464
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,720
29, how did you get out?

465
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,440
Report, sir! I found the key
in the door crack.

466
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,000
We opened the door and walked out!

467
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
Everyone, listen up.

468
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,720
Going through the barracks,

469
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,240
all the way to the end,

470
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
the green warehouse is the repair squad.

471
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,400
I want you to fix all your
damaged doors and windows.

472
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,240
There isn't enough tools. So I can't
guarantee that everyone will get one.

473
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,240
The time now is

474
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,960
5:30am.

475
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,720
Anyone who fails to
complete the repairs by 6:30am

476
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,000
will be eliminated.

477
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,880
Go!

478
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,160
Let's go.

479
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,840
Let's wash our hand first.

480
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,640
Let's wash our face.

481
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,880
You guys are exhausted already?

482
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
If you think this is too much for you,
get out of here then.

483
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,000
Why put up with all these sufferings?

484
00:30:44,185 --> 00:30:45,865
The food truck is here.
Come on.

485
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,754
Let's sing a song before we eat.

486
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,320
That's enough. Spare them.

487
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,480
They've been starving
since yesterday.

488
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,600
Kitchen Squad Leader!

489
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,920
-Yes, sir!
-Tell the guys

490
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,560
what are in the buns.

491
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,239
Beef, carrot, lamb and onion.

492
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,520
What beverages are they having?

493
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,120
Milk and soy milk.
You can eat as much as you can.

494
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,200
You heard him.

495
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,480
Bun, milk, soy milk.

496
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,840
You can eat as much as you can.

497
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,760
We won't make things
difficult for you this time.

498
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,240
I promise there isn't any trick.

499
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,400
The condition is

500
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,159
you only have three minutes.

501
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,080
Start now!

502
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,880
Give me one.

503
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,840
Easy, easy. Everyone will get one.

504
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,280
-What?
-I want a bun.

505
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,760
Bun! Bun!

506
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,160
Don't push.
There is enough for everyone.

507
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,920
Goodness.
It's so hard to grab some food.

508
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,080
Good job.

509
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,080
You have to stay fierce too
when you eat.

510
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,880
Listen up.

511
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,080
You have one minute left.

512
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,240
Here.

513
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,569
What are you looking at? Eat up.

514
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,920
26 and 31 are eating very little.

515
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:23,960
Something is not right.

516
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,920
Let's be cautious.

517
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,760
That's because they're not hungry.
I'm famished. I don't care anymore.

518
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,199
Stop. Fall in!

519
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,000
Not bad.

520
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,199
Given that

521
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,160
you have just finished breakfast,

522
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,160
today's training program

523
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,120
is relatively less arduous.

524
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,280
I can ensure you,

525
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,120
you won't sweat at all.

526
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,600
How is it?

527
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,440
Have you drained out all your
energy from your breakfast?

528
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,600
I know that

529
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,920
you guys must be
cursing me internally now,

530
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,560
but it's okay.

531
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,200
Like I said,

532
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,960
you make your own choice.

533
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,840
Whoever can't take it anymore,
just come up.

534
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:18,200
How is it?

535
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,080
Anyone wants to be the first?

536
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:26,960
31,

537
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,320
how are you hanging in there?

538
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,960
Report, sir!

539
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,520
I can do this!

540
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,800
Squadron Leader Leng Jing told us
not to be too hard on you.

541
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,280
You're a female soldier.

542
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,800
It's been two hours.

543
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
If you can't take it anymore,
just come up.

544
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,640
I'm doing fine!

545
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,680
27, why are you shaking?

546
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,640
Keep your balance.

547
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,105
These soldiers around you

548
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,160
are selected from ace units.

549
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,000
If you can't do this anymore,
just come up.

550
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,320
You're not like them.

551
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,399
Report, sir!

552
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm stronger than them!

553
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,120
Okay then.

554
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,560
Next training course,

555
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,639
you and 31 will give
everyone a demonstration.

556
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,440
All of you,

557
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,879
your hands and feet will be tied up.

558
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,559
Two persons a team.

559
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,006
Save yourself in the water.

560
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Your time limit is two minutes.

561
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,919
The worst performer will be eliminated.

562
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Face the pool.

563
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,680
Start the demonstration.

564
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,680
One, two, three.

565
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,560
Go!

566
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:32,398
Are you ready?

567
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,320
Yes, sir!

568
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,320
Ready.

569
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,200
Come here!

570
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,920
Captain,

571
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,800
he's fine.

572
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,280
17

573
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,519
and 8 exceeded the time limit.

574
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,160
They are eliminated.

575
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,320
Report, sir!

576
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:55,680
Why?

577
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,000
I got out before the time was up.

578
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,760
Only 17 should be eliminated.

579
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,960
You are a group.

580
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,040
I said save yourself in the water,

581
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
but I didn't say
you can't save each other.

582
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,720
I told you before,

583
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,240
everyone around you is

584
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
your most treasured comrade!

585
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,560
Those who only care
about their own interests

586
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,280
and not about the lives of others,

587
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,761
get out of Cheetah!

588
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,960
17,

589
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:32,440
you're good,

590
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,560
but your physical conditions

591
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,920
may not be suitable for special forces.

592
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,800
I believe

593
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:39,560
you can do better

594
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,000
in other positions.

595
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,520
(I've gotten used to the reality that
we have people leaving everyday.)

596
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,800
(I'm just not used to the helping hand
offered by Guo Xiao Xiao.)

597
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,440
(And how she is always so calm
irritates me even more.)

598
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,640
(She acts like she's the strong one,)

599
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,000
(like she was born with a reason
to help the weak.)

600
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,480
(But I'm never weak.)

601
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
(Sentinels Are Sacred And Inviolable)

602
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
(Show Your ID, Receive Inspection)

603
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,600
100 meters ahead, sprint.

604
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,040
The slowest group

605
00:40:54,142 --> 00:40:56,480
will be rewarded with
200 push-ups per person.

606
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,520
Team 1, get ready.

607
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,320
Go!

608
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,520
Team 2, get ready.

609
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,400
Go to the back!

610
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,600
What are you doing?

611
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,639
This is fairer to you.

612
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,200
Mind your own business!

613
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,560
Go!
