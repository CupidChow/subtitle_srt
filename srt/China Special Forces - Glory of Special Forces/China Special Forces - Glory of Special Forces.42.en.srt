1
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,151
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,026
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,640
(Episode 42)

4
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,360
Now, we are confronted with 26 alphabets

5
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,417
that are tricky and hard to recognise.

6
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,600
Only by conquering them,

7
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,240
will we be able to march

8
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,800
to the finishing point together.

9
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,200
It will be an arduous journey.

10
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,120
I hope we can stay united.

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,720
I'm sure we could
definitely conquer them

12
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,360
if we stayed as bloodthirsty as we were

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,720
when we were on the battlefield.

14
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,480
Do you guys have confidence
in yourselves?

15
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:01,680
Yes!

16
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:02,745
Do you guys have confidence
in yourselves?

17
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,920
Yes!

18
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,560
I heard that the lowest points
that Class C had scored

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,480
for the English test were 5 points.

20
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,040
Class C consists of soldiers and cadres.

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
The result isn't surprising at all.

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,720
I thought the Cheetahs were in Class C?

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,880
So what?

24
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:24,520
They only have half a year.

25
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,560
It'll be too late if we have to wait

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,240
until they pass their cultural course.

27
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,600
Don't take them lightly.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
They are capable of

29
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,559
producing miracles.

30
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,240
May I see your passport?

31
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,919
Please show me your passport.

32
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,880
May I have a look at your ID card?

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Please stand in...

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,240
Safety off.

35
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,680
Safety on.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,000
Safety off. Safety on.

37
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,920
Safety off. Safety on.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,560
Please stand in a line.

39
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,960
Weapon support detachment.

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,919
Weapon system designator.

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,160
Checks weapon.

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,320
Order arms.

43
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,759
Test the gun.

44
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,919
Order arms.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,039
Take the bullets.

46
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,080
Bullets in.

47
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:43,960
Bullets in.

48
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,679
Weapon system directive.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,720
Weapon support detachment.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,000
Operations and Intelligence.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,679
Get down, one by one.

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,240
Lay down your guns.

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Or, we will fire.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,639
Bullets in.

55
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,119
Bullets out.

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320
Yan,

57
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,320
do you want to try my method?
It's especially effective.

58
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,240
Come, I'll put it on for you.

59
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,880
Take a look.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,679
Don't be impatient for now.

61
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,600
Listen to me.

62
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,679
This was how I memorised my vocabulary
during high school.

63
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,600
It's especially effective.

64
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,400
Back then, I was at my peak.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,160
I knew both astronomy and geography.

66
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,519
I knew the history of China.

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,801
I knew the size of Port Island.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,079
I could draw cell diagrams,

69
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,160
solve equations,

70
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,000
speak English
and understand ancient verses.

71
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:56,839
I'm serious.

72
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,400
Now that I think about it,
I was unstoppable back then.

73
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,720
Can you just shut up and read for once?

74
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,880
Just trust me this time.

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

76
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,880
We have to use special methods for this.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,760
Do you think all those with
a Master's degree or PhD

78
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,080
acquired their qualifications
by being a smart alec like you?

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,160
We only have six months.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,239
I didn't even dare to sleep.

81
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,040
I don't have time to mess around.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,440
Look at our...

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Just study.

84
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,639
Fine.

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,280
You have a point.
You're right in everything you say.

86
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,600
Bai?

87
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,040
Bai,

88
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,399
I understand

89
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,920
that it's been tough on you.

90
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,400
I believe you can do it.

91
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,600
Standby.

92
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:02,960
Are you ready?

93
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,480
Come in.

94
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,280
Vice Detachment Chief,

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,281
I've made up my mind.

96
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,080
Great.

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm glad that you could
straighten your thoughts out.

98
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,520
I won't go there.

99
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
There's only one slot for a female
officer in the entire detachment

100
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,399
to attend the sniper academy.

101
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,200
Do you know how many people
wish to take your spot?

102
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,359
The detachment chief thinks that
you're suitable for the role.

103
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,559
Do you think I'm suitable for the role?

104
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,840
I do.

105
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:42,200
You qualify in
both qualifications and results.

106
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,880
My roots are in the Cheetah Commando.

107
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:49,839
Leng Jing,

108
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,279
sometimes,

109
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,320
you have to think of yourself.

110
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,399
When you have to let go of something,
you should let it go.

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,119
It's not that I can't let it go.

112
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,040
But since I've made a promise,

113
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:07,683
I have to keep it.

114
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,120
Even if you go there,
you can still nurture new snipers.

115
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
Now, we need to establish

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
a strong and modern armed police force.

117
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,840
Not only do we need the best soldiers,

118
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,359
but we also need better commanders.

119
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,320
-I know that.
-What do you know?

120
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,320
Even I feel a sense of crisis now.

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,279
Leng Jing, remember,

122
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,879
you must improve yourself
when you get there.

123
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,759
You have to expand your knowledge
and experience.

124
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,840
You must put your strength into good use

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,640
and improve yourself
in a holistic manner.

126
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,840
Only then,

127
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,280
you'll be able to go far
on the path you've taken.

128
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,200
Am I right?

129
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
You might even surpass me.

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,240
No matter what
the higher-ups had decided,

131
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,840
it's a well-thought-out decision that is
beneficial to the bigger picture.

132
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
I will obey their command.

133
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:56,440
But if I have the right to choose,

134
00:07:57,234 --> 00:07:58,315
I'll choose to stay.

135
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:04,560
Leng Jing...

136
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,280
There are many things
that I need to thank you for.

137
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,000
Thanking me isn't the end.

138
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,960
It's just a process.

139
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,168
The process is tough,

140
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:20,120
but we have to go through it.

141
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,640
I wish to recommend a better candidate.

142
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,080
Please come in.

143
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,000
Make yourself at home.

144
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,480
I'll pour you some water.

145
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,760
You've been training for so many years.

146
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,640
But now, you have to study.

147
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
I'm sure you're not used to it, right?

148
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
Captain Leng, here.

149
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Have some water.

150
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,039
Be careful, it's hot.

151
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:51,785
Hold it like this.

152
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:56,708
Did you stay up late?

153
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,032
No, I didn't.

154
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,480
Stop lying. You look like a panda.

155
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,640
I'm not lying.

156
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,720
I'm very energetic right now.

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,720
I've heard about your result.

158
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:11,520
You don't need to push yourself.

159
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,880
This isn't the only path you can take.

160
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,000
Come.

161
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
Have a seat.
I'll explain it to you in a second.

162
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,920
Okay.

163
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,233
It's like this.

164
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200
Our higher-ups

165
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:31,720
have established an academy for snipers.

166
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
They will select the best snipers
from the military

167
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,800
and the armed police forces
to be the instructors there.

168
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:39,800
They need a female instructor.

169
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,040
You should go.

170
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,240
Are you dumbfounded?

171
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:52,935
Why me?

172
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,160
Isn't it obvious?

173
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,200
Why can't it be you?

174
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,720
Is it acting up again?
Let me give you a massage.

175
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,898
I'm fine.

176
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:05,243
It acts up whenever it rains.

177
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:06,084
I'm truly fine.

178
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:13,347
Do you know how I got this injury?

179
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,920
I heard that you were struck by
a stray bullet during a mission.

180
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,760
There's a risk of hurting your nerves
if they operate on you.

181
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:23,640
That's why the shrapnel

182
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:25,880
is still inside your shoulder.

183
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,480
Back then, I thought
it was a stray bullet too.

184
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:33,240
I thought the enemy sniper

185
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:35,000
was just lucky.

186
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:37,920
Back then, the bullet

187
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,268
struck a piece of glass in front of me.

188
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,120
After that, it deflected from
the surface

189
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,000
and hit the stone wall behind me.

190
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,400
Right after that,
the shrapnel struck my shoulder.

191
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,959
When I examined the situation again
after my recovery,

192
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,959
I realised

193
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,399
that it wasn't just a lucky shot.

194
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:56,400
It was a calculated shot.

195
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:57,681
A calculated shot?

196
00:10:57,794 --> 00:10:58,400
That's right.

197
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,280
Not only did my enemy understand
the wind speed, wind strength,

198
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,760
atmospheric pressure, humidity,
and other common perimeters,

199
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,080
but he also knew about
the thickness of the glass,

200
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,200
the bullet's angle of insertion,

201
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,080
and its angle of deflection.

202
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
Everything was calculated.

203
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,080
How is that possible?

204
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,280
There are too many uncertainties
during wartime.

205
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
However,

206
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,680
it did happen.

207
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,120
When I realised the truth,

208
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,200
I was scared.

209
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
I always thought

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,317
that I could surely become
the best sniper

211
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:51,026
if I worked hard enough
with the help of my innate talent.

212
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:52,120
But that wasn't enough.

213
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,600
The shrapnel in my shoulder

214
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,960
doesn't just cause me pain
during rainy days,

215
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,800
but it also reminds me

216
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,960
that if I want to be
an excellent sniper,

217
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,320
I still have plenty of things
I need to learn.

218
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:07,273
Only then, you will achieve victory
when you face your enemies.

219
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,210
So, Xiao Xiao,

220
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,800
you should go to the sniper academy.

221
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:14,760
This way, you can acquire more
professional knowledge and skills.

222
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
And,

223
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:19,000
I've been seeking scientific methods
to train my recruits.

224
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,400
And I aim to nurture

225
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:24,240
100 excellent snipers in my lifetime.

226
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:25,655
You're the 50th candidate,

227
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:27,337
and you're the best among them.

228
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:29,345
But now,

229
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:32,520
I can no longer continue.

230
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,680
The doctor told me

231
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,320
that the shrapnel in my shoulder

232
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,040
has been displaced.

233
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,680
It might hurt my nerves at any time.

234
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:56,360
That's why I'm sending you
to the sniper academy

235
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,800
so that you can achieve
my goal on my behalf.

236
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,320
Although you're injured,

237
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,960
I know

238
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,000
that the slot belongs to you.

239
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,800
I know this well.

240
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,480
I understand
the situation I'm in better than you.

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,960
But Captain Leng,

242
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,560
you told me

243
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,239
that I am the best

244
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,080
out of the 50 snipers you have nurtured.

245
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:44,880
Don't tell me you did so

246
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,120
just because
you want to leave with dignity

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
while imposing a future
that you think is bright upon me?

248
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,280
If so,

249
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,200
I'm not fit to be Guo Xiao Xiao
of the Cheetah Commando.

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,800
Xiao Xiao, that's not it.

251
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:08,812
That's not what I mean.

252
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,040
I truly think that you fit the role.

253
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,240
Captain Leng,

254
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,720
I'm really happy that
you're here to visit me.

255
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,960
However,

256
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,640
if I can't even pass
the cultural course,

257
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,160
how am I fit

258
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:40,480
to be the new sniper instructor?

259
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,720
I know.

260
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,400
If I want to become an excellent member
of the Cheetah Commando,

261
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,800
I have to be mighty at both
the pen and the sword.

262
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,640
But I believe in myself.

263
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,400
I believe that I can achieve it
through hard work

264
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,880
instead of leaving

265
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,480
at a compromise like this.

266
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,760
How about this?

267
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:12,805
I'll give you some time.

268
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:14,369
Think it through.

269
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,640
You can answer me after that.

270
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:29,913
This...

271
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:31,777
I have to learn how to fly

272
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:33,544
before walking.

273
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,760
I didn't even pass English Level 2.

274
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:38,301
How can I translate the thesis
while referring to these materials?

275
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:40,609
Come.

276
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,680
You can check the dictionary
if you don't understand the words.

277
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,640
Buddy,

278
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,999
you want me to refer to the dictionary
word by word?

279
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:52,903
Look at the long paragraphs.

280
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,799
How many years do I need to take
to translate all of them?

281
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,840
What else do you think?

282
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:57,662
We have no choice but to do this.

283
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,400
How about this?

284
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,455
I'll deal with the first four paragraphs

285
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,719
while you can deal with
the next four paragraphs.

286
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,159
It'll be faster if we work together.

287
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,479
Hurry up.

288
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,520
By the way,

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,240
we should split half of our workload
to Xiao Xiao when she's here.

290
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,919
She might not be able to come.

291
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,119
But why?

292
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:16,480
I saw Captain Leng looking for her

293
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:18,033
during our morning class.

294
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,560
What's the matter?

295
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,160
Guo Xiao Xiao came in fourth last place

296
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,560
for the monthly test.

297
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,960
That's fine.

298
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,200
Even if someone were to eliminate her,

299
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,560
it would be Instructor Ai, am I right?

300
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,799
Enough.

301
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,119
Get to it already.

302
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,640
There's trouble at your 11 o'clock.

303
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,720
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie,
what are you two doing?

304
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,680
Senior, we're studying.

305
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,998
We're studying hard.

306
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,240
You don't say?

307
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,079
Don't you think I can tell
by looking at the books on your table?

308
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,119
I was asking what subject
you're studying.

309
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,239
We're learning how to translate

310
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,160
and write our thesis.

311
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,839
Comrade,

312
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,119
you see, we're already busy enough.

313
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,001
Can you please
stop creating trouble for us?

314
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,560
I didn't speak nor move.

315
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,600
Which of your eyes saw that
I was creating trouble for you?

316
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,600
Hurry and get to it.
Why are you staring at me?

317
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,280
Brave...

318
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,001
Brave...

319
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,840
You moved.

320
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,560
Look! You're moving!

321
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,599
You're wrong.

322
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,719
Where?

323
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,801
Look.

324
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:58,879
Brave.

325
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,120
It's wrong in this context.

326
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,440
There's the word "than" behind it.

327
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,400
It shows comparison.

328
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,320
Braver than.

329
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:05,200
It's an adjective, not a noun.

330
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,640
A hero is not braver
than an ordinary man,

331
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,800
but he is braver five minutes longer.

332
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,440
A hero is not braver
than an ordinary man,

333
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,480
but he is braver five minutes longer.

334
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,200
Ralph Waldo Emerson
came up with the quote.

335
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,199
Senior,

336
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,320
how is your English this good?

337
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,680
I just got Band 8
on the Test for English Majors.

338
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:32,121
You're being humble here.

339
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,160
How about this? I'll buy you a drink.

340
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,000
Please translate
the two paragraphs for me.

341
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,680
I don't dare to speak much.

342
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,600
I'll interrupt your study, won't I?

343
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,040
You're being too courteous here.

344
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,080
You aren't interrupting us at all.
This is just an interaction.

345
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,560
It's an exchange of thoughts.

346
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,240
What's wrong?

347
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,080
Is there something wrong with your eye?

348
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,320
Senior, it's fine
if you don't want to help me out.

349
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,280
You should at least help him out.

350
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:14,680
Help him out? Sure.

351
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
Please.

352
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,600
If you help him out,
you'll be helping me out too.

353
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
Come on. You can ask me
if you have questions.

354
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:24,720
I'll check the dictionary for you.

355
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,520
Everybody!

356
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,120
Dress right, dress!

357
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,560
Attention!

358
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,600
-Eyes front!
-Dress right, dress!

359
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,119
Count off!

360
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,680
One, two, three, four, five, six!

361
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,760
Eyes front!

362
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,319
Count off!

363
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,319
One, two, three, four, five, six!

364
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:41,920
Full attendance!

365
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,040
At ease!

366
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,240
Instructor!

367
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,720
12 members are supposed to be present
for Squad One!

368
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,760
12 members are currently present!

369
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,561
Please give us your instructions!

370
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,241
At ease!

371
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,041
Yes, sir!

372
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,320
-At ease!
-Attention!

373
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,040
Instructor!

374
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,560
12 members are supposed to be present
for Squad Two! All 12 are present!

375
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,199
Please give us your instructions!

376
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,640
-At ease!
-Yes, sir!

377
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,399
At ease!

378
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,199
Everybody!

379
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:16,680
This morning, we will hold
a 10km weighted running assessment!

380
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,040
Sir!

381
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,280
Speak!

382
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,880
Squad One requests a greater challenge!

383
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,120
They will only start running
after three minutes.

384
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,480
Please let Squad Two depart first!

385
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:24,920
Are you sure?

386
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,160
Squad One, are you sure?

387
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,160
Yes, sir!

388
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,080
Alright. Squad Two will depart first.

389
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
Yes, sir!

390
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,200
One, two, one!

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,199
One, two, one!

392
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
One, two, three, four.

393
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,799
One, two, three, four.

394
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,080
One, two, three, four.

395
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,081
One, two, three, four.

396
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,481
Should we overtake them?

397
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,586
Don't mess up the rhythm.

398
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:51,960
Conserve your stamina.

399
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:53,368
Follow them.

400
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:02,261
One, two, three, four.

401
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,360
We'll reach the finish line soon.

402
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,839
It's time for us to pick up the pace.

403
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:15,400
Let's overtake Squad One.

404
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,200
Squad Two,

405
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,160
change formation!

406
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,040
Yes, sir!

407
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,040
Bai!

408
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,520
Bai!

409
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,280
-What's wrong?
-He stayed up all night studying.

410
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I think he's too exhausted.

411
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,440
Yan!

412
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,840
Come here, Yan!

413
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,320
Let's send him to the infirmary!

414
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,880
-Hurry!
-Help us out!

415
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,520
Give us a hand! Come on! Let's go!

416
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,880
Let's go!

417
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,600
Bai, your food is here.

418
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:54,184
Bai,

419
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,680
what are you doing?

420
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,239
I'm so stupid! I can't master them
no matter what I do!

421
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,080
Give it to me!

422
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,439
Even if you smash your head with this,

423
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,359
do you think you can remember them?

424
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,551
What else can I do?

425
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,410
You didn't even make a sound
when you were shot.

426
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,760
How could the 26 alphabets
pose a threat to you?

427
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:27,674
We've been through
all kinds of situations.

428
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:29,242
We pulled through every time, right?

429
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,920
We won't lose to these alphabets.

430
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,273
Let's study together.

431
00:24:38,594 --> 00:24:39,834
Everyone will help you out.

432
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:45,305
It's easy for you to say.

433
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:50,687
I bought this online.

434
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,440
They said it's a memory enhancer.

435
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,680
It's imported. They said
it could help boost my memory.

436
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,640
I take it every day.

437
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,280
I didn't even dare to stop for a minute!

438
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,959
But, I still couldn't master them!

439
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,520
In the past,

440
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,737
I thought hard work
could help me achieve anything.

441
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:10,920
I came from a village. I'm uncultured.

442
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,540
When you guys were eating,
I was memorising my vocabulary.

443
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,880
When you guys were sleeping,
I was memorising my vocabulary.

444
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,280
I didn't dare to stop
even when I was in the toilet!

445
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,160
I only sleep for two hours per day.

446
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,801
Sometimes,
I even skipped sleeping entirely.

447
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,119
I've done everything I could!

448
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,120
Take your time.

449
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,440
Everyone is doing their best too.

450
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,319
I,

451
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,760
Bai Long,

452
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,560
came in last place
for the cultural course.

453
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,480
No matter how hard I try,

454
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,400
I can never catch up with you guys.

455
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,680
You guys could master them
after reading them once.

456
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:17,680
I could never understand them even if
I had studied them six or seven times.

457
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,280
I'm willing to learn from the start,

458
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:22,129
but there's truly no time left.

459
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,551
I don't want to give up,

460
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,760
but I can't afford to hold back
the Cheetah Commando.

461
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,760
I must protect the Cheetahs' honour.

462
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,600
I still wish to be
the proud soldier I am

463
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,960
in the place where I belong.

464
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,360
Yan Po Yue,

465
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,000
just leave.

466
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,120
I'm sorry.

467
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
Even though Bai Long is hospitalised,

468
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,239
we still have to
hold our weekly meeting.

469
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:26,560
Let's report our thinking,

470
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,641
work, and study progress

471
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
for the week.

472
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
I'll jot down the meeting minutes.

473
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,680
Yan Po Yue, you may start first.

474
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
If so, I'll start first.

475
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,040
-This week, my cultural course...
-I have something to report.

476
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,160
Bai Long failed his monthly assessment.

477
00:27:54,818 --> 00:27:55,578
He has applied

478
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:58,680
to withdraw from the programme.

479
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,000
Did he apply it of his own accord?

480
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:10,440
Applying it of his own accord
is better than being eliminated.

481
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,080
He's trying to protect

482
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:16,080
the honour of the Cheetah Commando.

483
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,760
Do you know how many wars
Bai had fought in?

484
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,720
They're trying to
chase away our war hero!

485
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,320
Let's report this to Qin Feng.

486
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,320
We're his subordinates.

487
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,320
Do you think Qin Feng will
give Bai Long any special treatment?

488
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:34,600
Even if he's willing to,

489
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:37,840
do you think Bai Long will accept it?

490
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,840
I'll find Bai.

491
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,233
What is he thinking?

492
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,760
He finally made it here,
but now, he's leaving?

493
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,880
Stop right there!

494
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:48,720
Bai Long already feels terrible.

495
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,160
Do you think he'd give up
if he stood a chance?

496
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:53,080
If you go to him right now,

497
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:55,646
that means you'll be stomping on
his last bit of dignity.

498
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:56,567
Tell me then!

499
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,760
Tell me.

500
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:58,699
What should we do?

501
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,360
Should we just do nothing
and let him leave?

502
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,040
I suggest

503
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,080
respecting Bai Long's decision.

504
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,000
I agree.

505
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,920
Can't we just work harder?

506
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,220
Can't we just work harder?

507
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,760
Bai Long didn't admit defeat.

508
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,761
It's just

509
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,080
that he ran out of time.

510
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:28,160
The military wants to hasten
their development.

511
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,720
They're running out of time too.

512
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,320
Come in.

513
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,200
Captain.

514
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,920
I've brought your belongings here.

515
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,920
-How's your injury?
-I'm fine now.

516
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,560
-Let me take a look.
-I'm truly fine.

517
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,921
-I'm fine now.
-Let me take a look.

518
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,160
Don't worry. I'm fine now.

519
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,480
Alright then.

520
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:04,440
It's fine as long as
it won't hinder you from getting a wife.

521
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,321
Don't you think so?

522
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,240
Must you leave at this time?

523
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,680
Are you doing so
to avoid bidding farewell to them?

524
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:20,353
They still need to study.

525
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:22,120
I don't want them to be distracted
by my departure.

526
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:29,080
Captain, I'm sorry.

527
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,480
I've failed my mission.

528
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,880
What are you saying?

529
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:47,000
Bai,

530
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,000
it's been tough on you.

531
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,040
We need well-rounded individuals

532
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:58,600
to form the modern armed police forces.

533
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,480
As a veteran,

534
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:02,800
I should give up my seat.

535
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,480
Don't worry, I'm fine.

536
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,200
Listen.

537
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,480
No matter where you go,

538
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:21,080
you'll always be our king.

539
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,160
Stop the car.

540
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,000
Proceed.

541
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:04,240
Salute!

542
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,840
Cheetah Reserve Number 31!

543
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,480
I heard that you're enlisting
in the army for the second time.

544
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
What has that got to do with you?

545
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,960
Knowing our comrades better
can foster better chemistry between us.

546
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:30,192
Just mind your own business.

547
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,560
Cheetah Reserve Number 28!

548
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,920
Cheetah Reserve Number 27!

549
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,920
Captain, I'm honoured to be
in the same squad as you.

550
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:55,760
In the future, if the members
of Squad Nine are in danger,

551
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,440
I will protect you guys, just like
how Platoon Leader Xiang protected us.

552
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,160
(Hello?)

553
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,920
Hello?

554
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,840
Captain, this is Xiao Xiao.

555
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:52,842
(Have you made up your mind?)

556
00:33:56,572 --> 00:33:57,291
Captain Leng,

557
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,240
first, I would like to thank you
for the constant care and high regards.

558
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,800
Even though this was
an opportunity meant for you,

559
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,040
you still thought of me before yourself.

560
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:10,592
But, after serious consideration,

561
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,480
I still think I have no choice

562
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,480
but to apologise to you.

563
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,360
(You don't need to apologise to me.)

564
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,979
I think I still have
plenty of things I need to learn.

565
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,319
I still wish to move forward.

566
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:30,680
I don't want to give myself an excuse

567
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:33,560
to settle down right now.

568
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:35,712
(Understood.)

569
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:37,360
(I wish you luck.)

570
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,160
Thank you, Captain Leng.

571
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:42,200
(Take good care of yourself.)

572
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:44,039
(Goodbye.)

573
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:46,160
You too.

574
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:47,377
Goodbye.

575
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,919
Your shooting result this morning
really impressed me.

576
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:06,178
I was just doing what I usually do.

577
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,011
You don't need a spotter, do you?

578
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,520
I don't.

579
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,520
I know you don't need one.

580
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,160
Along with the improvements
in sniping equipment,

581
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,840
snipers nowadays can go on missions
without any spotters.

582
00:35:23,674 --> 00:35:25,833
Tracking Point came up with
a new sniper rifle

583
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:28,200
called Shadow Tracks 8.

584
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:30,480
This model is equipped
with an intelligent FCS.

585
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,160
It provides snipers with
the highest level of assistance

586
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,320
so that they can
complete their missions alone.

587
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,720
What's the difference between it
and the traditional ACOG?

588
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,679
How do I explain it to you?

589
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:45,106
It's like...

590
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,008
It's more like a computer.

591
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:49,497
It has a camera,

592
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,520
a RAM, a CPU,

593
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,800
all kinds of sensors,

594
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,000
and an independent battery.

595
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:55,120
It can measure

596
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,320
the perimeters and data required
for long-distance sniping,

597
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,359
including the wind speed,
weather conditions,

598
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,960
temperature, humidity,

599
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,241
the precise location

600
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
and the precise distance of the target,

601
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
including the change
of the bullet's amplitude,

602
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,761
the gun's angle of inclination,

603
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:10,120
even

604
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:12,440
Coriolis force.

605
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,081
Through a series
of internal calculations,

606
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,480
it will integrate the perimeters
and data that were collected

607
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,680
in an intelligent manner

608
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,721
to get rid of the external conditions

609
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,840
that will affect its accuracy.

610
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,120
There is no end to sniping technology.

611
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
I love to invent new equipment.

612
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,865
You're welcome to join me
if you're interested.

613
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,840
You may find me anytime.

614
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,760
See you.

615
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,201
Come, pass it to me.

616
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,720
Both of you are here.

617
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:19,160
Are you here to see me off?

618
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,640
Or are you here to bid me farewell?

619
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:22,840
Don't they mean the same thing?

620
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,000
Today, our ranks don't matter.

621
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,560
I'm just here to see my old comrade.

622
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,360
I'm here to fetch you as well.

623
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:32,880
I didn't say I wanted
you guys to see me off.

624
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,720
Just you wish.

625
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,000
The time is stated within
the transfer order.

626
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:37,616
Get in the car.

627
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,400
Leng Jing, how long has it been
since you've been on a holiday?

628
00:37:57,769 --> 00:37:58,680
Two years.

629
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,920
Why didn't you apply for leave?

630
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Have you applied
for any leaves yourself?

631
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,960
I just had nothing to do.

632
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,840
Leng Jing, I remember that
there's a special beef soup in Anhui.

633
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:10,120
The best shop is in Bozhou.

634
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:11,240
You're right.

635
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:15,040
I still remember I went to Anhui
to receive the new recruits

636
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
as a platoon leader over a decade ago.

637
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,320
The soup was unforgettable.

638
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:23,113
Leng Jing,

639
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
if you don't feel too good
about your transfer,

640
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:25,960
you can take a break

641
00:38:26,025 --> 00:38:27,080
and visit your hometown first.

642
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:29,442
I'll see about that.

643
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,440
Actually, this is common
within the military.

644
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:37,639
Maybe we would show up
at the same place some other time.

645
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,640
Don't you think so?

646
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,009
Vice Detachment Chief,
I'm planning to take a break too.

647
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,120
Will you permit my leave?

648
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,079
Just you wish.

649
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
When have I taken a break
when I was serving as the corps captain?

650
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,880
Focus on driving.

651
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,320
Detachment Chief.

652
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:04,800
Have you seen her off?

653
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,360
Yes, sir. She has arrived safely.

654
00:39:09,505 --> 00:39:11,666
Even though Leng Jing
has left the Cheetah Commando,

655
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:13,720
her roots are here.

656
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:15,920
Don't overthink it.

657
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:16,761
Understood.

658
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:18,834
There's one more thing.

659
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:22,320
Have you decided on the participants
for the upcoming special unit contest?

660
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,399
Detachment Chief, we still have
three months before the contest, right?

661
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:28,320
It was brought forward.

662
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,720
As the pressure of international
anti-terrorism piles up,

663
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,959
they plan to hold
the contest by next month.

664
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,640
Many new countries
will be joining the contest.

665
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,040
This is the largest international
anti-terrorism drill in the world.

666
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:39,400
The types of event,

667
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,840
the role of the imaginary enemy,

668
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,079
even the venue of the drill

669
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,120
are all unknown for now.

670
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,959
This is just like a real operation.

671
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,839
Give me a name list in one week.

672
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:52,880
Detachment Chief,
if that's the case, why don't we...

673
00:39:58,792 --> 00:39:59,953
Do you still want

674
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,600
the old Cheetahs to spar with
the new Cheetahs?

675
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,680
No.

676
00:40:04,883 --> 00:40:06,880
That was what I thought at first.

677
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:09,160
But now, since the contest date
has been brought forward,

678
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,320
why don't we use
the contest to our advantage?

679
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,800
We can provide the new and old Cheetahs

680
00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:14,840
with the same goals and opponents.

681
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:18,040
By doing so, we can form a stronger team
through complementary advantages.

682
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:19,880
That will be the best-case scenario.

683
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,319
But Qin Feng,
have you ever considered this?

684
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,799
They've never mingled
with each other before.

685
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,440
What if they bite each other
when we put them on the same team?

686
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,400
Detachment Chief, this...

687
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:30,240
I believe they are at least
conscious of that fact themselves.

688
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,000
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie, Guo Xiao Xiao!

689
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,240
Stop your training and assemble!

690
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,697
You three, stop your training

691
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,280
and head to the meeting room
in the academy building right now.

692
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,001
Sir, what's going on?

693
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,239
I don't know the details either.
Just hurry up.

694
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,640
-Sir!
-Come in.

695
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:06,785
Salute!

696
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:28,560
Do you know why I'm here this time?

697
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,760
Sir,

698
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,719
I've reached the goals

699
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,520
for every subject this month.

700
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,321
Sir,

701
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,600
I think I didn't do too badly

702
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,200
except for the English essay questions.

703
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,880
Sir,

704
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,680
I didn't do well in
the monthly English test.

705
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:56,121
Please let me retake the test!

706
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,480
Sir! Comrade Guo Xiao Xiao
has been working hard all along!

707
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,080
Please give her more time.

708
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:01,000
Sir!

709
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,360
Please give the three of us more time.

710
00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:06,680
It's too late.

711
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
You guys are too late.

712
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:15,145
We're here to bring you guys away.

713
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:20,920
All three of us are eliminated?

714
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,240
You must be kidding me.

715
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,400
We've already done everything we could!

716
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,320
Sir!

717
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:26,431
Come in!

718
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,600
Right face!

719
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,040
-Pei Ta Yan!
-Mao Lang!

720
00:42:33,186 --> 00:42:34,760
-Su Jian Fan!
-Ren Xiao Chuan!

721
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,520
We're here to report for duty!
