(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:31,000
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 33)

4
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,560
That brat, I guess
he's addicted to fighting.

5
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,240
What about this, Captain?

6
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,120
I'll go here and take him back.

7
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
I'm tagging along.

8
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,920
Don't create more trouble for me.

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,881
He didn't even bother to listen to me.

10
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
Do you think he'll trust you

11
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,040
when you are there?

12
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,559
Is it possible

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,319
that he really thinks
that this is a trap?

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,360
You mean...

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,960
He thinks what we said is not true.

16
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,080
He believes
that the drill is still ongoing.

17
00:01:58,919 --> 00:01:59,959
It's highly possible.

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,320
What a brat.

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,799
It seems

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,520
only one person

21
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,720
stands a chance to bring him back.

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,120
Yan Po Yue!

23
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
Come out now!

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,920
Yan Po Yue, come out!

25
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,360
Yan Po Yue!

26
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,119
Look clearly!

27
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm Ai Qian Xue!

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,720
I'm not the participant of the drill!

29
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:07,418
Come out now!

30
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:09,332
No one else is around.

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,080
There is no ambush!

32
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,840
Yan Po Yue!

33
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,600
Come out now!

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,160
I know

35
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,760
that you can see me

36
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,880
and you can hear me!

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,480
Come out!

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,080
Yan Po Yue!

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,000
Come out now!

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
Do you hear me?

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,480
Come out now!

42
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,720
Yan Po Yue!

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,800
Come out now! Do you hear me?

44
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,120
Yan Po Yue...

45
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,599
You...

46
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,440
Why are you here?

47
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,040
My unit is on a block leave.

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,400
That's why
I'm paying my former troop a visit.

49
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,760
Then, I heard

50
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,078
that you're missing in action.

51
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,840
No!

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,520
I'm doing all right.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,777
I'm still fighting
as the battle is still ongoing.

54
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,000
We have yet to achieve
the stipulated kill ratio.

55
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,559
All the shouting could be fake.

56
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,440
They could be traps.

57
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,839
Yan Po Yue.

58
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,480
It's a trap.

59
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,279
-It's just a trap.
-Hear me out.

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm still fighting.

61
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,519
It could be a trap.

62
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,559
It could be a trap!

63
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:36,200
Yan Po Yue!

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,959
Don't touch me!

65
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,920
Yan Po Yue, hear me out!

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,360
Hear me out, Yan Po Yue.

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,480
The drill has ended!

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,760
Do you hear me?

69
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,960
Hear me out.

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,080
The drill has ended.

71
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,920
Cheetah Commando

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,320
won.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,960
We won?

74
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,600
Yes.

75
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,280
Yan Po Yue!

76
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,560
Yan Po Yue.

77
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,320
Here, lie down.

78
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,560
Actually,

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,840
you knew the outcome
since the beginning.

80
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,680
Am I right?

81
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:04,840
Then why...

82
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,080
In the beginning,

83
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
I wanted to prove myself.

84
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,520
Then,

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,800
I lost all my comrades.

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,000
The battle

87
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,800
became an obsession.

88
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,560
I would like to find out

89
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,320
how long can I survive

90
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,160
with various skills that I have.

91
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,840
I wondered if I would be
captured by the opponent.

92
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,200
Then,

93
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,160
I started to feel afraid.

94
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,760
I was afraid

95
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,680
I would be my own enemy.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,799
If that's the case, those in the
Blue Team who were eliminated earlier

97
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,241
would be dead.

98
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,110
So,

99
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,319
you soldiered on in the drill

100
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,760
to show everyone
the right way of defence

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,560
to prevent losses
on the real battlefield.

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,005
This is not something
you can bear alone.

103
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,959
It shouldn't be borne by you alone.

104
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,040
In the drill,

105
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,160
we keep modifying and refining
the combat skills of the troop.

106
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,759
The responsibility is shared

107
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,761
among everyone
in the armed police force.

108
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,119
You can't solve the problem on your own.

109
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,080
I'm informing you once again.

110
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,240
The drill

111
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,840
has officially ended.

112
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,200
Yan Po Yue!

113
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,720
Yan Po Yue!

114
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,799
Salute!

115
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,840
What are you waiting for?

116
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,000
Why aren't you saluting back?

117
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,800
Yan Po Yue.

118
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm happy for you.

119
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,680
You didn't give up nor become dejected.

120
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,440
On the contrary,
with your effort and persistence,

121
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,440
you've created

122
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,120
a path of your own.

123
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,960
Aren't we having gathering?

124
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,360
Where is the rest?

125
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,441
Buddy.

126
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:03,599
No one is a match for you in guerrilla.

127
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,760
You persisted for more than ten days.

128
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
No one has the time to wait for you.
Everyone has left.

129
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,581
I'm the only one left
to keep you company.

130
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,440
If that's the case,

131
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:12,466
where is the Blue Team?

132
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,280
Blue Team?

133
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,600
You defeated the Blue Team.

134
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,147
Do you expect them
to eat together with you happily?

135
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,320
Are you kidding me?

136
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,040
It's just the two of us. Eat up.

137
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,680
Skip the meat. Eat more vegetables.

138
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,000
It's been more than ten days
you didn't eat anything.

139
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,721
Here.

140
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,681
Eat more vegetables.
It's good for your stomach.

141
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,360
Guo, do we have enough food?
I bet there are many people eating.

142
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,520
It's enough.

143
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,919
I bet it's happening in there.

144
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,119
Finally you're back!

145
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,359
It's been a long time since I saw you.

146
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,320
Finally the battle has ended.
Are you all right?

147
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,841
But the outcome is honourable.

148
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,160
Why is no one here?

149
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,320
We're here and that's enough.

150
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,639
They're so narrow-minded.

151
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,240
And they have the cheeks
to say that we're comrades.

152
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
Why are they doing this?

153
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,080
Do you know what makes
you two extraordinary?

154
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,720
That's because
you're from the kitchen squad.

155
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,761
As such,

156
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,720
I'm showing my gratitude
on behalf of the kitchen squad.

157
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,721
Go away.

158
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,080
You don't have the right
to represent the squad.

159
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:00,679
Exactly.

160
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,320
Guo.

161
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,119
Here, the three of us should drink up.

162
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:03,729
What's wrong?

163
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,503
I'm also included.

164
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,601
Cheers.

165
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,073
What's wrong? Are you okay?

166
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
It's been a while
since he had fizzy drinks.

167
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:14,680
It's okay.

168
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,120
-Slow down.
-I'm fine.

169
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,040
Yan.

170
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,120
You've gotten face in the drill.

171
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,559
That's indeed
a full display of your skills.

172
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,560
If Fan knew about it,

173
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,560
he would slap his thigh excitedly.

174
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,680
Can you imagine him doing this?

175
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,240
When did squad leader retire?

176
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,440
It's been half a year.

177
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,640
The day he left,
the scene was impressive.

178
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,720
Many soldiers who used to be
under his lead came to send him off.

179
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,120
-I was shocked.
-There're so many people.

180
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
When I took a closer look,

181
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,480
I realised many of them
are high ranking officers.

182
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,240
Guo.

183
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,760
Why didn't you inform us
when Squad Leader Fan was leaving?

184
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,320
You're busy with training
in Cheetah Commando.

185
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,320
Fan didn't want to disturb you.

186
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,440
Once one has left the regiment,

187
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,080
meeting each other

188
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,640
is difficult.

189
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:08,800
There's always a chance.

190
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,920
That's because

191
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm quitting soon.

192
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,680
I'm serious. I'm quitting soon.

193
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
It's a good thing.

194
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:18,760
We've a deal, okay?

195
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:19,960
I'll organise a party.

196
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,679
Both of you had better
do something impressive for me.

197
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,480
Finally, you're quitting.

198
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,399
That's a good thing.

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,720
I congratulate you in advance.

200
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,600
Three Shells.

201
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,840
You won.

202
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,720
I have a big heart.

203
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm genuinely happy for you.

204
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,360
After all,

205
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,800
all of you are the epitome of the elites

206
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,280
in the armed police force.

207
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,160
Through the drill,

208
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,640
we have discovered the problems.

209
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,840
We'll close the loophole in time.

210
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,640
When the other units
are here for training,

211
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,640
they won't stand a chance
to strike pay dirt.

212
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,560
(Everything for war)
Very well.

213
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:56,560
We'll come again in the future.

214
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,800
(Train like the war is real)
Let's have a fight.

215
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,080
You're always welcome.

216
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,479
Here.

217
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,559
-Let's cheers.
-Cheers.

218
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,719
Here.

219
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:03,799
Yan Po Yue

220
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,960
was the pick
that we intended to nurture.

221
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,960
Then, he joined Cheetah.

222
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,679
The result of the drill

223
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,880
has proven that
we chose the right person.

224
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:10,840
That's right.

225
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,080
In this drill,

226
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,800
Yan Po Yue performed exceptionally well.

227
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,001
Yan Po Yue

228
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,307
lives by individualistic heroism.

229
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,799
No doubt the victory

230
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,560
was because of him

231
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,320
but Cheetah Special Forces

232
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,720
won't rely only on someone

233
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,199
to gain victory.

234
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:31,400
Without him,

235
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,680
we would still win in the drill.

236
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:33,992
Three Shells.

237
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,160
Judging by what you just said,

238
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,480
you're taking the victory for granted.

239
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
My job is to train the soldiers,

240
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,840
but Yan Po Yue

241
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,440
is not good enough.

242
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,840
He's still not good enough?

243
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,360
Don't be too strict to him.

244
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,600
I agree with Three Shells.

245
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,160
He is saying that

246
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,800
Yan Po Yue

247
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,199
could be better.

248
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,320
That's right.

249
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,600
Yan Po Yue

250
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,200
is a strong iron

251
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,960
but I hope he can become a strong steel.

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,924
Now, everyone sees him as a hero

253
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
but I'm going to
give attitude to him on purpose.

254
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,229
Here.

255
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,320
Let's drink.

256
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,360
-Bottoms up!
-Come on.

257
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,680
It may cause bloating.

258
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,017
Guo.

259
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,465
What's wrong with them?

260
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,921
None of them came.

261
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,718
They're so petty!

262
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,320
Who else do you want to see?
Isn't my presence sufficient?

263
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,280
Who do you think you are?

264
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,680
Yan Po Yue.

265
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,600
Xiao Yun Jie.

266
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,320
I propose a toast to you.

267
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:54,080
I thank you.

268
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,040
What for?

269
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,080
Are you thanking us
for eliminating you?

270
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,880
There's always next time.

271
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,240
I'll fight against you again
in the future.

272
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
Fight for what?

273
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,745
I'm

274
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,880
prideful,

275
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,760
competitive,

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
and I have a big ego.

277
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,520
I enjoy wearing
well-ironed military uniform.

278
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,200
I enjoy shinning military badges.

279
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,880
I enjoy being respected by everyone.

280
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,520
I enjoy the sense of accomplishment
during training.

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Since rookie,

282
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
you are always stronger than me.

283
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,400
But I don't concede.

284
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,101
I love competing with you.

285
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,723
Whenever I see you achieve something,
I want it too.

286
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,583
A fair and square competition

287
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,240
that involves hand-to-hand combat

288
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,919
can only happen in the military.

289
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,560
I'll be waiting for you
in Cheetah Special Forces.

290
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,000
Yan Po Yue!

291
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:37,800
Regiment Commander.

292
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,320
Who are you looking for?

293
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,319
Report!

294
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm not looking for anyone.

295
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:47,839
You're not looking for anyone?

296
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,199
Why aren't you sleeping at this hour?

297
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
You're wandering around.

298
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,760
Yet, you said that
you're not looking for anyone.

299
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,399
You're looking
for Ai Qian Xue, aren't you?

300
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,158
Look at you.

301
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:08,119
I thought you're ingenious.

302
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,481
Ai Qian Xue was summoned here for you
on urgent basis.

303
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,600
Since you've returned safely,

304
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,440
she has been sent back to the troop.

305
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,760
Look at you.

306
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Everyone gives face to you.

307
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,760
I didn't do it on purpose.

308
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,160
It doesn't matter

309
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,560
whether you did it on purpose or not.

310
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,599
Through the drill,

311
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,199
more importantly through you,

312
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,644
we've discovered

313
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
many problems in the detachment.

314
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,661
All of us

315
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,841
can learn from each other and improve.

316
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,960
It's good.

317
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,840
We're fighting against our own people.

318
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,360
We had to pretend
that the battle was real.

319
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,040
I had to remind myself repeatedly

320
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
that all of you were my enemies.

321
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,520
When I finally immersed myself
in the battle,

322
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,835
I couldn't tell
if it was a real battle or a drill.

323
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,720
Then, I was brought here

324
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,960
and sat together with everyone else.

325
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,841
But I...

326
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,320
But I was spacing out.

327
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,480
I still believed that all of you

328
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,400
were my enemies.

329
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:16,600
Alright.

330
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
In that case,

331
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,960
let's take a stroll with your enemy.

332
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,480
Yan Po Yue.

333
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,640
Tell me what impressed you the most

334
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,360
in Cheetah Special Forces.

335
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,119
I always tell myself

336
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,001
to be the best.

337
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,760
I want to be number one

338
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,686
and become the best soldier

339
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,440
in the best troop.

340
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
I still live by that principle now.

341
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,720
But as I go,

342
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
I gradually feel that

343
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,120
there is

344
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,200
a wall in front of me.

345
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,159
I don't feel the same.

347
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,800
Hence, I'm unable

348
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,760
to solve the difficulty for you.

349
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,920
But

350
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,999
once, I too,

351
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,920
lived in fear.

352
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,480
I would like to
share the experience with you.

353
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:47,000
For a while,

354
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,361
I was just graduated
from military school

355
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
and joined Regiment 247 as a rookie.

356
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
During that period,

357
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,599
I was struggling.

358
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,588
It felt like

359
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,480
crossing the river
with my eyes blindfolded.

360
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,680
I was completely lost.

361
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,360
The only thing I could do
was to keep going.

362
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,320
Actually,

363
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,160
no one shares the same path.

364
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,920
There is no definite
right and wrong in life.

365
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,520
Only when you hold fast to your dreams,

366
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,679
you'll stand a chance

367
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,039
to correct

368
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,639
and adjust your direction
in the journey.

369
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,640
Later, I discovered that

370
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,640
what matters is not making a choice,

371
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,599
but perseverance.

372
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,120
Hesitance

373
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,361
only invites fear.

374
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,440
Yan Po Yue.

375
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,639
It's okay if you don't get it now.

376
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,199
But always remember,

377
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,600
you must trust yourself and keep going.

378
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,880
One day soon,

379
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,800
you'll make your dream come true.

380
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,561
Do you get it?

381
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,240
Yes!

382
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,480
Come in.

383
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,240
Report.

384
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,440
Captain.

385
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
Were you looking for me?

386
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,400
After you came back,

387
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,880
have you gone for
psychological counselling?

388
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,599
No.

389
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,040
Why didn't you go for it?

390
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:26,880
I don't need counselling.

391
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,119
Yan Po Yue.

392
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,800
Do you think that you're good enough?

393
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,920
Report!

394
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,760
I'll only know the answer
when I get involved in a real battle.

395
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
Do you plan to turn the real battle

396
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,560
into your own show?

397
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,280
I learned how to work with my comrades.

398
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,680
That's not considered
as working with your comrades.

399
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,321
Your comrades were accommodating you

400
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,160
to accomplish
your individualistic heroism

401
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,319
and your winning targets.

402
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,808
Only when you're fighting alone,

403
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,560
you're completely confident
with yourself and unleashed.

404
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,199
Once you have to team up with others,

405
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,239
you feel constrained.

406
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:05,360
Do you really think
that your emotions are well hidden?

407
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,800
Everyone can sense that!

408
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
Comrades...

409
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,960
To you, comrades

410
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,480
are merely tools to pursue success.

411
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,720
That's because your aloofness and pride

412
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,400
are in the blood!

413
00:23:19,753 --> 00:23:21,713
It's not something within your control.

414
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,880
Am I right?

415
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,999
It's a yes

416
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,760
and a no.

417
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,960
Ever since you joined the army,

418
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,800
it just so happened

419
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,000
that you always succeeded every time.

420
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:40,440
Success

421
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,480
keeps growing your confidence.

422
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,519
But there will come a time

423
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,479
when your confidence and pride

424
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,839
will put your comrades in danger.

425
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,640
Behind your victory,

426
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,159
all I can see is your comrades' blood.

427
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,239
The more victories you accumulate,

428
00:23:58,887 --> 00:23:59,846
the more the blood

429
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,560
is shed!

430
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,879
Are you saying all this

431
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,000
just to undermine my self-confidence?

432
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,760
Yan Po Yue.

433
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,040
I don't know how to make you understand.

434
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,120
Before you experience failure,

435
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
you'll never understand.

436
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,880
This is the more reason

437
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
I dare not take you to battle.

438
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,039
I don't have the courage
to verify the truth with real combat.

439
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,880
That's right.

440
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,920
You're in Cheetah Special Forces now.

441
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,481
But as long as you're trained under me,

442
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
you'll remain
at the training ground forever.

443
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,640
Will you concede to it?

444
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,160
Captain.

445
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,200
Are you forcing me to leave?

446
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,760
You're the ace

447
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,360
in all aspects.

448
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,560
I have no reason to drive you away.

449
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,080
If you join the other units,

450
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,120
no one can match you.

451
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,879
When it comes to fighting alone,

452
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,680
Yan Po Yue

453
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,199
is unbeatable.

454
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,520
All right.

455
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,800
Take a week off from training

456
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,080
and free up your mind.

457
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,960
Think about what I said carefully.

458
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,120
(Behind your victory,)

459
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,760
(all I can see is your comrades' blood.)

460
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,719
(The more victories you accumulate,)

461
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,481
(the more blood)

462
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,120
(is shed!)

463
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,639
Where is Mr. Zhang?

464
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,800
It's too hot here.

465
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,520
Mr. Zhang invites you
to a shadier place for a cup of tea.

466
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,720
Sure.

467
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,840
Where are we going?

468
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,360
Mr. Zhang invites only you.

469
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
That's even better.

470
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,680
I earnestly wish
that he would eat me up alive.

471
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,160
Mr. Zhang didn't bring any weapon.

472
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,681
He just wants to enjoy some tea.

473
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,841
Sorry to trouble you.

474
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Please.

475
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,201
Wait for me.

476
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,840
Sure.

477
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,079
Why are you standing?
What are you waiting for?

478
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,680
Are you Mr. Zhang?

479
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,039
Do you have to be asked to sit?

480
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:41,288
I'm thinking where I should sit

481
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,960
so that it's easier for the sniper
to aim at me.

482
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,000
Since you're here,

483
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,120
what is there to be afraid of?

484
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,280
Please sit down.

485
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,320
You have trained your team really well.

486
00:29:06,863 --> 00:29:08,959
Selecting commoners as troops,

487
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
and they are very disciplined.

488
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,640
The previous Mr. Zhang
passed away too soon.

489
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,961
I just follow his way

490
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,960
to make a living for everyone.

491
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,920
The water is boiling.

492
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,880
Have some tea.

493
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,760
Nice tea.

494
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,399
It's my treasured collection.

495
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:53,698
I got it
the first time I killed someone.

496
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,720
Before he died,

497
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,481
he was hugging the jar so tightly.

498
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,481
I only found out after opening the jar

499
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,759
that it contained tea leaves.

500
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,520
There was a key inside the jar.

501
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,440
Do you know what did I open

502
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
with that key?

503
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Let's cut to the chase.

504
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,000
When Mr. Zhang was still alive,

505
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,920
he had a deal with your father.

506
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,640
Just like this piece of cake,

507
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:22,333
the market at the border

508
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,720
belongs to you

509
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,200
while the mainland market

510
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,760
belongs to us.

511
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,840
We

512
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
don't cross each other's boundaries.

513
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,000
Since you are aware of that,

514
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,880
why did you poke your nose
into my business?

515
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,279
My son made the mistake
out of ignorance.

516
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,120
It is the father's fault
if the child is not well taught.

517
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,799
Since the father is no longer here,

518
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,040
who should we put the blame on?

519
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,520
You're right.

520
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,159
I've failed to teach my son.

521
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,079
Here's one million dollars.

522
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,239
It's been laundered.

523
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,839
It's clean.

524
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,080
Thank you

525
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,561
but it's not enough.

526
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,039
How much are you asking for?

527
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,360
It's not about money.

528
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,921
Have you seen your son lately?

529
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,641
He created such a huge mess.

530
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,841
He fled on the day of the incident.

531
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,600
But everyone says

532
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,840
you're hiding him away.

533
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,960
If I had hidden my son,

534
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,920
would I be sitting here talking to you?

535
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,280
If you chances upon my son,

536
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,841
please teach him a lesson.

537
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,280
I've done so.

538
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,560
Help me, mum!

539
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,800
Help!

540
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,840
Mum!

541
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,681
Let go of me!

542
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,520
-Help!
-Release him now.

543
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,200
How much do you want?

544
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,921
Like I said, it's not about money.

545
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,080
What is it about then?

546
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,680
Give up on your market.

547
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,720
It's impossible.

548
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,740
Do you still want to see your son?

549
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,120
Family members shouldn't be implicated
in the wrongdoing of one person.

550
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:39,840
You should know the rules.

551
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Rules need to be reset.

552
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,120
Do you really think
I'm waiting for you here alone?

553
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,719
You don't really think

554
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:57,239
I am here to meet you alone, do you?

555
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,601
My best sniper

556
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,000
is aiming your head with rifle.

557
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,140
He can hear every word

558
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,040
of our conversation.

559
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,239
Tell your sniper
to check out his three o'clock

560
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,833
at the peak of Mount Niutou.

561
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,279
Tell him to see
who's standing at the peak.

562
00:33:27,026 --> 00:33:27,840
Boss.

563
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,760
There is a tree
at the peak of Mount Niutou

564
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,160
with someone tied to it.

565
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,120
His attire is similar to young master's.

566
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,639
I've brought a sniper, too.

567
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,040
He's aiming at your son.

568
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,759
He can hear every word
of our conversation, too.

569
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,240
You have five seconds to consider
whether to agree to my request.

570
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,064
Boss.

571
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,040
Tell him to count to five.

572
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,800
Young Master is the only
bargaining chip they have.

573
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
He won't have the guts
to kill Young Master.

574
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,879
Five.

575
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,960
The first shot
usually serves as a threat.

576
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,760
Four.

577
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,400
If he dares to fire the gun,

578
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,320
I'll find him and kill him.

579
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,080
Three.

580
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,000
Boss, trust me.

581
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,240
Two!

582
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,240
I agree.

583
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,159
Boss, that's not the real young master.

584
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,400
Kill him!

585
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,800
Mi Ya!

586
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,920
Come out now! Kill Xing Tian!

587
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,640
Stop the Red Scorpion member over there.

588
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:52,520
Don't move!

589
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,480
Save me, General!

590
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,000
Release Mr. Zhang.

591
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,840
Your boss is dead

592
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,800
but I really admire you.

593
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,840
Work for me.

594
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,080
I guarantee that you'll
make ten times more

595
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,720
than you did when you
followed that woman.

596
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,680
Do you know how much money I make now?

597
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,159
Can you afford it?

598
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,520
Just name the figure.

599
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
I'm sure I can afford it.

600
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,481
How do I address you?

601
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,839
Xiao Fei Hu.

602
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,961
This is the new arrival.
What do you think?

603
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,080
I'm not interested in this.

604
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,961
What are you interested in?

605
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,159
I'm interested in making money.

606
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,640
You promised me.

607
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,440
Sure.

608
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,920
I'll give you ten times
more than what you earn now.

609
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,440
Thanks.

610
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,120
Tai.

611
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,480
Show Hu the Mengla Route

612
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,880
and hand over the goods to Gui.

613
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,280
From now on,
Hu will be in charge of this route.

614
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,680
Hu.

615
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,800
It took us a lot of effort
to open up the route.

616
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,760
To prevent troubles,

617
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,040
don't bring any weapon.

618
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,961
If it's necessary,

619
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,879
I'd rather lose the goods

620
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,880
than expose the route.

621
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,000
Got it.

622
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,600
Tai.

623
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,680
Hu is new here.

624
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:48,600
Take care of him when you're out there.

625
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,720
The goods are a great deal.

626
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,520
Can you entrust it to them?

627
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,880
It's powder now

628
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,880
but it will turn into something else
when they board the ship.

629
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,960
The border of China is intense.

630
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,880
We need to create some chaos

631
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,880
to distract the China's military

632
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,399
so that we can deliver the real goods.

633
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,041
You and I

634
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,240
will travel Mengla Route together.

635
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,080
My goodness.

636
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,800
Hurry up.

637
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:33,360
Am I in the right room?

638
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,719
What are you doing?

639
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,000
Are you doing charity?

640
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,479
I'm free.

641
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,600
That's why I'm helping my comrades out.

642
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,799
Is it not allowed?

643
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,875
Of course it's allowed.

644
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
He's done a good job.

645
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
What happened? Did you see Captain?

646
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,240
What did he tell you?

647
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,081
I'm given a break.
I'll stop training for a week.

648
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,320
Is everything okay?

649
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,800
Yes.

650
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,159
It's just a break.

651
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,480
I envy you.

652
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:05,685
Please clean these shoes I'm wearing.

653
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,080
Sure. Remove your shoes.

654
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,120
Go away.

655
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,077
Leave him alone.

656
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:09,999
I'm just kidding.

657
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,280
Let's take a shower.

658
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,120
Are you really okay?

659
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:21,400
What can happen to me?

660
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,080
Don't think too much.

661
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,520
Yan Po Yue, someone calls you!

662
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,720
Coming!

663
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,201
Hello.

664
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:39,560
(Guess who am I?)

665
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,560
Lu Xiao Tian!

666
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,360
(How could you recognise my voice?)

667
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,520
(You know me the best!)

668
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,560
That's enough.

669
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:47,320
Where are you?

670
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,880
(I'm on a coach.)

671
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,840
(I will be in the county where
you are based tomorrow.)

672
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,000
(Tomorrow is weekend.)

673
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,200
(Can you come out?)

674
00:40:53,399 --> 00:40:54,239
Yes.

675
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,919
(What about Xiao?)

676
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,280
Xiao has to apply for leave.

677
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,439
(Sure. As long as
one of you can make it)

678
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,080
(and take back what I brought you.)

679
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,880
Sure.

680
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,720
Be safe!

681
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,439
It's a happy day.

682
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,679
Will you smile?

683
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,040
Can you feel it?

684
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,439
I didn't even go home first after
I was discharged from the army.

685
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:14,840
I came to visit you instead.

686
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,920
Why did you quit so fast?

687
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,720
It's been two years, Strongest Yan.

688
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,640
I've grown taller.

689
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,200
Time flies when you're in
Cheetah Special Forces.

690
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,959
You have no idea how
slowly time passes in reality.

691
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,760
I didn't know you're leaving in a rush.

692
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,520
This one...

693
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,360
Don't do that. Take it away.

694
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,160
What a realistic present.

695
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,520
Open it.

696
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,400
The figurine is quite good-looking.

697
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,800
You've grown up too in two years.

698
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:51,919
Unlike Xiao,

699
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,439
he didn't prepare me any present.
How heartless.

700
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,521
Xiao got you a present too.

701
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm not used to him being so nice to me.

702
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,508
Goodness.

703
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,080
Here.

704
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,960
Let me read it for you.

705
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,440
It's not something nice.

706
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,920
You don't say.

707
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,000
That lad looks rough on the outside

708
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,720
but his handwriting is quite nice.

709
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,920
All right.

710
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,760
Since he doesn't have the luck
to eat nice food today,

711
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,160
you may eat some on his behalf.

712
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,879
I have received my demobilisation pay.

713
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Just order away. We can even
order everything on the menu.

714
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,875
Let the three of us enjoy the feast.

715
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,960
Enjoy the feast! It's a happy day!
