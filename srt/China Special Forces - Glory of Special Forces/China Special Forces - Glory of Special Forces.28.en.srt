major literary and artistic project)

(Camouflage Reconnaissance Training)
(Camouflage reconnaissance training.)

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,323
(Candidates will form a three-man squad)

6
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
(and proceed 300m under camouflage)

7
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:41,276
(in 30 minutes)

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,160
(and arrive at the firing line.)

9
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,920
(You are to read the six numbers
above the observer)

10
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,120
(and shoot two targets.)

11
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,800
(Beware.)

12
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,400
(There will be six observers
for this mission.)

13
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,136
Later, we'll split up
and infiltrate the area.

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,222
We can rendezvous here.

15
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,160
I object.

16
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,680
Bai, that area is
filled with greeneries.

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,041
There's even a slope down there.

18
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,080
It's the best place for us
to hide and retreat.

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,920
Our goal is to read the numbers
on the instructor's sign.

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,720
This is the best location for us.

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,520
I've considered that location too.

22
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,160
But there are fewer greeneries here.

23
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:10,746
And, they have many observers.

24
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,640
Our location is easily exposed.

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,160
Don't forget, we need to dry fire twice.

26
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Just follow my plan for now.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
Captain, Vice-captain.

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,120
You guys will do the dry firing.

29
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,080
I'll read the numbers
on the instructor's sign.

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,320
Captain,
you all have reached the 270m mark.

31
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,745
Okay. Spread out and hide.
Prepare for dry firing.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,880
Remember, if an emergency happens,

33
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:52,641
you should continue the mission.

34
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,130
I will draw fire away from you.

35
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,007
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:57,713
01,

37
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,600
take 20 steps towards your 12 o'clock.

38
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:01,043
04,

39
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:03,009
take 15 steps towards your 2 o'clock.

40
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,530
Sir, there's no discovery here.

41
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:16,395
Sir, there's no discovery here.

42
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:17,753
03, take 30 steps ahead.

43
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,729
Sir, there's no discovery here.

44
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:31,112
04, take 4 steps towards
your 10 o'clock.

45
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:35,951
Sir, there's no discovery here.

46
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:40,161
04, take 15 steps towards
your 2 o'clock.

47
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:46,833
Sir, there's no discovery here.

48
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:58,023
05, take 25 steps towards your North.

49
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:05,305
01, 02, approach the firing line.

50
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:27,818
Six,

51
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,241
three,

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,360
five,

53
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,400
four,

54
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,440
two...

55
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,360
What's the matter?

56
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
I can't read the last number clearly.

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,400
Let me move to another location.

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,401
Stay right there!

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,520
Bai!

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
03, 04, move towards your 9 o'clock.

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
05, 07, move towards your 6 o'clock.

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,920
Three!

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
Six, three, five, four, two, three!

64
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,720
It's a success!

65
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,560
Captain, mission accomplished!

66
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,800
Your men have entered
the booby trap zone.

67
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:24,680
Mission failed.

68
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:26,240
Your men have been killed.

69
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,120
That's impossible.

70
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,592
The person covering your back
stepped into the booby trap zone.

71
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,679
Your booby traps are
not challenging at all.

72
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,330
You want to kill enemies with them?

73
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:38,636
Captain.

74
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,600
Next time, remember to
set up more of them.

75
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:43,634
If not, there's no challenge at all.

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,401
I've disarmed all of them.

77
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:48,945
There should be no casualty, right?

78
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:50,369
Your squad

79
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:51,585
has passed the test.

80
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:53,976
Captain,

81
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:56,200
aren't you too quick in disarming them?

82
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,480
You're an expert indeed.

83
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,359
I've trained myself before.

84
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,160
Captain.

85
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:00,400
Come.

86
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:05,106
Seems like booby traps
are right up your alley.

87
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:22,673
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:25,545
It's useless for you to tell me that.

89
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,359
It's not useless!

90
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
It's not useless.

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,240
Will it make sure that you won't
commit that stupid mistake again

92
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,200
if you have a second chance?

93
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,079
You knew this as well! I was
damaged by a landmine when I was young!

94
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,640
I was terrified of landmines
when I joined the squad!

95
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,384
When I stepped on one,
I was dumbfounded.

96
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,519
I was standing there
like a useless fool!

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,080
I couldn't even move an inch!

98
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:51,627
I regret it!

99
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
Back then, if I weren't that terrified,

100
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,875
if I knew how to disarm a landmine,

101
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,360
if I weren't that useless,

102
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,160
does that mean Fei wouldn't need to die?

103
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,080
It's been three years,

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
nine months, and five days!

105
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,320
I have never forgotten about it!

106
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,040
I forced myself to study
landmines every day!

107
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,120
You said it was useless,

108
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:14,520
but I think that's not true!

109
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
I think it's useful for me
to apologise to you all!

110
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,279
I think it's useful

111
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,693
as long as I can contribute
something to the squad!

112
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,560
That's all I can do now!

113
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,440
(Final assessment: Rescue the hostage
and take him to the designated place)

114
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:02,520
(Time: 30 minutes)
(Location: Abandoned chemical plant)

115
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:03,960
(Number of enemies: Unknown)

116
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,800
(Judgment: If the hostage or any member
of the squad dies, it will be a fail)

117
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,000
(The squad has arrived at
the designated location.)

118
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,480
(Please give us your instruction.)

119
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,480
This is the final assessment.

120
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,040
It's a hostage rescue mission.

121
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,272
Begin your mission.

122
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,560
Yes, sir. We will begin.

123
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,640
The goal of this mission

124
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,800
is to rescue the hostage successfully

125
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,600
and extract from the scene.

126
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,519
During the mission,

127
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,880
if the hostage dies, you will fail.

128
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,560
If you didn't bring the hostage to
the mark within 30 minutes,

129
00:08:47,616 --> 00:08:48,360
you will fail.

130
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,280
If any one of you dies,
you will fail the mission.

131
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:18,919
Move out!

132
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,639
Let's go!

133
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
Group B, sniper ahead!

134
00:09:57,315 --> 00:09:58,554
The bullet came from
the tower's direction.

135
00:09:58,713 --> 00:09:59,472
There's a sniper ahead.

136
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:01,321
(Bai Long, follow our plan.)

137
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,960
(Lead Group B, head to the location
given to us by our informant)

138
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,001
(and eliminate the enemy sniper.)

139
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,600
(Provide Group A with cover)

140
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,039
(and UAV monitoring.)

141
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,800
Roger that.

142
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,400
Cover me with a smoke bomb.

143
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,251
Yes, sir.

144
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,072
Move out!

145
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,000
Target location confirmed.

146
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,800
Flashbang incoming!

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,960
The main route has been exposed.

148
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
Group B,
please clear them out immediately.

149
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,040
(Group A,)

150
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:12,459
(take Route One)

151
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:13,599
(and head towards the warehouse.)

152
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,400
Yes, sir.

153
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,478
We will clear them out immediately.

154
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,001
Move out!

155
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,720
Retreat!

156
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,000
(Bai Long!)

157
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,760
(Group A is under heavy fire!)

158
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,760
Requesting backup!

159
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,496
Roger that!

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
Head to high ground and cover Group A!

161
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,600
Go!

162
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:51,226
Don't shoot!

163
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,360
We're just lab assistants.

164
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,680
We aren't terrorists!

165
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,080
Reloading!

166
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,560
Captain, I'll deal with the two
in front of us.

167
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,280
Cover me!

168
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,040
No!

169
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:11,944
There are too many of them.

170
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,367
We'll fail our mission
if one of us dies.

171
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,480
What should we do then?
Should we just stay here?

172
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,840
The situation has changed!

173
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,814
Xu Yang, activate the UAV

174
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,760
and scout the terrain!

175
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,560
Yes, sir!

176
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,280
Seems like it's not going well for them.

177
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,911
I've blocked their escape path
and surrounded them.

178
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,320
I'll see where they can escape to.

179
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,960
This is a despicable move.

180
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,119
How could you say that?

181
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:39,400
Do you think enemies
nowadays are brainless?

182
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,760
Do you think they'll stand there
and wait for their assault?

183
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
You didn't stop the operation
even though it was wrong from the start.

184
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:44,817
These fellows

185
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:49,400
think that they have good chemistry
and trust among themselves.

186
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,920
I want them to know

187
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,520
that a tiny mistake

188
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,600
can cause the demise of
the entire squad.

189
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,400
It's the same sniper.

190
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,640
We may have entered
the wrong building from the start.

191
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:17,337
I saw the same marking

192
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,280
provided by the informant
in the other building too.

193
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,861
Qin Feng,

194
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,800
he's a sly old fox indeed.

195
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:28,720
He's pretty daring, isn't he?

196
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
How dare he insult his leader?

197
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,557
Did you two hear that?

198
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,531
-Captain.
-Speak.

199
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,400
Currently, Group B cannot
provide us with any cover.

200
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,960
Please assist us to eliminate
the enemy sniper.

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,960
We're in a disadvantageous position.
We can only stay passive.

202
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,840
Both groups, gather at Point C.

203
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,280
Yue Kong, Guo Xiao Xiao,
head to Point C's vantage point

204
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
and eliminate the enemy sniper.

205
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
-Roger that!
-Roger that!

206
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,721
Xu Yang, provide cover!

207
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,879
To your 2 o'clock.

208
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,840
Three, two, one, move out.

209
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:13,799
To your 11 o'clock!

210
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:15,977
To your 12 o'clock!

211
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:17,622
To your 5 o'clock!

212
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:19,316
To your 4 o'clock!

213
00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:21,154
To your 1 o'clock!

214
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:24,291
To your 11 o'clock!

215
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,424
Cover him!

216
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,640
It's just an assessment,

217
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,120
yet all of the department leaders
are here.

218
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,960
Something seems amiss.

219
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,480
Captain, it's disadvantageous for us
to engage in a street fight.

220
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,440
We have to rush into the warehouse
and save the hostage.

221
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:53,960
If this continues,

222
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,121
we'll run out of time!

223
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,760
You guys can stay here.

224
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,665
Yan Po Yue and I will
storm the warehouse.

225
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,000
After that, you guys can
bring the injured there.

226
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,720
No!

227
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:04,930
The situation is different from
the intel provided by our informant.

228
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,840
We have to observe the situation!

229
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,400
We'll fail if you hesitate any longer!

230
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,840
You'll kill everyone if you do this!

231
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,720
Xiao Yun Jie, provide cover.

232
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,480
Xu Yang, support Mu Qing.

233
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,560
Move out!

234
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,880
They're doing pretty good as a squad.

235
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:40,119
But under such suppressive fire,

236
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,561
they're caught in a dilemma.

237
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,319
So what if they're doing well?

238
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,040
They're doomed to fail

239
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,720
since they used the wrong strategy.

240
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,239
It isn't entirely their fault
for the misjudgment.

241
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,280
They didn't make
the necessary preparations.

242
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,640
And they didn't verify the intel.

243
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,719
Don't tell me that's my fault?

244
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
They're still inexperienced.

245
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:58,760
They can't compare with
an old fox like you.

246
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:00,520
That's why

247
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,040
I've told them time and time again.

248
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:03,732
If they don't think hard enough,

249
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:05,560
they will die on the battlefield.

250
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:26,428
Xu Yang, Mu Qing, guard the entrance.

251
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:27,059
Yes, sir!

252
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,520
Bai Long, Yan Po Yue, flank the left.

253
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:29,720
Xiao Yun Jie and I will flank the right.

254
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:30,680
Yes, sir.

255
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:31,480
Move out.

256
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,760
We found the hostage.

257
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,240
They still succeeded.

258
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,161
Who told you that?

259
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,840
Did you verify the hostage's identity?

260
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:42,748
You guys have failed.

261
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,600
Yue Kong,

262
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,680
you guys have lost.

263
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,681
Why did we fail?

264
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
You guys must be out of your mind!

265
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,160
Why are you shooting us
when the mission is over?

266
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,280
Yue Kong, you've failed
to keep your emotions in check.

267
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,160
Now, another two
of your squadmates are dead.

268
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:24,392
For this simulation exercise,

269
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:26,440
16 enemies were killed.

270
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:27,600
Nine enemies

271
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:28,839
were injured.

272
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,601
There were six casualties

273
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
on our side!

274
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,040
You guys have failed

275
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,320
to rescue the hostage.

276
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:37,200
You guys have failed

277
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,320
to extract from the mission.

278
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,680
Overall,

279
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:41,000
you guys have failed your mission!

280
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,840
The mighty Cheetah Commando

281
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,426
actually tried to complete
a suicide mission?

282
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:57,066
How dare you guys still come back?

283
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:01,563
Later, pack up your things

284
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:03,120
and leave the army!

285
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:05,392
Sir!

286
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:08,480
Is there anything else for you to say?

287
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,400
The assessment
was problematic in the first place!

288
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:13,080
The intel we had received was fake!

289
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,320
This rarely happens
during real operations!

290
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,079
You still have the guts to say that?

291
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,240
Giving you the wrong intel
was part of the assessment itself.

292
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,760
You guys acted recklessly without
analysing it thoroughly.

293
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,479
I assumed the intel would be true!

294
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,160
You assumed?

295
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,479
Do you have the right
to be their captain?

296
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,200
How many missions have we been through?

297
00:24:34,282 --> 00:24:36,920
Wasn't verifying the intel
our utmost priority?

298
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,680
Yes, sir! It's my fault!

299
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,880
As their captain,

300
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
I didn't prepare
our strategic deployment well!

301
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,600
Captain, please don't punish them!

302
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,880
Punish me instead!

303
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:47,760
They failed because of my misjudgement!

304
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,440
Do you think you're the only one
who had misjudged the situation?

305
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,880
All of you

306
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:55,760
are responsible for this!

307
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:59,440
You guys had committed
three serious mistakes.

308
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:02,760
First,

309
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:05,200
you believed in others too easily.

310
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,080
You believed in the intel that
the informant had provided

311
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:09,489
without verifying it yourself.

312
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,640
In real operations,

313
00:25:11,873 --> 00:25:13,840
we will encounter
all sorts of fake intel.

314
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,280
Our enemies would
even try to lure us with fake intel.

315
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,360
So, we must

316
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,600
verify every intel that we receive.

317
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,960
Second, you underestimated your enemies.

318
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:26,120
All of you

319
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,400
thought that you were good with firearms

320
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:29,680
and good at combat.

321
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,600
Can you fight 1 to 100?

322
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,840
We're facing armed forces.

323
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:36,520
If you guys can do well
in these aspects,

324
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:37,840
so can they.

325
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
They train just as hard as you guys.

326
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Their weapons and equipment might be
more advanced than yours.

327
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:43,920
They might be more prepared
than you guys.

328
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,920
All of them are thirsty for blood

329
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,800
and they don't care about their lives.

330
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,760
That's why we have to be cautious

331
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,599
in every decision we make.

332
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,400
We cannot afford to act recklessly.

333
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,960
Third, you behaved frivolously!

334
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,040
The camera recorded the entire process.

335
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,360
Yan Po Yue,

336
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,280
why didn't you verify
the hostage's identity

337
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:12,604
when you were saving her?

338
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,240
Do you think she's a hostage
just because she's a pitiful woman?

339
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:18,600
Did you see her face clearly?

340
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,320
Why didn't you confirm her identity
by checking the picture?

341
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,720
And, where were you looking?

342
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,320
Our enemies will use
all kinds of ways to allure us.

343
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,680
They can pretend to be hostages,

344
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:39,206
commoners,

345
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,840
even your mother!

346
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,440
We must never let down our guard.

347
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,800
We must never commit any mistake!

348
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,840
Sir!

349
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:47,760
Speak!

350
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,720
I request another attempt!

351
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,480
Another attempt?

352
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:57,240
Do you think you can find
the king of the underworld

353
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,880
and request another attempt at life

354
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,800
after dying on the battlefield?

355
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,466
-Captain.
-What?

356
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,840
Captain,

357
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:05,440
calm down.

358
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:10,338
There are eight members here, you know?

359
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,716
We can't just send all of them home.

360
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,400
Moreover, Bai Long
and Cao Ben are among them too.

361
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:16,880
Veterans like them

362
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,440
who think they're experienced

363
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,040
are the reasons why
they underestimated their enemies!

364
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,720
Sir.

365
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,200
We failed our mission

366
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,520
mainly because of me.

367
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,880
Captain, please give us another chance.

368
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,120
Treat it as if you're giving
the new guys another chance.

369
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,239
If we fail again, I will retire
of my own accord

370
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,999
and never join Cheetah Commando again.

371
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,400
Cao Ben, do you think
this will help them out?

372
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,840
Do you think you'll take
the same assessment again?

373
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,560
It'll only get harder!

374
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,360
All footage of today's assessment

375
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,520
are in the computer.

376
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,640
The floor plan of the training ground
is on the table too.

377
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,840
You guys will take
the assessment again tomorrow.

378
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,960
You guys can use these facilities today.

379
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,520
Use them to the fullest.

380
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:20,393
Dismissed!

381
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,440
(Make-up assessment: Rescue hostage held
by drug dealer on informant's intel)

382
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,360
(Time: 30 minutes)
(Location: Cement factory)

383
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,880
(Number of enemies: Unknown)

384
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,720
(Judgment: If the hostage or any member
of the squad dies, it will be a fail)

385
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,280
Yue Kong, eliminate the enemy sniper

386
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,239
and conquer the vantage point!

387
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,199
Roger that!

388
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,480
The sniper on the roof
has been eliminated.

389
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,080
Move out!

390
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,760
Let's go!

391
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,720
Let's go!

392
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,400
Let's go!

393
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,120
They didn't stay there
for too long this time.

394
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:17,720
They're launching a feint attack.

395
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Things will be difficult
for our snipers.

396
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Today is a make-up assessment.

397
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,240
There's nothing to be excited about.

398
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,651
Xu Yang!

399
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,560
Bai Long, go! Mu Qing, cover him!

400
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,920
Let's go!

401
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,038
Xu Yang, Mu Qing, guard the entrance.

402
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,040
Yes, sir!

403
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:29,000
Yan, when did you learn that?

404
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:30,195
You looked so cool just now.

405
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,039
He's asking for it.

406
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,280
Look.

407
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,400
He didn't change his bad habit.

408
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:39,859
If they fail again,

409
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:42,640
I would've locked them up for nothing.

410
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,360
Save me!

411
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,840
Save me!

412
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,880
Save me!

413
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,640
Save me!

414
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:21,400
Hostage identity confirmed.

415
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,200
Defuse the bomb!

416
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,039
Save me!

417
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:28,080
Save me!

418
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,513
The vest is stuck onto my body!

419
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
I can't move!

420
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,120
Help!

421
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,640
Help!

422
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,240
Help! Save me!

423
00:36:56,218 --> 00:36:57,320
Help!

424
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,560
Xu Yang, Mu Qing, cover us!

425
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,160
Save me!

426
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:18,840
Reloading!

427
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,760
Roger that!

428
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,040
Reloading!

429
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:31,213
Hurry!

430
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,440
It's going to blow!

431
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:56,480
That's more like it.

432
00:37:57,682 --> 00:37:58,600
Not bad.

433
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:00,200
It's time to increase the difficulty.

434
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:05,792
Save me!

435
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:09,153
Search for the switch!

436
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,401
We're running out of time!

437
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:12,880
Save me!

438
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:16,042
Help!

439
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,800
Save me!

440
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:22,514
Save me!

441
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:25,010
I'm going to die!

442
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,920
Don't move!

443
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,920
-We're running out of time!
-Bomb defused!

444
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,800
-Yan, hurry!
-Save me!

445
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,721
Hurry! We're running out of time!

446
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,319
Hurry! Save me!

447
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:55,978
Yue Kong, Guo Xiao Xiao,

448
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,371
we've secured the hostage.
Preparing for evacuation.

449
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,120
Let's go.

450
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
(We just received the newest intel.)

451
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,280
(The leader of the drug cartel)

452
00:39:06,392 --> 00:39:07,552
(is hiding within the same building.)

453
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,760
(I order you guys to begin
a search for him immediately.)

454
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:11,640
(The mission objective has changed.)

455
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,239
(You guys only have eight minutes.)

456
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,120
After eight minutes,

457
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,000
the entire factory will explode.

458
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:18,720
If you don't complete your objective
and make it out,

459
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,960
you will fail your mission.

460
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,640
Was that a hidden mission?

461
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,720
Even I haven't heard of it before.

462
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,840
I was afraid that
you might leak it to them.

463
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:32,880
So,

464
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:34,577
where did you hide
the drug cartel leader?

465
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,240
We don't have any footage of him.

466
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:37,920
I don't know either.

467
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,200
Take a guess.

468
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,010
The trickier it is, the better.

469
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,634
You're an old fox indeed.

470
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,840
What should we do?

471
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,040
Should we split up and search?

472
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,761
No.

473
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,240
The area is too huge.

474
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:51,418
And we don't have much time.

475
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
If we split up,

476
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,240
we might be wiped out.

477
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:58,000
Do you know where the target is?

478
00:39:58,914 --> 00:39:59,873
I don't know anything.

479
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:16,711
Captain,

480
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:21,403
below us.

481
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,440
One,

482
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,400
two, three!

483
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,360
So, are they trying to guard against me?

484
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,560
They learned it from you, you know?

485
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,800
They're giving you
a taste of your own medicine.

486
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,200
Captain.

487
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,840
Let's go!
