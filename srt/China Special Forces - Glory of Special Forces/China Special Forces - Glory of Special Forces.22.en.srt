(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,200
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,946
(Episode 22)

4
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:40,803
Brat,

5
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:44,464
you were still playing with mud
when I was a soldier.

6
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:51,018
Can you still fight?

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,721
Come on.

8
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:06,800
Yan.

9
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:08,984
Can you still fight?

10
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:13,763
Lock him down!

11
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,520
You can still fight?

12
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,121
Bring it on.

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,520
Come on.

14
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:30,960
Do you need me to help you up? Come on.

15
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,520
Yan Po Yue, hang in there!

16
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:13,791
He won!

17
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,440
Yan, you won!

18
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,160
You won!

19
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,825
You won!

20
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:28,978
I have something to say.

21
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,086
At ease.

22
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:34,204
First, I would like
to congratulate you guys

23
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,106
for passing the toughest,

24
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,040
most brutal,

25
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:38,802
most cruel,

26
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:40,297
and most inhumane torture training

27
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:41,422
of the special forces.

28
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:42,436
I believe

29
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:46,117
you guys will remember
this experience forever.

30
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,811
But at the same time, I hope
you guys can remember this.

31
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:49,418
Loyalty

32
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,177
is the baseline of
every military operation.

33
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,179
In the future, no matter what kind
of situation you get yourself into,

34
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:56,537
you need to defend it with your life.

35
00:03:57,084 --> 00:03:57,883
Do you remember that?

36
00:03:58,144 --> 00:03:59,144
Yes, sir!

37
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,249
Do you remember that?

38
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:01,791
Yes, sir!

39
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,361
Medical officer, get into position.

40
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:16,113
Ouch!

41
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,098
Doctor, go easy on him.
He's afraid of pain.

42
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,679
He's a member of the special forces,
yet he's afraid of pain?

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,679
Doctor, you may not know,

44
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:26,462
but that training was...

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,923
You mean the torture training?
We do them every year.

46
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:30,809
Was everyone okay?

47
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:31,968
What could happen to them?

48
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Those are just scratches.

49
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:36,547
Weren't you guys rolling on the ground
while being dragged by a vehicle?

50
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,565
The veterans cleaned up the path
before the training.

51
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:41,265
There were no obstacles on that path.

52
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,959
The veterans tested the path themselves.
It's 100% safe.

53
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,480
As for the other training programmes,

54
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,640
they were only implemented
after strict testing and evaluation.

55
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:49,439
So, the torture you've received

56
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,920
affects your mental state
way more than your physical state.

57
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,280
Most people were just frightened
out of their mind.

58
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,072
So, that's the case.

59
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:01,640
I'm done with your diagnosis.
You're fine.

60
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,519
-We'll keep you here for observation.
-Okay.

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
-Next.
-Okay.

62
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,399
Xiao, it's your turn.

63
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,399
I think I feel much better
after hearing the doctor's words.

64
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,799
Please come in.

65
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,600
-Xiao Xiao.
-Captain Leng.

66
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:21,880
Captain Leng.

67
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:23,000
Lie down.

68
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't get up.

69
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,280
What are you doing here?

70
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,048
How are you?

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I feel fine. I think I'll be fine
after resting for a few days.

72
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:34,631
Please have a seat, Captain Leng.

73
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:40,040
Xiao Xiao,

74
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,360
although you haven't
fully recovered yet,

75
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,688
I still need to remind you this.

76
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,080
In the Cheetah Special Forces,

77
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,041
women need to work harder than men.

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
We might even have
to endure more hardships

79
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,560
to carve a place for ourselves
within the team.

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,280
It's especially true for
the border area combat team.

81
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm not afraid.

82
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:00,647
I believe I can overcome
all of the obstacles.

83
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,200
Although men are strong,

84
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:04,520
women are both strong and delicate.

85
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm confident in myself.

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,280
What is this?

87
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,297
It's nothing.

88
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,160
I just made it for fun.

89
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,880
Whom did you make this for?

90
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,040
No one. I made it as I was too bored.

91
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
Fine, I'll stop interrogating you.

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,360
You'd better get yourself examined.

93
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,040
You're seriously injured.

94
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,079
You didn't expect this, did you?
That we could see each other again?

95
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:45,920
Have you got yourself examined?

96
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,960
I have.

97
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,600
That's good.

98
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm planning to return to our company.

99
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,327
Do you have any message
for our squad leader?

100
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:01,736
Wish him

101
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:03,680
a smooth journey for me.

102
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:04,840
Okay.

103
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,320
I'll relay the message to him.

104
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,720
I have something to tell you.

105
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:16,865
Actually,

106
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,160
I was planning to leave
after Gao Zhun was eliminated.

107
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,543
I stayed

108
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:23,960
because I wanted to prove
that I was just as good as the others.

109
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:28,313
What are you trying to say?

110
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,280
This is what I want to say.

111
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,519
Everyone has their own hope

112
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,834
for enlisting in the military.

113
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,040
Some of them wish to
get into military schools.

114
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,920
Some of them wish to learn new skills.

115
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,800
Some of them wish to prove themselves,
just like you.

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,040
Before this, I was sure that I could be
an excellent special forces soldier.

117
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,040
But after the torture training,

118
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:52,880
I realised

119
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,199
that on the battlefield of
special forces where all is fair,

120
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,280
it's highly likely that I might
drag my teammates down.

121
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,360
As for me,

122
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,769
from now on, I just wish

123
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:23,362
to make more buddies

124
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:25,960
so that we can look after one another.

125
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,720
I think I'll stick to being
the vice squad leader.

126
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,720
As for the special forces,

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,440
I think it's more suitable
for people like you, Yan Po Yue.

128
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,240
It's fine.

129
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,191
Actually, I'm quite envious of you.

130
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,800
I'm serious.

131
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,520
Not everyone is like you.

132
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,401
You're talented, lucky,

133
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,880
and handsome.

134
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
You have a...

135
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
How do I put it?

136
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,360
You have an unstoppable drive.

137
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:30,642
I believe

138
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,801
that you can become
the best soldier in the future.

139
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,719
I will never be wrong about that.

140
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,520
Thanks.

141
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:47,658
But no matter how strong you are,

142
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:50,794
you're still a soldier.

143
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,049
I just want to be a soldier

144
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:00,778
and fulfil my duty.

145
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:07,528
Goodbye, Yan Po Yue.

146
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:10,825
Although you have one less rival now,

147
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,520
you will encounter more in the future.

148
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,919
Why are you guys here?

149
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,361
Boss Chuan invited
Daddy Kun here for a meal.

150
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,320
Only three people can go up.

151
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,479
Godfather.

152
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:19,360
Xing Tian, Miya,
the three of us will go.

153
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,200
-Big Boss.
-Daddy Kun.

154
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,200
Long time no see. Seems like
your business is booming.

155
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,160
I was just trying to make a living.
I'm no match for you.

156
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,680
Daddy Kun, please take a seat.

157
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,479
Okay.

158
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,679
Daddy Kun,

159
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:53,497
how many kids
do you wish to buy this time?

160
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:57,640
Do you still care about
that unprofitable business?

161
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,200
It's my old trade, you know?

162
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,986
I heard that you started
a new business in China.

163
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,560
You were selling decent stuff
for an excellent price, huh?

164
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,600
Daddy Kun, you do your business
around the border area

165
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,280
while I sell them to the mainland.

166
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
There's no conflict between us, right?

167
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:11,968
That's fine.

168
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,440
I was just curious
about your new business.

169
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,559
Daddy Kun, you...

170
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,640
You see, when you do business,
you buy and sell things.

171
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,960
Hurry and bring us
some of the new stuff.

172
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Daddy Kun, you look pretty energetic.

173
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,960
I guess so.

174
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:05,116
It's decent.

175
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,630
Daddy Kun, we've been trading
with each other for so many years.

176
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,200
The price is negotiable
if we work out a long-term partnership.

177
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,840
Of course we will work out
a long-term partnership.

178
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,480
Hurry, prepare the goods for Daddy Kun.

179
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,720
No need for that.

180
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,761
You guys are crossing us?

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,601
Who told you to be so greedy?

182
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:38,744
Someone is paying huge money
to open a path into the mainland.

183
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,608
How dare you try to
steal our business in the mainland?

184
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:45,080
Daddy Kun, please spare me
on account of our bond.

185
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,719
I'll give you everything I have.

186
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,679
Do you think I need you
to give me the things I desire?

187
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,959
Daddy Kun, we've found
both the goods and the man.

188
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,802
So, were you the one

189
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:00,514
who developed the new type of meth?

190
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:03,913
Very good.

191
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,321
-I have no use for him.
-Daddy Kun! Don't go!

192
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,401
Daddy Kun, please spare me!

193
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:12,697
Daddy Kun, please!

194
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,000
Daddy Kun, come back!

195
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,039
Daddy Kun!

196
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,160
I...

197
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,560
Tie up the loose ends.

198
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,388
Take it!

199
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:21,897
Right face!

200
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,160
Quick march!

201
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,163
Halt!

202
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,360
Right face!

203
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,512
The ceremony

204
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,640
will begin now!

205
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:48,400
Salute!

206
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:51,240
End of salutation!

207
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,000
Right face!

208
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:54,720
Quick march!

209
00:15:58,684 --> 00:15:59,843
From today onward,

210
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,560
you guys will be a part of the
Cheetah Special Forces officially.

211
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:04,200
Remember my words.

212
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:06,446
As a member of the special forces,
you have to be brave.

213
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,600
When you have to risk your life,

214
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:09,320
it's all or nothing.

215
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,160
But when you're on the battlefield,

216
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,163
your priority

217
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:15,080
isn't to sacrifice yourself
for a just cause.

218
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:16,793
Your priority is to complete the mission

219
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:18,440
and return here alive.

220
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:20,575
You all may have been through

221
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:22,360
many years of training
on the training ground,

222
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:24,240
but no matter how hard you train

223
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:25,680
or how strong you look,

224
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:27,736
you all are still new recruits.

225
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:30,359
You all have to survive
operations after operations

226
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,759
and accumulate
practical experience bit by bit

227
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,080
until you become a veteran.

228
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,320
You need to transform your ferocity
into slyness

229
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,081
and ruthlessness.

230
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,000
If you're alone, you'll have
to fight alone for thousands of miles.

231
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,280
If you're together, you're undefeatable.

232
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,320
In the end,

233
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,720
you guys will bring honour
and military merits back home.

234
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:50,218
That's the true Cheetah!

235
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:52,673
That's the soldier I want!

236
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:54,978
Understood?

237
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,200
Yes, sir!

238
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,559
Everybody!

239
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,479
Attention!

240
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,040
Left incline!

241
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,840
Cheetahs, repeat after me!

242
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,319
I'm a member of the most elite unit
of the armed forces!

243
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,800
The badge on my chest
represents my honour!

244
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,480
We're members of the most elite unit

245
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,239
of the armed forces!

246
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,960
The badges on our chests
represent our honour!

247
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:30,720
(On top of an unknown mountain,)

248
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,680
(we polished our killing skills.)

249
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,400
(We might never get the chance
to be mobilised)

250
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,888
(and fight for our country.)

251
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,920
(We might not accumulate)

252
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,760
(any military merits until the day
we retire from the military.)

253
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:50,240
(When people ask us
about our achievements in the military,)

254
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,560
(we will answer them in silence.)

255
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,360
(It's because the duty of a soldier)

256
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,480
(is to sweat profusely in
the training ground.)

257
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,651
(If we achieve victories in our drills,)

258
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:05,612
(that could only mean that
our training went well.)

259
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,058
(Just like the nuclear weapons)

260
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,240
(in the armoury that we will never use,)

261
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,400
(some of them were
already stored for several decades.)

262
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,881
(In the end, all of them
will be demolished.)

263
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,480
(However, there are values and meaning
to their existence.)

264
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,840
(Similarly,)

265
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:34,280
(our motherland could only develop
in peace due to the existence of)

266
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,320
(millions of guardians of the state.)

267
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:40,778
(Currently,)

268
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,360
(we can be sure)

269
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,881
(that no country dares
to declare war against China.)

270
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,400
(The era)

271
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,359
(when you can make China cower in fear)

272
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:52,376
(just by launching several torpedoes
from a battleship)

273
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:54,400
(is gone.)

274
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:59,121
(Those who turn the tides when
everything seems hopeless are heroes.)

275
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,199
(Spending their youth
without any regrets,)

276
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,560
(rolling around in the training ground,)

277
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:06,120
(achieving victories in their drills,)

278
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,960
(that's how they become
the pillar of the state.)

279
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,520
(Rejecting the fear of risk and death)

280
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,600
(so that their family and friends)

281
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,960
(can live an ordinary and happy life)

282
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,640
(on a peaceful land,)

283
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:21,087
(they are what we call heroes.)

284
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,880
Morning, everyone.

285
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,479
Let me introduce myself.

286
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,134
Yue Kong.

287
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,360
I assume all of you still remember me.

288
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,439
-My head hurts when I see you.
-I'm sorry.

289
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,160
It was a life-and-death struggle.

290
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,880
I had to give it my all.

291
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
You did give it your all.

292
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,640
But I didn't.

293
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,000
If you're not happy, let's spar again.

294
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,680
No, thanks.

295
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,119
Life-and-death struggle?

296
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,272
Do you bear a deep grudge against me?

297
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,120
No.

298
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,280
Veterans bullying the new recruits

299
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,520
are nothing special.

300
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:10,880
Veterans always keep their promises too.

301
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,760
I just want to know

302
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,760
if you will keep your promise.

303
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,720
If I lose, I'll follow your every order!

304
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,040
You want me to follow your every order?

305
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,560
Fine.

306
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,599
But first, you have to become
an intelligent commander.

307
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,080
I don't want to die for nothing

308
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,960
because of your gentleness.

309
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
-I'm a good guy!
-You mustn't leave!

310
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,480
What should we do then?

311
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,880
Let's do a vote.

312
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,680
If we return to our first encounter,

313
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,519
when you encounter someone suspicious

314
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,119
during your mission,

315
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,920
if you progress while escorting them,
they will hinder your mission.

316
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,040
If you let them go,

317
00:20:58,513 --> 00:21:00,120
they might expose your identity.

318
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,760
If you leave them at the same spot,

319
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,920
they might endanger your life.

320
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,439
If you kill them on the spot,
it's too cruel.

321
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,040
Think about it.

322
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,873
What will you guys do

323
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,280
if you have another chance?

324
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,160
Not just you guys,

325
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
to every unit that will infiltrate
the enemy backlines,

326
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:27,239
this kind of decision is unavoidable.

327
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:33,600
Navy SEAL,

328
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,040
it's one of the most famous
special unit in the world.

329
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:38,200
Their whereabouts are unknown.

330
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:39,240
They do not have many members.

331
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,470
They only have around
1,600 members right now.

332
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,217
However, all of them
are the cream of the crop.

333
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:46,911
Not only are they
physically strong and capable,

334
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:48,656
but they are more intelligent than most.

335
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,760
During the selection,
the elimination rate is over 70%.

336
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
And, they use live bullets
for their drills and training.

337
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,800
That's why they have
a high casualty rate.

338
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:58,240
And that's precisely why

339
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,560
they're one of the toughest
special unit in the world.

340
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:05,160
The retreat mission you guys
had undergone at the last phase

341
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:07,640
was designed based on
their famous operation,

342
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,231
Operation Red Wings.

343
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,479
I have some information over here.

344
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,119
On June 2005,

345
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,599
in order to eliminate Ahmad Shah
and the rest, the senior commanders

346
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,920
of a terrorist organisation,

347
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,320
Country A has decided to launch
Operation Red Wings.

348
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:22,888
The operation began officially
on the 28th.

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,278
Country A dispatched
a four-man SEAL squad

350
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,479
for reconnaissance purposes.

351
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:28,479
On their journey, they met
three shepherds.

352
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:31,760
In the end, they decided to let them go.

353
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,800
Due to that, their whereabouts
were leaked.

354
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,160
After several hours,

355
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,439
more than 150 terrorists
surrounded the four of them.

356
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,640
The four-man squad retreated
towards the nearby villages

357
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,360
while requesting reinforcements from HQ.

358
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,400
As they were in the mountains,
the wireless signal was terrible.

359
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,560
The commander only managed to send out
the SOS signal right before he died.

360
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,400
In the end, only one of them survived.

361
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,200
After Country A's HQ
had received the SOS signal,

362
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,320
they sent out a chopper on that evening.

363
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,400
16 Navy SEALs were dispatched
to save them.

364
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,119
Due to thunderstorms

365
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,241
and pouring rain in the action area,

366
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,040
the rescue chopper was brought down
by the ambushing terrorists.

367
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,560
Everyone on the chopper died.

368
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,040
After that, the command centre sent out

369
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
a huge number of choppers and A-10s.

370
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,240
That's how they were able
to save the last man.

371
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,639
The command centre only managed to find

372
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,960
the bodies of those who were
killed in action after several days.

373
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,160
Almost 20 members of
the Navy SEAL were killed in action.

374
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,920
Operation Red Wings
was declared a failure.

375
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,199
The failure of Operation Red Wings

376
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,959
had left a deep lesson behind
for every army in the world.

377
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,400
At the same time, it had
provided many insights

378
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,479
to modern mountain warfare.

379
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,959
Next, I have a question for you all.

380
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,280
If one of you were to be the commander
of that operation,

381
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
what would you guys do?

382
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:52,760
Think about it.

383
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,199
-Sir.
-Speak.

384
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,040
I think we need to be meticulous
when we come up with operation plans.

385
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,040
Operation Red Wings was full of flaws.

386
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,881
Their failure had taught us

387
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,640
that we must be concerned
about three factors

388
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,680
when we do operation planning.

389
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:12,120
First,

390
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,800
we should design our action plan
to be most complete as possible.

391
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,520
From the action system

392
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,359
to the details of every personnel,

393
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:20,480
we mustn't omit any of them.

394
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,000
For example, the thunderstorms
that occurred within the action area.

395
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:24,639
Their action plan

396
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,160
almost didn't take the surrounding
weather into account at all.

397
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,440
Second,

398
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:30,697
they should prepare different solutions

399
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,239
for all types of emergencies.

400
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,880
For example, when the military launched
their first rescue operation,

401
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:37,839
they never took things
like ambushes into account.

402
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,440
They didn't prepare any possible
solutions to it.

403
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,560
In the end, the chopper was shot down.

404
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:43,360
Third,

405
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,200
they should hold a simulation
right before an operation.

406
00:24:46,488 --> 00:24:48,368
They could rely on the training ground.

407
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,920
By holding simulations of

408
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,160
the operation repetitively,

409
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,560
they could discover their flaws
and solve them in time.

410
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,240
They could make every personnel
familiar with the operation details,

411
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
thus, reducing mistakes.

412
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,080
-That's all, sir.
-Sit down.

413
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,840
The battlefield is ever-changing.

414
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
No one has time
for all those simulations.

415
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,959
Xiao Yun Jie, louder!

416
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:08,760
Yes, sir!

417
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,599
I think communication

418
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,319
needs to be emphasised
during mountain warfare.

419
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:17,719
Think about it.

420
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,439
If they could send out
the SOS signal earlier,

421
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,119
if the four-man squad could maintain
constant communication with the HQ,

422
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,000
the situation might be
entirely different.

423
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,920
This tells us that
mountain warfare is something special.

424
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,400
Tall mountains, thick forests,
and steep valleys,

425
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:35,000
all of those have a huge impact
on the wireless signal.

426
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,959
We should emphasise the quality
of wireless radio communication.

427
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,040
This tells us

428
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,719
that we need to emphasise communication
when it comes to mountain warfare.

429
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,719
According to different landscapes
and regions,

430
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:47,439
we have to choose the best
radio frequency, satellite phones,

431
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:49,599
communication equipment and so on.

432
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,560
We must make sure that
our communication is smooth.

433
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,240
-That's all, sir.
-Sit down.

434
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,760
Only the new guys
are answering my question.

435
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Where are the old guys?

436
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,400
We've studied the same scenario
over 10 years ago.

437
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,440
Let the youngsters speak.

438
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,680
Don't put on airs.

439
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,640
Stand up. You can gain new insights
by reviewing old materials.

440
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,080
I think the operation support
mustn't lag behind.

441
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:15,040
The four-man squad was isolated
from the start.

442
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,839
Even though the HQ had
sent out reinforcements,

443
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,040
they didn't receive any support
as the chopper was shot down.

444
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,920
All of those were fatal mistakes.

445
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,320
It shows the ineptitude of
the operation support team.

446
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,479
After receiving the SOS signal,

447
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,960
they knew that
a fierce battle was ongoing.

448
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:28,400
Even so, they didn't dispatch any drones

449
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,599
to do any reconnaissance.

450
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,599
They dispatched members of special
forces without thinking it through.

451
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,000
And, they did so without any air cover.

452
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,199
That's why they were easily wiped up
by the enemy ambush.

453
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,248
Besides that, they only dispatched
a huge number of choppers

454
00:26:38,302 --> 00:26:39,639
after the rescue chopper was shot down.

455
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,839
It was too late by then. They had
missed the best rescue opportunity.

456
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,160
All of those showed

457
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,400
that their operation support team
was lagging behind.

458
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,280
They weren't at the same frequency
with the operation team.

459
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,800
And, retreat operations
should be prioritised too.

460
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:52,119
After their first chopper was shot down,

461
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,239
they did something different
the second time around

462
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,319
when they tried to rescue their men.

463
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,280
Not only did they do
a detailed reconnaissance

464
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,120
around the target and his surroundings,

465
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
but they also dispatched air units
to back up the rescue unit.

466
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,321
That caused their enemies

467
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,079
to fail their second ambush.

468
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,080
For most armies,

469
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,319
retreat operations
aren't prioritised enough.

470
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,800
But, it turns out that
retreating is an important aspect too.

471
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,880
We must never neglect it.

472
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,280
Sir, that's all.

473
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,439
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

474
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,760
Great job.

475
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:21,320
I wish to give you all a reminder.

476
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,760
No matter what type of operation it is,

477
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,800
we mustn't neglect
the deciding factor of being human.

478
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,160
The operation plan of Operation
Red Wings was rough and full of flaws.

479
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:34,089
They underestimated their enemies.

480
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,440
This is closely related

481
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,960
to the arrogance of
the soldiers themselves.

482
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:42,600
Along with the pace of current
scientific technology advancement,

483
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,920
both weapons and equipment are being
upgraded at an unprecedented speed.

484
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,120
Warfare is constantly changing too.

485
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:49,360
Future wars

486
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:52,105
will only demand more from soldiers.

487
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,000
If you cannot bring
the human factor into play,

488
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,079
it will cause all sorts of problems.

489
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,320
It might even land us
in desperate situations.

490
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,639
-Sir.
-Speak.

491
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,040
Captain,

492
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,199
is there any difference in strength

493
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
between the Cheetah Special Forces
and Navy SEAL?

494
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,960
If there's a difference,

495
00:28:13,384 --> 00:28:14,745
how huge is the difference?

496
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,920
We can only tell who's better

497
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:19,408
after a head-on battle.

498
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,574
You guys are lucky that
you're born in a peaceful country.

499
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:24,761
You've never experienced
a large-scale war.

500
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:25,760
However,

501
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:27,840
the global situation is unpredictable.

502
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,160
A sudden war might
break out at any time.

503
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,479
A regional war
might break out at any time too.

504
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,479
By that time,

505
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,400
we can show our strength
and verify how strong we are.

506
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,748
What's our target

507
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:39,729
if we're unable to do so?

508
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,719
-Bai Long.
-Yes, sir.

509
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,359
-Tell him.
-Yes, sir.

510
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,641
Our strongest rivals

511
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:50,920
are always the past us!

512
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,601
-Lu.
-Speak.

513
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,839
Let's have a rematch later.

514
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
A rematch? Fine.

515
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,079
But you have to admit defeat
if you lose this time.

516
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,481
Did I lose?

517
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,880
You hurt the hostage by accident.
Doesn't that count as a loss?

518
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:50,897
Fine, it's my loss.

519
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,761
Let me ask you something.

520
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,000
What's in it for you
to keep losing all the time?

521
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,160
There's plenty in it for me.

522
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,319
Wait a minute.

523
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,320
You lost during our training
and assessment.

524
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:05,554
It's been over a month.

525
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,305
You're almost at the bottom of the table
among cadres, you know?

526
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,080
What?

527
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,639
Do you wish to showcase our spirit?

528
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,840
Do you want everyone else to win
except for you?

529
00:30:19,171 --> 00:30:20,411
We're a family.

530
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:22,856
Winning or losing doesn't matter to me

531
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,880
when I'm not facing our enemies.

532
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,439
You don't act like yourself ever since
Bai Long returned to the team.

533
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,640
Bai Long was also too much.
He kept being mean to you.

534
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,055
But you shouldn't hold it against him.

535
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,479
I didn't hold it against him.

536
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,760
You're the one holding it against me.

537
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,319
What's there for me
to hold it against you?

538
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,400
Wait.

539
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,160
Don't you think it's meaningless
for you two to do this?

540
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,839
It's not Bai Long's problem.
It's my problem.

541
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:49,408
Let me put it like this.

542
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,000
When there's a worm on a tree,

543
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:54,488
it will infest the tree
and create a hole.

544
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,680
No matter how you try to
cover it with leaves,

545
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,400
the hole is still there.

546
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,040
If so, you can just remove the leaves.

547
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,520
If I do so, it'll hurt our relationship.

548
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,479
But if I don't do so,

549
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,719
it makes me upset.

550
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,040
What can I do?

551
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,040
I would rather

552
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,240
chop down the tree.

553
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,239
That's fine too.

554
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:21,280
You should make an axe
and chop down the tree then.

555
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,610
I'm the tree.

556
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
What am I then?

557
00:31:28,394 --> 00:31:29,073
You?

558
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:32,129
You're the bird on the tree.

559
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,760
You catch the worm
and remove the leaves every day.

560
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,551
The tree thinks that you're annoying.

561
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,479
What exactly do you want me to do then?

562
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,220
I'm tired.

563
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,199
What are you looking at?

564
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:04,802
I wish to learn from you.

565
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:07,239
We're comrades now.

566
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,192
Ask away.

567
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,259
How did you get yourself to this level?

568
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,890
Have you ever been on a mission before?

569
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:18,426
I have.

570
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:20,953
Have you killed a person before?

571
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,159
I have.

572
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,440
Have you ever thought of death before?

573
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,040
No.

574
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:30,449
Train as if every day is your last.

575
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,730
Wait.

576
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:35,228
That's just a hypothetical scenario.

577
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,073
I need an answer.

578
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:40,272
It's better if you don't have one.

579
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:41,368
If you do get an answer,

580
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:43,708
I'm sure it's because of a tragedy.

581
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:48,479
But that answer is strong enough
to make you challenge Cao Ben.

582
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,839
He's not the answer.

583
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,040
He's the cause of it.

584
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,520
Captain.

585
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:13,705
Let's have a chat.

586
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:14,818
Okay, sit down.

587
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:24,319
Cao Ben, how many years
have we known each other?

588
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:27,473
About six to seven years.

589
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:31,222
7 years, 6 months, and 18 days.

590
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:34,016
You're amazing.

591
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,160
I remember everything and everyone.

592
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:40,065
That's great.

593
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,839
I can ask you

594
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,040
when I forget anything.

595
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,040
Sure.

596
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:46,609
But can I ask you questions

597
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:47,906
when I want to know something?

598
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:49,512
Ask away.

599
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:55,920
A person whom I once thought was simple
has become complicated.

600
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:58,523
Why?

601
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,319
I...

602
00:34:04,698 --> 00:34:05,857
Did Lu Tu tell you something?

603
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:10,639
Don't believe in that fellow.

604
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,098
But of course,
I know you trust me more than him.

605
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,761
I hope you can be happy
from the bottom of your heart.

606
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:19,306
I don't want you to smile
out of resignation.

607
00:34:20,353 --> 00:34:21,513
I didn't do it out of resignation.

608
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,360
Yes.

609
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,553
I'm sure he has mentioned this,

610
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,559
but I'm not doing too well
on the assessments lately.

611
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,320
But I promise
I will readjust my state in time.

612
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,921
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

613
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,800
But I'm not sure about that.

614
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:43,978
I've read your training report.

615
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,760
You've done pretty well
on the training programmes.

616
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:52,479
But you had made mistakes
during crucial moments.

617
00:34:53,882 --> 00:34:55,882
After that, I reviewed
the recordings of your training.

618
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,880
I realised that you didn't
hesitate to commit mistakes

619
00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:02,424
during crucial moments.

620
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:04,218
What does that mean?

621
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,080
That means

622
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:08,855
I was careless.

623
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:11,466
Last time, during our operation,

624
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,321
you even investigated a shell
because it was suspicious.

625
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:15,697
Are you sure that you were careless?

626
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,280
Have you forgotten how to use a gun
just because we don't use live bullets?

627
00:35:21,337 --> 00:35:22,057
That's not it, Captain.

628
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,280
You see, I'm a veteran.

629
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,679
But even veterans

630
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,360
are human, right?

631
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,930
As humans, it's common for us
to make mistakes.

632
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,360
It's understandable.

633
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,080
All humans have human nature.

634
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,280
And human nature is complicated.

635
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:40,313
But you had committed mistakes
without any hesitations.

636
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,320
To me, that's not carelessness.

637
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,721
You did them on purpose.

638
00:35:45,473 --> 00:35:47,031
But Captain, that's not true...

639
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,281
Even though Bai Long is back,

640
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,977
Cao Ben is leaving.

641
00:35:55,228 --> 00:35:56,028
Do you think it's worth it?

642
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:57,594
Wait, Captain.

643
00:35:58,872 --> 00:35:59,993
This has

644
00:36:00,987 --> 00:36:02,467
nothing to do with Bai Long.

645
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,679
It's my problem.

646
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,959
I'm just tired.

647
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,723
Do you want to take a break?

648
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:30,290
Captain,

649
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:36,719
don't you think you guys
were too nice to me in the past?

650
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,570
Maybe Bai Long is doing the
right thing by treating me like this.

651
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:50,042
I understand what you mean now.

652
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,730
Regarding this incident,

653
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:56,695
no one could understand
what you had been through.

654
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,199
Alright. You can enjoy your lunch break.

655
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,920
I'll make a move now.

656
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Goodbye, Captain.

657
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,840
When we go on missions,

658
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,201
we usually move in squads.

659
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,600
So, after
the party committee's discussion,

660
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,360
the five of you will make up
the Cheetah Commando's ninth squad

661
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:27,635
within the First Corps.

662
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,679
As a usual squad contains eight members

663
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,320
while your squad only
contains five members,

664
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,000
therefore,

665
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,040
I've selected three veterans
to join your squad.

666
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,479
-Ma Liang.
-Yes, sir!

667
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,754
He's our demolition expert.

668
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:43,560
He has defused more than 1,000 bombs.

669
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,399
-Mu Qing!
-Yes, sir!

670
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:49,863
He's a top graduate
of the army medical university.

671
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:50,864
He's a Master of Medicine.

672
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,479
-Yue Kong.
-Yes, sir!

673
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,818
I think I don't need to introduce him.

674
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,360
You guys have spent a lot of time
together before this.

675
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,720
He has put you guys through hell.

676
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:01,719
Yue Kong

677
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,800
is also the most senior sniper
of the Cheetah Commando.

678
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:06,529
Sir!

679
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,159
Speak.

680
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,439
-What am I in charge of then?
-You'll be our spotter.

681
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,041
You're in charge of spotting the targets
and cooperating with Yue Kong.

682
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,959
What? Is there any problem?

683
00:38:21,178 --> 00:38:22,097
No, sir.

684
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:23,611
Guo Xiao Xiao!

685
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,239
-Yes, sir!
-Fall out!

686
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:26,003
Yes, sir!

687
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,385
Do you have any problems with that?

688
00:38:29,553 --> 00:38:30,313
No, sir!

689
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:32,152
We're a combat unit!

690
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,560
If you don't have any problems with it,

691
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,479
you'd better keep your emotions away!

692
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,239
Listen up!
The position you have right now

693
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,760
is the result of our
strict selection, comparison,

694
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,479
and discussion!

695
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,080
If you're unhappy with the result,
you may leave right now!

696
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,556
All of you'd better remember this.
When you move as a squad,

697
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,639
your personal emotions
might affect the entire squad

698
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,728
and cause unimaginable consequences.

699
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:58,088
Understood?

700
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,320
Yes, sir!

701
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:01,532
Guo Xiao Xiao,

702
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:03,781
do you understand me?

703
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,560
-Yes, sir.
-Louder!

704
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:08,297
Yes, sir!

705
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:11,280
-Fall in.
-Yes, sir!

706
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:16,360
-Yue Kong.
-Yes, sir!

707
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,760
-Mu Qing.
-Yes, sir!

708
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,840
-Ma Liang.
-Yes, sir!

709
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
-Fall in!
-Yes, sir!

710
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,240
-Bai Long.
-Yes, sir!

711
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,520
You will be the squad leader.

712
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,120
Yes, sir!

713
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
-Yue Kong!
-Yes, sir!

714
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,798
You will be
the vice squad leader cum sniper.

715
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,560
Yes, sir!

716
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,320
-Guo Xiao Xiao.
-Yes, sir!

717
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,720
You'll be the spotter for our sniper.

718
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,000
Yes, sir!

719
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,160
-Xiao Yun Jie.
-Yes, sir!

720
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,639
-You'll be our machine gunner.
-Yes, sir!

721
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,959
-Yan Po Yue!
-Yes, sir!

722
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,320
-You'll be our shock troop.
-Yes, sir!

723
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,481
-Xu Yang.
-Yes, sir!

724
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,182
You'll be in charge of reconnaissance
and communication!

725
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,880
Yes, sir!

726
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,120
-Mu Qing!
-Yes, sir!

727
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,599
-You'll be the medic.
-Yes, sir!

728
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,879
-Ma Liang!
-Yes, sir!

729
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:54,520
-You'll be our demolition expert.
-Yes, sir!

730
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:58,360
We've assigned professional instructors

731
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,800
to all of you

732
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,679
in order to enhance your skills.

733
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,560
And,

734
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,439
each of you has to work together
with your squad

735
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,080
and execute regular tactical drills

736
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,073
to increase the chemistry
of your squad at a rapid pace

737
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,120
and enhance your battle strength.

738
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,321
Understood?

739
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Yes, sir!

740
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,040
Vice squad leader,

741
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
whose orders
shall we follow in the future?

742
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm caught in the middle too.

743
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:23,919
Follow the leader's order.

744
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,800
-Yan!
-Lower your volume!

745
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:21,919
Stop!

746
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:34,714
Yan Po Yue!

747
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:36,840
Yes, sir!

748
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,480
Do you know what you have done?

749
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,120
You acted without permission! Half of
your teammates are dead because of you!

750
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:43,560
Sir,

751
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,280
an eight-man squad isn't agile enough.

752
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:46,239
Our advance is too slow.

753
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,600
It hasn't achieved
the effectiveness of a raid.

754
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,559
It'll only affect our speed
if I act overcautiously.

755
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:52,439
Do you think you'll face enemies
like them on the battlefield?

756
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,960
Do you think your enemies
will show you mercy?

757
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,080
Do you think so?
