1
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,120
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:31,040
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,760
(Episode 21)

4
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
What about you,

5
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:36,919
31?

6
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,760
Me?

7
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,920
Inner Mongolia.

8
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,040
The grassland.

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,120
That explains your strong constitution.

10
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,641
My dad said

11
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,880
there are three types of people.

12
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,040
Sheep,

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
sheepdogs,

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,080
and wolves.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Sheep

16
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,079
rely on others to live.

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,040
Sheepdogs

18
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,240
live for others.

19
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,280
Wolves

20
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,759
live only for themselves.

21
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,720
You chose to be a wolf.

22
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,880
At first.

23
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,559
After I joined the army,

24
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,120
I chose to be a sheepdog.

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,520
We all live for others.

26
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,160
Don't forget that

27
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,439
at the end of the selection,

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,520
you're the one

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
who showed me I need comrades.

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,680
Answer me again.

31
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
Do you need comrades?

32
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,160
Or rather,

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
do you want comrades?

34
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
Yes.

35
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
Why did your family
name you Guo Xiao Xiao (smile)?

36
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Is it because you never smile?

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,199
Why does 28

38
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,760
call you Yan (swallow)?

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,160
Is it because you never fly?

40
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,199
Are you getting cosy down there?

41
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,520
Do you still want to come up?

42
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,120
Grab it, Yan.

43
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
(Name: Xiao Yun Jie.)
(Age: 20  No: 28)

44
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,879
I told you,

45
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,279
they will be fine.

46
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Lu Tu,

47
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,839
confirm the next training plan.

48
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,320
Zhou Zi Jian, you're so heavy.

49
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,360
Watch out for the pit.

50
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,640
We'll reach the rally point

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,119
after we go over this hill.

52
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,560
-Put me down.
-Stay still.

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,440
Put me down.

54
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,679
-Don't...
-Put me down.

55
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:21,519
Fine, fine.

56
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
Easy, easy.

57
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,640
What's wrong with you, Zhou Zi Jian?

58
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,400
Leave me here.

59
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,040
You guys should go.

60
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,560
And leave you to the wolves?

61
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,160
The wolves will lose appetite
when they see you. Look at you.

62
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,040
Come on.

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,440
Leave me here.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
Judging by his state,

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,160
he won't be able to make it until dark.

66
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,839
Go without me.

67
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,519
-I can hold on.
-Stop moving.

68
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,640
Stay still.

69
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,760
You have integrity.
Consider yourself lucky.

70
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:54,092
You guys go.

71
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,640
Alright, just stop moving.

72
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,200
I'll watch you.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Sit up, sit up.

74
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,840
It's cool.

75
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,360
So cool.

76
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,439
That's good.

77
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
Wrap it up.

78
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,480
31,

79
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:27,718
you know a lot.

80
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,880
If I don't, I won't be able to survive.

81
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,241
In the jungle,

82
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,160
antidote can usually be found

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,519
in the habitat of venomous animals.

84
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,480
Someone is coming.

85
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,200
Go, go!

86
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,320
Check over there.

87
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
Look around.

88
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,920
Copy that.

89
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,520
Interesting.

90
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,240
They are just chasing us around.

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Are they herding?

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,720
They are rushing us.

93
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,839
They're driving the stragglers
to the rally point.

94
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,680
Why?

95
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Because before it gets dark,

96
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,120
this assessment is over.

97
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
(Rally Point)

98
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,319
It's time to blow the whistle.

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
There is still some time left.

100
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,799
-Let's wait a little longer.
-Okay.

101
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,240
-Okay.
-When can we eat? I'm starving!

102
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,520
You think you're the only one?

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,760
Listen, we have five more minutes.

104
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:49,160
At 8pm, we will give you food on time.

105
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
Give us some water!

106
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,119
We're thirsty.

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Why are there still so many people left?

108
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,840
The training after this
must be even harder.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm exhausted.

110
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Faster.

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,520
Hurry up!

112
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,839
We're waiting for you.

113
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880
Now,

114
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,453
I have a good news,

115
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,359
and a better news.

116
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,600
-Which one would you like to hear first?
-Report, sir.

117
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,200
The good news.

118
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
The good news is

119
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,719
in this assessment,

120
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,320
some of you got eliminated,

121
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,760
while you persevered

122
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,439
and made it to the rally point.

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,039
There are 23 of you.

124
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,800
-Congratulations.
-Report, sir!

125
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Speak.

126
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,679
What is the better news?

127
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,663
Enter the tent and have your dinner.

128
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,000
-Go!
-Let's go!

129
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,280
-Let's go.
-Let's have dinner.

130
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,560
-I thought we're having dinner?
-Did we enter the wrong tent?

131
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,160
What is this?

132
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,360
It's...

133
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,640
Didn't they tell us to come in for food?

134
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,040
But there are only guns here.

135
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Just guns.

136
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,360
Aren't we having dinner?

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,960
Aren't we having dinner?

138
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,560
Are these guns our dinner?

139
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
What do you think?

140
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:21,960
Do you like your dinner?

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,640
You're disappointed, aren't you?

142
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,039
There are no chicken legs

143
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,160
or lamb chops here,

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,040
but

145
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,480
we got you mental food

146
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,441
to better stimulate your potential

147
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,880
and your courage.

148
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,760
Now, an update on the situation.

149
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,760
The rally point has been
attacked by the enemy.

150
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
You cannot retreat.

151
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,280
So you have no choice

152
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,479
but to regroup at
an alternate regroup point

153
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,440
50 kilometres away.

154
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:47,640
During this process,

155
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,960
you will be pursued by a squadron of
imaginary enemy.

156
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,960
Those who are shot,
their sensor vest will emit red smoke,

157
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
and they will be eliminated.

158
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,480
Those who can reach
the alternate rally point,

159
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
will pass the assessment.

160
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,320
To raise your interest
in participating,

161
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,800
I'll give you a spoiler.

162
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,600
The ones who will lead the force
to come after you

163
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,719
are all your instructors.

164
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Report, sir!

165
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,480
Speak.

166
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
This is so unfair.

167
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,200
War is not fair to begin with.

168
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,519
-Report, sir.
-Speak.

169
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:14,039
At least give us some food
before we start.

170
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,119
The jungle has everything you need.

171
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,199
You can find your own food.

172
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,919
-Report, sir!
-Speak.

173
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,080
It's impossible to win.

174
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,799
You can take off your clothes
and leave now!

175
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,840
Any other questions?

176
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,280
We will each lead a team.

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,480
Follow the plan and besiege them
from four directions.

178
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,760
We have to give them
a feeling of oppression.

179
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,520
If we do this, there won't
be many left in the end.

180
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,839
Less work for us then.

181
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,520
After spending so much
efforts and time to train them,

182
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,799
in the end,

183
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,640
only a few can stay.

184
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,201
I want only the best soldiers.

185
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,799
What are you eating?

186
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,280
Ant eggs.

187
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,040
Pardon me?

188
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,200
Ant eggs.

189
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,518
Is that stuff safe to eat?

190
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,559
31 said it's edible.

191
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,000
And it's rich in protein.

192
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,159
Eww, you guys are disgusting.

193
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:10,840
You're being picky.

194
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:15,680
Who's there? Come out!

195
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,601
I'm a human, not animal.

196
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Are you hikers?

197
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,039
Freeze!

198
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,760
Don't shoot.

199
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
You're soldiers.

200
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
You scared me.

201
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,080
I thought I'd run into a bad guys.

202
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,120
We're on the same side.

203
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:30,639
Who are you?

204
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,799
I'm from Yun Ling exploration team.

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
My colleagues and I went into the woods

206
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,440
to collect water samples.

207
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,199
I fell into the ditch by accident

208
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
and got separated.

209
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
It's been two days.

210
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,400
Thank goodness

211
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:43,599
I ran into you.

212
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,719
I'm safe now.

213
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
-My ID...
-Freeze!

214
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,679
Don't shoot.

215
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,599
Search him.

216
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,359
-Don't move.
-Here, here. Yes.

217
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:55,078
I'm a good guy.

218
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,000
My bag.

219
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,039
This should be

220
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,799
real, right?

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,679
It is real. You can check it.

222
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,760
Shut up.

223
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,960
If you don't believe me,
you can call our department

224
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
to verify.

225
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,679
I work there.

226
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,432
I'm Yue Kong.

227
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,680
I'm a good guy.

228
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,919
My photo is in there.

229
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:37,398
We're in the mountains.

230
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,000
You came here to find water?

231
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,599
That's very unconvincing.

232
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,359
Listen to yourself.

233
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,440
All places

234
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,080
are a part of our country.

235
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,286
I'll go wherever I'm needed.

236
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,719
I'm a researcher after all.

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,959
Are you guys on patrol?

238
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,370
Let me come with you.

239
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,440
If you don't believe me,

240
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,400
tie me up then.

241
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,800
Just tie me up, okay?

242
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,840
Bring me with you.

243
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:03,549
What do we do?

244
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,440
Tie him up!

245
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,720
Yes, yes.

246
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:06,685
Tie him up?

247
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,560
Take him with us while we retreat 50 km?

248
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,040
We still have to deal
with imaginary enemy.

249
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,760
Tie him to the tree then.

250
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,480
When we arrive at the rally point,
we'll report it and verify his identity.

251
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,440
No, you can't do this to me.

252
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
It's been two days.
I can't hold on much longer.

253
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:22,599
There are all kinds of creature here.

254
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,920
If you tie me up here, I'll die.

255
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:26,320
You can't do this.

256
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,520
Don't do this to me.

257
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,720
There are snakes and predators here.

258
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,158
If anything happens to him,

259
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,600
we'll be held accountable.

260
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,360
Are you the PLA or the Armed Forces?

261
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,159
Are you one of our own?

262
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,320
Why don't we

263
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,159
-release him?
-Just release him.

264
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,120
No.

265
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,520
He just came out of nowhere

266
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
in this jungle.

267
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,560
-There must be something wrong with him.
-I'm not.

268
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:59,200
Say no more. Tie him up now!

269
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,039
No.

270
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,039
No, please.

271
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,080
I didn't see anything.

272
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,159
My girl just had her one-month old
birthday. I haven't even seen her.

273
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,280
Please spare my life.

274
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,719
I'm begging you.

275
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,232
I'm not a bad guy.

276
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,519
Hide!

277
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:15,399
Hide now!

278
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,079
Hide! Lie down!

279
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,039
Listen.

280
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,840
No matter your identity is true or not,

281
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,400
we're having a military exercise now.

282
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,479
It's dangerous.

283
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
You'd better stay here and rest.

284
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:49,582
Go west at sunrise.

285
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,799
You'll find our campsite there.

286
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,960
Xiao,

287
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,599
give me his bag.

288
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,640
Go now,

289
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,880
before we change our mind.

290
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,879
Okay.

291
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,559
Comrade, tell me your designation.

292
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,599
Don't worry.

293
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:19,479
I'll write you a thank you letter.

294
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,560
Thank you.

295
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,280
Thank you.

296
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,920
No.

297
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm a good guy.

298
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:29,919
He can't leave!

299
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,640
What do you think we should do then?

300
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,680
Go on, tell us.

301
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,919
You tell us.

302
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,341
How about this?

303
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:47,477
Let's do a show of hands

304
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:49,814
If you agree to let him go,

305
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,040
raise your hand.

306
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:07,206
Enough, 31.

307
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,359
Enough, majority rule.

308
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,079
-Go now.
-Thank you.

309
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
-Go.
-Thank you.

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,040
There will be trouble.

311
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
We'll leave it to fate.

312
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,279
Someone got there before us.

313
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,361
Shooting blanks doesn't hurt at all.

314
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,081
Why don't we fight for real?

315
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Sure.

316
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:14,294
I know

317
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,760
you've been resenting me for
what happened to Xiang Fei.

318
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,818
But if you beat me to death,

319
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,159
will it really make you feel better?

320
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,720
We haven't started yet.

321
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,999
Who knows?

322
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,120
So this is why you re-enlisted.

323
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,520
This is half the reason.

324
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,720
But even if you really beat me to death,

325
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,920
Fei won't come back to life.

326
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,479
Trading his life

327
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,000
for yours,

328
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,040
you think you're worthy of it?

329
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:43,613
No, I'm not.

330
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,040
Let's do this.

331
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,920
Don't play pity with me.

332
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,840
If you had been smarter
on the battlefield,

333
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,160
he wouldn't have died because of you.

334
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,960
You used dirty trick!

335
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
Stop whining. You're eliminated.

336
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
Keep this in mind,

337
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,520
your hatred

338
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,080
is what failed you this time.

339
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,640
Yan,

340
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,680
what should we do if that man
really is a spy from the drill team?

341
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,240
Then our location is exposed.

342
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,960
We're dead.

343
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,320
Sniper.

344
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,481
He wears a night-vision goggles.

345
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,120
The gunshots were barely audible.

346
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,920
He is using a silencer.

347
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,359
He took out two guys in five seconds.
Let's take a detour.

348
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,680
This is the only path.

349
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,000
We can't go around it.

350
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,880
Got any idea?

351
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,409
Don't worry.

352
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,490
We're still

353
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,600
out of his shooting range.

354
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,999
(3, how is it going?)

355
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,840
I eliminated two guys.

356
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,081
(Impressive.)

357
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,199
(My mortar took out three.)

358
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,680
Are you waiting for my compliment?

359
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,000
(I won't dare to.
I use mortar, you use gun.)

360
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,241
(1, what about you?)

361
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,200
Four guys.

362
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
That's fast.

363
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,120
(Other than Bai Long,
will we have any other guy left?)

364
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,760
Bai Long has been captured.

365
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
(How did you do that?)

366
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,439
I used myself as bait.

367
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,360
Goal.

368
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,418
Wipe them out

369
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,880
before daybreak.

370
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,760
23.

371
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,520
200.

372
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:11,137
450.

373
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,241
34.

374
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,680
24.

375
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,801
49.

376
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,120
A sand table.

377
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,920
You're trying to calculate
the sniper's location.

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,239
Calculate?

379
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,400
What does that mean?

380
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,760
Give us a lesson.

381
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:24,972
A sniper's nemesis on the battlefield

382
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,160
is another sniper.

383
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,080
Therefore, when a sniper
chooses his firing position,

384
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,040
he will first observe
his surrounding terrain,

385
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,756
and make a note of the terrain

386
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:34,997
that may be a threat to him.

387
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,720
This way, if the enemy's
sniper infiltrates the area,

388
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,960
even if there is
a basketball-sized object

389
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,720
shows up on a small hill
a few hundred meters away,

390
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:43,044
the sniper

391
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,520
will notice it immediately.

392
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,760
Across from us is a small hill.

393
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,280
Its vertical elevation

394
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
is 200 meters.

395
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,760
The slope length is 450 meters,

396
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,680
with a gradient of 34 degrees.

397
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,959
On its right side is a narrow trail,

398
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,480
behind it is a cliff

399
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,640
that common people
aren't capable to climb over.

400
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:08,909
In this order,

401
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,400
we can produce a multi-digit number.

402
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,360
First,

403
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:15,319
we'll label this hill with numbers.

404
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,800
1 is the ground.

405
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:20,269
2 is the hill.

406
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,439
3, jungle.

407
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,160
4, unvegetated land.

408
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,280
5, swamp.

409
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,951
6, rivers and lakes.

410
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,759
7, other special terrain.

411
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,479
Since the target is the hill,

412
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,481
so the first number of this
multi-digit combination is 23.

413
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,479
The hill and the jungle.

414
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,199
Its altitude is 200 meters.

415
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,031
The slope length is 450 meters,

416
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:46,446
with a gradient of 34 degrees.

417
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,359
So the last few digits of
the string of numbers are

418
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:49,324
200,

419
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,281
450,

420
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,359
34.

421
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,800
We'll set another set of numbers.

422
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,638
1 represents the left side.

423
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,400
2, the right side.

424
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,681
3, the middle.

425
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,400
4, the back.

426
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,332
Combining the two sets of figures above,

427
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,639
at the end,

428
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,080
putting the information

429
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,880
of this hill together,

430
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:09,341
we have

431
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,720
23.

432
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
200.

433
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,560
450.

434
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,960
34.

435
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,874
24.

436
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,120
49.

437
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,720
We're trying to counter-snipe now.

438
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,280
We just need to add about
six more numbers,

439
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,920
and we'll be able to include

440
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,120
all the possible fire points

441
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,600
of the lurking sniper into our memory.

442
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,839
This is a memory technique of

443
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,359
numerizing all topographic features.

444
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,160
Compare to sniper's common method of

445
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,479
icon drawing, numeric memory

446
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,278
is efficient, faster

447
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,560
and more accurate

448
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
If he can memorize
hundreds of numbers at once,

449
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:44,974
he won't even need a map

450
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:47,165
on the battlefield.

451
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,102
Wherever he encounters the enemy,

452
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:51,599
he just needs to pull up
the data in his head.

453
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,839
In his mind,

454
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,680
the figures will then assemble

455
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,479
according to their corresponding
terrain features,

456
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,359
forming a virtual sand table.

457
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,239
That's awesome.

458
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,760
What is all this?

459
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,560
When did you learn this?

460
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,901
Why haven't you showed it before?

461
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,040
I have to clap for you.

462
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,760
We are best friends indeed.

463
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,920
So at this point,

464
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:16,520
you don't need to have

465
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,184
sharp eyes to find out

466
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,600
the lurking sniper.

467
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,359
You just need to compare

468
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,319
the most possible hiding locations
of the lurking sniper.

469
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,280
When a certain spot
seems off to you,

470
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,240
just aim your gun at it

471
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:31,093
and wait for him to give himself away,

472
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,960
or,

473
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
you can contact your comrade

474
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,560
to use the mortar to
hit that spot repeatedly

475
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,560
to drive him out,

476
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
and you can kill him with one shot.

477
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,840
37.

478
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,320
82.

479
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:47,308
51.

480
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,439
Sorry for interrupting.

481
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:53,399
-What does that mean? I don't get it.
-That's right.

482
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
Translate it for us.

483
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,320
The right of the bush.

484
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,239
The left of the rocks.

485
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:02,556
The left of

486
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,190
the swamp.

487
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,599
The moonlight can't reach those spots.

488
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,360
It's perfect for hiding.

489
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,359
Great minds think alike indeed.

490
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,920
I think

491
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,520
there might be more than one sniper.

492
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,400
There are three spots.

493
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,240
You'll each keep an eye on one spot,
focus your fire on it.

494
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,520
I'll do flexible shooting.

495
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,956
Keep in mind that our goal

496
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,600
isn't to wipe them out,

497
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,120
but to get a chance

498
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:31,606
to go through it.

499
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,040
Copy that.

500
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,360
Good for you.
You have good rapport.

501
00:25:40,424 --> 00:25:41,304
Shush.

502
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,520
Get out of here.

503
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,240
1, 1.

504
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,807
Four guys went through my area.

505
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:34,606
They are heading toward Zone B.

506
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:35,999
(Copy that.)

507
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,840
Are the four of us the only ones left?

508
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:48,721
I think so.

509
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
I didn't hear any gunshot
after midnight.

510
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,840
We're getting closer to the rally point.

511
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,119
Let's take a break, Yan.

512
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,439
I'm exhausted.

513
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,360
Five minutes.

514
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:02,920
Let's take a break.

515
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,159
I'm exhausted.

516
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,441
You still have water.

517
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,160
You want to drink it?

518
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,321
Is this water?

519
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Yan Po Yue, you're disgusting.

520
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Here.

521
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,959
Take it away from me.

522
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,280
So it is water. Give me some.

523
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,519
You're unbelievable.

524
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:37,665
You fooled me too.

525
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,640
What's wrong?

526
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,640
What's that?

527
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,120
-Don't step on it!
-Zhou Zi Jian!

528
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,720
Hurry!

529
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,920
Let go.

530
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,079
You bunch of losers.

531
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,240
You'd better untie me now.

532
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:10,839
See if I can beat you to death. Come on.

533
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,800
Let's fight. Come on.

534
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Come here, come here.

535
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,400
Come here.

536
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,279
-Beat me to death?
-Take it on me!

537
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,260
Come on!

538
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,160
So you're the leader, is it?

539
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Okay, I'll take it on you.

540
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,921
Come here! Come!

541
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,441
-Yan!
-Come here!

542
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,439
The most arrogant one.

543
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,080
I want you to mark the
coordinate of your training base.

544
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,441
Mark it to me now!

545
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,480
Mark it!

546
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,719
Our training has ended.

547
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,400
There is nothing to mark.

548
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,160
You're wasting my time!

549
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,080
Scram!

550
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,480
What? What?

551
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Stay still!

552
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,200
Mark me the coordinate,

553
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,479
and you will suffer less.

554
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,360
Give it to me.

555
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:53,659
Give it to me.

556
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,940
We got a smart one here.

557
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,600
Be a good girl.

558
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,840
Mark it for me.

559
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,000
I can't see it clearly.

560
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:01,486
I can't see it clearly.

561
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,560
Closer.

562
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,159
Mark it.

563
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,160
-Come on.
-Okay.

564
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
Move!

565
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,760
Let go of him!

566
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,560
Kneel!

567
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,481
Still won't mark it?

568
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,920
Open the gate!

569
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,960
Watch.

570
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,440
Watch.

571
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,639
Keep your eyes open and watch.

572
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,279
Yan!

573
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,320
Yan!

574
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,240
Are you scared?

575
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,719
-Tie him up!
-Let him go! Take me instead!

576
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,040
Easy, easy.

577
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,199
Everyone will get to play.

578
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,520
-You're really going to hurt us?
-Who gave them the right to do this?

579
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
It's the ultimate assessment.

580
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,120
Captive torture training.

581
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,679
This isn't training, it's murder!

582
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,920
Let him go! Come at me!

583
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,200
-Come at me!
-Calm down.

584
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,199
Everyone gets a chance to try it.

585
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,880
Drag him away!

586
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,641
Let me go!

587
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,639
Let go of him!

588
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,560
Take me instead!

589
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,280
You aren't afraid?

590
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
Okay then. As you wish.

591
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,440
Put me down if you dare!

592
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,520
114.

593
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,000
115.

594
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,120
116.

595
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,280
Captain, that's enough.

596
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,439
On the battlefield,

597
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,720
once they are captured,

598
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:13,360
the enemy isn't going to

599
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,039
treat them like human beings.

600
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,720
What about the psychological impact?

601
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,680
They can choose to quit
if they can't handle it.

602
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,839
No one is stopping them.

603
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,279
The best part

604
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,600
is yet to come.

605
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
The oil-dripped lamb skewers
smell so nice.

606
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,040
Shut up.

607
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,360
I can still manage.

608
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,719
This is just the beginning.

609
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,561
31.

610
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:55,727
31,

611
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:56,959
are you still alive?

612
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,920
Just take care of yourself.

613
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,160
31,

614
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,520
hang in there.

615
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,120
They are one of our own after all.

616
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,839
One of our own?

617
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,999
These "one of our own"
are enjoying the food,

618
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,280
after they beat us up so badly!

619
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,280
27,

620
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,200
stop trying to shield me
from those sticks next time.

621
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,560
I'm not weaker than you.

622
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,079
You misunderstood me.

623
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,373
I was afraid you would surrender.

624
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,439
I'd rather die

625
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:24,760
than surrender.

626
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,400
We're fated to go through this.

627
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,959
Just hang in there.

628
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:31,800
Did I permit you to talk?

629
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:33,830
Did I permit you to talk?

630
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,880
You'd rather die than surrender?

631
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,280
You'd rather die than surrender?

632
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:40,685
Hey man,

633
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,520
I talked too!

634
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,360
Come here. I need a beating!

635
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,199
-Come on!
-Be patient.

636
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,599
Did you really have to provoke them?

637
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,959
When they release me,

638
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm going to beat them up real hard!

639
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:01,042
Go down there!

640
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,400
Push them in!

641
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,760
It's nice to be

642
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,560
in the water!

643
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,320
If you're thirsty, just open your mouth!

644
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,479
You had to make this so complicated.

645
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:19,400
I'll say it again,
I just want the coordinate.

646
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,760
Tell me the coordinate,
and I'll let you up.

647
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,680
And I'll feed you food.

648
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,360
So no one wants to tell me?

649
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
Very well.

650
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
I cherish the fact that

651
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:38,080
your comrades are loyal to your faith.

652
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,200
I like it.

653
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
But are you seeing this?

654
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,800
Your comrade is about
to drown in front of you.

655
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,520
He's going to die.
Is loyalty still important?

656
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,239
His parents will come

657
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,120
and ask you why you didn't save him!

658
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,960
How are you going to answer that?

659
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,360
They will never forgive you!

660
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
Still won't talk?

661
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
How are you hanging in there?

662
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,159
Are you going to tell us?

663
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,400
Let's talk about your relationship then.

664
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,600
You all have a lover, right?

665
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,960
After you die,
they will get married with someone else.

666
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,320
He will marry another woman.

667
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,120
She will have someone else's baby.

668
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,760
Have you ever thought about that?

669
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,640
What are they going to do if you die?

670
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,320
You bunch of garbage.

671
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,560
You're worse than garbage!

672
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,638
You just want the coordinate, right?

673
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,476
I'll give it to you!

674
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,601
Zhou Zi Jian, you...

675
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,519
Good!

676
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,120
We got the first one.

677
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,040
Get them out.

678
00:34:39,426 --> 00:34:41,146
Smart people do the
right thing at the right time.

679
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,639
One of you has given in.

680
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,000
The rest of you, there is no point
to continue to be stubborn.

681
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
He's not drowned, is he?

682
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,280
Get him out now. Hurry.

683
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,240
Dude.

684
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,360
Wake up.

685
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,320
Wake up, man.

686
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,800
You must've experienced this before.

687
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,319
Try it again,

688
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,879
experience it better.

689
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,760
Let's get out of here.

690
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,600
I told you, I would beat you up.

691
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
And I did it, didn't I?

692
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:13,209
Captain.

693
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:17,306
What's the matter?

694
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
You got something to say?

695
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,200
Captain,

696
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,880
I think they've reached their limit.

697
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,560
Everyone's body constitution
is different.

698
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,960
Your limit

699
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,601
may not be their limit.

700
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,999
May I express my opinion?

701
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,679
Of course.

702
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,920
No one is stopping you.

703
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,920
Go on.

704
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,440
I believe that

705
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,720
training has to be scientific.

706
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,200
A training like this is beyond

707
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,480
the physical and psychological limits
of normal people.

708
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,320
Driving them to
the brink of mental breakdown

709
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,879
can leave them with physical
and psychological trauma.

710
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,080
Especially female soldier.

711
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,439
The consequences may be immeasurable.

712
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,519
Scientific training is called

713
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,800
polishing.

714
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:02,384
Unscientific training is called

715
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:03,320
steeling.

716
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,639
No one will talk about

717
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,520
science with you in war.

718
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,600
There is only life and death.

719
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,360
If I don't drive them to the edge,

720
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,200
how will they reach their potential?

721
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,440
Keep in mind that

722
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,800
our enemies

723
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,480
are always more ruthless than

724
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,080
we imagined them to be.

725
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,879
Are you trying to

726
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:26,920
kick 31 out with a justified reason?

727
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:28,832
I never said that.

728
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,520
I have nothing against anyone.

729
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,920
This is a fair selection.

730
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:35,472
Alright.

731
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,880
It's about time.

732
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,840
Get them out of the water prison.

733
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,000
Proceed to the next training course.

734
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,560
(Captain, they ran away.)

735
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,360
Ran away? Who ran away?

736
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,440
(Don't worry, Captain.)

737
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,160
(Given their current physical strength,
they can't run far.)

738
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,440
(We'll get them back soon.)

739
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,600
It's fine.

740
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,640
The outer perimeter
is full of our guards.

741
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,680
They won't get far.

742
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:57,801
No need to go after them.

743
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,720
I think

744
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
they will come back.

745
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,320
Nice work.

746
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:11,459
Yan.

747
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,480
Hurry.

748
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,080
Get up, get up.

749
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,081
Are you okay?

750
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,000
Let's stop here.

751
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,840
We're going back.

752
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,200
Going back?

753
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,040
We can't go back.

754
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,879
I don't want to be kicked
into the sewer again.

755
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
I'd rather

756
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
die here.

757
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,369
We have nowhere else to go.

758
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,200
We still have to go back
to the army in the end.

759
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,520
He's right.

760
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,385
We can't be deserter.

761
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,360
We'll do this.

762
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,040
We will go back.

763
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,519
The five of us

764
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,480
will put up a big fight with them.

765
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,120
Are you sure?

766
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,120
Okay.

767
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,600
We've had enough sufferings.

768
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,960
Let's go back.

769
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,640
We can't just swallow this.

770
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,160
Let's do this.

771
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,440
I got your back.

772
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,999
Kids,

773
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:29,760
open the gate for us!

774
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,000
Serve us good food!

775
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,479
Is this how you lead a team?

776
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,520
Run faster!

777
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,799
There you go. You're carrying guns?

778
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,560
Looks like we intimidated you.

779
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,021
Raise it, raise your guns.
That's it.

780
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,601
You're back.

781
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,880
How is it?

782
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,319
I suppose you remember the
coordinate of the training base now.

783
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,320
We've dealt with each other
for some time now.

784
00:39:54,514 --> 00:39:55,994
Show us your face.

785
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,000
Okay.

786
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,320
I'll fulfil your wish.

787
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,440
You're soldiers.

788
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,640
You scared me.

789
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,360
I thought I'd run into a bad guys.

790
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,400
We're on the same side.

791
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,200
Have you got a good look now?

792
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,760
Remember my face.

793
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,040
Remember who's the one who got you.

794
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,320
I told you we should tie him up.

795
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,639
-We should've listened to you.
-You regret it, don't you?

796
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,199
It's too late.

797
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,360
Come here.

798
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,279
I'll tell you the coordinate.

799
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,400
Let me go! Let me go!

800
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,080
Let me go!

801
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:38,753
Don't move!

802
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,760
Don't move!

803
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,080
Or I'll kill myself now!

804
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,840
-Don't move!
-What are you doing?

805
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,320
That's enough, Bai Long.

806
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,300
-You're breaking the rules.
-Breaking the rules?

807
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,441
Do you have rules?

808
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:53,645
What do you want?

809
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:55,280
Let us fight with them!

810
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,400
Let go.

811
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,360
Scatter.

812
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,040
Yue Kong,

813
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,160
if I fight you,

814
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,440
it would be unfair to you.

815
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,800
Yan Po Yue will fight you.

816
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,160
He hasn't eaten anything for two days.

817
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,720
And he was beaten
by you guys for all day.

818
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,480
Let him fight you is
considered a favour to you.

819
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:17,279
Let's fight then.

820
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:18,297
What if I win?

821
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,321
I'll surrender.

822
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
We will all surrender.

823
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,480
Okay.

824
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,480
Bring it on.

825
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,840
What if you lose?

826
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,660
If I lose, I'll obey you from now on!

827
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,239
I'll do whatever you want me to do!

828
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,720
Okay?

829
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,320
Okay!

830
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,681
You all heard him!

831
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,680
We heard it!

832
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,160
Come on!
