(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,204
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:33,829
(Episode 10)

4
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:38,960
We're here.

5
00:01:42,924 --> 00:01:44,403
Brat, what are you doing here?

6
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:46,560
Squad Leader, let me do it.

7
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Don't call me that.

8
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,200
Zhang Tian Yang
is your squad leader now.

9
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,880
Squad Leader,
look at what you're saying.

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,000
Once you're our squad leader,
you'll always be our squad leader.

11
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,279
You led Po Yue before this.

12
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,160
He must've created
a lot of trouble for you.

13
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,721
-Not at all.
-Take more.

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
Po Yue, get me a bun.

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,360
You just joined Squad One.
You should be more sensible.

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,160
Squad Leader, Zhang Tian Yang
isn't someone like that.

17
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,316
Mind your manners.

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,479
Po Yue? Why have you returned?

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,640
So, you didn't forget about us?

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,320
I had to do all your chores
after you left your post.

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,160
I had to pour away the leftovers,
let the dough ferment,

22
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,440
cut onions, peel sweet potatoes,
you name it.

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,399
Look. I've lost weight because of them.

24
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,199
Yeah.

25
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,640
Your cheeks look deflated now.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,000
You must be kidding.

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,040
He takes over 10 buns per meal.

28
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:31,440
It's because he missed you.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,840
Steaming buns is more fun
than handling firearms, huh?

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,999
How many buns do you want?

31
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:49,511
Let's be in the same group

32
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:51,193
for the grappling training later.

33
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,520
Sure.

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,640
It's my pleasure.

35
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,800
You should take more buns

36
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,240
so that you won't be hurt
when I punch you.

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
Are you done?

38
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:01,720
Leave!

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,400
You should beat him to a pulp later.

40
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,519
This Zhou Zi Jian,

41
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,759
where did he get that confidence
when he had already lost to you once?

42
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,680
Enough. Stop creating trouble.

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,320
Go and have your meal.
You have a training to attend later.

44
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,280
Yes, Squad Leader.

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,080
This is the grappling training!

46
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,240
The strong and the weak

47
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,567
will be determined through your results!

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,560
You all can use techniques
you're familiar with.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,520
Do not go any further than necessary!

50
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,679
-Understood?
-Understood!

51
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,000
The first group, Guan Yong.

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,960
Yes, sir!

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,320
Zhang Tian Yang.

54
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,920
-Yes, sir.
-Fall out!

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

56
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,880
Squad Leader,
I won't stand on ceremony then.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,920
Please do so.

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,120
Bring it on.

59
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,240
Guan Yong is pretty aggressive.

60
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,440
He only has brute strength.

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,061
Squad Leader is just playing with him.

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,040
I guess it's time.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,920
For the first group,

64
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,559
Zhang Tian Yang wins!

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,160
You need to train more.

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,319
The second group.

67
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,440
-Gao Zhun.
-Yes, sir!

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,879
-Xiao Yun Jie.
-Yes, sir!

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,080
Fall out!

70
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,440
-Sir!
-Speak!

71
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,279
He's cheating! He threw sand at him!

72
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,880
Do you think your enemies
won't throw sand at you?

73
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Stop!

74
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,239
For the second group,

75
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Gao Zhun wins.

76
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,720
Return to your positions!

77
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,200
Be careful.

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,760
They play dirty tricks.

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,600
The third group, Yan Po Yue.

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes, sir!

81
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,119
-Zhou Zi Jian.
-Yes, sir!

82
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,040
Fall out!

83
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,440
Zhou Zi Jian, hurry and enter the field.

84
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,519
Zhou Zi Jian,

85
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,079
I'll disqualify you
if you waste any more time!

86
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,960
I'll go!

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,239
Prepare for combat.

88
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,120
Wait!

89
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,160
Company Commander.

90
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,399
Instructor.

91
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,519
What are you doing here?

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,880
I heard that the Special Service Company
is having combat training today.

93
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,600
I brought my squad here
to observe and learn from your squad.

94
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,679
That's great. Please.

95
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,720
But observing alone is no fun.

96
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,881
We have to spar with each other.

97
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,000
Spar with each other?

98
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,478
You mean now?

99
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,160
You don't need to come out.

100
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,320
Everyone knows that the top soldiers
of the entire company are here.

101
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,600
Youngsters have great stamina,
while the old have techniques.

102
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,599
Lately, I've been hearing

103
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,040
that someone is going
to take over my position.

104
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,759
That's why I'm here!

105
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,160
Who said that?

106
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,800
Who said that?

107
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,400
So, the Special Service Company
isn't willing to own up to their words?

108
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,879
Sir!

109
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,681
It was me!

110
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,200
-Yan, are you dumb?
-Stop it.

111
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,800
The company commander is here.

112
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:21,400
Squad Leader Xiao,
you're the dragon of Regiment 247.

113
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:23,352
I'm just a low life.

114
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,840
I just want to witness

115
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,880
how a dragon ascends to the sky!

116
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,920
Yan Po Yue, mind your manners.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,600
Instructor, you should grant his wish.

118
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,320
Company Commander.

119
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,560
He's just a kid.

120
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,040
If you want to spar,

121
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:45,346
I'll spar with you.

122
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,360
Company Commander,

123
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,640
I would like to represent
the Special Service Company

124
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,361
and spar with Squad Leader Xiao!

125
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,880
Do not go further than necessary.

126
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Yes, sir!

127
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,679
Why is he using a knife?

128
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,230
Don't say that I'm bullying you here.

129
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,663
It's your win as long as you can

130
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,880
make me bleed.

131
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,841
I thought this was a spar?

132
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,720
Why is he using a weapon?

133
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,000
Stab me.

134
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,184
Do you wish to learn this or not?

135
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,959
Don't worry, Instructor.

136
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,359
I know my limits.

137
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
Good!

138
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,439
Yan Po Yue, what are you doing?

139
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,559
I'm sorry, Squad Leader Xiao.

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,240
Squad One, let's go!

141
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,679
Move!

142
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,559
Are you okay?

143
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,679
He's already a veteran,

144
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,201
yet he's as reckless as ever.

145
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,760
You did great.

146
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,720
Xiao, go easy on me.

147
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,000
You want me to go easy on you?

148
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,120
Why didn't you tell
Xiao Fei to go easy on you?

149
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,606
Give me your hand.

150
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,960
-Bear with it.
-I'll do it myself.

151
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,640
Using ice alone won't do any help.

152
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,760
Squad Leader.

153
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,199
Your wound needs to be treated.

154
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,679
Sit down. I'll help you out.

155
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:53,960
Bear with it.

156
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,359
-Give it to me.
-It has a terrible smell.

157
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,559
Come.

158
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,840
Does it hurt?

159
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm fine.

160
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,840
What's wrong with your leg?

161
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
It's nothing.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,880
Guan Yong,

163
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,079
were you hurt during our training?

164
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,319
No.

165
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:12,819
I'm perfectly fine.

166
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:13,722
Yun Jie.

167
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,900
-Okay.
-Come here.

168
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:16,804
Let me take a look.

169
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:17,879
Squad Leader, stop it.

170
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,119
Don't waste my time.

171
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,960
What did you tie on your leg?

172
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:28,116
Why did you tie
a sand weight to your leg?

173
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:29,304
Squad Leader,

174
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:31,994
I'm doing this to prepare for
the competition tomorrow.

175
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,320
Competition? What competition?

176
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:38,039
They said the last event
tomorrow is trail running.

177
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,840
If I tie a sand weight to my leg
tonight, I can run faster tomorrow.

178
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,320
Guan Yong,
where did you learn that from?

179
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,521
It would be strange
if you could run faster

180
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,280
on the second day
if you tied this to your leg tonight.

181
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,280
Why don't you tie a hot air balloon
to your leg? You can even fly.

182
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:50,945
That's what I thought.

183
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,200
But first, the company commander
must permit me to do so.

184
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,520
Sit down. I'll take it off for you.

185
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,919
-Squad Leader.
-This is an order.

186
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,559
-Squad Leader...
-Sit down.

187
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,200
If you tie this to your leg
for the entire night,

188
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,760
you won't be able to run tomorrow.

189
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:08,007
By the way,

190
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,599
you guys mustn't tell the others
that we're doing trail running tomorrow.

191
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,743
The vice squad leader
said that this is a secret.

192
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,359
In previous years,
the Special Service Company

193
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
did trail running
for the last event as well.

194
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,279
This is not even a secret.

195
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,359
Everybody,

196
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:28,440
attention!

197
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:31,704
Dress right, dress!

198
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
Eyes front!

199
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,899
At ease!

200
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:39,496
My comrades, I know all of you

201
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:43,416
are curious about the last event.

202
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,600
This time,
we will let you all experience

203
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,320
what it feels like to
be in a real battle.

204
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,240
When people are facing
the threat of death,

205
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:05,040
they will be highly focused.

206
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:08,496
Their hearts will
contract and expand furiously.

207
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,559
Time will feel 10 times
or even 100 times slower to them.

208
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,361
I hope you all

209
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,640
can experience
that exhilarating feeling today.

210
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,160
Did you all see that site?

211
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,455
Later, you all need to pass through
that site and acquire the red flag.

212
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,840
I will be on the watchtower
right in front of you all.

213
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,280
I will open fire on you all.

214
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,960
These are rubber bullets
with paint in them.

215
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,520
You will fail your mission if you can't
acquire the red flag in 10 minutes.

216
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,889
Get up! Let's go!

217
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,080
Wait!

218
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,257
Let's go!

219
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,186
Let's go!

220
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,360
This is beyond an ordinary assessment.

221
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
It's too risky to use
rubber bullets against them.

222
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,720
I've reported this to the drill
department and got their permission.

223
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,520
There are three minutes left.

224
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,839
Do we give them a fail
if they can't get through the obstacles

225
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,080
in three minutes?

226
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,360
This is bad!

227
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:20,960
Psycho King is truly a psycho.

228
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,400
He didn't tell us that
there was a wall here!

229
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,880
This wall is at least 3m tall!

230
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
Cut the crap.

231
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,920
Hurry and think of something.

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,199
We have three minutes

233
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,479
before they use the mortar.

234
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,720
-Follow me!
-Let's go!

235
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,720
Watch out!

236
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:39,080
You all have 2 minutes
and 30 seconds left!

237
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
If you all don't advance right now,

238
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,320
the mortar will be on your tails!

239
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:46,280
Squad Leader,
you've been through so many drills.

240
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,560
Can you think of something?

241
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,880
On the battlefield,
there are four solutions.

242
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,439
First, call for reinforcements
to provide fire support!

243
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:55,398
Second, throw a smoke grenade
and affect the enemies' vision!

244
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,800
Third, hide in the same spot

245
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,880
and wait for the enemies
to shift their attention.

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,239
Fourth, think of a way
to take down the enemy gunner.

247
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,880
All of those were pretty useless!

248
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
It's my first time being in
this kind of situation as well!

249
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,600
Vice Squad Leader, why don't we give up?

250
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,640
What are you saying?

251
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,153
He stopped shooting!

252
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,360
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

253
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,560
Let's go!

254
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,400
Hurry!

255
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,480
They have three people left.

256
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,040
I think this can
be considered our victory.

257
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:03,262
There was a long interval
before he shot just now.

258
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:04,976
I'm sure Company Commander
was reloading his gun just now.

259
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,215
He's using a Type 88 GPMG.

260
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,601
It fires 300 rounds in 1 minute.

261
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,840
Its ammo capacity is 200 rounds.

262
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,239
If I include the shooting intervals,

263
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:14,335
he will finish
one magazine every minute.

264
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,600
If eight rounds make one cycle,

265
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,120
according to
his continuous shooting pattern,

266
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,120
he will reload the gun
on the 25th cycle.

267
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,439
Let's follow his shooting pattern
and wait for him to reload.

268
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,400
After that, we'll break through!

269
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,640
No! That's too risky!

270
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
This is our only method.

271
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,399
They will rain mortar on us soon!

272
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,839
Yan!

273
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:40,152
Yan! Yan Po Yue!

274
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,839
Let's go!

275
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:01,560
Time's up! Fire the mortar!

276
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,520
-What's the matter?
-I was shot.

277
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:39,883
Hurry! There's no time left!

278
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,850
Go and get the flag!

279
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
Xiao Yun Jie is right! Hurry!

280
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,400
Come!

281
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,160
Yan, you did great this time.

282
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,760
The company commander is here. Fall in.

283
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,800
Eyes front!

284
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,320
Attention!

285
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,080
Salute!

286
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,680
Company Commander,
we've completed the mission!

287
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,760
Good.

288
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:52,593
I hereby announce

289
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,680
that Zhang Tian Yang's group

290
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:57,400
is the winner of the Special
Service Company's drill tournament!

291
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:02,314
But among them,

292
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:04,914
a person was sacrificed.

293
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,760
Touchwood.

294
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:13,280
-Yan Po Yue!
-Yes, sir!

295
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,200
-Fall out!
-Yes, sir!

296
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:20,961
Right face!

297
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:23,825
Quick march!

298
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:26,896
Halt!

299
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,496
Right face!

300
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,314
Take off your uniform.

301
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:42,108
This is an order.

302
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,384
Did you see the rope ladder on the wall?

303
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,440
I did.

304
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:44,988
Do you know what's the function of it?

305
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:45,676
I do!

306
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,210
Why didn't you put down the rope ladder?

307
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,680
In front of the wall is an open area!

308
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,560
Under such intense firepower,

309
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,320
the more people we send out,
the more casualties we will receive!

310
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,440
I was capable enough
to complete the mission by myself!

311
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:58,050
You're very brave.

312
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,039
You're braver than I thought.

313
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:03,800
People like you

314
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,840
who rush forward

315
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:07,520
in the face of machine gun assaults

316
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,680
will become one of the following.

317
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:11,306
You'll either become a hero,

318
00:25:11,796 --> 00:25:12,676
or a dead man.

319
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,795
Out of 100 people like you,

320
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:16,157
only one can become a hero!

321
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,779
The other 99 will die!

322
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:23,500
Since I'm in a good mood today,

323
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,800
let me hold your memorial for you

324
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:27,840
in advance.

325
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,160
-Zhang Tian Yang!
-Yes, sir!

326
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,732
Take his uniform!

327
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:38,960
Yes, sir!

328
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,920
You two,

329
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,200
come here!

330
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:11,632
Pour this on him.

331
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,960
Let's give
our late warrior a salutation.

332
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:58,360
Remove your helmet!

333
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,919
Comrade Yan Po Yue,

334
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:10,816
you may rest in peace.

335
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:15,257
I will visit your father
with your ashes personally.

336
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,719
I will tell him that you died as a hero.

337
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:20,198
Your father,

338
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,168
he's old now.

339
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,480
He doesn't have a wife or any children.

340
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,977
He's alone.

341
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,161
When he's old, he can
retire in an old folks' home.

342
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,610
Accompanying him

343
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:35,214
will be the military merits
you got from sacrificing your life.

344
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,920
Nonsense!
You don't understand him at all!

345
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,040
Are you sure I'm spouting nonsense?

346
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,552
Your father will grow old eventually!

347
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,325
Your comrades will feel guilty forever
because of your sacrifice!

348
00:27:44,802 --> 00:27:46,442
Your life will end!

349
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:50,199
All of your unaccomplished dreams
will disappear in an instant!

350
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,439
Just now, I had two chances
to shoot you directly.

351
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:05,496
If this weren't a tournament,

352
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,040
and the bullets weren't made of rubber,

353
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,319
if this was a real battle,

354
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,560
you would've been dead long ago!

355
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:19,223
If you put down the rope ladder,

356
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,440
your comrades will try to cover you
by drawing my fire away.

357
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,040
If so, you might still have
a chance to survive

358
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:27,097
and complete the mission.

359
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,599
But you didn't do so.

360
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:33,416
You neglected your comrades
and your team entirely.

361
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:39,710
That's why your sacrifice was
the most nonsensical thing of them all.

362
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,520
Do you think soldiers are consumables?

363
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,880
We train you guys day after day.

364
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,680
From a recruit, you became a veteran.

365
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,199
And you've mastered
various combat skills.

366
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:58,160
Did you guys think we did so
for you guys to be greedy

367
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,760
and end up
being cannon fodder on a battlefield?

368
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,866
Did you guys think we did so
for you to show your bravery

369
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,680
and make stupid decisions
that might look brave on the surface?

370
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,040
-Zhang Tian Yang!
-Yes, sir!

371
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,079
-Dismiss your team!
-Yes, sir!

372
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,800
Everybody!

373
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,719
Left face!

374
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,040
Quick march!

375
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,285
Yan,

376
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,269
let's go back.

377
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,479
Actually, this was my fault.

378
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,880
If I wasn't shot,
it wouldn't have been...

379
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,800
I'm sorry.

380
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,273
Li, don't you think
you went overboard just now?

381
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,279
Thank you, Company Commander.

382
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:03,617
Thank you, Instructor.

383
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:08,233
Company Commander!

384
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:13,400
It was my fault.

385
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:15,176
It was because my leg was injured.

386
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:16,327
My leg was shot.

387
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:18,664
I thought I was a burden to everyone.

388
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,000
That's why I told Yan
to leave me behind.

389
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,041
Vice Squad Leader,
can you please calm down?

390
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,520
Yan Po Yue, I need
to tell you something.

391
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,600
You won the tournament.

392
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,795
I'll keep my words.

393
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:07,888
I'll apologise to you.

394
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,280
I'm sorry.

395
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:12,954
Vice Squad Leader,

396
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:14,992
you're overthinking it.

397
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:16,760
I was already a casualty.

398
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,359
I never go back on my words.

399
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:19,337
Vice Squad Leader...

400
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:20,551
Don't touch me!

401
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,640
We're comrades, right?

402
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,080
Who's your comrade?

403
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,480
These are two different matters.

404
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,840
I'll apologise
as I've lost the tournament.

405
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,200
But, I still don't like you two.

406
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:37,994
Yan, what kind of person is this?

407
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,760
He's so narrow-minded.

408
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,879
What a child.

409
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,880
Now that Kun Meng is dead,

410
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:05,929
our connections with
the mainland's buyers have been severed.

411
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,768
We need to restore
our connections with them.

412
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,239
The Chinese military has tightened
security around their borders.

413
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,601
If we cross the border right now,

414
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:20,482
we won't be able to return.

415
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:26,332
If our connections are severed,
our profit will be affected too.

416
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:30,839
The big buyers from the mainland
will get their goods from someone else.

417
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:33,451
But Daddy Kun doesn't approve of this.

418
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,749
Daddy Kun is unwilling
to take the risk as he's old now.

419
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:40,872
But you need to know this.

420
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,528
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

421
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:46,520
Young Master, I got it.

422
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,520
Find some tough men

423
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:54,058
who know the terrain well
and can speak Mandarin.

424
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,117
Restore the connections for me.

425
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,184
Okay.

426
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,601
But it's hard to find men like them.

427
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,770
So, do you want me to do it myself then?

428
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,480
I'll find them.

429
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:22,383
After so long,

430
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,640
Yun, Yan, you two are finally back.

431
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,320
I heard that you guys had extra
training. Do they want to kill you guys?

432
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,800
Look at all the sweat.
You must've been exhausted.

433
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,080
You just need to do your job
in the logistics support department.

434
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,640
Do you think I'm doing a bad job here?

435
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,723
Try them.

436
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:35,320
Did you make them?

437
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:36,261
You don't say?

438
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,439
Are these even edible?

439
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:38,888
No way.

440
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,281
Where's your conscience?

441
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,760
The future Forbes List's candidate
is making a meal for you two,

442
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,720
but you two are complaining?
Take it or leave it.

443
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,699
Try them.

444
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,277
What do you think?

445
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:52,407
Listen.

446
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:53,520
After you two left the department,

447
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,600
I took charge of the kitchen squad.

448
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,959
I can do anything
and everything in the kitchen now.

449
00:34:59,112 --> 00:35:00,753
Although I'm not
a Michelin three-star chef yet,

450
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,081
-I think a two-star...
-Enough. Stop talking.

451
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,639
-Your saliva is on the food.
-That's right.

452
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,480
-What's the matter?
-Squad Leader made this, right?

453
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
You're wrong.

454
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,840
Squad Leader loves to
use peppercorn in his dishes.

455
00:35:17,903 --> 00:35:19,824
He even uses them in making
shredded pork with bamboo shoots.

456
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:24,049
So,

457
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,479
not only did you try to praise yourself,
but you also didn't make them yourself?

458
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,320
-Am I right?
-This isn't my fault.

459
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,160
He didn't want me
to tell you guys about it.

460
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,410
Where's Squad Leader?

461
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,440
His rheumatism was acting up again.

462
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,215
Guo took him to the medical unit.

463
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,041
Is it serious?

464
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:44,785
He's fine.

465
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:47,058
I think Squad Leader
will retire by next year.

466
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,481
The three of us will be the last batch
of soldiers that he had trained.

467
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,720
You two must prove yourselves.

468
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:53,479
Come, bottoms up!

469
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:01,560
Our division headquarters
has already assigned the mission to us.

470
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,960
My company and the public security
bureau will join hands for this mission.

471
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,720
This is Captain Chen
from the City Council.

472
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,560
Captain Chen,
please give them the briefing.

473
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:17,919
On 1st December, the sentry post
of the border encampment training venue

474
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,120
was attacked by
malicious drug traffickers.

475
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,375
We've been investigating
the case ever since.

476
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:24,696
According to our current intel,

477
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,320
we have a grasp of
the drug traffickers' newest plan.

478
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,800
As armed drug traffickers
are very dangerous,

479
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,207
I would like the Chinese People's
Armed Police to assist us.

480
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,919
After my discussion with
the political commissar,

481
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,199
we will put the Special Service Company
in charge of this mission.

482
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:38,880
You are to join hands with them
and arrest the drug traffickers.

483
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,880
Yes, sir!

484
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,880
The Special Service Company
will be on standby immediately.

485
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,680
We will act
once your order has been issued.

486
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:11,761
(We boarded the military vehicle
that was heading to the border area.)

487
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,640
(Although we know this is a drill,)

488
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,200
(we still wish that
it is a real operation.)

489
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,000
(As soldiers,
fighting in war is everything.)

490
00:37:19,129 --> 00:37:20,360
(All of us crave for)

491
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,439
(merits and contributions
while we are still in service.)

492
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,481
(We want to earn the honour
that belongs to us.)

493
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,280
This time, we will join hands
with the public security bureau

494
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:30,449
to arrest the armed drug traffickers
who had gone into hiding.

495
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,479
The battle plan has been issued.

496
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,719
Everyone must follow the battle plan

497
00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:38,752
to establish a blockade and stay alert.

498
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:41,280
If you find the armed drug traffickers,

499
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:42,992
you may open fire.

500
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,879
You must never let them
escape our encirclement!

501
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:49,239
At the same time,
take note of your own safety.

502
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,560
Yes, sir!

503
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,799
-Yan Po Yue.
-Yes, sir.

504
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,636
Why are you smiling?

505
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:03,121
Sir,

506
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:05,061
I just feel excited.

507
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,720
Look at your magazine.

508
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,241
These are real bullets.

509
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,769
This is not a drill.

510
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:18,004
Yes, sir!

511
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,800
All squads and platoons, right face!

512
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:26,234
At the double, quick march!

513
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,028
All squads and platoons,
enter the designated area

514
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:00,840
and establish a blockade immediately.

515
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,599
Halt!

516
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:30,033
We're entering the warning area.
Unlock your safety trigger.

517
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:35,960
Xiao Yun Jie, Yan Po Yue, fall out.

518
00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:40,680
You two will stay hidden
and stand guard over here.

519
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,080
Squad Leader, why should
we stand guard over here?

520
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,079
Our order was to establish a blockade
at the southern part of the hill.

521
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:47,136
Of course you two should do it.

522
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,840
West of this path is the borderline.

523
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,840
Beyond that lies steep cliffs.

524
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,039
No one will take this path.

525
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,240
Yan Po Yue, do you know
what it means to follow an order?

526
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:54,777
Vice Squad Leader,

527
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
do you know what it means
to use the terrain to your advantage?

528
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,439
Enough. You two will stay here.
Do you have any questions?

529
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,855
Squad Leader,
we will accomplish our mission.

530
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:04,391
The rest of you, follow me.

531
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,703
Yan, it's been more than two hours.
But there's no movement at all.

532
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,240
If this was a real operation,

533
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,920
the drug traffickers
would never take this path.

534
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,120
They will follow the waterway
and escape the border.

535
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:31,431
So, are you saying

536
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,439
that there's a flaw in the battle plan?

537
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,680
It's an obvious flaw.

538
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,961
It's impossible for
the company commander to overlook it.

539
00:40:37,993 --> 00:40:39,513
So, I suspect
this is not a real operation.

540
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,840
I think this is another drill.

541
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,793
Shots were fired!

542
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:52,561
AK-47?

543
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,640
Yan, where are you going?

544
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,120
I'm going to the riverside.

545
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:57,079
The enemies won't come here.

546
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,080
We need to request permission
from our squad leader first.

547
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:01,639
If we wait for his permission,
the drug traffickers would've escaped.

548
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,720
A strategy needs to be flexible.

549
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,880
Are you coming or not?

550
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,159
Let's go!

551
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,481
Yan, last time,
the sentry post was surprised

552
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:21,898
when they were attacked.

553
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,919
This time,
we'll wait for them to come to us.

554
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,219
This feels great.

555
00:41:30,664 --> 00:41:32,144
I see three targets.

556
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,472
Let me see.

557
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,199
They're heading towards the river.

558
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,320
I'm sure they'll cross the river.

559
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:44,768
We'll launch our attack
when they get closer.

560
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,922
We'll force them towards the cliffs

561
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,359
and wait for the others
to surround them.

562
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:50,881
Both of us are more than
capable enough to deal with them.

563
00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:55,553
Let's force them into the river.

564
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:56,824
Remember,

565
00:41:57,258 --> 00:41:58,360
we must capture them alive.

566
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,137
Let's go!

567
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:16,886
Don't move!

568
00:42:18,393 --> 00:42:19,001
Don't shoot!

569
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:19,639
Sir, don't shoot us!

570
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,199
Throw your backpack away!
Raise your hand!

571
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,040
We're tourists. We're just lost.

572
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,640
Don't move!

573
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,721
Buddies, you guys misunderstood us!

574
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:25,679
Our identification cards
are inside the backpack!

575
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,879
If you don't believe us,
we can show them to you.

576
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:27,840
-That's right!
-Show what?

577
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,359
Nothing!

578
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,920
What's with the blinking?
Do you think I'm blind?

579
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:31,959
Our identification cards
are inside our backpacks!

580
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,239
They're in the backpack.
We can show them to you.

581
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:35,080
Raise your hand!
Take them out slowly!

582
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:43,679
-We'll send them to you.
-That's right.

583
00:42:44,377 --> 00:42:45,857
We're just here to sightsee.

584
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,301
Yan.
