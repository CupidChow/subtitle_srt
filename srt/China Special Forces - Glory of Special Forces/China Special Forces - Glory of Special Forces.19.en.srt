(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,800
(Episode 19)

4
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,480
Hurry!

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,120
Every member of the slowest group
has to do 200 push-ups!

6
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,440
Begin!

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,920
Hurry up!

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,160
Listen up!

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,240
At this place, you guys
have no choice to be wolves!

10
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,920
You have to be a bloodthirsty wolf!

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,919
Show me how bloodthirsty you are!

12
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:40,680
Group Two,

13
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,880
begin!

14
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,640
Examine your gun!

15
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:18,840
Group Three,

16
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,799
begin!

17
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,920
It looks like you all are
pretty satisfied with your results, huh?

18
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,720
I will announce your result now.

19
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,800
30,

20
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,800
31,

21
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,160
they barely passed.

22
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,521
The rest of you failed the test!

23
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,440
If you wish to join
the Cheetah Special Forces,

24
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,760
you'd better give 200% of your effort!

25
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
Do you think this is a playground?

26
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,239
In three days,

27
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,438
you guys will go through

28
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,880
a physical shooting assessment
under extreme conditions.

29
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
Those who score 85 points and below

30
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,520
will be eliminated.

31
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,640
Understood?

32
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,840
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,200
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

34
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Stand here!

35
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,760
He's really trying to kill us here.

36
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Does he think that
everyone here is a sniper?

37
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
What?

38
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,760
Is anyone afraid?

39
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:47,880
If you're afraid,

40
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,320
you may quit now.

41
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,719
Sir!

42
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,921
Speak.

43
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,240
I would like to request

44
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,560
additional ammo for further practice!

45
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,600
Do you know
how much ammo you had wasted?

46
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:05,400
How dare you still make such a request?

47
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,640
You'd better use your brain
in our future training!

48
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,400
31,

49
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:25,440
in three days, we'll go through
the moving target shooting assessment.

50
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
I don't want to be eliminated.

51
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
So?

52
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,640
Please teach me.

53
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
I'm not your instructor.

54
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm 31.

55
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,480
I know that.

56
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
I knew you helped me out
during the military dive.

57
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,760
I will repay the favour.

58
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,320
You're overthinking it.

59
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
I just don't want to be eliminated.

60
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
Thanks.

61
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,320
If you want to be an excellent shooter,

62
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,520
first, you must maintain stability.

63
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,840
Stability?

64
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,760
The stability of your heart,

65
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:29,960
your hand,

66
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,280
and your vision.

67
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,720
I started practising horse stance
when I was seven.

68
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,279
When I was 10,

69
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:43,160
I added bricks onto my shoulders
for my horse stance practice.

70
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,920
Now, I can put three bricks on each of
my shoulders during the stance.

71
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,593
I can maintain
the stance for three hours.

72
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:50,953
I think my hand is stable enough.

73
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,360
Are you sure?

74
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,665
Did the targets tell you that?

75
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,160
Let me ask you, how long
can you hold your breath underwater?

76
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:09,200
Around three minutes.

77
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,160
Three minutes?

78
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,000
That's not enough.

79
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:14,680
You need to hold your breath
for at least six minutes underwater.

80
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,600
Ordinary people can only
last less than two minutes underwater.

81
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:23,200
My record is close
to a professional diver's record.

82
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:29,200
I can hold my breath underwater

83
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,280
for 7 minutes and 45 seconds.

84
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:35,759
How did you achieve that?

85
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,200
If you wish to know,

86
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,840
come to my dorm tonight

87
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,440
before the lights are out.

88
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,840
♫ Unity is power ♫

89
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,359
♫ Unity is power ♫

90
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,200
♫ This power is iron ♫

91
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,560
♫ This power is steel ♫

92
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,960
30, you're really muscular.

93
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,400
I heard that this is your second time
enlisting in the military.

94
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,320
That's none of your business.

95
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,640
You're treating me like a stranger here.

96
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,800
We should try to understand each other
so that we can train better.

97
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,520
Just mind your own business.

98
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,720
What kind of attitude was that?

99
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,000
He's just like a log.

100
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,320
So what if you're a veteran?

101
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,880
You might be eliminated too
if we compete fairly.

102
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
Are you arguing with that log?

103
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,520
Why are you everywhere?

104
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:43,080
Our regiment has been relieved of
their duties and transferred away.

105
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:44,800
Do you know where they went?

106
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,880
Where?

107
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:47,680
I thought you were complaining about me?

108
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:50,240
Little Zhou.

109
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,880
Little Jian.

110
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,560
Vice Squad Leader,

111
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,721
I said that out of spite
because that log infuriated me.

112
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,960
I know you're a magnanimous person.
Please forgive me.

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Tell me about it.

114
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,320
You want to know?

115
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,320
Yeah.

116
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,840
Our regiment is serving as
other people's training partner.

117
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,120
Are you serious?

118
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,640
Do you think I'm joking?

119
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,480
This time,

120
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,239
there's no way back.

121
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,960
Thanks, Little Jian.

122
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,359
Yan, where are you going?

123
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Something huge had happened.

124
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,480
It's fine as long as
I haven't been eliminated yet.

125
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,680
Fine, it's not a huge problem.

126
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,680
But it's an important piece of news
regarding our regiment.

127
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,480
Tell me about it.

128
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,880
Our regiment has been
transferred to another place.

129
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,960
Do you know where they went?

130
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,040
The plateau base.

131
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,200
Our regiment and some reformed units

132
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,760
have formed a special forces detachment

133
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,239
at the plateau base training ground.

134
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,520
What's its function?

135
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,720
To serve as drill partner

136
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,360
and imaginary enemies.

137
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,960
All elite units

138
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,079
take turns having their drills
in the plateau base.

139
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,840
They're lining up to shoot our regiment.

140
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,240
To put it bluntly,
we're just their punching bags.

141
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,800
Zhou Zi Jian just told me about it.

142
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,200
Yan, if we go back,

143
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,680
it won't be an escape path.

144
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,080
It will be a dead end.

145
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,880
We'll be punching bags
until we retire from the military.

146
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,800
Do you think we'll be eliminated?

147
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,600
I don't think so.

148
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,760
If so, why are you worried?

149
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,400
Lights will be out soon.
Where are you going?

150
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
I need to go to avoid being eliminated.

151
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,761
Stop.

152
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,080
Sir, I'm looking for someone.

153
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,200
Who are you looking for? There's
only a female soldier downstairs.

154
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,240
I'm looking for her.

155
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,080
Do you think it's appropriate for you
to do so at night?

156
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
-Do it during the day.
-I won't enter her room.

157
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,160
-I just have questions for her.
-What questions?

158
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,200
I didn't go well in the shooting drills.

159
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,520
I wish to learn from 31.

160
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,480
Learn what?

161
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,320
I wish to learn
how to stabilise my body.

162
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,640
Seems like today's drill

163
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,400
has had a huge impact on you.

164
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,144
She helped me out
during the underwater training.

165
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,760
You saw it as well.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,880
I did see it.

167
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,960
31 has participated
in numerous sea training.

168
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,520
Of course she's better
than you underwater.

169
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,600
Besides,

170
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:20,120
when it comes to holding one's breath,

171
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,200
this isn't even her limit.

172
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:26,480
7 minutes and 45 seconds.

173
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,200
That's what she told me.

174
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,280
That's just an ordinary record for her.

175
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,840
Don't forget.

176
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,200
31 is a sniper.

177
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,320
The longer she can hold her breath,

178
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,360
the stabler her body will be.

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,800
How did she achieve that?

180
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:45,400
I thought you were a smart chap?

181
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
I'm not smart.

182
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:48,640
I just want to stay here.

183
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,240
Holding one's breath
looks simple to you, right?

184
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,880
Actually,
there's a technical term for it.

185
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,560
It's called static apnoea.

186
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,440
The best person at doing static apnoea

187
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,840
can hold his breath underwater
for over 11 minutes.

188
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,280
Come, think about it.

189
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,560
What did 31 do before
she jumped into the water?

190
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,039
She took several deep breaths in a row.

191
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,760
That's right.

192
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,160
Our brain

193
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:39,520
constantly monitors
the carbon dioxide content in our blood

194
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,360
and make internal adjustments
according to it.

195
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,720
By taking several deep breaths in a row,

196
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,640
it can expel carbon dioxide

197
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,280
and increase the oxygen content
in our blood.

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
So, think about it.

199
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,880
How many breaths did you take
before you submerged yourself?

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,960
You only took one breath, right?

201
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,800
How many breaths did 31 take?

202
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:57,160
Do you understand now?

203
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:00,560
She had an advantage from the start.

204
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,040
No wonder.

205
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,240
Besides,

206
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,400
when we submerge ourselves,

207
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,720
our skin will start to contract
due to the cold water.

208
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,000
It forces the blood to flow towards
your heart and brain.

209
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:14,159
If you can keep calm at such moments

210
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,240
and think of yourself

211
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
as a piece of rock without
a brain, any thoughts,

212
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,640
or any temperature

213
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,120
and immerse yourself in the water,

214
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,040
your heart rate
will reduce automatically.

215
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,880
It can also slow down
the oxygen flow within your body.

216
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,840
Thus,

217
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,840
it can greatly reduce the amount
of oxygen your body consumes.

218
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,440
At this moment, if you can
stabilise your emotion,

219
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,840
with the help of cold water,

220
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,480
you can reduce your heart rate
to 70% of the usual rate.

221
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,320
Understood.

222
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,520
If I train myself long enough,

223
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,760
I can achieve the same effect
by hypnotising myself

224
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,680
even if I'm on the battlefield.

225
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,080
Alright. Is there anything else?

226
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,799
Give me 10 minutes.

227
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,280
What do you mean?

228
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:04,880
You don't believe me?

229
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:06,560
You taught me how to stabilise my heart,

230
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,480
my hand, and my vision.

231
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,280
-But I still want to...
-What are you talking about?

232
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
You get them through practice.

233
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:15,960
I don't have time for practice now.

234
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,360
Please give me a chance.

235
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,399
You have 10 minutes.

236
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,560
Give me your hand.

237
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,320
This is?

238
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,600
Is this a charm?

239
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,320
How about this?
First, you can do 100 push-ups.

240
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,239
Right after that, hold your breath

241
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,920
and use the needle to carve
a flower on the rice grain.

242
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,800
Carve a flower?

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,720
That's right.

244
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,320
-What kind of flower?
-Any kind.

245
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,120
Chrysanthemum is the hardest to carve.

246
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,840
Sunflower is the easiest.

247
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:19,880
Forget it
if you're not willing to do it.

248
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,400
Carving things on a rice grain
trains your eye and hand.

249
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,640
It's the most basic training.

250
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,760
I've only heard about this before.

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
In order to train the soldiers'
emergency response capability,

252
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,960
the instructors ordered them
to stop exercising immediately

253
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,200
when their heart rates
were at their highest.

254
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:36,473
After that, they'll scatter rice grains
all over the ground

255
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,911
and ask them to pick them up one by one.

256
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,479
The goal is the same.

257
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,640
But this is even harder.

258
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,560
It will overload your heart,

259
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,478
but it will also help you get used

260
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,560
to the overloading sensation
of your heart and body

261
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,280
when you stop your
rigorous movements immediately.

262
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,719
This is how I train.

263
00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:57,880
If you think this is too difficult,

264
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,080
you can try this.

265
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,200
96,

266
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,440
97,

267
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,839
98,

268
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,120
99,

269
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,400
100!

270
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,880
What are you laughing at?

271
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,160
I'm just bad at arts!

272
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,360
I can't carve a flower.

273
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,040
Do you wish to master it or not?

274
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,520
I know.

275
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,120
No matter how strong you are,

276
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:43,720
your body won't be able to take it
when you stay still immediately

277
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,400
after doing rigorous exercises
time and time again.

278
00:18:48,246 --> 00:18:49,440
But think about this.

279
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,440
You're a member of the special forces.

280
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,200
When you're on a mission,
you might be pursued by

281
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,000
100 enemies.

282
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,193
At this time,

283
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,239
you and your teammates
need to retreat with haste

284
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,120
while being prepared for any ambushes
or skirmishes that might happen anytime.

285
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,320
By that time,

286
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,880
do you think it's useful for you
to throw a tantrum

287
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,440
and scold your enemies?

288
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,959
The situation on
a battlefield is different.

289
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,920
If you wish to be calm
on the battlefield

290
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,520
and not drag your teammates down,

291
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,599
you have to learn
how to stay calm even after

292
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,359
you have to stop moving immediately
after doing rigorous movements.

293
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,719
Use your hands that can
carve flowers on a rice grain

294
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,280
to shoot your enemies with precision.

295
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,481
Please tell me.

296
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,040
What should I do

297
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:38,842
so that I can control my body, emotions,

298
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:42,360
and restabilise my hands
in the shortest time possible?

299
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,800
Here are two key factors
in stabilising your hands.

300
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,080
Learn how to deceive

301
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:51,952
and practice your military skills.

302
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,480
First, you need to learn
how to deceive your body.

303
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,400
If you wish to overcome the constraint
of your self-defence mechanism,

304
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,199
you have to generate
a belief that's so strong

305
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,400
that your body

306
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,520
will think that you will die
if you cannot recover stability

307
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,720
from the sudden pause in movements.

308
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,719
Naturally, your body
would release its constraint.

309
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,204
For example,

310
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,160
if a person is hanging onto
a rock wall with his arm,

311
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,000
he will be forced to let go
after a short while due to the numbness.

312
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,280
But,

313
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,280
if a steep cliff is right under him,

314
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,880
under the threat of death,

315
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
he might be able to hang onto the wall

316
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,121
for an hour,

317
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,800
or even an entire day with his arm.

318
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,160
Will this

319
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
really work?

320
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,680
Of course,

321
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,080
you need to go through
certain targeted training too

322
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,560
so that you can adapt yourself
to the ever-changing battlefield.

323
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,760
Try to avoid running
and stopping immediately

324
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:45,222
as it will overburden the heart.

325
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,880
What kind of targeted training?

326
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
To put it simply,

327
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:51,360
make sure to leave some space
for yourself when you move quickly,

328
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,120
unless it's a full-on sprint.

329
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,680
If not, you should be in a state

330
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:57,480
when you run for three minutes

331
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
and rest for one minute.

332
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:05,400
I don't understand.

333
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,880
Learn the tempo from me.

334
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,200
Got it?

335
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,720
Continue.

336
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's do it together.

337
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:36,240
Let's begin.

338
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,680
Bring it on.

339
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,915
Stop.

340
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,800
Left,

341
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,000
right,

342
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,400
left, left?

343
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,800
That's right.

344
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,401
Right, left, left, left.

345
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,320
Right, left, left, left.

346
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,480
Understood?

347
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,360
When you were moving forward, you were
in the Three Charge One Stop State.

348
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,520
Your speed was irregular.

349
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,680
Even if there was an enemy sniper,

350
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,480
it's difficult for him
to take you out in one shot.

351
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,720
That's right.

352
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
It's just like when a vehicle

353
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,080
is trying to escape
the enemy's bombardment,

354
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,760
the driver will accelerate
and decelerate without any signs.

355
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,040
Sometimes, they will take
an S trail when they drive.

356
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,599
It's the same thing.

357
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,600
Let's begin.

358
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,000
If you complete it while
maintaining this state,

359
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,800
you'll be 20% slower than usual.

360
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,119
But do not underestimate
the extra time you took.

361
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,319
It will help keep your heart rate

362
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,360
below its peak value.

363
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,400
I succeeded!

364
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,119
This...

365
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,040
Is this the red flower
your kindergarten teacher gave you?

366
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,800
I don't care as long as it's a flower.

367
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,880
Everybody,

368
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,080
at ease!

369
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,760
Attention!

370
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,880
Dress right, dress!

371
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,760
Eyes front!

372
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,839
This is our first assessment today.

373
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,400
During your march,

374
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,560
you have to shoot
the mid to long-distance targets.

375
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,600
Everyone,

376
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,000
head to Vehicle Three
and get your weapons and ammo.

377
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,120
Group A, get ready.

378
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,280
Group A!

379
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,960
Left face!

380
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,439
Quick march!

381
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,480
Captain,

382
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,280
we've reduced field visibility
according to our original plan.

383
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,000
The visibility on the battlefield
is way worse.

384
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,680
They need to get used to

385
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,280
more than just relying on their vision.

386
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:53,200
More importantly, they need to be able
to shoot while relying on their senses.

387
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,640
Understood.

388
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,520
Number 31 of Group A

389
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,920
has hit all 10 targets!

390
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,800
Number 31 is giving out
a solid performance.

391
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,280
What's the matter?

392
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Do you feel defeated?

393
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,840
Listen, failure is
the mother of success.

394
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,840
You have to be more optimistic.

395
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,119
Zhou Zi Jian,

396
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,160
your name suits you indeed.

397
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,519
You think I have failed
even though it isn't my turn yet?

398
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,846
You should
be more concerned about yourself.

399
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,360
You should be kinder.

400
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,599
Number 30, get ready!

401
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,320
Yes, sir!

402
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,560
Look at his attitude.

403
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,280
Number 30 of Group B has hit 9 targets!

404
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,840
Number 28, get ready!

405
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,440
Number 28 has hit 8 targets!

406
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,560
-Number 27!
-Yes, ma'am!

407
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,440
-Get ready!
-Yes, ma'am!

408
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,959
Number 27 of Group B,

409
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,200
he hit Target Three,

410
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,719
Target Five,

411
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,119
Target Six,

412
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,800
and Target Nine.

413
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,719
He only hit four targets.

414
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,080
This chap...

415
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,640
He has to get a high score
for the rest of the assessments

416
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,800
in order not to be eliminated.

417
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,480
This is your second assessment.

418
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
A simulated roadway with moving targets.

419
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,360
You will form a two-man cell.

420
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,320
If you guys fail to hit
a certain number of targets,

421
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:35,400
not only will you be eliminated,

422
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,920
but you might also
hurt your teammate by accident.

423
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,760
So, all of you have to focus!

424
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,880
Get ready!

425
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,880
Don't you think it's too late
for you to say your prayers now?

426
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,160
What have you been up to?

427
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Useless.

428
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,920
30, you should know what's good for you.

429
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,280
I was just afraid that I might hit you.

430
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,680
With skills like yours,

431
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,439
you will die on the battlefield
from the start, understood?

432
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,520
I don't want to talk to you.

433
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,520
Number 29 and Number 9!

434
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,160
Get ready!

435
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,040
Yes, sir!

436
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,481
-Number 27!
-Yes, sir!

437
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:21,520
-Number 31!
-Yes, sir!

438
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,719
-Get ready!
-Yes, sir!

439
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,079
Quick march!

440
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,760
Get ready!

441
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,000
Remember, stabilise yourself.

442
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,600
Let's go!

443
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:51,306
Number 31 of Group A
and Number 27 of Group B

444
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,760
have hit all 10 targets!

445
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,360
Not bad at all.

446
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,160
He's finally enlightened.

447
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:01,439
He's found a good instructor.

448
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,799
Were you guys referring to Number 31?

449
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:05,720
That's right.

450
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,960
Alright, I'll wait for you guys
at the venue for the next assessment.

451
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,915
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

452
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,400
You guys are too slow!

453
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,920
Even tortoises are faster than you guys!

454
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,360
Gather in front of the targets!

455
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,520
Use the targets as your centre!

456
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,760
Assemble!

457
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,640
Dress right, dress!

458
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,560
Eyes front!

459
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,399
Next, you guys will go through

460
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,879
the physical shooting assessment
under extreme conditions.

461
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:04,233
You all have to get into
your shooting positions

462
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,560
and shoot the moving targets.

463
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,529
Empty your magazine within 30 seconds!

464
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,640
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

465
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,520
First row, fall out!

466
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,159
Remove your helmet!

467
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,680
Put it down!

468
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,760
Get ready!

469
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,120
Cold water flows through the water pump.

470
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,160
When you guys are shooting,

471
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,880
you'll enjoy a cold shower to your face,

472
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,080
and you have to answer random questions
given by the instructor,

473
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,560
-understood?
-Yes, sir!

474
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,600
Load your gun!

475
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,840
Get ready!

476
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,680
Fire!

477
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:27,559
Number 11!

478
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,600
What's the lethal range

479
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,760
of a M18A1 Claymore?

480
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,119
Sir, its lethal range is 50m
and it covers a 60° arc in front of it!

481
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,640
Number 9!

482
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,280
How wide is the flareback danger area
of a Dragon Missile?

483
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,080
Sir, it's 20m!

484
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,040
No, it's 25m!

485
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,560
Are you sure?

486
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,680
Sir, it's 30m!

487
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,800
Number 28!

488
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:57,680
How many personnel
can a M2 Bradley fit?

489
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,849
Sir, it's nine!

490
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:04,360
What's the longest range of
a Mk 19 Automatic Grenade Launcher?

491
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,760
Number 28, are you giving up?

492
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,520
Sir!

493
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,400
It's 1,600m!

494
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,638
I will never give up!

495
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,680
If so, you'd better maintain
a standard position!

496
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,720
Yes, sir!

497
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,200
Number 31!

498
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,920
What colour do you see
when you score a headshot?

499
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,479
Sir, it's white!

500
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,840
What's the furthest distance
where you can see a single tree?

501
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,120
1,000m!

502
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,920
Are female soldiers
weaker than male soldiers?

503
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,640
I'm stronger than male soldiers!

504
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,040
Sir! Shooting complete!

505
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,520
Prove that you're better than them!
Do 50 push-ups!

506
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,120
I can do 100 push-ups!

507
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,960
Do 200 then!

508
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,067
Yes, sir!

509
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,880
-Number 27!
-Yes, sir!

510
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,400
How many C-4 do you need

511
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,440
to blow up a cement wall

512
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,201
about 0.6m in diameter?

513
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,600
Around eight C-4s!

514
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,760
What's the burning rate

515
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,360
of a 0.5mm diameter safety fuse?

516
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,040
If you light the first one
and run back 20m,

517
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,200
after that, you use one second
to light up the second fuse

518
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,479
and sprint 100m
to reach the safety zone.

519
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,360
Assume the two explosives
blow up at the same time,

520
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,921
what's the length of
the two safety fuses?

521
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:28,960
The first answer!

522
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,920
The burning rate of the safety fuse

523
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,480
is 0.8cm/s!

524
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,641
The second answer!

525
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:35,520
I need around 20 seconds to sprint 100m!

526
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
The second safety fuse
needs to be 0.16m long!

527
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,520
The first safety fuse
needs to be 0.2m long!

528
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,440
Sir, I've answered your questions!

529
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,879
Sir, shooting complete!

530
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:50,080
Number 27, do you think you're smart?

531
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,600
No, sir!

532
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,919
I'm just good at counting!

533
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,399
If so, you need to train your body more!

534
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:56,600
Do 200 push-ups
just like the female soldier!

535
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,428
Yes, sir!

536
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:06,720
(Qin Feng doesn't like me,)

537
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,360
(but I have to
force myself to like him.)

538
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,560
(I had to treat every word of his
like the final order.)

539
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,280
(This major can decide
the fate of everyone here,)

540
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,213
(but I will decide my own fate.)

541
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,639
(My final assessment is tomorrow.)

542
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,760
(It's a hellish week.)

543
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:30,120
(I promise you,)

544
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,960
(I will bring honour to Regiment 247.)

545
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,159
One, two, one.

546
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,240
One, two, one.

547
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:32,826
Halt!

548
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,720
Everybody,

549
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:37,466
right face!

550
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,161
Dress left, dress!

551
00:41:44,057 --> 00:41:45,057
Eyes front!

552
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,464
Attention!

553
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,399
Captain, full squad in attendance!

554
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:53,040
Please give us your instructions!

555
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,199
-At ease.
-Yes, sir!

556
00:41:55,018 --> 00:41:55,720
At ease!

557
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:02,440
I'll say something.

558
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,120
At ease!

559
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:07,920
Everyone here was outstanding today.

560
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,080
As a reward,

561
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,120
you can take the day off tomorrow.

562
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,800
What's wrong?

563
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:16,000
Did you guys go dumb
from all the training?

564
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,200
Shouldn't you guys be happy

565
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,800
about receiving news like this?

566
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,399
Alright, I won't say much.

567
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,240
Rest well during your holiday.

568
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,120
Dismissed!

569
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,199
Yes, sir!

570
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,919
He's giving us a day off?

571
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,360
Rest?

572
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:30,959
I don't think so.

573
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:33,639
Why do I feel uneasy about this?

574
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:35,199
Your prediction was never on point.

575
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,399
But why?

576
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,880
How long have we been here?

577
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,560
How long?

578
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,000
I guess it's been more than a month.

579
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,959
It's been more than a month.

580
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,520
Those who were supposed to be
eliminated were eliminated.

581
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,840
The rest of us are staying here.

582
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,399
I'll go to sleep first.

583
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,666
You must be kidding me.

584
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,640
It's never that easy.
