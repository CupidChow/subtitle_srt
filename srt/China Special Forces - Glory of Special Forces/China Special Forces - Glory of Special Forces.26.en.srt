(Episode 26)

4
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,420
Pour it on your leg like this
won't help. Let's go to the hospital.

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,240
Leave me alone.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
That seems serious.

7
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,280
How about we have a rematch

8
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,721
after your foot recovers?

9
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
You won.

10
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,560
Stop showing off.

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,040
I'm not showing off.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Will you stop fighting?

13
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,800
If you want to compete,

14
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,520
let's see who performs
better academically.

15
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,120
What's wrong with that?

16
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,600
Boys with good grades
are the most handsome.

17
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:17,519
Yan Po Yue,

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,720
I dare you to compete with me on grades.

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,960
Bring it on.

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
Next exam,

21
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,793
the one who doesn't come last
will be the grandson.

22
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,040
-How could you suggest that?
-The loser will call the winner grandpa.

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,480
Xia Li,

24
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,040
you're in first place again.

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,920
Make way, make way.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,080
Excuse me.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,080
What do you think, grandson?

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,079
How can this be?

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,240
I answered the questions directly
without even reading them first.

30
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,919
How did you manage to
get lower score than me?

31
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,880
Sorry,

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,640
I drew on the test paper.

33
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,399
My raw score got deducted ten points.

34
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,240
I heard Yan Po Yue draw a portrait
of language teacher on the paper.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,280
I should get going first.

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll leave my cleaning duty
to you today,

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,960
grandson.

38
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,079
Hold on.

39
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,159
(Announcement of Grades)

40
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:10,720
-Call me grandpa.
-I should call you grandpa?

41
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,559
I was the one who came last
in the final exams that semester.

42
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,720
You should call me grandpa.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,639
-Is that what happened?
-Yes.

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,279
Your teacher was so unlucky

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,560
to have students like you.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,000
Ms. Jiao had made a lot of

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,320
memorable comments on us.

48
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:25,121
She said the skin on our face
was thicker than the skin on our heels.

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,840
Even the awl can't pierce through it.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,080
And that guy,

51
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,559
what that guy said about us,

52
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,000
that guy named...

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,720
-Sun Yao Peng.
-Yes.

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Sun Yao Peng said

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,919
we're like urinal pot.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Only the mouth is good.

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,560
Only the mouth.

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,080
Is that girl named Xia Li

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,800
pretty?

60
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,479
She has long hair.

61
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,080
She wears glasses.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,679
Her skin is quite fair.
When she smiles, her eyes squint.

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,520
Her eyes squint?

64
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,439
-That means she isn't pretty.
-No, she's pretty.

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,680
What makes you think she's not?

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,960
Yan Po Yue didn't say she's pretty.

67
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:58,878
So, she surely isn't.

68
00:03:59,119 --> 00:03:59,919
He

69
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,106
really liked her back then.

70
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,399
Oh, come on.

71
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:04,696
Weren't you the one who liked her?

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,240
No, I didn't like her.

73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Why did you fight for her then?

74
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,880
-You did something like that?
-You fought for her?

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
How could you tell them?

76
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:22,720
-Tell us about it.
-Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!

77
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,399
Fine, fine. I'll tell you.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,119
Yes! Tell us!

79
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,313
Actually,

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,999
I didn't fight for her.

81
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,440
About that time,

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,720
well, here's what happened.

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360
Grandpa, want a rematch
on who will come last?

84
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,840
I'm sick of it.

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,159
-Let's compete another thing.
-What does that mean?

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,880
Just because you won once,
you don't want to compete anymore.

87
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,800
This is the review focus
for each subject this semester.

88
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,480
I wrote them myself.

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm the class's study committee.

90
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,760
I have responsibility to improve
the performance in class.

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,880
So, please stop competing already.

92
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,759
Don't worry.

93
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,284
I'll study hard.

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,377
At worst,

95
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:14,046
I'll just call him grandpa
for another six months.

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Why can't you just compete healthily?

97
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
Anyway,

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
no matter what you want to compete,

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,280
I'm all in.

100
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
Xia Li, Xia Li.

101
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,760
Can you come and watch me

102
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,561
play basketball after school later?

103
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,320
Xia Li. Xia Li, let's go.

104
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,920
You can bring them with you.

105
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,039
Jie's grades aren't good.
He isn't serious with his study.

106
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,480
After discussing with his aunt,

107
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,000
we thought that maybe
he should quit school.

108
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,680
What does Xiao Yun Jie think about this?

109
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,680
He...

110
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,560
Well, isn't it obvious?

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
We just want to hear your opinion.

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,160
Are you having financial difficulty?

113
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:58,760
No.

114
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:01,680
We just think this is too hard for him.

115
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,880
Getting a job earlier is good for him.

116
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,240
It'll save you from trouble too, right?

117
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
I want to study.

118
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,600
You want to study?

119
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,400
And this is how you study?

120
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,560
You came last in
your class every year.

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,996
You keep causing trouble.

122
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,240
I want to study.

123
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,120
We heard you.

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,400
Miss,

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,960
it's not that I'm treating him badly.

126
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:25,599
If he really wanted to study,

127
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,992
he would've performed better.

128
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Since the kid already said so,

129
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
just give him another chance.

130
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,560
Xiao Yun Jie,

131
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,120
get good grades in your final exams

132
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,281
and prove it to your uncle.

133
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,360
You see, this is a small town.

134
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,760
You don't want
any rumour get out, right?

135
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,200
Let me tell you,

136
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,280
this is the last time
I came to school for you.

137
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,920
If you really want to study,
I want you to swear to me.

138
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,680
If you cause trouble again,

139
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,200
I will pull you out of school.

140
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
I swear.

141
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,280
What are they fussing about this time?

142
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,880
It's about Yue's classmate.

143
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,040
I feel sorry for that kid.

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,880
His parents were gone.

145
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,640
He's staying at his relative's house.

146
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,800
Over time, they are bound
to have some conflicts.

147
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,280
He went to school
to see the kid's teacher today,

148
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
saying that he wanted to
pull the kid out of school.

149
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,240
After discussing about it,

150
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,560
he decided to give the kid a chance.

151
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,920
His aunt got upset after she heard that.

152
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,240
Saying that Xiao Yun Jie
has occupied his son's place,

153
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,600
that's why she can't get pregnant.

154
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,759
It's feudal superstition.

155
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,040
Exactly.

156
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,280
How are you getting along with that kid?

157
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,480
We're good.

158
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Look at them.

159
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,080
They started studying.

160
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,520
This is a surprise.

161
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,400
-They are sitting together.
-Since when did they get so close?

162
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,041
The late emperor had yet to complete
his life's work when he passed away.

163
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:37,640
The Empire was divided into three.

164
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,680
Yi Province was in dire straits.

165
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,000
Our very survival was at stake.

166
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,120
Xia Li,

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,880
you're late.

168
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,919
I'm sorry, Miss

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,960
I woke up late.

170
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,360
You're late for the first time.

171
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,401
Never again.

172
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,234
Sit down.

173
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,320
Let's focus.

174
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,160
Let's carry on from where it left off.

175
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,960
Starting from "However".

176
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:11,120
However, the ministers in the
capital were not disheartened,

177
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:15,560
and the loyal warriors outside
the capital did not fear death.

178
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,600
What took you so long?

179
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,679
-The line was long.
-What? Louder.

180
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,640
The line was long.

181
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,400
How come Four-eyes,

182
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,520
who is our top student
in class is inarticulate?

183
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,439
Stay away from me.
You might get your saliva in my food.

184
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,880
A four-eyes like you has
the audacity to like someone.

185
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,159
Chen Hui,

186
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,659
you're going too far.

187
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,160
What did I do?

188
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,240
You're afraid that people will know?

189
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,680
Do you think

190
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,400
that guy would still

191
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,640
talk to you if he finds out about it?

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,640
What are you doing, Xiao Yun Jie?

193
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,839
What do you think I'm doing?

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Stay there.

195
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,440
Xia Li.

196
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,440
Come here.

197
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Come here.

198
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,600
Don't be afraid.

199
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,520
She's my best friend.

200
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,480
Nonsense!

201
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,960
On Friday,

202
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,880
we have a new classmate.

203
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:23,292
-His name is...
-Chen Hui!

204
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
What do you want?

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,280
What do I want?

206
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
My shoe is dirty.

207
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,880
Wipe it off for me.

208
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,240
Hurry up.

209
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
When the soup dries up later,
it can't be wiped off.

210
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,680
Hurry up.

211
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,320
You hear me?

212
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
Hurry up.

213
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,400
Xiao Yun Jie!

214
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,880
You can't get into another fight!

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Come on.

216
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,560
If you cause trouble again,

217
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,000
I will pull you out of school.

218
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Who are you?

219
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,960
Who are you?

220
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
Who...

221
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,440
Who are you?

222
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,679
Who are you?

223
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,640
You'd better not let me catch you!

224
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,880
Have you heard?

225
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,840
Chen Hui was beaten up last night.

226
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,400
This is out-of-school assault.

227
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,760
The school will give
severe punishment on this.

228
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,080
He's always causing trouble.

229
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,760
Maybe it's someone
from outside the school.

230
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,840
Four, two, three, four.

231
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,760
Five, six, seven, stop.

232
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,239
One, two, three, four.

233
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:48,719
Five, six, seven, eight.

234
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,000
Two, two, three, four.

235
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
Mr. Cui, please pause this for a moment.

236
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,520
Yan Po Yue,

237
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,400
Xiao Yun Jie,

238
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,560
come with me!

239
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,760
What's going on?

240
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,921
I have no idea.

241
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,520
This is an appalling event.

242
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,680
I hope the perpetrators can
identify themselves.

243
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,906
It's not my wish to see sports
team being punished collectively.

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,800
Miss,

245
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,680
what does this have
to do with sports teams?

246
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,400
The perpetrators put trash can
on his head before beating him up.

247
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,280
That's good.

248
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,960
That's quite smart.

249
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,000
It's a pity that

250
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,320
you didn't use your cleverness
on the right things.

251
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,640
You used it on doing
indecent things like this.

252
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,599
No one wants to admit it?

253
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,600
This wrist guard was found
on the scene last night.

254
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,120
Only our school's sports team has this.

255
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,159
You all have one.

256
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,040
I'll give you one last chance.

257
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:50,480
If you step forward now and admit it,

258
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,880
you'll receive a major demerit.

259
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,234
If you wait until we catch you,

260
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,880
you will get expelled.

261
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,240
You can also expose each other.

262
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:00,280
I know who did it.

263
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,480
Point him out.

264
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,280
It's me.

265
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
I did it alone.

266
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,240
That's impossible.

267
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,520
There were clearly two people.

268
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,720
I punched and kicked fast.

269
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,600
One person equals two persons.

270
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,760
You're lying.

271
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
You don't believe me?

272
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,440
My punches have rhythm too.

273
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,080
Why don't you put on the trash can
and try it again?

274
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,640
-Enough!
-Aunt!

275
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,679
He beat me up.

276
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,239
It takes two to tango.

277
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,640
There are so many students here,
and he only beat you up.

278
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,760
You two, come with me.

279
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,320
Dismissed.

280
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,159
Let me tell you,

281
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,040
you may have thrown away the diary.

282
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,441
But its content

283
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,800
is still in my mind.

284
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,640
I can write it down again.

285
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,640
Disgusting!

286
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Stop beating him.

287
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,080
Chen Hui is a bully at school.

288
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,760
Yue beat him up
because he had it coming.

289
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:39,913
Beating him is one thing,

290
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,680
but leaving evidence behind
and got caught?

291
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,680
Have you learned nothing
from the scout training?

292
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Get out of the way.

293
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,640
So how did it go?

294
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,040
I received demerit.

295
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,680
My dad punished me to do trail running.

296
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,680
It's not that big deal.

297
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,960
Why are you trying to achieve
by training like this everyday?

298
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,520
I don't have anywhere else
to use my strength.

299
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,520
What do you want to be in the future?

300
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,400
I want to join the army.

301
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,040
Join the army?

302
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,280
I'll join too. I'll go wherever you go.

303
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,783
What happened after that?

304
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,800
After that,

305
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,840
I went to the northeast
to attend sports school.

306
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,439
And then, we joined the army together.

307
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,760
That's the end?

308
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:35,924
That's the end.

309
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,720
Did you think this is a TV series?
That there will be a next episode?

310
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,760
We are not interested

311
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,840
in the next episode of you two.

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,400
We want to know
what happened to Xia Li.

313
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,040
Yes, yes. Xia Li.

314
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,920
She went abroad after graduation

315
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,320
and never contacted us again

316
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,160
So which one of you two likes Xia Li?

317
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't look at me.

318
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,880
That's Xiao's dream girl.

319
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,799
Who is my dream girl?

320
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,560
I barely noticed her.

321
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,640
He's being shy.

322
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,920
Alright now. Let's call it a day.

323
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,881
Clean up the table.

324
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:08,120
Get ready to go to bed.

325
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,839
It's too early to go to bed.

326
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,880
There is no lights out sign here.

327
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,759
There is one here.

328
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,879
Rest early.

329
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:17,918
I didn't expect they have

330
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
so many stories in their past.

331
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:20,332
Yes.

332
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,359
If we hadn't locked them up together,

333
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:25,439
we'd never know
the stories of their past.

334
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:27,990
Getting to know each other

335
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:30,541
can improve the relationship
between comrades.

336
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,959
But Guo Xiao Xiao is a female soldier.

337
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,439
Is it convenient for her

338
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,760
to live with male soldiers?

339
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,960
This is the fourth day.

340
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,176
No one sees her as a female soldier.

341
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,840
What's wrong?

342
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,159
I can't sleep.

343
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,319
Trumpet Radio Station is now on air.

344
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,719
I'm your broadcaster, Xiao Yun Jie.

345
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,280
Is there anyone who is still awake?

346
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,160
Yes. Let's chat, Xiao.

347
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,119
Are you missing Xia Li?

348
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,520
Yes, Xiao.

349
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,359
Let's talk about Xia Li.

350
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,520
You're no fun.

351
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:47,705
No.

352
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,760
I have to pee.

353
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,120
We have a female soldier here.

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Use civil words.

355
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,840
Oh, right. Sorry about that, Xiao Xiao.

356
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,720
Wait.

357
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,400
What... What is it this time?

358
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,880
I'll go first.

359
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,840
Look at Xiao Xiao.

360
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,400
She's unabashed and cool.

361
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,479
She's more manly than you.

362
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,760
Stop laughing.
Let's continue the conversation.

363
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,600
Yes.

364
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,160
Let's continue the story telling.

365
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,439
-Whose turn is it?
-Let's continue.

366
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Whose turn is it?

367
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,200
Yue.

368
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,159
Yue.

369
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,240
Wake up, Yue.

370
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,200
What's wrong?

371
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,560
-Let's continue the story telling.
-What were you thinking about?

372
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
Tell us a little.

373
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,840
It's nothing.

374
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,000
It's just that

375
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,119
Xiao Yun Jie and Yan Po Yue's stories

376
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,680
reminded me of my two friends.

377
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,720
What friends?

378
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:33,960
-Tell us.
-Tell you what?

379
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,840
Tell us more.

380
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,040
But don't just talk
about the fights you had,

381
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,080
tell us a love story too.

382
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Yes, yes.

383
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't have any love story to tell.

384
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,480
Impossible.

385
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,200
You're not young.

386
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,119
You must've had a girlfriend before.

387
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,240
Xiao Xiao, Xiao Xiao,

388
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,160
go back to your bed.

389
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,600
Yue is going to tell us his love story.

390
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,760
-Let's clap our hands for it.
-Yue, tell us.

391
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,600
You have to tell us.

392
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,040
Tell us a little bit.

393
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,160
If you want to talk about relationship,

394
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:08,014
I'm not sure if that time
counts as a relationship.

395
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,921
When I was little,

396
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
I was very naughty.

397
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,360
My two friends and I

398
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,961
grew up in armed police family quarters.

399
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,400
When I was a child, I often
took them causing trouble.

400
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,680
Three.

401
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,720
Four.

402
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,560
Five.

403
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:42,880
Brat.

404
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,125
-Dad.
-Are you playing with gun again?

405
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,640
How many times have I told you
not to play with gun?

406
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,520
Have you forgotten that
you almost blinded someone last time?

407
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,079
Why haven't you learned your lesson?

408
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,640
Where is your mum?

409
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,280
Why hasn't she told you to stop?

410
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,760
Let me take a good look at you.

411
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,560
You haven't been home for a long time.

412
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,799
As soon as you come back,
you start lecturing him.

413
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,520
He's already like this now.

414
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,760
If I hadn't lectured him,
he would've become worse.

415
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,720
When have you ever
had time to teach him?

416
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,680
You see,

417
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,120
I'm home now, aren't I?

418
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,559
I came back just to see you,

419
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,239
and take care of something.

420
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,040
Have you washed you hand?

421
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Did something happen?

422
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,600
Why are you bringing this?

423
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,040
A little assignment.

424
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,320
I have to leave at dawn.

425
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,360
Speaking of which,

426
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:31,062
I haven't slept all day.

427
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,320
I'm going to take a nap now.

428
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,200
Okay.

429
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,680
Go in and lie down.

430
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,560
By the way,

431
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,481
don't let him play with gun anymore.

432
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,480
What if he really shoots someone?

433
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,640
Don't worry about him.

434
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,560
He'll be fine.

435
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Go lie down.

436
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,440
Yue Kong,

437
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:46,693
go back to your room
and finish your homework.

438
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Let Dad rest a while.

439
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,079
This is a real gun.

440
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
This is a Type-92 semi-automatic pistol,

441
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
with 5.8mm calibers.

442
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,080
That's so cool.

443
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,800
My dad owns a 9mm one.

444
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,920
Right.

445
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:49,753
Only regimental level and above
are eligible to be equipped with this.

446
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,920
This gun is highly accurate.

447
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:55,479
It has low recoil and
exceptionally fast rate of fire.

448
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,799
Do you want to try it?

449
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Don't be afraid.

450
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,439
Look. This is the safety pin.

451
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,839
It's on.

452
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,960
So, it's safe.

453
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,040
Even if I pull the trigger,
it won't shoot.

454
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,280
It's fine, isn't it?

455
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,080
Want to try it?

456
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,910
Pull the trigger.

457
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,079
Okay, now,

458
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,359
I'll be the commander.

459
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,959
Wang Fan He will be the security guard.

460
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:39,040
Dai Jin, you'll be my medic.

461
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,840
-Okay.
-You three will be terrorists.

462
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,680
You are attacking
my command headquarters.

463
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,639
-Got it.
-Yes.

464
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:53,566
Li Jie, you're dead.

465
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,120
Wang Fan He, give me the gun.

466
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,480
You're shot.

467
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:00,600
Watch out, Yue Kong.

468
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,760
Well done, Wang Fan He.

469
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,199
But you're dead.

470
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,440
Wang Fan He, you made a contribution.
I'll avenge you.

471
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,199
You've been captured. Surrender.

472
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,599
A commander

473
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,800
will not surrender.

474
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,279
Dai Jin, shoot!

475
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,600
(An old hand grenade was
found in a construction site)

476
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,960
(in our city during
foundation excavation.)

477
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,800
(According to experts,)

478
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,520
(the grenade dated back to
anti-Japanese war period.)

479
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,560
(Despite it has been a long time,)

480
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,241
(it's still dangerous.)

481
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,440
(At the moment, the site has been
controlled by the armed police forces.)

482
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:48,960
(Evacuation is being carried out.)

483
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,240
(Removal operation
will take place tomorrow.)

484
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,732
You have gotten

485
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,360
your dad into a huge trouble this time.

486
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,680
He has been summoned by his superior.

487
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,240
I wonder if he's fine.

488
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,960
This is all Wang Fan He's fault.

489
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,161
You've been running
around with him all day.

490
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
He has gone too far this time.

491
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,680
Mum,

492
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,400
I gave him the gun.

493
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,599
I asked him to pull the trigger.

494
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,920
You're still defending him?

495
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:17,319
You almost got killed, you know?

496
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,800
Mrs. Yue, we're here to see Yue Kong.

497
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,920
-I hope he didn't get frightened.
-Come in.

498
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's just flesh wound.

499
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,200
He's fine.

500
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,560
It's just that he hurt his right arm.

501
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,120
He can't do his homework now.

502
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
We are really sorry, Mrs. Yue.

503
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,119
This is all Wang Fan He's fault.

504
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,080
If you want to beat him or punish him,

505
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,640
I've brought him here to you.

506
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,760
Kneel!

507
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,440
Look what you've done.

508
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,600
Mum, I'm fine.

509
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,480
We'll go to my room.

510
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,710
Be careful.

511
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,640
Is Dai Jin okay?

512
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,560
She was awfully frightened.

513
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,640
I told her not to come see you first.

514
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,800
In case she cries if she sees you.

515
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,079
And we'll get caught.

516
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,599
If the adults find out that

517
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:15,200
she was the one who shot you,

518
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,760
I think

519
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,840
her mum will probably

520
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,040
lose her nurse job.

521
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,160
Wang Fan He,

522
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,160
that was so smart of you.

523
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,040
Ouch, ouch.

524
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
Are you okay?

525
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,880
I'm fine.

526
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,080
I didn't think too much at that time.

527
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,640
I just didn't want to see her cry.

528
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,400
Where is the wound?

529
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,279
Let me see it.

530
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,599
There is nothing to see.

531
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,920
It's completely healed.

532
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,279
Yue, so the first time you
were heroically wounded,

533
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,560
you were shot by a girl.

534
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,959
And after that, your buddy
had to take the blame for her.

535
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,400
Impressive.

536
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,199
At that time,

537
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,200
we didn't have any concept about gender.

538
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:52,560
We just thought that

539
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,360
this is a matter of man.

540
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,960
We can bleed and sweat,

541
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,640
but we shouldn't get a girl involved.

542
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,919
You made such a huge trouble.

543
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
Didn't your father get punished?

544
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:03,840
Of course he did.

545
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,800
He gave me a good beating
after he got home.

546
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:07,160
Now that I think about it,

547
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,040
that was the first time
my father hit me.

548
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,361
You're dead, you punk!

549
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,640
You're dead!

550
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,680
Yue Bai Shan, just take it out on me!

551
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,280
-You just wouldn't listen!
-Stop beating the kid.

552
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,119
Stay out of this.

553
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,359
He is injured.

554
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,599
He was shot by someone else.

555
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,000
Why are you punishing him?

556
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,841
Do you know that because of this,

557
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,720
all my hard work over the
past decade has been wasted?

558
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,680
Dad,

559
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,320
when will you take me
to the shooting range

560
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,761
to use the real Type-95?

561
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,560
You little punk.

562
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,320
You're talking back?

563
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,040
(Ever since then,)

564
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,240
(my dad wouldn't let me
touch any gun anymore.)

565
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,160
(But I found ways.)

566
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,920
Where is the grenade?

567
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,720
(I,)

568
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,560
(Wang Fan He,)

569
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,560
(and Dai Jin)

570
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,480
(just grew up together like that.)

571
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,960
(We were known as
the Three Musketeers Of The Quarters.)

572
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,199
(We often dressed up in
the adults' uniforms)

573
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,840
(and wandered around the barracks.)

574
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:19,413
(Without realising it,)

575
00:28:19,494 --> 00:28:21,920
(Dai Jin has turned into
a beautiful lady.)

576
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,959
(She's still jumping up and down)

577
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,239
(with us like monkeys,)

578
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,760
(but to say that
I feel nothing for her,)

579
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,761
(that's impossible.)

580
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,560
We're here.

581
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,721
Behave yourselves.

582
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,200
Quick march!

583
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Halt!

584
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
(Restricted Area)

585
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,200
We're here to
take guns for our training.

586
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,639
Will this really work?

587
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,239
Maybe we should run.

588
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,479
Don't run.

589
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Keep your head held high.

590
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,520
There isn't any training today.

591
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,760
Why do you need guns?

592
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,400
Squadron leader is worried that we
can't pass our performance assessment.

593
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,600
He wants us to practice more.

594
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,520
Where are your IDs?

595
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,360
I mean,

596
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
they left it in their dorm.

597
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,040
I'll go with them to get it.

598
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,560
-Stop!
-Run!

599
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,440
Stop right there! Stop!

600
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,280
Run!

601
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,480
Hurry!

602
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,520
Wait.

603
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,200
Here's fine.

604
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:13,599
We're safe.

605
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,600
I say,

606
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,640
Yue Kong,

607
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,720
can we stop doing
such dangerous things?

608
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,119
This isn't dangerous.

609
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,721
I'm going to military school.

610
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,640
After I join the army,

611
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,406
I will shoot guns every day.

612
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:30,239
I won't need to hide anymore.

613
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
And nobody can control me.

614
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,960
Looks like

615
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,760
you've made up your mind.

616
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm not like you, Yue Kong.

617
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,680
You got good grades.

618
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,560
You can attend any school you want.

619
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,079
I'll work harder.

620
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,574
I'll try to get into military school
and get an official post.

621
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,000
Dai Jin,

622
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,399
what major will you study?

623
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:54,898
How about

624
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,166
we go to the military school together?

625
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,600
I don't want to.

626
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,200
I want to attend art school.

627
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,480
We will get to buy your
paintings in the future then.

628
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,400
You will have to make good money.

629
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,600
My paintings are going to be expensive.

630
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,360
We can do it!

631
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
We can do it!

632
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,680
We can do it!

633
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,679
(A bike has been following me)

634
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,839
(when I go home after class lately.)

635
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,321
(I'm a little scared,)

636
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,891
(but I don't dare to tell my mum.)

637
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,240
(Can you two come and pick me up
after your evening study?)

638
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,040
Dai Jin.

639
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,120
You're Dai Jin, right?

640
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,640
Don't get me wrong.

641
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,040
I just want to make friends with you.

642
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,720
I don't know you.

643
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,080
Why should we be friends?

644
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,520
Well, you know me now.

645
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,800
From now on,

646
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,440
I'll walk you home.

647
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,720
Let go of me!

648
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,520
Let go!

649
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Let go...

650
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,160
Let her go!

651
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:25,000
Fan He, I'm here!

652
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm having a fight with my wife.
It's none of your business. Scram!

653
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm not your wife.

654
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,080
-Let go!
-Get your hands off her!

655
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,814
I've called the cops.

656
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,040
We're classmates.

657
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,960
Even if the cops are here,
they can't do anything about this.

658
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:42,760
I'm not your classmate.

659
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,040
Let go of me!

660
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
So many of you bullying
a girl like this is uncool.

661
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,000
If word gets out,
people will criticize you.

662
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,398
How about this?

663
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,480
I'll fight you one-on-one.

664
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,800
The loser

665
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,160
will scram!

666
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,680
I never fight one-on-one.

667
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,900
Come here.

668
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,360
Come.

669
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,440
Who are you trying
to scare with a stupid knife?

670
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,921
Put down the knife,

671
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,000
release the girl,

672
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,121
and we'll all be fine.

673
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,920
What if I don't release her?

674
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,440
If you don't,

675
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,561
we'll all die here.

676
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,720
Did you dig that soil clod
from your grandpa's grave?

677
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,800
You think that will scare us?

678
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,399
Whether it's soil clod or not,

679
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,080
we'll find out after I light it up.

680
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,960
Go ahead! I dare you to light it.

681
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,040
Dai Jin.

682
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,480
Dai Jin, Dai Jin.

683
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,280
Run! Run!

684
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,360
Go after them!

685
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,160
I'm not going to beat you today.

686
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,479
From now on,

687
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,520
you will stay home and study.

688
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,879
Don't even think

689
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
about joining the army.

690
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,021
Dad.

691
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,000
So you were the one who sabotaged
the mine removal mission back then.

692
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,399
You were still little at that time.

693
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,520
Your arm was injured, yet you
still managed to dig out the mine.

694
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,480
Let me tell you,

695
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:54,399
if someone like you joins the army,

696
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,960
you will only get other people killed.

697
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,320
-I...
-Yue.

698
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:01,304
Yue Kong,

699
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,559
with your grades,

700
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,240
you can get in a prestigious university.

701
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:05,720
Your English is so good.

702
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
You can become a diplomat too.

703
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,080
Mum,

704
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,520
you know about my dream.

705
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:12,160
You are not in position
to talk to me about dreams.

706
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,840
You want to talk about dreams?

707
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,320
if someone like you joins the army,

708
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:16,804
you'll become a typical
black sheep, you know?

709
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,719
Yue!

710
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:21,999
You want to talk about dreams?

711
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,639
You'd better behave yourself first.

712
00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:32,973
If you're outstanding,

713
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:34,953
no matter where you go,
you will always be outstanding.

714
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:36,593
It doesn't have to be the army.

715
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,559
Everyone's genes are different.

716
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,719
And my genes,

717
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,879
other than a soldier,

718
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,720
I can't be anything else.

719
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,280
Have you tested it?

720
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
(Yun Ling Academy Of Fine Arts)
(Admission Notice)

721
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,439
Wow.

722
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,879
The 3rd place.

723
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,600
Over 1,000 people
applied for art school this year.

724
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,199
And you got the 3rd place.

725
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:14,719
Impressive, right?

726
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,879
It's just okay.

727
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,521
It's an affiliated art school.

728
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,159
English results of our main campus

729
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,799
are among the top schools
in the country.

730
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,479
If you are that good,

731
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,120
try to apply and see if you can get in.

732
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,280
Don't provoke me.

733
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,680
Well,

734
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,519
if you really get in,

735
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,839
I will have to see you
every day in university.

736
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,080
It's annoying even thinking about it.

737
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,520
I'll have to think about it.

738
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,040
(After that,)

739
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,080
(Dai Jin went to the art school
as she wished.)

740
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,886
(And I got into Yun Ling University
as well, and majored in English.)

741
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,240
(We started seeing each other)

742
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,000
(in university.)

743
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
(Join The Army, Brother)

744
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,320
(Join The Army)

745
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,840
Having a boyfriend who grew up
together is different indeed.

746
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:21,875
-Go on.
-Okay.

747
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:22,996
-Bye.
-Bye.

748
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,520
What are you looking at?

749
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,800
Nothing.

750
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,479
Let's go. Wang is waiting for us.

751
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,159
He finally has some time off.

752
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,600
After getting into university,

753
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,110
Dai Jin has become
more and more beautiful.

754
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,879
She pays lots of attention
on her appearance now.

755
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,239
-Is it?
-She keeps asking me

756
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,080
if her lipstick colour is nice.

757
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,805
For me, the colours are
just red, pink or orange,

758
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:49,719
right?

759
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,040
What red, pink or orange?

760
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,520
Every colour is different, okay?

761
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,360
Stop.

762
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:55,000
No public display of affection
in front of me.

763
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,440
Things are going
so great between you two.

764
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,680
When are you getting married?

765
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,160
Getting married?

766
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,800
I've discussed with Mrs. Yue.

767
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,639
Yue Kong is interning in
Ministry of Foreign Affairs next year.

768
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,080
And I will stay in school
and become a lecturer.

769
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,920
Once we have stable job...

770
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,840
-What?
-Have some vegetables.

771
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
Enough about us.

772
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:14,639
How's your life in the army?

773
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,081
What is your usual training?

774
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,000
Cultural courses, tactical theory,

775
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,080
the latest technology,

776
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,040
the latest weapons.

777
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,360
My daily training includes
weight-bearing race,

778
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,549
wrestling and shooting.

779
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,720
That doesn't sound special.

780
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,600
Hang on,

781
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,560
have you ever driven
infantry fighting vehicle?

782
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,720
Type 92.

783
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
This is our most basic training course.

784
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,360
And we can practise shooting.
Type 88 rifle, QBZ-95 rifle,

785
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
high precision rifle.

786
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,679
We practise with real bullets everyday.
It's professional.

787
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:40,761
You make it sound so good.

788
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:42,778
-Are you better than special forces?
-I'm no match for them.

789
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,320
But I'm much stronger than you now.

790
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,840
I don't believe it.

791
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,960
Let's fight someday.

792
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,840
Sure.

793
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,160
You have a thesis to write.

794
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:51,920
Don't mind him.

795
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,840
He always wants to compete
with me since we were little.

796
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,400
-You think you can beat me?
-Why can't I beat you?

797
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,839
Tell me, how can you beat me?

798
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,040
Eat your food. Dai Jin, eat your food.

799
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,520
-Come on, cheers.
-He's like a kid, you know.

800
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
(Application Form)

801
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,440
He applied to join the army in secret

802
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,680
when he could just study in university.

803
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,280
This kid always does things his own way.

804
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,080
He takes after you.

805
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,320
What does this have
anything to do with me?

806
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:06,233
Dad,

807
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,760
Mum,

808
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,120
don't worry.

809
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,800
Your son will do great in the army.

810
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,400
If I had known this would happen,

811
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,520
I would've let you
attend military school.

812
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,680
You can only be a private now.

813
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,200
Yue,

814
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,760
do you know the leader
of his detachment?

815
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,480
Fine, fine.

816
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,240
Mum,

817
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,720
don't worry.

818
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,040
Obeying orders is the duty of a soldier.

819
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,240
If you dare to misbehave in the army,

820
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,080
I'm going to teach you a
lesson when you come home.

821
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,240
Mum,

822
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,360
why don't you go home first?

823
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,960
Take good care of yourself.

824
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,040
I'm sorry.

825
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,560
I didn't think you'd come.

826
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,440
Don't you think
you're being too selfish?

827
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,120
What about our plans?

828
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,440
I'm sorry,

829
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,160
but your plan is not
what I want in life.

830
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,520
I've finished university with you.

831
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,360
Can you let me fulfil my dream now?

832
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,640
If I don't join the army,

833
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,720
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

834
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,280
You've been like this
since you were little.

835
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,280
Forget it.

836
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,760
I'll give you another chance.

837
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
I'll wait for you
to return from the army.

838
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,560
(Just like that,)

839
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,681
(my once interrupted
military life restarted.)

840
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,360
(Soaking in sweat,)

841
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,839
(mud, and water every day,)

842
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,560
(I finally felt like I'm alive.)

843
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,840
What's the use of fighting

844
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,160
for these vain things?

845
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
You won't be able to get one
even if you want to.

846
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,961
Because your dad isn't
a military commander.

847
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,920
What are you talking about?

848
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,320
I got this all by myself.

849
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:40,708
Whatever you say,

850
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,720
Young Master.

851
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,520
Everyone knows the detachment commander
is sending you for further study.

852
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,360
Of course the Most Outstanding Soldier
award can only be yours.

853
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,213
Yue Kong of 3rd Platoon,
1st Squadron.

854
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Someone is here to see you.
