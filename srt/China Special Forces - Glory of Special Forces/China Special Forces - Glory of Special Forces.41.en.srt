00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,203
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:30,960
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,880
(Episode 41)

4
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,599
Your enemies used an
infrared anti-sniper detection system.

5
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
When a sniper pulls the trigger,

6
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,561
the bullet trajectory
will be traced immediately.

7
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,680
And, it will launch an accurate
retaliation at the perpetrator.

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,079
No matter how tough you are,
you won't be able to avoid it.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,239
If our enemies

10
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,799
is equipped with better equipment
and technology than us,

11
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,199
no matter how good our marksmanship is,

12
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,681
it doesn't serve any purpose.

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,200
Staff Officer Ai,

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,961
we're

15
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,000
not in a class now.

16
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,520
I know.

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,721
Cheetah Commando's confidence

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,199
is tempered through real combats.

19
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,965
But have you ever thought about this?

20
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:19,300
When you're struggling
in bloodbath over and over again,

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,680
military technologies
are still developing rapidly.

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
In the future,

23
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,760
we need more highly educated and
well-qualified special unit commanders

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,044
who're staying ahead of the curve
and who're far-sighted

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,960
to push through the reform
of special forces in China.

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,400
Only then,

27
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,119
we can catch up with other veteran
special forces active around the world.

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
You're saying

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,560
veterans like us

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,200
will be eliminated soon?

31
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,671
If you can't keep up with the times,

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,717
your pride and experience

33
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,400
will definitely become a hindrance to
the development of Cheetah Commando.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,120
Staff Officer Ai.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
See you in class.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
Before you depart tomorrow,

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,760
I'll give all of you
an important lecture

38
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:16,520
in the information command centre

39
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
so that you will understand

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,959
the reasons
why you will be eliminated soon.

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,479
I look forward to it.

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,281
What are we doing here?

43
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,600
We're here for a class.

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,640
What class?

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,840
Staff Officer Ai

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,360
is giving us a lecture.

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,720
Staff Officer Ai?

48
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
Not bad.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,680
We're having a class.

50
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,080
Salute!

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,320
Down!

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
I would like to thank everyone

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,119
for making time to be here today.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
I would like to thank the detachment

55
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
for allowing me to use this
information command centre.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,639
The title of today's lesson is called

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,080
"The Age of War".

58
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,598
(Macedonian Phalanx)

59
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,760
Take a look at the screen.

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,200
This is Macedonian Phalanx.

61
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,964
The primary phalanx
is formed by 4,096 soldiers.

62
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,159
In addition to the 4,096
heavily armoured infantrymen,

63
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,720
there are also light infantry,
cavalry, auxiliaries

64
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:39,419
and mobile escorts on either side,

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,759
for a total of 8,192 men.

66
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,519
These over 8,000 men

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,680
make up exactly a

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,200
primary Macedonian phalanx
as we can see in the image now.

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,801
This primary phalanx brings
the collective strength of humans

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,400
to the extreme through
training and military discipline.

71
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,119
When they're fighting on a battlefield,

72
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,758
skilled soldiers in the first five rows

73
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,041
kill the enemy
with spears in their hands.

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,519
When soldiers in the first row
are killed in battle,

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,880
the second row immediately
fills the empty spots.

76
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,880
The phalanx rolls on in cycle,

77
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,920
aiming to crush each and every target

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,079
that stands in their way

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,281
until they wipe off their enemy.

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,641
Four primary phalanxes

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,120
form a combined phalanx.

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,880
This is the real composition
of the Macedonian phalanx,

83
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,999
an invincible chariot
in the cold weapon era

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,360
that consists over 30,000 soldiers.

85
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,599
Elites,

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,717
the training that you've received,

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,160
and knowledge that you've mastered,

88
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:45,440
are far more advanced than the
ancient Greek era by thousands of years.

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
Think about it.

90
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,113
What is the best way

91
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,800
to break the Macedonian phalanx
from the front?

92
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,000
It's easy.

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,399
Just use trebuchet

94
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,079
or send a troop of vanguard cavalry
to break through the formation.

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,040
That won't do.

96
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Firstly, we don't have
enough time to do so.

97
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,040
Secondly,

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
it is an act of suicide.

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,959
Give me a heavy machine gun.

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,640
Then, I can kill all of them
from the front.

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,719
Bai, you might as well use a rocket.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,359
Gun wasn't invented yet
in the cold weapon era.

103
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,515
Could you travel through time and space?

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,599
If you could only use cold weapons
to fight on the battlefield,

105
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
what could you do?

106
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,960
Your skills are beyond
ordinary soldiers.

107
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,480
But when you're facing

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,462
a frontal attack launched through
the collective strength of humans,

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,999
you serve no purposes at all.

110
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,185
To deal with the phalanx

111
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,668
that pushes the collective strength
of humans to the extreme,

112
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:41,766
the only way

113
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
is to invent firearms.

114
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,840
Look at the screen.

115
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:01,160
The Matchlock looks a
little outdated and primitive,

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,126
but its presence caused
tactics and cold weapons

117
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,640
like the Macedonian phalanx to
be replaced by firearms together.

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,360
Following that, human warfare

119
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,040
entered the era of hot weapons.

120
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,119
During World War I,

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,760
both sides were no longer
fighting in term of physical strength,

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,161
but firepower.

123
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,399
Machine gun bunkers,
trenches and barbed wire

124
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,720
became the hardest tactical combination
to conquer in that era.

125
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,160
(World War II)
But in a short period of time,

126
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,480
during World War II,

127
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,280
the ultimate tactical combination
was completely routed

128
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,039
in the Lightning War where
attacks were advanced by tanks.

129
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,879
Battleships and aircraft carriers

130
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,600
launched the most intense attacks

131
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,279
to compete for the supremacy of the sea.

132
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
(World War II)
At the same time, in the sky,

133
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:45,760
all kinds of fighter aircraft were
being upgraded at an alarming rate.

134
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,720
That era is known as the era
of massive mechanised warfare

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,079
by military historians.

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,841
Then, the Gulf War ensued.

137
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,000
At the outbreak of
the Gulf War in the 1990s,

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,399
(The Gulf War)
the military elite of various countries

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,239
were still excitedly predicting

140
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,280
how many casualties it would cost
and how long it would take

141
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,960
or the US-led multinational coalition
to defeat the Iraqi army,

142
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,721
which had 77 divisions and a
total strength of 1.2 million fighters.

143
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,360
Even the most aggressive
and courageous combat staff officers

144
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,198
were of the view that
the US-led multinational coalition

145
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,912
would take at least half a year
to win the battle.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,480
Some pessimists even thought

147
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,000
the US would be in trouble again in this
war, as happened in the Vietnam War

148
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,280
where they're dragged into
a long-lasting war.

149
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:35,601
In the end, they would
retreat from the battlefield

150
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,721
in a disgraceful way.

151
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,200
Soon,

152
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,878
they found that they're wrong.

153
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,080
Yan.

154
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
What is Staff Officer Ai trying to say?

155
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,919
We are...

156
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,879
We're just like the Macedonian phalanx
which was unwilling to move forward.

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,880
Are you done?

158
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,039
Yes.

159
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,599
Please go on.

160
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,201
If China Special Forces

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
want to catch up with the rest,

162
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,519
we need a batch of high quality soldiers

163
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,400
to work with the Military Office
of Scientific Research and Development

164
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,761
and to give feedback

165
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,639
on new weapons and tactical strategies

166
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,600
that they encounter
in drills or even in actual combat.

167
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,039
They not only help the Military Office
of Scientific Research and Development

168
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,556
to strive towards high-precision era,

169
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,160
they also become the role model

170
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,880
to promote the new technology
to the whole army.

171
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,160
Under the circumstances,

172
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,045
although you're the pick
of the armed police forces,

173
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,493
Cheetah Commando,

174
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,840
if you are unable to catch up
and keep pace with the times,

175
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,881
you'll be replaced.

176
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,960
Worse, you'll be eliminated.

177
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,920
Report!

178
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
What is the problem?

179
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,240
Instructor Ai,

180
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
the glory of the Cheetah

181
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,439
cannot be written off
with a few words from you.

182
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,439
As a member of the special forces,

183
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,079
I don't deny that you're excellent.

184
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,200
You accomplished missions
with blood and sweat.

185
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,481
You provided information of real combats
for research purposes.

186
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:13,412
However,

187
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,679
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie,

188
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,679
Bai Long and Guo Xiao Xiao,

189
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,640
you must know your identity.

190
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:24,296
As a student of
a special unit commander,

191
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:27,239
standing in front of the steps of
change towards the high-precision era,

192
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,119
all of you

193
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,719
may be inferior to a normal student.

194
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,000
We gritted our teeth in training.
We watched our comrades fall one by one.

195
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
We did our best to accomplish missions.

196
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:41,202
We are more than
just a research material.

197
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,080
We won't be eliminated for sure.

198
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,233
(Anti-sniper system)
Look at it carefully.

199
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,278
This is a French-made
Pillar vehicle-mounted

200
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,440
processor terminals
for anti-sniper systems.

201
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,520
The system uses
a series of sound sensors

202
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:07,520
to measure the muzzle flames
of enemy sniper fire

203
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,359
and the shock waves
of projectiles in flight

204
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,200
to accurately calculate the position
and distance of the enemy sniper,

205
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:18,612
and even the calibre of
the weapon used by the enemy sniper.

206
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,880
Its presence represents a tenfold
or even a hundredfold increase

207
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,360
in the chances of
the sniper being spotted

208
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,829
by the enemy
after he has shot his target.

209
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,359
Once this equipment becomes
common on the battlefield,

210
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,280
the legend of one sniper killing
hundreds of enemy troops may be over.

211
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,599
If Cheetah Commando was
equipped with the anti-sniper system,

212
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,920
and the device broke down
on the battlefield,

213
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,400
what should you do?

214
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,079
Of course,

215
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,919
such expensive device

216
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,880
comes with repair manuals.

217
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:53,852
I would like to find out from you.

218
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
On the battlefield,

219
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,079
can anyone of you repair the device

220
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,840
by referring to the manuals
in the shortest period of time?

221
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,159
Staff Officer Ai.

222
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,800
No.

223
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,119
Instructor Ai.

224
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,360
You are finding fault with us.

225
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,033
If the manuals are in Chinese,

226
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,731
the foreigners won't be able
to understand the manuals either.

227
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,920
That's what you think.

228
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,439
How are you so sure that
foreign soldiers can't read Chinese?

229
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,201
You're the instructor.

230
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
You're always right.

231
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,197
(Remember why you started)
(Remember the mission)

232
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,121
Fine.

233
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,959
Manuals in French is too harsh.

234
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,320
Let's change it to English.

235
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,320
It's the world language.

236
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,440
What about now?

237
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,280
Can anyone read the manual?

238
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,520
Speaking in English
to engage in simple conversations

239
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,761
is not a problem to all of us.

240
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,159
But judging by what you're asking,

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,520
even those who passed TOEFL

242
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,920
may not be able to answer the question.

243
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,039
You're reaching for the stars.

244
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,319
Is it really difficult?

245
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,152
Isn't accepting challenges

246
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,000
the vision of Cheetah Commando?

247
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,440
It's different.

248
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,800
This is not within our league.

249
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,360
As the Chinese Army

250
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,079
is making rapid progress to keep pace
with ever-changing technologies,

251
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,040
you'll get in touch with
cutting-edge devices like this.

252
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,960
Some of the devices

253
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,159
are produced on a small scale
as they are still in the testing phase.

254
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,640
Some of the devices

255
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,360
are authorized equipment obtained
by our country through various methods.

256
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:34,440
When the time comes, you'll realise

257
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,239
the knowledge that you master

258
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,280
is not enough.

259
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,000
You must learn how to use,

260
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:49,313
maintain and repair these world-class
devices that are precise and pricey,

261
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,880
and provide first-hand information
from the drills and real combats

262
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,359
to the relevant authority.

263
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,359
In that case,

264
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,481
the Military Office
of Scientific Research and Development

265
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,760
can refer to the information
as their primary source.

266
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:03,719
At the same time,

267
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,126
you have to accumulate
more experience in using these devices.

268
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:10,080
You must lead the entire
special forces unit in learning

269
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,840
these lessons and techniques,
with yourself as a role model.

270
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,840
This

271
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,280
is the obligation that has to be borne

272
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,200
by a special unit commander

273
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,680
in the high-precision era.

274
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,800
It's so much easier
to be a normal soldier.

275
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,800
Report!

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,719
Say it.

277
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,799
If you care so much about
being highly educated,

278
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,280
highly qualified
and highly intelligent,

279
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,679
why don't you just arm the researchers
at the military research institute

280
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,293
and send them into battle
to get first-hand information?

281
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,400
Why are you torturing us instead?

282
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,559
Why don't you tell everyone

283
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,520
the reason we're doing this?

284
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:09,680
The best equipment

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,200
needs to be operated by someone.

286
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,240
If the operator gets killed
immediately on the battlefield,

287
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,441
even the best equipment

288
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,280
and the most advanced
tactical strategies

289
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,359
mean nothing.

290
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,081
Well said!

291
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:29,359
Well said!

292
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,240
Well said!

293
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,519
Instructor Ai.

294
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,680
You are used to working
in an air-conditioned office,

295
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,080
so you may not be too
aware of the current situation of

296
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,919
uneducated, unqualified and
unintelligent people like us.

297
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,120
but I would like to remind you

298
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,520
that special Forces members

299
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,520
hold the most dangerous job
in the world.

300
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,040
Don't think that just
because you're physically fit,

301
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
you have strong will

302
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,514
and with some training,

303
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,920
you can be
a part of Cheetah Commando.

304
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,960
Just now,

305
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,480
in a lively tone, Instructor Ai

306
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,839
explained the history of the war to us

307
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,640
in simple terms.

308
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,000
Now, please give her
a round of an applause

309
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
to thank Instructor Ai.

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,040
It's been a few years
since I last saw you.

311
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
You insulted Cheetah Commando
the moment you're back.

312
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,560
Are you trying to offend everyone?

313
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,639
It's as expected.

314
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
If I don't provoke them,

315
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,800
they won't realise the importance
of continuous learning.

316
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,880
Their military quality
has reached the limit.

317
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,240
Now, they need to be armed with brains.

318
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,558
I must let them know

319
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,720
that there is always someone
better out there.

320
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,640
That's right.

321
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
In order to build

322
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,566
a strong and modern armed police force,

323
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,400
they're destined

324
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,439
to keep running endlessly.

325
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,240
I've taught them

326
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
everything that I know.

327
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,200
Fortunately,

328
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,600
you're here.

329
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,800
To them,

330
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,080
it's a little cruel.

331
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,440
Elites from different units are selected

332
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,560
to Special Police Academy for training.

333
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,520
The General Headquarters has decided

334
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,640
that six months later,

335
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,080
a new selection will begin.

336
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,440
By appointing the selected
special unit commander as the backbone,

337
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,880
new Cheetah Commando will be formed.

338
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Cheetah Commando is the best unit in
the Chinese People's Armed Police Force.

339
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,319
Therefore, you only have six months

340
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,320
to nurture

341
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,359
the strongest armed forces in the world.

342
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,440
Six months...

343
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,720
That's too little time.

344
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,760
Special Police Academy

345
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,280
welcomes you.

346
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm Lei Qi Ming, the deputy chancellor.

347
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,360
I went through your profiles.

348
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,000
Everyone of you are warriors
from different units.

349
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,680
But from today onwards,

350
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,640
you are students of the Special Police
Academy's Operations Command Course.

351
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,640
Please accumulate professional knowledge
and combat skills

352
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,560
starting with basic theories,

353
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,319
and from there,

354
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,935
equip yourself with the ability
to organise and command,

355
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,760
outstanding military qualification

356
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,520
and tenacious fighting spirit

357
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,720
to become a highly skilled
military commander

358
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,959
and serve in special units
of the armed police forces

359
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:54,760
as detachment command officer.

360
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,480
This is Professor Sun Bin,
the dean of the department.

361
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,119
At ease.

362
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,399
Good day, everyone.

363
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm Sun Bin.

364
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,978
I hope you live up to your glory here.

365
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,139
When you leave the academy,

366
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
don't forget your mission.

367
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,697
Ai Qian Xue,
distribute the reading material to them.

368
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,480
Yes.

369
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,520
I'm your instructor, Ai Qian Xue.

370
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
The student manual

371
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:26,263
has listed the information
of your hostel,

372
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,559
the location of the lecture hall

373
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
and the opening hour
of the computer room and the library.

374
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,360
I hope you can adapt to the environment
and the change of your identity

375
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,239
within the shortest period of time.

376
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,880
I'm giving you a lecture
for the first time tomorrow.

377
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,799
In order not to affect the progress
of other students,

378
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,600
please go through the reading material
in advance.

379
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,760
Yan.

380
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Since when did Staff Officer Ai
become like this?

381
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,160
She used to be so nice
when she was in Regiment 247.

382
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:51,937
She's always like this.

383
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,320
I don't think so.

384
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,440
I remember she was quite friendly
in the past.

385
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,400
If she's still friendly to you,

386
00:19:57,937 --> 00:19:59,160
will you listen to her?

387
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:01,697
We have passed
the strictest examination,

388
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:02,896
brought down armed drug traffickers,

389
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:04,296
and went through intensive fighting
on the battlefield.

390
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,080
If civilians like them

391
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:07,737
don't impose authority on us

392
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,440
and put the fear of God in us,

393
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:12,097
they won't even have the confidence
to give us lectures.

394
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:13,697
If you ask me,

395
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:14,977
why can't they be sincere?

396
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:17,056
Why do they never
grow tired of the same tricks?

397
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:19,896
Do we have to
study the reading material?

398
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,840
Bai.

399
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:22,617
Do you really think that
you're here for school?

400
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:22,937
No.

401
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,296
What else?

402
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,656
We're here to look good,

403
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:27,656
go through the motion
and call it a day.

404
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:29,776
I don't know the process

405
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,183
but I understand Qin Feng.

406
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,759
He won't make meaningless arrangements.

407
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:34,536
Listen.

408
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:35,697
You're absolutely thinking too much.

409
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:36,857
I'm sure

410
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,376
I can defeat the dean
of the department effortlessly

411
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:39,617
even after I attend
the Cheetah Commando training

412
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:40,737
three days in a row.

413
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:42,737
He's so much senior than you.

414
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:43,817
How can you fight him?

415
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,960
Yan Po Yue!

416
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,056
Stand there!

417
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,056
Wait for me!

418
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:51,577
Who is that?

419
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:53,176
Why did you hide about her from me?

420
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:54,376
Are you still my buddy?

421
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:55,857
I don't know her.

422
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:57,136
Keep pretending.

423
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,159
Just keep pretending.

424
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
I really don't know her.

425
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,399
She told you

426
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:03,617
to stand here and wait.

427
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,840
Handsome guy is always luckier.

428
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,817
Where are you going? She is coming down.

429
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:12,176
She's here.

430
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,937
Hello, I'm Xiao Yun Jie.

431
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:19,536
I'm Yan Po Yue's
childhood friend cum comrade cum buddy.

432
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,056
He always mentions about you.

433
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:22,536
That's why I'm familiar with you.

434
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:23,497
That's impossible!

435
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:26,776
It is a small world.

436
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,056
Do you still remember me?

437
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,497
Do I know you?

438
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:34,497
You tied me up on a tree.

439
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:35,900
How could you forget me?

440
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,400
You're not wearing uniform at that time.

441
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:40,376
I couldn't recognise you.

442
00:21:43,656 --> 00:21:44,776
During the confrontation drill,

443
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:45,697
you're our enemy.

444
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:46,937
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:49,056
I wasn't even a participant
to begin with!

446
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,239
Did I wear any Blue Army's badge?

447
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:54,577
During the drill, Blue Army sent a fool

448
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:55,416
who gave us the chance to kill tens
of their people at once.

449
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Is that her?

450
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:00,937
It's really nice to meet you.

451
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:02,656
I've long heard about you.

452
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,817
Listen.

453
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:06,296
It was a mistake.

454
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:07,376
It was a huge mistake.

455
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:08,857
Every dog has his day.

456
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:10,136
Yan Po Yue.

457
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:12,280
You didn't think we'd see
each other again, did you?

458
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:13,416
Let me tell you.

459
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:16,097
I'm a postgraduate student in
Operations Command Course.

460
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,577
I'm more senior than you.

461
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:19,776
You'd better wait and see.

462
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:21,536
Okay.

463
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:22,776
I'll wait and see.

464
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:23,577
Yan.

465
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:25,056
Senior, I was just kidding.

466
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:25,896
Please don't take it to heart.

467
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:26,776
I look forward to learn from you.

468
00:22:26,977 --> 00:22:27,656
Goodbye.

469
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:30,176
Yan Po Yue!

470
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,776
Don't you think that
studying at the academy

471
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:33,016
is a piece of cake!

472
00:22:33,296 --> 00:22:35,337
You'll get a taste of
what it's like to be crushed!

473
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:38,896
Our future life is going to be fun.

474
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,850
Four students are coming from faraway.

475
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,497
They'll reach here in the afternoon.

476
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:03,136
Everyone here,

477
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,959
please introduce yourself.

478
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:06,958
Tell us your name and unit.

479
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,857
Yan Po Yue, start from you.

480
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:10,056
Sure.

481
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,803
Hello, comrades.

482
00:23:14,097 --> 00:23:14,896
My name is Yan Po Yue.

483
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:17,296
I'm from Cheetah Commando

484
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:18,536
of the Chinese People's
Armed Police Force.

485
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,850
That's all.

486
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:23,937
Hello, comrades.
My name is Xiao Yun Jie.

487
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,697
I'm from Cheetah Commando

488
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:26,817
of the Chinese People's
Armed Police Force.

489
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:27,577
That's all.

490
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,759
Hello, comrades.
My name is Guo Xiao Xiao.

491
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,737
I'm from Cheetah Commando

492
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:34,656
of the Chinese People's
Armed Police Force.

493
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:35,416
That's all.

494
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:37,376
Hello, comrades. My name is Bai Long.

495
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,857
I'm from Cheetah Commando

496
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:39,736
of the Chinese People's
Armed Police Force.

497
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:40,376
That's all.

498
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:42,376
Hello, comrades. My name is Wang Lei.

499
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:50,817
You're now at
the Special Police Academy,

500
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:53,217
a place to further your studies

501
00:23:53,697 --> 00:23:54,737
and learn from one another.

502
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:56,617
There is only one criterion.

503
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:58,360
Not only are you required
to possess the ability

504
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,160
to command operations with
the modern information technology,

505
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:03,016
you also needs to have
excellent physical fitness.

506
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,737
On top of that, you need to be familiar

507
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,457
with the application
of the high-precision equipment.

508
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:09,097
If you want to be
the strongest in the end,

509
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:11,256
you need to work hard together

510
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,617
and steer your team to victory.

511
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:15,617
In the coming six months,

512
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,217
every month,

513
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,056
you'll be tested in term
of physical fitness and culture.

514
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:21,697
Those who fail in the assessment

515
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:24,296
will be eliminated

516
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:25,617
and be sent back to their original unit.

517
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:31,617
Perhaps I didn't make myself
clear enough.

518
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:34,656
This time,

519
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,937
you're facing the strictest test

520
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:39,577
throughout your military career.

521
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:40,896
The higher-ups have given instructions

522
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,560
that your weekend off is cancelled

523
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:43,776
so that you can focus on training.

524
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:45,217
Those who are qualified can stay

525
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:46,617
while those who aren't qualified

526
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:48,056
have to go back.

527
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:49,457
Those who think that they can't do it

528
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:51,296
may leave now.

529
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,977
I couldn't find you
anywhere after lunch.

530
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,256
I knew you're here.

531
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,080
When we introduced ourselves
in the morning,

532
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,320
I didn't find anyone outstanding
in the class.

533
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:05,937
There are four more students
who have yet to come.

534
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:07,497
I wonder which unit are them from.

535
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,719
They seem to be something.

536
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:10,320
Not bad.

537
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,120
Train yourself harder

538
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,817
so that you won't be eliminated
in the first round.

539
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:15,935
You're not in the position
to teach us what to do!

540
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,049
Those who are going to
teach you a lesson will be here soon!

541
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:23,817
Senior.

542
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:25,817
What do you mean by saying that?

543
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:28,016
You'll know when you go to class
in the afternoon.

544
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:30,136
I don't want to wait any longer.

545
00:25:30,337 --> 00:25:31,737
Tell me now.

546
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:32,697
Give me a heads-up.

547
00:25:35,024 --> 00:25:35,904
My mouth is dry.

548
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,697
I can't talk.

549
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:39,337
That's easy.

550
00:25:39,794 --> 00:25:40,577
This way, please.

551
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:47,776
It's hot.

552
00:25:58,896 --> 00:25:59,697
Senior.

553
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:01,577
Stop tasting.

554
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:02,536
Quick, tell me now.

555
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:04,296
It'll take forever to finish the drink.

556
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,056
Free drinks are the best.

557
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:16,977
Senior.

558
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:19,656
Just let me know if you
enjoy spending time alone with me.

559
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:21,296
You're just a student, too.

560
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:23,217
I bet you know nothing.

561
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:26,480
The profiles
of the special training class students

562
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,119
are managed by me for the department.

563
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:30,617
Otherwise, where did I get the idea
that Yan Po Yue was coming?

564
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:31,817
Listen.

565
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,577
The most outstanding student
in your class

566
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:34,977
isn't Yan Po Yue.

567
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:36,737
The incoming four students
are way better than him.

568
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:39,016
Keep boasting.

569
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:41,840
Fine, I won't take your drink
for no reason.

570
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,360
Let me tell you

571
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:45,376
how impressive your opponents are.

572
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,561
(The four of them consist of)

573
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:48,457
(one captain)

574
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:49,896
(and three lieutenants.)

575
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:51,737
(All of them possess double major.)

576
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:54,311
(They're from the second
detachment of the special forces)

577
00:26:54,335 --> 00:26:55,497
(of Rapid Deployment Brigade One.)

578
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:58,536
(They took part in anti-terrorism
mission over a long period of time.)

579
00:26:58,536 --> 00:26:59,580
(Every day, they face
the test of life and death)

580
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:01,176
(and go through
intensive fighting on the battlefield.)

581
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,844
(They've accomplished
countless missions.)

582
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:05,416
Four of them also attended training
in Country W

583
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,937
at Hunter School for a year.

584
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:09,217
They graduated with flying colours.

585
00:27:09,937 --> 00:27:12,337
Each of them is the expert
in a specific field.

586
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:14,896
They can speak many languages

587
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:16,817
and they are adept at handling all kinds
of advanced military equipment.

588
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,893
(Su Jian Fan,)

589
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,217
(a communication specialist,)

590
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:23,857
(doctor cum dietitian.)

591
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:26,457
(He can creates nutrition plans)

592
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:28,536
(based on the different physiques
and specialities of his teammates.)

593
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:31,480
(He can cure internal and external
trauma within a short period of time.)

594
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,641
(Ren Xiao Chuan,)

595
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
(an expert in weapons and explosives.)

596
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,781
(He's familiar with the parameter
of all types of weapons,)

597
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,296
(be it domestic or foreign.)

598
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:40,176
(He can come out with a list)

599
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:42,977
(of the weapons required
for combat missions within a minute.)

600
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:44,056
(Mao Lang,)

601
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,416
(an expert sniper.)

602
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,981
(Not only does he
hit the target every time,)

603
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:48,743
(he's also very good
at covering himself up.)

604
00:27:49,256 --> 00:27:51,376
(Rumour has it that
during one of the missions,)

605
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,881
(he was cornered into a forest
by the enemy.)

606
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,344
(The enemy scouted around
for three days and three nights.)

607
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,508
But they didn't manage to locate him.

608
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,440
Worse, their leader
was captured alive by him.

609
00:28:03,176 --> 00:28:04,577
The last one

610
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:06,296
is the best among them.

611
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07,737
His name is Pei Hong Hu.

612
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,001
Hong Hu?

613
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:11,577
What kind of name is that?

614
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:12,376
It's so strange.

615
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,199
(He's named after
the Records of the Grand Historian.)

616
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:17,497
(Pei Hong Hu)

617
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,359
(is a renowned combat expert)

618
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,320
(and a master fighter in the army.)

619
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:23,999
(Rather than being a master fighter,)

620
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,080
(he is able to take down
all attacks and defences)

621
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:30,497
(in the shortest possible time)

622
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:33,800
(or even kill them outright.)

623
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:37,176
(He acted as commander-in-chief
in numerous missions.)

624
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,376
(To them,)

625
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:40,776
(the plus points, brutal training)

626
00:28:40,776 --> 00:28:43,536
(and rich actual combat experience
which you take pride in)

627
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:46,176
(are not even worth mentioned.)

628
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:48,857
(They carry out security tasks
in the flames of war)

629
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,656
(over a long period of time.)

630
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:52,680
(Each day, they face
the test of life and death.)

631
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,560
(On the contrary,)

632
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:55,760
they also have something else
that you don't.

633
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:59,497
They are capable of applying
the latest technology and equipment

634
00:28:59,578 --> 00:29:01,178
in combat anytime.

635
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,640
Impressive.

636
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,001
Since they're so impressive,

637
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:09,176
why do they come for the training?

638
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,480
Are they here to make us look bad

639
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:12,560
and to dampen our confidence?

640
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:14,416
It's possible.

641
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:16,000
You guys are too arrogant.

642
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
If that's the aim,

643
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:22,776
why did they go to the trouble
of sending us here?

644
00:29:22,817 --> 00:29:24,776
They could eliminate us right away.

645
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,800
Previously, you're soldiers.

646
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,040
Once you joined Cheetah Commando,

647
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,841
the competition as a soldier was over.

648
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,720
Now, you're competing
to be a new commander.

649
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,560
Just wait to be crushed.

650
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,279
The last four students are here.

651
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,292
Just like everyone else in the class,

652
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,360
they're elites selected from the
Chinese People's Armed Police Force.

653
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,240
Four of you,

654
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,880
please introduce yourself.

655
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,640
Hello, everyone.

656
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
My name is Pei Hong Hu.

657
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:07,480
I'm named after
the Records of the Grand Historian.

658
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:09,310
I'm from the second detachment
of the special forces

659
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:10,600
of Rapid Deployment Brigade One.

660
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,481
Before joining the academy,

661
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,680
I applied to change my name.

662
00:30:14,817 --> 00:30:15,920
From now on,

663
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,960
I hope everyone can address me
by my new name.

664
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:19,480
My name is Pei

665
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:20,896
Ta

666
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,360
Yan.

667
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:29,200
Report.

668
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,040
Can I meet my comrades?

669
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:34,640
Suits yourself.

670
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:44,760
Yan Po Yue.

671
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:47,560
I've long heard about you.

672
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:09,840
I changed my name because of you.

673
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,360
Do you want to see my identity card?

674
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,280
What matters is your capability,

675
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:22,840
not your name.

676
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,600
I believe I have the capability.

677
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:26,817
By the way,

678
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,200
I almost forgot to tell you.

679
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:30,240
I just had an idea.

680
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:35,880
If I get first place in the
assessment six months from now,

681
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,240
I'll change my name to Pei Mie Yan.

682
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,400
I deliberately provoked you just now

683
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:07,577
so that you got distracted.

684
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,960
Or else, I wouldn't get you so easily.

685
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:13,720
Fine, let's consider
that we're even this time.

686
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:16,040
Okay?

687
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:26,960
Yan.

688
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,120
As a member of special forces,

689
00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:34,097
you made the same mistake twice
in such a short period of time.

690
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:34,840
How could you?

691
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:35,760
His right hand is injured.

692
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,160
Shame on you
for attacking his right hand!

693
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,040
No matter what, he lost.

694
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:40,440
Don't find excuses.

695
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:42,080
If you don't admit defeat,

696
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:43,280
you can give your left hand a try.

697
00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:44,136
Try it with your left hand.

698
00:32:44,217 --> 00:32:45,200
I'll do it.

699
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:46,360
Let me do it.

700
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,400
I'm here, too.

701
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:50,337
Stop.

702
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,561
Today,

703
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:53,040
I lost to you.

704
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,400
Look to the right.

705
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:22,240
Your first-meeting gift

706
00:33:23,776 --> 00:33:24,960
is really something.

707
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,800
Come on.

708
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,400
Continue the introduction.

709
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,879
One, two, three, four!

710
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:36,136
One, two, three, four!

711
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:38,937
One, two, three, four!

712
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,817
One, two, three, four!

713
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:43,200
One, two, three, four!

714
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:49,600
Detachment Chief.

715
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:52,360
Qin Feng.

716
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:53,960
I have two things to tell you.

717
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:55,337
Firstly,

718
00:33:55,896 --> 00:33:58,080
the higher-ups want to appoint
a female sniper instructor.

719
00:33:58,577 --> 00:33:59,857
After a careful thought,

720
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,320
I think Leng Jing is the best candidate.

721
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,560
After all, you guys have been
in Cheetah Commando for a long time.

722
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:07,680
The position can make the most of her.

723
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,600
To Leng Jing, this is a good news

724
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:13,257
but I have to get her consent first.

725
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:15,479
She is your subordinate.

726
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:16,960
I respect your view.

727
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:19,481
If you're not against it,
I'll talk to her about it.

728
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:20,640
I'm totally fine with it.

729
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:21,480
Okay.

730
00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:22,600
Let's move on to the second thing.

731
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,320
This time,

732
00:34:26,976 --> 00:34:29,039
they decide to forgo
the usual competition format

733
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:31,080
and go for joint military operations.

734
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:31,920
At the moment,

735
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,640
terrorism is lurking around
the borders of different countries.

736
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,040
When our army approached them,

737
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,360
they fled to the neighbouring
countries immediately.

738
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Even if we are well-trained
and well-equipped,

739
00:34:40,616 --> 00:34:41,976
when we're facing terrorists
who have fled

740
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:42,655
to the neighbouring countries,

741
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,999
we can't do anything.

742
00:34:44,136 --> 00:34:46,600
Therefore, in order to fight terrorism,

743
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,960
government of different countries
have to work hand in hand

744
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:50,879
so that they can't exploit
any opportunity to their advantage.

745
00:34:52,096 --> 00:34:53,080
It's even more difficult now.

746
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,073
That's right.

747
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:55,199
This time,

748
00:34:55,297 --> 00:34:57,279
instructors and commanders
of different countries

749
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,560
will get together.

750
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,160
They'll share information
with each other,

751
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,720
command the operation jointly

752
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,537
and give all types of combat order.

753
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:04,560
They're also required

754
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:06,280
to judge the comprehensive military
quality of different countries

755
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:07,440
and come out with the final score.

756
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:10,257
Detachment Chief,

757
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:11,816
I have an idea.

758
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:15,263
You're thinking

759
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,720
of sending Yan Po Yue and the team
to the competition?

760
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:19,777
Detachment Chief, don't worry.

761
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,537
I'll send the best team.

762
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:22,856
But at the moment,

763
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:24,656
the winner is not known yet.

764
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,920
Pei Ta Yan and the team
were trained abroad.

765
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,760
They have the upper hand
in joint military operations.

766
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,480
In that case,

767
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,336
could I have more time
to think about it?

768
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,057
The higher-ups attach
great importance to this matter.

769
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:41,537
I believe that you'll handle it well.

770
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,479
Yes.

771
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,960
I'll come out with a plan soon.

772
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,840
One, two, three, four!

773
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,080
One, two, three, four!

774
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:55,257
One, two, one...

775
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:58,057
One, two, three, four!

776
00:35:58,176 --> 00:36:00,977
One, two, three, four!

777
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:04,376
Pei Ta Yan.

778
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,320
You changed your name for real.

779
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,440
You're really something.

780
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:12,960
Report, Instructor Ai.

781
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,840
In order to complete the task you gave,

782
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:16,800
I had to take such extreme measures.

783
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,560
I must thank you

784
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:22,257
for providing me
with so much information.

785
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:23,480
The information helps me

786
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,304
to understand Yan Po Yue well
since the beginning.

787
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,297
Therefore, I was able to design
an attack plan specially for him.

788
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:29,777
That's why I got to defeat him
two times in a row.

789
00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:31,257
Instructor Ai,

790
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,816
you're making me the catfish
in the class

791
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,896
so that everyone in the class
is always on their toes

792
00:36:36,017 --> 00:36:37,480
and dares not get careless.

793
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:38,977
Am I right?

794
00:36:42,336 --> 00:36:43,297
Be honest to me.

795
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,737
If Yan Po Yue
shakes your hand for the third time,

796
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:48,777
do you think you can tumble him again?

797
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,977
If he shakes my hand for the third time,

798
00:36:58,656 --> 00:36:59,537
I believe

799
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,329
I'll be the one who gets tumbled.

800
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:04,576
In the first two rounds,

801
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:06,937
I took advantage of his injury

802
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:08,136
and character flaws

803
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:09,416
to tumble him two times in a row.

804
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:10,777
But at the same time,

805
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,497
I exposed my strength

806
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:13,697
and habit of movement.

807
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,176
So,

808
00:37:16,457 --> 00:37:17,856
if he shakes my hand at the third time,

809
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:20,656
he won't let go of me.

810
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:23,777
But he didn't do that.

811
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:28,937
Yan Po Yue

812
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,816
has finally grown up.

813
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,681
(Xiao Yun Jie asked me)

814
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:56,856
(why I admitted defeat
when I got tumbled by Pei Ta Yan.)

815
00:37:57,896 --> 00:37:59,497
(That's because we have
always been the strongest.)

816
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:01,816
(Therefore, we have
become everyone's target.)

817
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
(When we're in a new environment,)

818
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,200
(only by admitting defeat,)

819
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,640
(hiding our skills,)

820
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,240
(and enduring hardship in silence,)

821
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:12,057
(we can make a way)

822
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,839
(in this unfavourable competition.)

823
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:41,416
Wake up!

824
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:05,297
You're early.

825
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:06,977
Are you awake?

826
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,799
Running with weights for 10 kilometres.

827
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:30,856
Begins now!

828
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:51,057
Yan.

829
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:52,616
Their backpacks seem heavier than ours.

830
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:54,136
I think they're
carrying 20 kilograms of weight.

831
00:39:54,257 --> 00:39:55,416
That's five kilogram heavier than ours.

832
00:39:56,457 --> 00:39:58,217
Tomorrow, we'll
carry 25 kilograms of weight.

833
00:39:58,257 --> 00:39:59,257
Stick your chest out and lift your head.

834
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:00,416
Don't look around!

835
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:04,136
One, two, three, four!

836
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:07,103
One, two, three, four!

837
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:09,217
One, two, three, four!

838
00:40:09,336 --> 00:40:11,257
One, two, three, four!

839
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:15,656
Based on the English level test,

840
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:16,920
we divide the students
into a few classes.

841
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:18,640
This class

842
00:40:19,257 --> 00:40:20,160
is Class C.

843
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:22,880
It means the third class.

844
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,697
No.

845
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:30,017
Staff Officer Ai, I scored 82 marks.

846
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,576
It's 82 marks.

847
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,467
Do I deserve to be placed in Class C?

848
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:35,777
Do you really think 82 marks
is good enough?

849
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:37,015
That's right.

850
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:39,376
You, Yan Po Yue and Guo Xiao Xiao

851
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:40,856
scored 80 marks and above.

852
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:41,576
I can tell that

853
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,376
your English proficiency level
is equivalent to high school students.

854
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:44,816
But in comparison to Class B,

855
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:45,856
you're a far cry.

856
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:46,937
Forget about Class A.

857
00:40:47,017 --> 00:40:48,856
Their English proficiency level
is Grade Six and above.

858
00:40:48,977 --> 00:40:49,656
Moreover,

859
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:50,656
to become a student in Class A,

860
00:40:50,777 --> 00:40:53,217
you have to master
at least three foreign languages.

861
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,095
Are you qualified?

862
00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:55,176
Class A...

863
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:57,457
Who are there in Class A?

864
00:41:06,977 --> 00:41:08,136
Students in Class A

865
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:10,176
include Pei Ta Yan,

866
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:12,777
Mao Lang, Ren Xiao Chuan,

867
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:14,892
Su Jian Fan, Gu Meng,

868
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:16,840
Xu Guang Rong and Chen Hua.

869
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,320
Bai.

870
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,359
If you chose C for every question,

871
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,880
you would score more than five marks.

872
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:34,720
Five marks?

873
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:37,240
Bai scored five marks only.

874
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:39,656
I can't even memorise all the alphabets.

875
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,160
Forget about
memorising the vocabularies.

876
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,440
Stop laughing!

877
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,120
No doubt you're not
on the same starting point,

878
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,520
but

879
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,160
there is only one way to the end point.

880
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,160
You must continue working hard.

881
00:42:01,457 --> 00:42:02,320
Instructor Ai.

882
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,160
We want to learn.

883
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:05,800
Please help us out.

884
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:08,440
Helping you is my job.

885
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:10,080
But whether you can succeed,

886
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:12,600
it depends on your will.

887
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:14,720
Instructor Ai, I have a few ideas.

888
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:16,760
I don't know if you would agree.

889
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:17,616
Go ahead.

890
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:18,297
Firstly,

891
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:20,457
halving our physical training time

892
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:21,257
so that we can study.

893
00:42:21,697 --> 00:42:22,297
Secondly,

894
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,079
delaying lights out to four hours later

895
00:42:25,937 --> 00:42:26,777
so that we can study more.

896
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:28,257
Also,

897
00:42:28,537 --> 00:42:30,616
we must consume more fish
during this period

898
00:42:30,697 --> 00:42:31,737
because fish is good for brain.

899
00:42:31,856 --> 00:42:34,057
It's as if we're studying
for the college entrance exam.

900
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:35,457
It's important for us to eat well.

901
00:42:35,576 --> 00:42:36,376
Sure.

902
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:38,360
The food prepared
by the cafeteria is not bad.

903
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:39,400
You can eat there.

904
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:41,960
What else?

905
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:49,880
Everyone,

906
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,000
all of us here

907
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:53,136
are elites.

908
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:54,040
Now,

909
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,839
we are confronted with 26 alphabets

910
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:59,047
that are tricky and hard to recognise.

911
00:42:59,136 --> 00:43:00,120
Only by conquering them,

912
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
will we be able to march

913
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,200
to the finishing point together.
