(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,136
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,440
(Episode 38)

4
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,840
I'll do it!

5
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,160
Scram! Did you hear me?

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,720
I'll destroy their mortar base!

7
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,880
Bearing, 201.

8
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,960
Shooting angle, 1380.

9
00:01:56,994 --> 00:01:57,839
Shoot!

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,841
This is impossible.

11
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:11,480
How could he be so accurate with
the grenade launcher without a tripod?

12
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,641
Bearing, 215.

13
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:17,880
Shooting angle, 1415.

14
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,720
Fire!

15
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,840
Impossible!

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
No one in the world can run this fast!

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
Get out of the way!

18
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,120
Fire!

19
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,959
Ammo!

20
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
It's useless no matter how fast you are.

21
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:26,162
Wind speed, two slaps to the face.

22
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:27,031
Distance,

23
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:28,960
143.88 yuan.

24
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:29,680
Ammo!

25
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:51,412
Sir!

26
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,120
The tracking device
our spy attached to their vehicle

27
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,840
has appeared on another route!

28
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:56,840
Deputy Director Ding,

29
00:03:57,297 --> 00:03:59,880
can you send some reinforcements
to the battlefield?

30
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:00,960
I'll arrange for that.

31
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,680
Lu Tu,

32
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,360
head to the tracking device's location

33
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,280
with Squad Seven right now.

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,520
Wake up!

35
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,440
Wake up!

36
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,520
Wake up!

37
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,040
Bai!

38
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,080
Wake up!

39
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,160
Bai!

40
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:29,320
Wake up! Bai!

41
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,200
Bai!

42
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
You scared me!

43
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,520
Captain Xiao,

44
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:46,760
leave this area to us.

45
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,640
You should check on your teammates.

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,440
Alright.

47
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,720
The enemy mortar base

48
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
was destroyed by Yan Po Yue.

49
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,400
Where's Yan Po Yue?

50
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Where's Yue Kong?

51
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:24,840
Where's Yue Kong?

52
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,760
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,200
Mu Qing! Take care
of our injured personnel!

54
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,080
Get up!

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Xu Yang, Guo Xiao Xiao,

56
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:56,360
follow me and pursue the enemies!

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,640
We mustn't let them exit China's border!

58
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,400
Yes, sir!

59
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Captain, I can still fight!

60
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,760
We can't afford any more casualties!

61
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:05,560
Captain!

62
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,760
Wait for reinforcements!

63
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,351
I'm your reinforcement!

64
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,480
Alright.

65
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's go then!

66
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,360
Lai!

67
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,360
Xing Tian sent us here to die.

68
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,600
We'll only become cannon fodder if we
fight the armed police forces head-on.

69
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,920
Are you afraid now?

70
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,600
Be careful!

71
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,880
Lai!

72
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,720
Retreat!

73
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's go!

74
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,121
We should survive

75
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,409
so that we can spend our money!

76
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,240
Special symbol discovered.

77
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
Do not hurt him by accident.

78
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,480
Now, I have a win-win situation for you.

79
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,520
You can cover
the long-distance shooting.

80
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,960
The three of us will cover you.

81
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,840
It's useless even if we hit them!

82
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,400
Captain!

83
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,919
Lai, retreat!

84
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,400
Retreat!

85
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Xiao Yun Jie!

86
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,479
Shoot them!

87
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,401
Captain!

88
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,280
Shoot them!

89
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,280
They'll run away
if we don't shoot them now!

90
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
Captain, your ear is bleeding!

91
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,519
Shoot them! Hurry!

92
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,200
Captain, we must stop!

93
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,240
This is an order!

94
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
Lai!

95
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,720
Move aside!

96
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,520
Run!

97
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,200
Run!

98
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,080
Captain.

99
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,080
It's over.

100
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,080
Mission accomplished, Captain.

101
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,840
Captain.

102
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,560
Captain?

103
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,761
Captain?

104
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,640
It's over, Captain.

105
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,280
You can let go now.

106
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,720
Captain!

107
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,120
Captain!

108
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,280
You can let go now.

109
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,280
Captain.

110
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,240
Captain, it's over now.

111
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,600
You can let go now!

112
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,760
Captain!

113
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,960
Captain, you can let go now!

114
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,520
Captain!

115
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,920
It's over!

116
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,680
Let it go!

117
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,920
Captain, just let it go!

118
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,520
Time to go home!

119
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,000
Captain, let it go!

120
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
-Lai!
-What?

121
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
He's a Chinese soldier.

122
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,800
He's more valuable alive than dead.

123
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,440
Hold this.

124
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,120
Lai,

125
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,399
why are you still standing there?

126
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,440
Come and help me out!

127
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,641
So many of our men died because of them.

128
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:22,800
We have to bring him back
to give Xing Tian an explanation.

129
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,440
Come!

130
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,080
Hurry!

131
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,520
How did he get so seriously injured?

132
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,402
He's suffering from a concussion.
His eardrums are ruptured.

133
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,720
His internal organs
are seriously damaged too.

134
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,840
He needs immediate medical attention!

135
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,240
Captain, look!

136
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,560
Flour?

137
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,240
This time, they're not smuggling drugs.

138
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,600
They tipped us off on purpose
so that they could deal with us.

139
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,440
Yan Po Yue!

140
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,200
Yan Po Yue!

141
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,000
So, you're Xing Tian?

142
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,960
That's me.

143
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,480
Do you know that it's very dangerous
for us to make the deal in person?

144
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,840
I want to see Mr. Song.

145
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,000
I am Mr. Song.

146
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,040
You're lying.

147
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm Mr. Song!

148
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,520
Mr. Song!

149
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,160
Shu Hai is dead!

150
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,080
I have to hand over my goods to you!

151
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,680
Are you sure you want this guy
to make the deal with me?

152
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,560
It's just a misunderstanding.

153
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:50,673
When we drove uphill,

154
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,800
it was shaking too much.

155
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:52,895
I was a bit carsick.

156
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,894
Why are you guys
pointing guns at each other?

157
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,200
Come.

158
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,440
This is just a misunderstanding.

159
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,440
Keep your guns away.

160
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,400
So, you're General Xing?

161
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:08,560
You're very young.

162
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:10,985
Mr. Song,

163
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,441
you had to choose
a remote place like this for our deal.

164
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:14,699
Sorry for the trouble.

165
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,039
It's been a long time
since I've come out.

166
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,400
I heard that you've achieved
a lot of things lately.

167
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,039
That side is too chaotic

168
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,999
while the security here is too tight.

169
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
I just want everyone to make enough
for them to survive.

170
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:30,800
Don't be upset with me, okay?

171
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
I'm getting old now.

172
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,556
I'm different from Shu Hai.

173
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,960
He's very high-profile.

174
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:38,128
How did you come here?

175
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,079
By car.

176
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,119
Come.

177
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,240
Group One, Two, and Three,

178
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:54,440
prepare to infiltrate.

179
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,920
01, in position, over.

180
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
02, in position, over.

181
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:23,040
03, in position, over.

182
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,400
Mr. Song, all the goods
are inside the vehicle.

183
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:01,920
We have 50 barrels of them here.

184
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,040
Seems like you were doing great, huh?

185
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,112
I guess God favours us.

186
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,320
The other side is all yours now, right?

187
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,600
(Listen closely!)

188
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,560
(We're the Chinese People's
Armed Police.)

189
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,238
(You guys have been surrounded!)

190
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:20,160
(Put down your guns
and surrender right now!)

191
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,160
Move out.

192
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,160
I was wondering why
you must make the deal today.

193
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,440
So, you're a spy.

194
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,600
Didn't your people behind this?

195
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,240
My gang and I

196
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,600
live and die together.

197
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,560
I saw a tracking device under
the vehicle just now.

198
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,549
They attached it to the vehicle
with a piece of chewing gum.

199
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,760
Old fool! Tell me where
the secret tunnel is!

200
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
-I don't know!
-Don't tell me you don't have

201
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,640
an escape route even though
you chose a remote place like this?

202
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,239
Tell me!

203
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:35,600
Run!

204
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:48,880
-Drop your guns!
-Don't move!

205
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,560
Don't move!

206
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,839
Nobody moves! Squat down!

207
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,400
Don't move!

208
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,160
Squat down! Put your hands on your head!

209
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,119
Don't move!

210
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,920
Don't move!

211
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:20,959
01 reporting.

212
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,359
We found a tunnel in the brick factory.

213
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:23,960
(The targets may have escaped
using the tunnel.)

214
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:27,463
Sir, target discovered.

215
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,520
Requesting permission to shoot.

216
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,760
They've already crossed the borderline.

217
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:40,560
We can no longer shoot them.

218
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:43,800
Hurry!

219
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,720
We've finally made it.

220
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:52,640
We're finally out of the country!

221
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:57,025
Mr. Song,

222
00:22:58,104 --> 00:23:00,504
I guess you didn't expect yourself
to die in another country, huh?

223
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,520
Don't move!

224
00:23:36,891 --> 00:23:37,931
Why didn't you give him any anaesthesia?

225
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,520
His muscles are too tensed up.

226
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:40,840
The needle can't
pierce through his skin.

227
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,760
Captain.

228
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,120
How could she bring her weapon inside?

229
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,960
Shut up.

230
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,200
Her partner was just
sacrificed in battle.

231
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,880
Captain, we didn't find him.

232
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
-Go now.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,560
Captain,

234
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,800
please tell us the truth.

235
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,480
Have you found Yan Po Yue?

236
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:47,849
Captain,

237
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:53,345
I have something to report.

238
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:56,930
Over here.

239
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,320
I've seen the spy before.

240
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,000
He was just like us.

241
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,457
He participated in the
Cheetah's selection before.

242
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:15,680
He was originally in
the same squad as Yan Po Yue.

243
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,200
But, you eliminated him
in the final round.

244
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,920
Xiao Fei,

245
00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:24,640
I've read your details.

246
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,520
You won the Excellent NCO Award
four years in a row.

247
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,800
You came in first place
for the group combat contest.

248
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,320
In your recommendation letter,

249
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,160
there were at least three pages
filled with praises of you.

250
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,800
Although you're an excellent individual,

251
00:25:35,288 --> 00:25:36,360
you will never find a place

252
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:38,440
in my team.

253
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,600
But why?

254
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,441
-Why?
-Because you don't deserve it!

255
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,280
To us, our comrades are
more important than our lives!

256
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,120
But you?

257
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:47,920
You harmed your own comrade

258
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,240
to acquire victory!

259
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You've betrayed your comrades!

260
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,840
Even if you are
one of the top six candidates,

261
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
I will never let you join us.

262
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,120
This is unfair!

263
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:00,040
It was actually him.

264
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,760
We organised our operation
based on his intel.

265
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,720
But the intel was a trap.

266
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,080
He kept shooting us
during our battle too.

267
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,760
Captain,

268
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,280
is he still one of us?

269
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,600
Will Yan Po Yue be able to survive

270
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,440
if he ends up being captured by him?

271
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:38,760
Doctor, how's his condition?

272
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,680
His life is out of danger now. However,
his eardrums were seriously damaged.

273
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,120
His hearing might never recover.

274
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
His hearing is damaged.

275
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:49,960
Deputy Director Ding.

276
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,841
The provincial public security bureau
had just sent us the statistics.

277
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:52,760
After rough calculations,

278
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,904
the number of drugs
and firearms we've confiscated

279
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:57,577
is around 50% of
the drug trafficking organisations'

280
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,304
annual production.

281
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,760
With this operation,
we've suppressed their flames.

282
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,121
They won't be able

283
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,801
to stage a huge-scale border-crossing
drug trafficking operation like this

284
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:10,578
for some time.

285
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:12,233
Good job, guys.

286
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:13,490
Thank you for your contribution.

287
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:16,074
Salute!

288
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:18,857
End of salutation!

289
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,480
Deputy Director Ding, I have to
report something to you in private.

290
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,080
One of our comrades is missing.
We don't know if he's alive or not.

291
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:35,400
It's highly likely that he was
captured by the enemies.

292
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,480
I will contact our spy.

293
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,800
If he was truly captured, we would
rescue him with everything we have.

294
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,320
So, are you trying to
raise hell with me now?

295
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,920
That's too far.

296
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:58,320
But, you see,

297
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,840
both the money and the goods are gone.

298
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,760
I'm just here to ask you
what we should do about it.

299
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,080
Besides, my men haven't returned yet.

300
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,800
I told you before, right?

301
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,320
I told you not to mess with the armed
police forces. You never listened to me.

302
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,640
I was responsible for the goods.

303
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,400
I will give you the money.

304
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,160
The goods are gone.

305
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:22,360
Where will you get the money?

306
00:28:30,682 --> 00:28:33,281
When I say I'll pay you, I'll pay you.

307
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,207
Do you guys want to wait back home?

308
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,640
Or do you guys want to wait here?

309
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,840
Alright.

310
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,400
Where are the rest?

311
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,400
General Xing, you're something else.

312
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:17,280
How dare you treat us as cannon fodder?

313
00:29:17,392 --> 00:29:19,560
You want us to die there, right?

314
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,480
Nan Da's mortar squad

315
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,920
is equipped with the latest radar.

316
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Although I did use you guys as baits,

317
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,400
as long as the enemies
reveal their location,

318
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:35,473
the mortars will annihilate them.

319
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,479
You shouldn't be in danger.

320
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,959
Nan...

321
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,137
Nan Da is dead.

322
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:45,240
What?

323
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,880
The Chinese soldier ran faster
than the shells.

324
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,080
Nan Da's mortar base was annihilated
by his grenade launcher.

325
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,259
Don't tell me you two were
the only ones alive?

326
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,090
I'm very curious.

327
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,960
How did you guys manage to return alive?

328
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,080
We took one of their men as our hostage.

329
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,720
That's why they didn't dare
to shoot us, General Xing.

330
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,880
-Where is he?
-We've brought him back.

331
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,720
Even though we've been fighting
each other for many years,

332
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,480
this is my first time seeing
a Chinese soldier this closely.

333
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,240
So, this is what they look like.

334
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,520
A first-year bean bag!

335
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Punch them in the face!

336
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:54,640
What's your name?

337
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,280
Where are you from?

338
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,625
Cheetah Commando?

339
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,000
It's the elite among elites.

340
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,920
They dispatched an elite unit
like you guys

341
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,240
to capture unimportant people like us?

342
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,959
Isn't that a waste?

343
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,600
I think I know my own worth.

344
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:17,660
You don't know your worth at all.

345
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,320
Your life is very valuable.

346
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,480
You're much more valuable than the sum
of all those cannon fodder out there.

347
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:27,160
You guys always know
which route we'll take.

348
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,560
There's a spy among us, right?

349
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,800
Do you want me to help you
figure this out?

350
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,640
Thank you

351
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,040
for ratting him out.

352
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,240
Yan Po Yue, you scoundrel.

353
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,760
You want to drag me down
with you even before death.

354
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,880
So, your name is Yan Po Yue?

355
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,520
We've met before.

356
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,662
Try to recall it.

357
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,121
A rainy night, and a radio.

358
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,600
Private Yan Po Yue,
calling for Tiger Three Five!

359
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,551
Private Yan Po Yue,

360
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,201
-(how old are you?)
-20 years old.

361
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:25,663
(You're this young?)

362
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,480
(Must you die at such a young age?)

363
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:29,400
How bold are you guys

364
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,080
to launch an attack against
the Chinese People's Armed Police?

365
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,280
(So what?)

366
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,640
(We'll launch a second attack soon.)

367
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,480
(There will be more of us.)

368
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,000
(You guys won't be able
to defend against us.)

369
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,439
Even so,

370
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,760
your men will die too.

371
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:44,914
Is that worth it?

372
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,080
When there's a war,

373
00:32:47,352 --> 00:32:48,433
people will die.

374
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,680
It's all thanks to you that
I could eliminate my enemy easily.

375
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,720
If not, I would have no chance
to stand here and talk to you today.

376
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,520
This time, I need to thank you
for revealing the spy to me.

377
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,400
Seems like we'll be great friends.

378
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,400
I admit!

379
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:14,601
I know him.

380
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,200
If you wish to kill me,
I'll accept my fate.

381
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,080
But don't frame me for being a spy.

382
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,240
Don't tell me you two were classmates?

383
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:28,680
In our squad,

384
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,280
we call them comrades.

385
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,760
Am I right, Yan Po Yue?

386
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:34,280
I admit,

387
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,400
I was once one of them,
and I was on the same squad as him.

388
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:43,920
Before this, I had
the same dream as him.

389
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,680
I wanted to be a Cheetah.

390
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,760
But ever since he appeared,
he always went against me.

391
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,720
He always created trouble
for me in training.

392
00:33:57,543 --> 00:33:58,520
Yan Po Yue!

393
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:00,320
Do you still remember this?

394
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,680
Once, we were on a rescue mission.

395
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,920
Even though we saved
the target together,

396
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,079
you managed to please our superior

397
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,719
with your glib tongue.

398
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,040
He stole my third-class merit!

399
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,480
Why are you everywhere?

400
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,960
I had been an ignorant soldier
for over 10 years.

401
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,600
And, my girlfriend
could finally visit me.

402
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,800
But you went and told her
that I was never an officer.

403
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,479
You said that I had rendered no merits.

404
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,040
You said that I would amount
to nothing after my retirement.

405
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,400
Did you say that to her?

406
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
After that, my girlfriend ignored me.

407
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,760
I won in the Cheetah's selection!

408
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:46,198
But our superior was biased towards you!

409
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,760
He kicked me out!

410
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Since then, I swore to myself

411
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,919
that money will be
my only motivation in life.

412
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,600
I will only sell my life for money!

413
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,480
So, that's why you joined us.

414
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,480
Tian, I had been a soldier
for over 10 years.

415
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,360
I know nothing except for war.

416
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,681
Where else can I go

417
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,960
if I want to make money
by fighting in wars?

418
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,760
Since he has landed you
in such a plight,

419
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
you should kill him.

420
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,520
Vent your frustration out on him.

421
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,080
It would be too easy for him
if I killed him with one shot.

422
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,600
Yan Po Yue,

423
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,040
I'll crush your chin with my first shot.

424
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,800
After an hour, I'll cut off your ears.

425
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,520
An hour after that,

426
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,240
I'll gouge your eyes!

427
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,480
By then, you'll beg me to kill you.

428
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,080
Bring it on.

429
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,960
I'm a member of
the Chinese People's Armed Police.

430
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,760
Do it! You deserter!

431
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Come on! Do it!

432
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,720
Don't just talk without action.

433
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,080
Come on.

434
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,640
-Come on!
-Wait!

435
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,720
We mustn't kill him.

436
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:24,000
General Xing, just like
what you had said,

437
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,400
a Chinese soldier is much more valuable

438
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,920
than all of the mercenaries combined.

439
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,440
With him, we can bargain
with the Chinese government.

440
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,880
But if he's dead,

441
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,800
the government might join hands
with the military to eradicate us.

442
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,490
I know that.

443
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:46,400
But you have to discuss that with Hu.

444
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,560
You have to see
if he agrees with the plan.

445
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,312
Since you're here to earn money,

446
00:36:57,305 --> 00:36:58,960
you shouldn't go against money.

447
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,800
Did you recognise Yan Po Yue

448
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,761
when you saw him on the battlefield?

449
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:55,920
That's right.

450
00:37:58,816 --> 00:37:59,697
You stopped me from killing him,

451
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,360
and you spent so much effort
to bring him back.

452
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,480
So, you did all that to seek revenge

453
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:06,209
and torture him?

454
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:07,920
Am I right?

455
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,760
That's right.

456
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,720
Since you've saved my life,

457
00:38:26,362 --> 00:38:27,880
I'll believe in your words.

458
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:06,720
Here's some milk.

459
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:07,760
It's produced in China.

460
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:09,080
Do you want some?

461
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,560
Don't worry.

462
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,280
Meth is very expensive.

463
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,160
I can't bear to waste them on you.

464
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,360
Besides, if I want to cripple you,

465
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,680
just one jab is enough.

466
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,440
Come, drink up.

467
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,640
Don't worry.

468
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:33,440
That's all you'll get.

469
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:35,384
It can ensure your survival

470
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:37,856
while making sure that
you won't have enough energy to escape.

471
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,800
It doesn't matter.

472
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,471
My goal in life is to arrest
drug traffickers like you guys.

473
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:51,080
When I spoke to you on the phone,

474
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,320
I thought you were a silly bumpkin.

475
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,640
I didn't expect you to look so spirited.

476
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,000
Maybe, you could be a match for me

477
00:39:59,654 --> 00:40:01,693
after a few more years.

478
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,920
I can beat you up right now.

479
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,400
What does your family do for a living?

480
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:10,192
You can tell me that, right?

481
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,400
They're soldiers.

482
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,280
Indeed.

483
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,760
An apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

484
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,960
My parents are drug traffickers.

485
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:25,840
That's why

486
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:27,945
I ended up like this today.

487
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:30,352
I'm very envious of you.

488
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,585
But, it's meaningless.

489
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:34,681
This isn't my destiny.

490
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,280
That's why I can only try my best
to live my wretched life to the fullest.

491
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:40,800
And you

492
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:44,209
should cherish your life too.

493
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:48,320
I only know that I'm a Chinese soldier.

494
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,200
And you're a drug trafficker.

495
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,960
If so, you should cooperate with me

496
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:00,360
and stay alive.

497
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:02,720
When it's necessary,

498
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,640
you should utter some words
in front of the camera.

499
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,120
Tell the outside world
that we lead difficult lives too.

500
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,000
We had no choice
but to do this for a living.

501
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:13,560
Your life will be more valuable

502
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,000
if you attract international attention.

503
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:21,640
I know.

504
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:25,320
Special unit members like you
have gone through torture training.

505
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:27,760
But, real torture

506
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,160
isn't something that you can imagine.

507
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:37,640
You don't need to send me
any milk tomorrow.

508
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,680
Thank you.

509
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,480
You must get me out of here.

510
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,520
Okay, I promise.
