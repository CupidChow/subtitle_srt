1
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,935
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:33,760
(Episode 20)

4
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,001
No doubt Qin Feng talked nonsense

5
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,480
but what can you do to him?

6
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,199
What else can I do to him?

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can only choose not to trust him.

8
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,800
If you expect nothing,
you will never be disappointed.

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,959
I'll not sleep then.

10
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,599
Emergency alert!

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
Isn't it a break?

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,400
Like I said, Qin Feng never means well!

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,120
Hurry up.

14
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,640
I would rather believe that
there are ghosts in the world

15
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,601
than believe that Qin Feng
will be lenient with us.

16
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,599
Karma hits.

17
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Karma hits!

18
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,799
Yan, wait for me.

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Carry your bag and get on the truck!

20
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,080
Be quick!

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,679
What are you waiting for?

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,080
Get on the truck now!

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,920
The helmet comes with
Individual Combat System.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Not only can it function
as a real-time monitor,

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,880
it can also detect our body functions.

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,879
(The officers must be up to no good.)

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,080
(They're going to fool us again.)

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,280
(Even our voice is being monitored.)

29
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,040
Captain.

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,920
You've worked hard.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,920
This is the final round.

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,480
How is it going?

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,920
Throughout the training,
Number 31 has been in the lead.

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
I know you have sharp eyes
in selecting participants,

35
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,480
but the final round

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,200
is designated to fail the veterans.

37
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,759
Yan,

38
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,960
something doesn't feel right.

39
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,160
I think we're crossing the border.

40
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,800
It's not like we haven't
crossed the border before.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
Haven't you had enough
from that one time?

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,000
You're so optimistic.

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,839
Number 27.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,201
Have you been overseas?

45
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,159
Let's get to the business.

46
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,619
I bet he knows something.

47
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
He is sitting at the corner
like a piece of wood.

48
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,399
You won't get any information from him.

49
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,760
After two months of training,

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,640
next up,

51
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,520
you'll face the last assessment.

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
It's known as the Hell Week.

53
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,040
Those who can survive the assessment

54
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,479
can stay on.

55
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,566
Any questions?

56
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:31,368
Report!

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,200
Say it!

58
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,560
Where are we?

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,645
Here is the most dreadful area in the
entire south-west tropical rainforest.

60
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,480
Many dead bodies from the war years
are buried here.

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,320
All of you

62
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,880
are here to go beyond the limit
and challenge yourself.

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,359
Find food when you're hungry.

64
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,820
Hide in cave when you're cold.

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,640
Report!

66
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,400
Are there any requirements
when we're walking through the jungle?

67
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,160
Is survival the sole goal?

68
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Listen carefully.

69
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,200
All of you

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
are allowed to act alone

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
or form alliance freely.

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,200
However, within five days,

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,800
by referring to
the direction of the compass

74
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
and the indications on the map,

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,560
you must traverse 100km
of jungle and swamp

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
and gather at the end point.

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,639
In the process,

78
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,720
you'll encounter numerous attacks.

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,280
Therefore, if you can't persist...

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,400
Do you see this?

81
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,240
Your helmet comes
with positioning device.

82
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,120
You may switch it on and ask for help.

83
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,960
If the positioning device doesn't work,

84
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,720
you may seek help with the smoking tool.

85
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,079
A helicopter will be sent immediately

86
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,400
to rescue you.

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,480
However, that means

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
you're eliminated.

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,880
Report!

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,401
Where do we depart?

91
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,561
Firstly, you have to climb over
the precipice to enter the jungle.

92
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,240
Whether you're qualified to become
a member of Cheetah Commando,

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,681
the Hell Week is the litmus test.

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,360
Go!

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,201
Yes!

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,439
Captain,

97
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,440
the rookies have departed to the jungle.

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,440
Have the helicopter
and the paramedics reached the scene?

99
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,800
(They have reached the
specified location.)

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,760
(They're on standby.)

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,320
Stay alert.

102
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,680
If any of them can't take it,

103
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,800
we'll take them away immediately.

104
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,200
I'll give it a try.

105
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,120
Sure.

106
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:51,882
Wait for me.

107
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,640
Okay.

108
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,720
It's impossible to climb up the cliff
without climbing equipment.

109
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,641
Is there any other route?

110
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,281
There's no other route
within the visual range.

111
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,440
It seems that
besides crossing the waterfall,

112
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,840
we have no other choice.

113
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,480
Number 30,
do you have any other solution?

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,480
Let's form a Human Ladder.

115
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,760
Forming ladder in a group of three

116
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,599
while the rest climb up the ladder.

117
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,440
Buddy.

118
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,759
The surface is not even.

119
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,279
We can't even stand on
the ground steadily.

120
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,399
Furthermore,

121
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:00,791
it's so high!

122
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,800
A ladder formed by three people

123
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,041
is not enough!

124
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,320
What if someone falls down?

125
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,681
It's too risky!

126
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
Let's give it a try.

127
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,439
We can't afford to waste time here.

128
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Let's climb up the cliff
while we still have the energy.

129
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,681
Xiao.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,601
You, me and Number 9.

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,999
Three of us will form a Human Ladder.

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,800
Sure.

133
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,041
Number 31.

134
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,199
You'll go first.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,599
Here.

136
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,400
See you at the end point.

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,119
What's wrong with him?

138
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,249
He left first.

139
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,960
This is training, not a trip.

140
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:43,173
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

141
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,161
What a waste of time.

142
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,760
At least we can help each other.

143
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,159
Some people need help

144
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,559
but some people don't.

145
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,201
I'll get going then.
See you at the end point.

146
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,079
Let's go.

147
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,640
Let's go.

148
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,241
Hold on, Yan.

149
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,800
Wait for me. Hold on!

150
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,000
-Hold on!
-What's wrong?

151
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,280
Trust me.

152
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,640
Number 31.

153
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,119
You've been to
a similar place like this, right?

154
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,841
Yes.

155
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,639
It's like this.

156
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,720
Three of us will form a team.
What do you think?

157
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,920
I'm not interested.

158
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,280
Look.

159
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,000
You're a lady.

160
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,999
This is a primeval jungle.

161
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,839
If you chances upon
poisonous snakes or wild animals,

162
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,721
you'll need help.

163
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,919
We both can protect you.
Don't you think so?

164
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,081
Thank you.

165
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,240
I don't need to be taken care by others.

166
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,319
Hold on!

167
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,025
We need your help, okay?

168
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm serious.

169
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,559
We need to be protected.

170
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,881
Furthermore,

171
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,000
we're comrades, right?

172
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,721
As our comrade,

173
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,359
you don't want to see us
in danger, right?

174
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,680
As Qin Feng said before,

175
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,680
comrades always come first.

176
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
That's enough.

177
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,320
I don't need protection.

178
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,159
All right.

179
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,080
Listen.

180
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,080
We can take care of each other.

181
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
She's experienced.

182
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Trust me.

183
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,599
I agree to be part of a team
but on a condition.

184
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm familiar with jungle.

185
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,640
If something happens,
you have to listen to me.

186
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,920
No problem at all!

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,279
He's okay with it!

188
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,280
Take a rest.

189
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,560
Have some water.

190
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,080
Watch your steps.

191
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,359
It's only been one day

192
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,520
but many of them are
on the verge of exhaustion.

193
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Those lads still have a long way to go.

194
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,081
The rain came all of a sudden.

195
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,281
That's right.

196
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,760
It came and went in the blink of an eye.

197
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,320
It's not an easy path.

198
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,520
I'm starving.

199
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,720
How do I survive?

200
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,520
This condition will last
for the coming days.

201
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,121
Save up on food.

202
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,600
We still have a few days to go.

203
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,479
I only take a few bites of food per day.

204
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,119
I'm famished.

205
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,159
Let me tell you.

206
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,800
We only have this much of food.

207
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,360
When we're running out of food,
we'll have to eat what we can find here.

208
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,960
Number 31.

209
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Did you really survive in jungle

210
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
for three weeks with an energy bar?

211
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,280
It's 27 days.

212
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,720
27 days?

213
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,080
It's four weeks!

214
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
You're impressive.

215
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,479
What did you eat during that period?

216
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,119
Did you live on ant's eggs?

217
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
It's difficult to find ant's eggs.

218
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,079
Bugs are common in the jungle.

219
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,799
Let's find together.

220
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,960
If we find bugs, I'll have it first.

221
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,640
That's disgusting.

222
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,239
Did it poke you?

223
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,641
Captain.

224
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
Now, a quarter of the participants

225
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,319
are running a temperature.

226
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,599
A few of them have infected wound.

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,841
I'm just wondering
if we've set the threshold

228
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,520
of the Hell Week a little too high?

229
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,480
These rookies are unlike us.

230
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:16,640
(Cao Ben.)

231
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,479
(Since when you have
become so soft-hearted?)

232
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,239
(We are their enemies now.)

233
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,199
(We mustn't be soft-hearted.)

234
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,679
(Cao Ben.)

235
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,039
(Relax.)

236
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,800
(This is merely a camping outing.)

237
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,039
(They just have to
grill a chicken, catch a fish)

238
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,400
(and grill some mushrooms to survive.)

239
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:32,232
We tried those delicacies
that can be found in jungle.

240
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,681
They're yummy.

241
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,639
Food tastes extremely delicious
when you have to fight for it.

242
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,440
Got it.

243
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,640
However, our main aim

244
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,240
is to find new blood.

245
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,800
If none of them survives,

246
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,279
the selection won't end well.

247
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Cao Ben, what are you trying to say?

248
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,440
Have you forgotten the time when
we were surrounded by drug traffickers?

249
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,201
We were trapped in the jungle
for seven days and seven nights!

250
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,840
If the veterans of
Cheetah Commando could do it,

251
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
the new blood must be able
to do the same, too!

252
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,400
Captain!

253
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,120
Cover up!

254
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,320
Vice Captain.

255
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,279
Vice Captain!

256
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,280
Vice Captain, leave!

257
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,000
Fei.

258
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,920
Leave me alone. Leave now!

259
00:18:58,998 --> 00:18:59,638
Lift your leg.

260
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,481
No!

261
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,641
This is an order!

262
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Please, I beg of you! Leave now!

263
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,239
Leave.

264
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,921
Leave.

265
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,516
I didn't forget it.

266
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,716
It's unforgettable.

267
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,896
(That's for the best.)

268
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,119
(Always remember)

269
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,880
(that everything
starts with actual combat.)

270
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:22,849
That's the only way

271
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,440
to ensure that we are
victorious in the battles ahead

272
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,439
and avoid sacrifice.

273
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,201
Yes.

274
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,561
But don't worry,

275
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:31,912
I won't overestimate their capability.

276
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,080
So, please don't underestimate them.

277
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,920
Don't eat that.

278
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,280
It's pokeberry root. It's poisonous.

279
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,200
Aren't you hungry?

280
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,079
I've lost the biscuits.

281
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,081
Number 28, don't move.

282
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,081
Our food is here.

283
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:21,840
What's wrong?

284
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,720
What is it?

285
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:29,920
Don't move.

286
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,681
-Hurry up.
-It's round-headed, not poisonous.

287
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,000
Hurry up.

288
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,800
Hurry up!

289
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,360
I don't care if it has a
square or round head.

290
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
I don't care about that.

291
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,040
Number 31.

292
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,319
Have you tried it before?

293
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
I can't remember how many times

294
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,319
I've had it before.

295
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:55,599
You're useless.

296
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,720
You got freaked out by a snake.

297
00:21:58,258 --> 00:21:58,880
Yan.

298
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,520
You should have known better.

299
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,000
Apart from cockroaches,
my biggest fear is snakes.

300
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,199
Sometimes, I get startled
when I see worms.

301
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,801
Now, we are their predators.

302
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,105
Enjoy the delicacy.

303
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:10,026
I'll skip.

304
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:10,840
That's all right.

305
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:12,640
The snakes is too small
to share among us.

306
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,599
Number 31, are there any
other dishes in your menu?

307
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes.

308
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Can you cook them?

309
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,680
It smells good.

310
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,359
Try it.

311
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Listen.

312
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,079
It smells like grilled lamb.

313
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,200
Take a sniff.

314
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,959
Enjoy the grilled lamb.

315
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,000
It's high in protein.

316
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,281
Open your mouth.

317
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,320
You're disgusting!

318
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:39,200
Haven't you had grilled lamb before?

319
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:40,079
-Come on.
-I don't want to eat!

320
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:40,839
You've lost weight!

321
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,680
No way!

322
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,240
Stun grenades!

323
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,839
What is going on?

324
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,801
We're outnumbered! Let's go!

325
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,960
Why should we retreat?

326
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:16,720
If we retreat, we'll lose!

327
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,430
We'll only lose
if we can't make it to the end!

328
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,320
Let's go!

329
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,319
This way!

330
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,280
Jump!

331
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,480
Captain.

332
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,320
Here's Group One.

333
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,960
27, 28 and 31

334
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:45,433
have moved towards Area Three.

335
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:46,813
Got it.

336
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:47,534
Group One,

337
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,520
keep tracking them.

338
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,840
If anyone of them is exhausted,

339
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
call for help immediately.

340
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,320
Roger. Group One
understood the assignment.

341
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,120
Let's go!

342
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,480
Group Two, Three, Four and Five,

343
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,441
keep searching.

344
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,600
Chase them towards the end point.

345
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,480
I'm all right, Yan.

346
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,800
Check on Number 31.

347
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,840
Let me take a break.

348
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,800
Number 31.

349
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,400
Are you okay?

350
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,520
Slow down.

351
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,040
You're hit three times with a stick

352
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,560
on your shoulder,

353
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
leg

354
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,840
and back.

355
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,160
You're hit from top

356
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,600
to the bottom on your shoulder.

357
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,680
The impact was huge.

358
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,319
I think your shoulder has swollen up.

359
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,480
If you walk with your backpack on,

360
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,520
it'll cause pain.

361
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
So what?

362
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
You're beaten up too.

363
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,840
We have only minor injuries.

364
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,800
The journey will only get rougher.

365
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,040
You don't want to
affect our progress, right?

366
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,520
What's wrong?

367
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,320
If you're worried about that,

368
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,160
you may go first.

369
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,480
Look at you.

370
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,800
Can't you talk properly?

371
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,160
Number 31.

372
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,920
Don't listen to him.

373
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,840
Wait for me!

374
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,400
Let me carry it for you. Slow down.

375
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,320
Watch your steps.

376
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,720
We're a team.

377
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,680
Am I right?

378
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,960
Slow down.

379
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
You're doing it right, Yan.

380
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Come on, Number 11.

381
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,079
I can't take it anymore.

382
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,360
Hang in there!

383
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,320
Go for it!

384
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,160
Come on, Number 15!

385
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,080
You can do it!

386
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,840
Here.

387
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,840
Come on, Number 11!

388
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,640
Here.

389
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,520
Number 15.

390
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
How are you feeling, Number 15?

391
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,880
Number 15?

392
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,960
Number 15.

393
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,440
Number 15!

394
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,560
Number 15!

395
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:06,800
Number 15!

396
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Number 15, wake up!

397
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,760
Can you hear me?

398
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,560
Wake up!

399
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:12,400
Number 15!

400
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,361
Wake up! Wake up now!

401
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,440
You've succeeded.

402
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,760
Report.

403
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,080
Number 15 has passed out.

404
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Please send help.

405
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,000
Please send help!

406
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,400
Captain.

407
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,040
Send helicopter to help them.

408
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,000
Flying Hawk One,
someone has passed out.

409
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,200
His condition is unknown.

410
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,480
The coordination is X5W3.

411
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,360
The wound on the leg is infected.
He's running a temperature.

412
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,760
He is unable to
continue with the training.

413
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,874
(Send him to the hospital immediately.)

414
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,720
Yes.

415
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,760
Number 15.

416
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,080
Number 15!

417
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,839
Well done!

418
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,079
Number 11, what are you doing?

419
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,080
I applied to quit.

420
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,359
Just put up with it and hang in there.

421
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,921
It'll over soon!

422
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,080
Number Nine.

423
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,280
I can't hold you back anymore.

424
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,039
Don't do it, Number 11!

425
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,441
It's such a relief.

426
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,559
Finally, I can take a nap.

427
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,680
Here.

428
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,400
There are leeches.

429
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:31,305
It bites even though
I'm wearing trousers!

430
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:32,000
It bites!

431
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,840
How dare you bite me?

432
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:35,173
Even if you tuck your pants
into the boots

433
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,600
and put on long socks,

434
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
you still can't run away from leeches.

435
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,560
Let's go.

436
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,560
Come out. Stop hiding.

437
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,999
Not bad.

438
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,680
You're still surviving.

439
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,080
Do you want to eat?

440
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,840
Yes.

441
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:33,800
Let's eat together.

442
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,480
Thank you.

443
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,480
I...

444
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,520
You may have it.

445
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,439
Enjoy the food.

446
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,439
I'm leaving.

447
00:31:13,214 --> 00:31:14,199
You can have the rest.

448
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,079
Number 30, hold on!

449
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:17,880
How about this?

450
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:19,186
We...

451
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,920
Why don't we form a team?

452
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,320
I'm sorry.

453
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,592
I prefer moving alone.

454
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,440
Look.

455
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:26,280
You know nothing about unity.

456
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,120
Unity is strength.

457
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,921
I

458
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,314
only unite with true comrades.

459
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
We're trained together. Am I right?

460
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,839
We're trained together

461
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,560
and we're eliminated together.

462
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
At times, sacrifices happened.

463
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,240
I've experienced it too many times.

464
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,200
I don't want to
waste my feelings for nothing.

465
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,080
I hope you can survive the training.

466
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,200
We will survive for sure.

467
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,080
See you at the end point.

468
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,280
See you at the end point.

469
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,920
He's such a piece of wood.

470
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,040
Yan.

471
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,760
Yan, wait for me.

472
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,440
Something is not right.

473
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,520
We've been walking around the same spot.

474
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:14,839
Are we walking in circle?

475
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,280
It's in broad daylight.

476
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,080
It's impossible we're walking in circle.

477
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,680
The woods are getting denser.

478
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,520
If we keep walking,
we'll get lost in the direction.

479
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,760
We can only climb uphill.

480
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,319
Can you see the spot with light?

481
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,760
We'll climb over the ridge.

482
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,160
Can we even do that?

483
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,119
You two may take a break.

484
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,280
I'm going to scout ahead.

485
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,199
Let me do it.

486
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,001
Give me a chance to show off.

487
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,481
Be careful!

488
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,840
Don't worry.

489
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,239
Yan!

490
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,160
Are you okay?

491
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,640
Something happened.

492
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,840
Report!

493
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,320
A participant's signal is interrupted.

494
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,240
Who is it?

495
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,439
Number 27.

496
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,719
Has something gone wrong
with the Individual Combat System

497
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,680
or is it because of some other reason?

498
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,160
I need to look into it.

499
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,159
Show me the last captured image.

500
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,080
Yes.

501
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,800
What are you doing?

502
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,798
I'm calling the helicopter.

503
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:30,960
I must ensure his safety.

504
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,920
Why are you so sure
that something bad has happened?

505
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,359
Isn't it obvious?

506
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,160
Here.

507
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,280
Can you see that?

508
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,919
His heartbeat is slightly faster
and his blood pressure is slightly low

509
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,320
but it doesn't show any sign of danger.

510
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:44,999
They're well trained.

511
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,520
Believe in their ability.

512
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,720
Sure.

513
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,280
I'll inform Captain
and get his instructions.

514
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,120
Sure.

515
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,439
Stay here.

516
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:55,225
I'll go down.

517
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:55,960
Hold on!

518
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,080
As a man, I can't let you go down.

519
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,800
I'll do it.

520
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,360
I'm lighter than you in term of weight.

521
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,880
I think the vines can take my weight.

522
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,680
Stop talking rubbish!
Let me do it. Come up!

523
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,920
My position is higher than you.

524
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,320
I'm more senior than you!

525
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,880
It's an embarrassment
to let you do it.

526
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
This is an order!

527
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,360
Move!

528
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,760
Listen.

529
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,720
If Number 27 can't proceed any further,

530
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,840
I'll provide the coordination

531
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,720
and seek for help.

532
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,640
Be careful.

533
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,599
Don't talk rubbish.

534
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,000
(I suggest giving him help to
prevent accident during the training.)

535
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,480
Hold on.

536
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:49,479
Captain.

537
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,840
-But...
-I said, hold on!

538
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,399
Why do you behave like a woman?

539
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,120
Don't worry.

540
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,199
How are you?

541
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,520
Are you okay?

542
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,480
Slow down.

543
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,159
Slow down.

544
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,080
Slow down.

545
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,360
Are you okay?

546
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,680
Are you okay?

547
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,640
Number 31's recording is gone, too.

548
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:53,440
Show me the other recording.

549
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,120
I can't find any.

550
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
It may due to
the unstable signals in the valley.

551
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,920
What are we looking for?

552
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,880
What is there to look for?

553
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,080
Both of them don't ask for help.

554
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,680
That means Number 27 and 31
are not in danger.

555
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,760
Am I right?

556
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,960
I've finished my coffee.

557
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,960
Share some with me.

558
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,160
Look at you.

559
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,760
Zhou Zi Jian!

560
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,199
What happened to you?

561
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:44,400
I was bitten by a spider.

562
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,000
Sit down.

563
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
It's not a big problem.

564
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,120
Why are you alone?

565
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,280
Where is Yan Po Yue?

566
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,320
He rolled down the hillside.

567
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
I was so worried.

568
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,400
Fortunately, nothing bad happened.

569
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,600
Number 31 went down to look for him.

570
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,400
He's great.

571
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,680
He won't need help from others.

572
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,561
What do you mean?

573
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,000
Nothing.

574
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,721
You take him as your buddy.

575
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,800
What does he take you as?

576
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,440
Are you picking a fight?

577
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,120
Zhou Zi Jian, listen carefully.

578
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,960
You either shut up

579
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,760
or go somewhere else.

580
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,600
Xiao Yun Jie.

581
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,560
Take care.

582
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,560
Fine.

583
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,640
Sit there.

584
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,080
Look at you.

585
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,680
You're acting fine
even when you've lost an arm.

586
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,120
We're from the same squad.

587
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:11,560
I'm reminding you

588
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,241
not to badmouth others.

589
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,600
Bear with it.

590
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:37,080
Here.

591
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,000
Are you okay?

592
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,239
Do you want to ask for help?

593
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,679
Do you believe that

594
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:27,679
I'll eat the smoking tool
in front of you?

595
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,840
What are you thinking?

596
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,117
I fell into a well when I was young.

597
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,240
It was broader and deeper

598
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,919
than this.

599
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,399
What happened next?

600
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,720
Did someone carry you out of the well?

601
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:14,760
I climbed out the well on my own.

602
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,240
How old were you?

603
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,760
I was about five to six years old.

604
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,560
I was freaked out.

605
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,599
I don't remember much.

606
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,240
No one found you?

607
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,760
In that well,

608
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,360
there were many people.

609
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,159
They looked at me.

610
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,560
No one hoped that I could escape.

611
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,639
Help! Someone is escaping!

612
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,719
Someone is escaping!

613
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,199
Help! Someone is escaping!

614
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,200
No wonder you don't believe in teamwork.

615
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:55,800
It makes sense now.

616
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,760
At the critical moment,

617
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:00,679
you can only rely on yourself.

618
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,439
Do you know?

619
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,439
When you fell down,

620
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,719
Number 28 was almost driven crazy.

621
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,080
Life is ruled by fate.

622
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Getting worried is pointless.

623
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Number 27.

624
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,080
What does your family
do for a living?

625
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:21,320
They're soldiers.

626
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,360
No wonder.

627
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,480
Number 31.

628
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,560
What about you?

629
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,320
I...

630
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:36,480
I came from Mongolia.

631
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,680
I lived on the grassland.

632
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,680
No wonder you're so strong.
