(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,119
(Episode 2)

4
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,199
-Zhang Tian Yang!
-Yes, sir!

5
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,480
-Gather around!
-Yes, sir!

6
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:38,839
Halt!

7
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,360
With First Squad Leader as your centre,
dress centre, dress!

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,559
Eyes front!

9
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:45,440
Xiao Yun Jie.

10
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,720
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,839
Repeat

12
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,879
what you had said just now.

13
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,080
Hurry!

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,360
Is your tongue tied

15
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,240
after seeing our female officer?

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,440
Louder!

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,919
Make yourself clear!

18
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,720
Yan, did you see that?

19
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,320
That female officer looks beautiful!

20
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,119
Yan Po Yue,

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,679
how did you answer him?

22
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,399
Repeat what you had said

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,839
using the same attitude

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,559
and tone.

25
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,160
Is this your first time seeing a woman?

26
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,240
Louder!

27
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,880
Is this your first time seeing a woman?

28
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,639
-Zhang Tian Yang!
-Yes, sir!

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,000
Bring the two of them

30
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
and march in double time
to the front of the canteen!

31
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,720
Ask them to repeat what they had said
about their superior loudly

32
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,919
for 200 times!

33
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,322
Yes, sir!

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
You may begin.

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,679
Squad Leader,

36
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,559
I don't think this is suitable.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,199
Hurry!

38
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,121
Li, don't you think
you're going overboard?

39
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,399
Am I going overboard?

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,440
I think it's just nice.

41
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,119
You need to look at the bigger picture.

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Two new recruits spouting nonsense
in front of the canteen.

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,479
It's embarrassing for
the recruit company, you know?

44
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,960
It's better for them to embarrass us now
than embarrass us in the future.

45
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,720
I realised that I cannot
understand what you're thinking at all.

46
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,199
They might embarrass our company,

47
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,440
but they will have to
bear the consequences.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,040
Staff Officer Ai.

49
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:58,191
Weren't you guys all fired up just now?

50
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,600
Don't stop.

51
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,440
Continue.

52
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm telling you to continue.

53
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,679
Yan, did you see that?

54
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,240
That female officer looks beautiful!

55
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:14,679
What about you?

56
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:18,607
I told you to continue.

57
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:24,320
Let him speak.

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,880
Yan Po Yue, continue.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,799
Is this your first time seeing a woman?

60
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,040
I'm the only female cadre
in the entire office.

61
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,279
What do you guys think
you're doing here?

62
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,959
Ma'am!

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,360
We were just expressing our feelings.

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,359
Do you think this is the right place
for you to do so?

65
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,399
Ma'am,

66
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,321
we didn't want to do this.

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,517
But we have to follow
our superior's order.

68
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,275
Whose order was this?

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Staff Officer Ai, our company commander
ordered them to do so.

70
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:02,289
Who's your company commander?

71
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,119
-It's Li Xiang.
-Staff Officer Ai!

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,929
Instructor.

73
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,799
Staff Officer Ai, this is
a misunderstanding.

74
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,600
Li Xiang told these two fellows
to shout at a public place like this.

75
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:13,399
Now, everyone knows what happened.

76
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,279
Who do you think they'll misunderstand?

77
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,280
These two new recruits were insensible.
They talked about you behind your back.

78
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,200
Li was just telling them
to do so out of spite.

79
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,040
He didn't expect them
to take his words seriously.

80
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,760
They're idiots for doing so.

81
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,197
What did he say out of spite?

82
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,920
May we speak in private?

83
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,439
Tell me.

84
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:33,906
Right here.

85
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:41,218
Li said

86
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,559
this.

87
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,048
"Who do you think Staff Officer Ai is?"

88
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,335
"What gives you two the right
to talk about her behind her back?"

89
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,478
"Even I don't have the right
to talk about her!"

90
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,279
That's what he said.

91
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,728
I don't care how
Li Xiang trains his new recruits.

92
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,537
But the two of them are too bold.

93
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,072
Remember to discipline them.

94
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,320
Yes, ma'am. We will surely do so.

95
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
What are your names?

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,681
Ma'am,

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,635
I'm Xiao Yun Jie!

98
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,150
Ma'am,

99
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,658
I'm Yan Po Yue.

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,791
Good.

101
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,385
I remember your names now.

102
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:19,720
Instructor,

103
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,040
go back and tell Li Xiang

104
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,000
that I'll surely visit him one day.

105
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,119
You're welcome to instruct us.

106
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,702
Staff Officer Ai, take care.

107
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,399
198,

108
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,559
199,

109
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,559
200!

110
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,416
Yan, look at you.

111
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,440
You just had to do a few more push-ups.

112
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,399
We aren't competing with each other.

113
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,236
Are you trying to prove
that you're stronger?

114
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,880
I'm not competing with you.

115
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,369
Not me? Who are you competing with then?

116
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,119
You're competing with someone every day.

117
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Don't tell me it's the squad leader?

118
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,947
I think it's him.

119
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,959
According to what your father had said,

120
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,760
you've served in the military
longer than our squad leader.

121
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,880
You've been serving
in the military for 10 years.

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
It's been 10 years,

123
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,039
but this is my first time
wearing a military uniform.

124
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,640
That means I'm a new recruit.

125
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,519
So what if you're a new recruit...

126
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,640
So what if you're a new recruit?

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,559
Our squad leader told us about this when
we first joined the recruit company.

128
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,760
In the recruit company,

129
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,559
even if you're a rising dragon,
you'd better not show off.

130
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,880
Even if you're a fierce tiger,
you'd better keep a low profile.

131
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,040
What gives him the right to say so?

132
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,279
Back then, I wanted to ask him

133
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,559
if he was a slayer of
dragons and tigers.

134
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,839
We became soldiers
because of our capabilities.

135
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,559
What gives them
the right to suppress us?

136
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,799
If I must say,

137
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,399
the instructor is an intelligent person.

138
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:31,200
He's expecting us to
score achievements for the company.

139
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,279
He's overthinking it.

140
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,839
Tell me then. What do you think
the company commander is thinking?

141
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,470
Him?

142
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:40,176
He didn't want to expose us
even though he knew the truth.

143
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:43,000
-He's just trying to mess with us.
-Mess with us?

144
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:44,529
Do you think it'll work?

145
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,239
It might not work against me.

146
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,877
But you?

147
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,049
That's hard to say.

148
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,559
What did you say? What do you mean?

149
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,369
What do you mean by that?

150
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,679
You two!

151
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:05,463
I've been tolerating
you two for a long time.

152
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,174
What?

153
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,760
Xiao,

154
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,039
if we beat them up,

155
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:20,914
we'll be punished.

156
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:25,095
See you on the training ground tomorrow.

157
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,744
Fine.

158
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,440
Tomorrow's our
grappling training, right?

159
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,330
I'll wait for you.

160
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,520
The loser will have to bring the winner
three days' worth of water.

161
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,635
Three days, you hear me?

162
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,919
Stop! Next group!

163
00:08:58,842 --> 00:08:59,842
Get ready!

164
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:14,806
Nice.

165
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:41,994
Stop!

166
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,260
Stop!

167
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,599
Yan Po Yue, stop right now!

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,728
Stop!

169
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,200
Stop! Yan Po Yue!

170
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:11,960
-Stop!
-Let go of him!

171
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,559
-Stop!
-Let go of him! Yan Po Yue!

172
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,919
Let go of him! Yan Po Yue!

173
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,856
-Jian!
-Zhou Zi Jian!

174
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,880
Zhou Zi Jian, are you okay?

175
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,679
-Yan, are you okay?
-Zhou Zi Jian!

176
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,853
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,642
-Zi Jian?
-Jian?

178
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,320
He just has insufficient
blood supply to the brain.

179
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:30,242
He'll be fine after resting.

180
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:31,729
Yan Po Yue, how dare you play dirty!

181
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,719
Are you blind?

182
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,400
He attacked him after the whistle
was blown. Who's the one playing dirty?

183
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Shut up!

184
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,880
Zi Jian, how do you feel?

185
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,541
Yan Po Yue,

186
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:43,900
who taught you that?

187
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,080
No one.

188
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,666
It's just plain stress response.

189
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,039
-Gao Zhun, Guan Yong.
-Yes, sir.

190
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:52,968
Send Zi Jian to the health team.

191
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,079
-Yes, sir.
-Hurry!

192
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,156
Be careful.

193
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,559
As for the rest, stand at ease.

194
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,063
Get ready for the obstacle course.

195
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,171
Good!

196
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,200
Tian Yang, look at those two.

197
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,679
Although they're mischievous,

198
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,320
they have excellent physical fitness.

199
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,119
Allocate one of them to me
when they're out of the company.

200
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,080
Don't ask me about that.
You should ask the company commander.

201
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,000
I have to go through you before
I can ask the company commander, right?

202
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:36,999
After all,
they're the soldiers you raised.

203
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,830
The soldiers I raised?

204
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,919
Although Xiao Yun Jie
has excellent physical fitness,

205
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:45,861
he's not familiar with
marching, handling firearms,

206
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:47,752
and so on.

207
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,080
If you insist on saying that
I raised him, I can accept it.

208
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,947
But that Yan Po Yue,

209
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,520
he's good at grappling, marching,

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
handling firearms, obstacle courses,

211
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:55,799
you name it.

212
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:57,499
He's good at everything.

213
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,009
And, he's better than me
for most of the courses.

214
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,369
You want to say that I raised
a soldier like him?

215
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,960
He's just born to be a soldier.

216
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,880
-You must be joking.
-Why should I do so?

217
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:06,306
You saw the grappling training
session yourself.

218
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:07,642
But he was pretty ruthless.

219
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:09,505
What kind of technique was that?

220
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:13,218
It's a technique used by
scouts in the 80s.

221
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,533
It's called blood choke.

222
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:17,119
Due to its lethality,

223
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,111
the current military system
has forsaken it.

224
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,410
(When a recruit joins
the recruit company,)

225
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,241
(they must learn basic
military housekeeping.)

226
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:28,752
(It's a tradition passed down from
the PLA tens of years ago.)

227
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:31,720
(At first, I couldn't understand why.)

228
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:34,088
(American soldiers I saw
in the movies were strong)

229
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,330
(and capable,)

230
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,832
(but they didn't need to
fold blankets every day.)

231
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:40,595
(After some time, I found out)

232
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,158
(that American soldiers have to iron
their uniform perfectly every day,)

233
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:46,450
(especially their collars.)

234
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,640
(For the Russian army,)

235
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,986
(their equivalent of housekeeping
is polishing their shoes.)

236
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:54,522
(In the world, armies that are strong)

237
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,025
(and have a glorious history behind them
always have their own distinctive ways)

238
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,377
(to steel the new recruits' resolve)

239
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,314
(on their first day of training.)

240
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,080
(It teaches them how to tolerate
and obey the orders of their superiors.)

241
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:09,359
(Repetitive menial tasks are
assigned to the new recruits)

242
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:11,478
(to grind away their impulsive nature)

243
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,399
(until their mentality)

244
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,640
(transforms from
a commoner's to a soldier's.)

245
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,440
Zhou Zi Jian has
no concept of time at all.

246
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,217
Where's the water
he promised to bring us?

247
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:29,970
You're here?

248
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,717
Thank you for the trouble.

249
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,424
What kind of attitude was that?

250
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:38,168
It's great that we can have water
without needing to do any labour.

251
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:39,650
It tastes sweet too.

252
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,968
Wait, where's Yan?

253
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,679
Did he go to train again?

254
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,244
Don't you understand him by now?

255
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,199
His testosterone
will go through the roof

256
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,666
if he doesn't train.

257
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:28,760
Lights will be out soon.

258
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,559
Why are you still here?

259
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:35,961
Squad Leader,

260
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,447
I'm revising the four exercises
we've learned today.

261
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,599
Where's Xiao Yun Jie?
Isn't he with you?

262
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,679
He was exhausted from the assessment.
He wanted to rest early.

263
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,538
I'm heading back now.

264
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,104
Although you're more
hard-working than him,

265
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,000
Xiao Yun Jie is much better than you.

266
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,079
Lu Xiao Tian fell

267
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:56,769
during the
5-km running assessment today.

268
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:00,416
When he asked you for help,
you ignored him.

269
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,679
But Xiao Yun Jie helped him up.

270
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:07,048
I admit. He likes
to help other people out.

271
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,877
What's the first lesson

272
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,359
you learned on your first day here?

273
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,181
Did you forget it already?

274
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,560
Although Lu Xiao Tian
is a terrible soldier,

275
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,503
he's your comrade from the same squad.

276
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,457
Helping each other out is the
most basic skill for every soldier.

277
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,244
Squad Leader,

278
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,319
do you really think he's my comrade?

279
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,320
How is he not your comrade?

280
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:30,808
A squad is a collective.

281
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,400
Don't you know that every soldier
must have team spirit?

282
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,159
I know that.

283
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,000
But just like what you have seen,

284
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,322
he'll only drag us down.

285
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,336
Fine.

286
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,840
I'll give you another example then.

287
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,961
If you guys were on the battlefield,

288
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,559
and if Lu Xiao Tian
fell on the battlefield,

289
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:48,799
would you save him or not?

290
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,359
On the battlefield,
I would've cleared a path

291
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:53,736
when he was busy falling down.

292
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,408
What if Xiao Yun Jie
was the one who fell down?

293
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,127
Would you leave him in the lurch too?

294
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,760
Squad Leader, bullets have no eyes.

295
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,449
If I fall before Yun Jie,

296
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:09,088
I'll accept my fate.

297
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,359
I'm talking to a brick wall here!

298
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:14,689
Squad Leader.

299
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:16,970
Speak!

300
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,359
There's a veteran
who always trains here at night.

301
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,081
His movements were close to perfection.

302
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,985
Who is he?

303
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,385
He's a bull,

304
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,236
and he's crazier than you.

305
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,369
Listen carefully.
You'd better not mess with him.

306
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,999
Everyone, gather around!

307
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,119
Those at the back, hurry up!

308
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,633
Dress right, dress!

309
00:16:58,312 --> 00:16:59,671
Eyes front!

310
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,320
Count off!

311
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,564
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

312
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,319
8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

313
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,199
13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

314
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,680
18, 19, 20, 21!

315
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,359
Attendance full!

316
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:10,611
At ease.

317
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,181
Attention!

318
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,119
Company Commander,

319
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,160
all the new recruits are here!
Please give us your instruction!

320
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:21,642
-Fall in!
-Yes, sir!

321
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:33,880
Very good.

322
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,599
You guys do resemble true soldiers
in the slightest sense now.

323
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,439
But you guys still have
a long way to go!

324
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:41,478
Tonight,

325
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,079
we will hold the night military
geographical assessment.

326
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,955
In ascending order,

327
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:47,424
three men will form a group.

328
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,199
Each group will get a compass

329
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:51,994
and a map.

330
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,345
Each group will depart
from a different location.

331
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,728
You guys

332
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,296
need to find your way back here

333
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,097
in the shortest time possible.

334
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,920
When you're back, press the button
and record your time.

335
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:04,939
A distress signal transmitter

336
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,800
is inside the backpack
we've allocated to you guys.

337
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,920
If you're in an emergency,
you may use it.

338
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,197
However,

339
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,517
that also means

340
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,361
that you will get zero marks
for the current assessment.

341
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,920
-Understood?
-Understood!

342
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,408
All squads,

343
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,736
-get in line and board the vehicle!
-Yes, sir!

344
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,760
Group One, Yan Po Yue.

345
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,040
Yes, sir.

346
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,239
-Xiao Yun Jie.
-Yes, sir.

347
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,199
-Lu Xiao Tian.
-Yes, sir.

348
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,880
-Exit the vehicle!
-Yes, sir!

349
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,588
Hurry up!

350
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:08,213
So, the three of us...

351
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,064
Buddy!

352
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:11,124
Wait for me!

353
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:12,656
Slow down!

354
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,041
Buddy!

355
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,642
Wait for me!

356
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,830
The three of us
are in the same group, right?

357
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:26,150
Do you need anything else?

358
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:38,641
Xiao, if you take this at night,

359
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:40,423
it'll provide you with energy. Take it.

360
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,199
In the future, the three of us

361
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,002
will be a family.
Don't stand on ceremony.

362
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:45,681
Really?

363
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,806
Say,

364
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,119
you're pretty intelligent, aren't you?

365
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,072
So...

366
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,640
The two of us will open a way.
You can just enjoy the ride.

367
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,513
Xiao, I beg to differ.

368
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:00,319
I think the three of us
are made for each other.

369
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,800
Look, you two are super strong.

370
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,010
Ordinary people
don't dare to approach you two.

371
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,839
But I don't want to claim any credits.

372
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,687
You see, I live by these words.

373
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,513
If you rest under a big tree,
the sun won't reach you.

374
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,040
If you look at the sky,
you can sleep at ease.

375
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,439
The two of you are my sky and tree.

376
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,880
In the future,
if we cooperate with each other,

377
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:16,037
I'm sure it'll be easy
and pleasant for the three of us.

378
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,119
Lu Xiao Tian, what you said just now
was pretty meaningless.

379
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,239
With thick skin like yours,
the company will surely award you

380
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,400
if we can make bulletproof vests
using your skin.

381
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,520
Xiao, what do you mean by that?

382
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,416
You're thick-skinned.

383
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,861
That was witty.

384
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,252
You two are witty and humorous.

385
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,000
Yan, slow down.

386
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,736
You should hurry up.

387
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:44,906
Wait, my buddies.

388
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:46,689
Are we on the right track?

389
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,760
I just checked the map.

390
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
We just need to head towards 4 o'clock
and everything will be fine.

391
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,280
But there's no one here at all.

392
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,088
-Something seems amiss.
-We exit the vehicle at different times.

393
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,719
And we're not taking the same path.

394
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
If everyone takes the same path,

395
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,000
the assessment will be meaningless.

396
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,599
Isn't it more fun if we all hold hands
and take a stroll together?

397
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:03,554
Can you slow down?

398
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:06,719
They didn't give us a torchlight.
How could we see anything in the dark?

399
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
It's a night operation. Using
a torchlight will expose our tracks.

400
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,040
What are you doing?

401
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,416
It's dark.

402
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,319
What? Are you scared?

403
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:20,343
No. I'm not scared.

404
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,959
We're soldiers, you know?
We cannot be afraid of the dark.

405
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,880
Yan, are you afraid of the dark?

406
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,599
You're asking him?

407
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,599
He once slept at a cemetery
when he was still in primary school.

408
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,599
Yan is pretty hardcore, huh?

409
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,822
It's lucky that there's
no cemetery around here.

410
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,959
That's hard to say.

411
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,839
You see, wild graves are abundant
in jungles like these.

412
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,199
Maybe there's one right under your foot.

413
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,280
-You must be joking.
-You see,

414
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,400
we must never take pictures
when we're on a wild road like this.

415
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,236
But why?

416
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,885
Once, a group of backpackers...

417
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,447
There were three of them.

418
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:57,473
Just like us, they came to
a jungle like this.

419
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,000
They thought the scenery was beautiful
as they saw the sun setting.

420
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Thus, they took a picture together.

421
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,439
In the end, they couldn't
leave the jungle no matter what.

422
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,280
No matter where they went,
they always ended up in the same spot.

423
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,119
Everywhere looked the same to them.
Everything was pitch black.

424
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,040
All they saw were trees.

425
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,560
Look.

426
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,291
Over there.

427
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,799
It looks just like this.

428
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,119
So, how did they manage
to leave the jungle after that?

429
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,239
On the second morning,

430
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,160
they managed to leave the jungle
after the sun rose.

431
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,239
Even though it should only take
20 minutes for them to leave the jungle,

432
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,839
they spent the entire night
getting lost in the jungle.

433
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,640
That's normal, isn't it?

434
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,640
It's easier to find the way back
when there's sunlight.

435
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,400
You two, hurry up.

436
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,719
Alright, Yan. You should
open a path for us.

437
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,791
-Yan and I will open a path.
-Don't!

438
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,160
That's what they thought as well.

439
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,306
Do you remember the picture they took?

440
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,880
The leader was dumbfounded
after he developed the picture.

441
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:50,904
Even though there were
only three people in the group,

442
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,199
they found a fourth face in the picture!

443
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,160
Lu Xiao Tian, are you out of your mind?

444
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,839
He tried to hit me! Did you see that?

445
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,520
How dare you try to hit me!

446
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,839
Lu Xiao Tian! He must be
out of his mind! He's sprinting!

447
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,158
-I'll cover this path!
-Hurry!

448
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,213
Lu Xiao Tian, stop running!
There's a cliff in front of you!

449
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,119
-Xiao Tian!
-Yan!

450
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,640
Yan! Xiao Tian! Where are you guys?

451
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,800
Don't let go of my hands!

452
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:24,880
Lu Xiao Tian, stop pulling my pants!

453
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,439
I'm out of strength!

454
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,439
I heard an echo from the stone I threw.

455
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,560
That means this cliff isn't steep.
Maybe it's just a slope.

456
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,599
-Yan!
-Don't come here!

457
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,720
Don't come here!

458
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,199
Can you stop pulling my pants?

459
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,599
Let go!

460
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,599
Shift your centre of gravity to the back
and slide down the slope!

461
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,319
Yan.

462
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,119
-Yan.
-Save me.

463
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,719
-Are you okay?
-What about you? I'm fine.

464
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,680
-Xiao.
-Are you dead yet?

465
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:23,986
Thanks.

466
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,775
Give me the compass.

467
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,359
Yan, I have something to tell you.
Please calm down.

468
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:36,674
Just stop.

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,079
I'm sure he lost the compass.

470
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,275
He's right.

471
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:42,869
Where's the map?

472
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,839
I kept it together with the compass.

473
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:49,839
Lu Xiao Tian, why didn't you
slide your way into oblivion?

474
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,920
Now, we have no map

475
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,280
and no compass!

476
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Forget about our assessment!
We can't even descend the hill!

477
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:57,690
Just send out the distress signal
and give up on the assessment.

478
00:24:57,904 --> 00:24:59,984
I lost the transmitter as well.

479
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,160
So, we can't even give up now?

480
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,000
I guess so.

481
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:04,680
Lu Xiao Tian, I!

482
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,520
Second Place Xiao,
do you think this would happen

483
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,640
if you didn't try to scare me just now?

484
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,119
-Who should be blamed for this?
-Are you blaming me right now?

485
00:25:09,256 --> 00:25:10,416
Did I tell you to tag along with us?

486
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,280
Did I tell you to lose all those things?

487
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,760
-Do you think you're guilt-free?
-Enough!

488
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,515
We're still in the middle
of our assessment!

489
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,560
You shouldn't blame
yourself too much, Xiao.

490
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:24,688
West is to our 9 o'clock.

491
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:26,616
If we head north-west for about one km,

492
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
we'll find the main path
that'll take us back to the camp.

493
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,079
-Look at this.
-What is this?

494
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:41,119
Do we need to survive in the wild now?

495
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,319
Tsaoko fruits.

496
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,920
Since there are tsaoko trees here,
there must be a stream below.

497
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:47,239
If we follow the stream,
we can descend the hill.

498
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,322
Let's go.

499
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:50,287
Don't follow us.

500
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,283
Are they from the recruit company?

501
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:34,728
Yan.

502
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:36,658
It's a supply vehicle.

503
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,773
I think it's from our company.

504
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:39,962
Every cloud has a silver lining indeed!

505
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,838
We're done refilling the water.
Let's go.

506
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:50,689
Yan!

507
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,517
Don't forget about me!

508
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,800
Seems like we can have supper tonight.

509
00:27:32,304 --> 00:27:33,664
Stealing military supplies

510
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,680
is the same as stealing
or seizing firearms,

511
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:37,577
and you will be dealt with accordingly
for your crime.

512
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:41,533
Do you remember that?

513
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:42,728
It's a crime?

514
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:43,892
Put them back.

515
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:46,782
Lu Xiao Tian,

516
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:48,283
how dare you say we're a family?

517
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,447
You'll get us into trouble
sooner or later.

518
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,385
What should we do right now?

519
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:58,619
Sleep.

520
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,211
Go away.

521
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,135
-Wait.
-What's wrong?

522
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:23,884
This is not the path to our camp.

523
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:27,799
That's impossible.

524
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:30,504
We're the only company
stationed in this region.

525
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,232
Where else are we going if not our camp?

526
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,073
We're ascending a mountain right now.

527
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:36,241
It's a different mountain.

528
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:39,319
Our company is still below the mountain.
We got on the wrong vehicle.

529
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:42,333
That's fine.
We can't do anything about it.

530
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,635
Calm down.

531
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:45,794
We can't leave the vehicle anyway.

532
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
After they stop,
we can just report the situation to them

533
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
and ask them to send us back.

534
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,178
My buddies, to be honest,

535
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:53,768
after that incident,

536
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,771
I think I've sustained
serious internal injuries.

537
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:57,337
I can't move for now.

538
00:28:57,929 --> 00:28:59,729
It's even hard for me
to get up right now.

539
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,056
Lu Xiao Tian,

540
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,881
I thought you wanted to
have supper just now?

541
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,209
But now, you have internal injuries?

542
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,751
Aren't you afraid that this vehicle
will bring us somewhere else?

543
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:08,560
Why should we be afraid
when it's from our company?

544
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,314
Special Service Company!
Exit the vehicle!

545
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,080
Everybody!

546
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,160
Dress right, dress!

547
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,000
Eyes front!

548
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,455
So, this is another company?

549
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,588
At ease.

550
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,408
Attention!

551
00:30:03,617 --> 00:30:04,817
Vice Company Commander,

552
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,319
Platoon One, Two,
and Three are all here!

553
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,199
Please give us your instructions!

554
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,719
-First Platoon Leader!
-Yes, sir!

555
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,359
What's the duty of the
Special Forces Company?

556
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,719
Vice Company Commander,

557
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,000
the duty of the Special Forces Company
is a counter-terrorism response unit!

558
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,079
Our duty is to stabilise and handle
sudden terrorist attacks,

559
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,056
to assist the borders to
protect our motherland,

560
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,761
and to protect the people
and their wealth.

561
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:23,842
What about the glorious history
of our company?

562
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,033
Our company was formed in 1996.

563
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,705
Our company has made many important
contributions in counter-terrorism

564
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,327
operations, anti-smuggling
operations, border operations,

565
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,680
and rescue operations.

566
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,239
13 of our company members
had died in the line of duty!

567
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,760
They're received Collective
First-Class Merit for their sacrifices!

568
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:39,257
With their bravery and passionate
hearts, our predecessors had

569
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:41,809
won the title of Tiger for our company!

570
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,911
-Fall in!
-Yes, sir!

571
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:48,064
Did all of you hear that?

572
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:51,617
The banner hanging on the merit list

573
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:55,672
was the result of
our predecessors' blood, sweat, tears,

574
00:30:55,865 --> 00:30:57,546
even their sacrifices!

575
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:00,370
You must always remember this honour!

576
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,412
They didn't leave us!

577
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,954
They're a part of us right now!

578
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,810
The current us

579
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:08,787
are just like the past them!

580
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:11,534
Back then, whenever there was danger,

581
00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:14,332
they would strike at its heart,
just like a dagger.

582
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:15,666
Tonight,

583
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,680
we must break our record for the drill!

584
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Dispatch me in the first battle,
victory will be assured!

585
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,839
Dispatch me in the first battle,
victory will be assured!

586
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,040
Dispatch me in the first battle,
victory will be assured!

587
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,280
Next, I will brief you guys
about the mission for your drill.

588
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:33,465
A random armed
drug-trafficking organisation

589
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:35,033
has occupied the hill.

590
00:31:35,322 --> 00:31:38,722
The public security bureau has
requested our help to wipe them out.

591
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:42,000
After one hour, our company
will launch an attack on them

592
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,760
and infiltrate the territory
of said organisation.

593
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:48,074
We will locate and destroy
their command centre.

594
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:49,650
The supply vehicles

595
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:51,434
have prepared supper for you all.

596
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:54,307
We will end the battle
within half an hour.

597
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,679
Understood?

598
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,119
Yes, sir!

599
00:32:00,756 --> 00:32:02,555
Company, rest!

600
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,959
We will depart in 10 minutes!

601
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:06,032
Yes, sir!

602
00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:12,132
Tiger Special Forces?

603
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:16,189
So, that's the absurdly strong unit?

604
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:17,518
Due to that, I suggest

605
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,194
we retreat right away
after they depart in 10 minutes.

606
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,921
Where can we retreat to?
We're already here, you know?

607
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,961
Psycho King keeps telling us
that their unit is absurdly strong.

608
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,760
Today, I'll see how strong they are.

609
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,280
Wait. What are you two doing?

610
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,761
My buddies,
weren't you guys joking just now?

611
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,839
Who said we were joking?

612
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,439
Besides, this is just a drill.
It's not a real operation.

613
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,455
What are you afraid of?

614
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:35,345
Do you think a drill is not dangerous?

615
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,166
Do you even know that'll happen later?

616
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:38,627
Yan, hurry and persuade him!

617
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:41,097
-Yan, what do you think you're doing?
-What do you think?

618
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:43,025
You two must be out of your mind!

619
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:46,019
What are you guys doing?
We're new recruits! We can't go!

620
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:47,876
Can we just stop?

621
00:32:48,072 --> 00:32:50,319
Just your luck.
You should just accept your fate.

622
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:52,228
Don't you think
I'm already unlucky enough?

623
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,585
I rolled off a slope,

624
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,119
and now,
I have to follow lunatics like you two.

625
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,922
Didn't you say we were a family?

626
00:32:58,152 --> 00:33:00,319
Do you think you should stay here
when both of us are going?

627
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,239
Look, isn't it better for us
to go back as a family?

628
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:04,471
Do you know how risky it is?

629
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,800
You always said that I dragged you down.
Now, aren't you dragging me down?

630
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,040
Do you two think that you haven't
caused enough trouble for other people?

631
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,306
You two are breaching the rules here!

632
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,580
Did you hear me?

633
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:15,163
Look at how bold you are.

634
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:16,698
You're wearing
a high-ranking title, you know?

635
00:33:16,818 --> 00:33:17,739
I'm putting on some face paint.

636
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:18,834
They won't be able to tell.

637
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,392
My title is too lowly.

638
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:25,627
We're a family, right?

639
00:33:26,102 --> 00:33:27,502
Were you insulting me just now?

640
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:30,056
We don't have any firearms!

641
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,321
This won't work.
We'll be exposed when we're there.

642
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:33,787
This is so unreliable.

643
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,160
-Look at us.
-Take this. Embolden yourself.

644
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:38,048
Hurry!

645
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:41,025
Hurry!

646
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,814
They're back.

647
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:44,845
Hurry!

648
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:50,017
Sir!

649
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:54,666
Guan Yong, Li Zhi Tao, and Zhao Peng
have completed the night assessment!

650
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:55,586
Good job!

651
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,230
Take a break in the resting zone.

652
00:33:57,484 --> 00:33:58,324
Yes, sir!

653
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:00,255
How was it?

654
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,319
Vice Company Commander,
we've arrived at the target location.

655
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:08,813
Zoom in.

656
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,311
Relay my orders.

657
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:14,026
Platoon One and Two will prepare
an ambush near Point C.

658
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:15,474
Platoon Three will
launch a feint attack.

659
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:16,674
Yes, sir!

660
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:30,478
It's so dark out here.
How can they tell who they're shooting?

661
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,431
Shut up.

662
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:04,355
Calling for command centre.

663
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,346
Platoon One and Two
have arrived at Point C.

664
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:07,034
Please give us your instruction.

665
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,080
Continue to lie low
and wait for the attacking order.

666
00:35:09,218 --> 00:35:10,057
Yes, sir.

667
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:18,589
Vice Company Commander,

668
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:21,041
the signal of our drones was jammed.

669
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,243
The map of the target location
cannot be shown.

670
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:31,546
Anti-jamming team, pick up the pace.

671
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,455
Yes, sir.

672
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:34,110
How's Platoon Three doing?

673
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:36,236
They're arrived at the flank.
Feint attack ready.

674
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,424
Order Platoon Three
to launch a feint attack.

675
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,348
Calling for Platoon One and Two.

676
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,506
Platoon One and Two here.

677
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:28,040
To maintain communication,
this is your last standby notification.

678
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:28,706
Conceal yourselves.

679
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Do not make a sound
until the order has been issued.

680
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,159
(Over.)

681
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,560
Roger that. Over.

682
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:50,639
-Xiao.
-Stop messing around.

683
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:52,283
What?

684
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:56,592
Stop dragging me!

685
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm afraid of snakes too!
Stop dragging me!

686
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:00,839
I can't save you!
No one can save you every day!

687
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:02,439
What?

688
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,595
Yan!

689
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:21,804
Which squad are you guys from? Get down!

690
00:37:21,937 --> 00:37:23,656
Get down! Hurry!

691
00:37:23,738 --> 00:37:25,459
Get down!

692
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,463
Calling for Platoon One!

693
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,020
First Platoon Leader?
First Platoon Leader!

694
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:45,176
Platoon One and Two, follow my lead!

695
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:50,153
Tiger Special Forces, let's go!

696
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:51,566
Charge!

697
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:12,290
The special unit is completely
suppressed by their enemies.

698
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,921
-They're done for.
-Let's retreat then!

699
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,159
We don't have any firearms!
We'll die for nothing if we go there!

700
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,916
Let's avoid the firing point.

701
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,561
-We should use the flank!
-Okay!

702
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,399
Take your weapon with you!
Don't fall behind!

703
00:38:37,893 --> 00:38:39,373
Yan!

704
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:41,848
It's reasonable for you two to head
there as you two are excellent soldiers.

705
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:42,924
But I'm useless.

706
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,250
Can I just stay here
and be your lookout?

707
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:45,097
Listen up.

708
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:46,731
When a new recruit
is on the battlefield,

709
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,107
being a lookout is the same
as digging your own grave.

710
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,116
That's right.

711
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:51,689
I think I'll rather be a lookout.

712
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,919
Yan, I'm sure you two can do it.

713
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:54,760
I'll wait for your good news, okay?

714
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:56,184
Yan, someone is here.

715
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:06,087
Yan?

716
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:07,619
Xiao?

717
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,408
Yan?

718
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:13,517
Yan?

719
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,080
Yan!

720
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,098
Yan!

721
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,250
Xiao, stop messing around!

722
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,275
Don't move!

723
00:39:28,471 --> 00:39:29,408
Chief!

724
00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:30,498
What chief?

725
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:31,810
Are you from Tiger Special Forces?

726
00:39:32,346 --> 00:39:34,147
That's right!
I'm from Tiger Special Forces.

727
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,752
Chief,

728
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,011
it must've been tough for you
to do this at night.

729
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,840
-Let me feed you.
-I told you to stand there.

730
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,400
Let me ask you. What's the spirit
of Tiger Special Forces?

731
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,840
Isn't this the spirit
of Tiger Special Forces?

732
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:47,993
You can have a piece.

733
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:50,924
Calling for the security team.

734
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,599
Come and help us out!

735
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,719
Hold down his legs!

736
00:39:58,923 --> 00:39:59,883
Hurry!

737
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:01,388
Turn his body around!

738
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:02,442
Turn it around!

739
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:05,744
Don't make any sound!

740
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:08,676
I'll seal your lips if you shout.

741
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:12,211
He's pretty strong.

742
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:13,673
Yeah.

743
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:16,094
Yan,

744
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:17,941
you were amazing!

745
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,328
You wrapped him

746
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:20,691
like a glutinous rice dumpling.

747
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,306
Let's take a look.

748
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:25,502
What are you staring at?

749
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:26,820
You're our captive now.

750
00:40:26,993 --> 00:40:28,017
Let me take a look.

751
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:29,966
He's a captain.

752
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,388
A captain?

753
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,166
This is great!

754
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,800
We've rendered huge merits!

755
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:38,439
What's your name?

756
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,308
Tell us where your command centre is.

757
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:48,231
Your act as a veteran
is quite convincing.

758
00:40:53,357 --> 00:40:54,676
You guys aren't from
the Special Service Company.

759
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:57,147
Tell me!

760
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:58,538
Which company are you guys from?

761
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:05,847
Chief,

762
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:08,013
I'm really sorry about this.

763
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:11,244
We're new recruits.

764
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:14,397
I understand now.

765
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:18,011
The recruit company is doing their
night geographical assessment tonight.

766
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,800
All three of you
are new recruits, right?

767
00:41:21,086 --> 00:41:22,086
You guys came here

768
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:23,666
because you were lost, right?

769
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,371
Chief, you're a veteran indeed.

770
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:27,940
You saw through us at first glance.

771
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,335
Untie me immediately!

772
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:33,364
This is a misunderstanding.
Chief, please don't take it to heart.

773
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,320
These two buddies
of mine are quite rash.

774
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,600
They were pretty harsh on you just now.

775
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,639
Go away!

776
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,791
Please get up.

777
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,600
The location of assessment
is at least 30 km away from here.

778
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:49,517
You guys did come a long way, huh?

779
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,268
We're sorry. Please take care!

780
00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:56,660
What about you guys?

781
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,171
We...

782
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:00,365
We can only return to our camp now.

783
00:42:00,612 --> 00:42:02,652
Not only did you find out
where we were holding the drill,

784
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:04,147
but now,
you're also trying to tip them off?

785
00:42:04,408 --> 00:42:05,408
Follow me!

786
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:08,260
I'll settle this debt with Li Xiang
after the drill is over.

787
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:24,663
Only the three of them
haven't made it back yet.

788
00:42:25,093 --> 00:42:26,294
That shouldn't be the case.

789
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:27,894
Don't tell me they got lost?

790
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:32,869
Let's wait for a little longer.
