00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,137
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:30,957
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,800
(Episode 35)

4
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,801
I guess the military
is quite strict now.

5
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,440
We were not allowed to drink

6
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,440
unless we had holidays
or we returned to our home.

7
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:45,360
It's fine. We can drink at home.

8
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
You shouldn't drink too much
if you're coughing.

9
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,320
We're drinking so that
we can be honest with ourselves.

10
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,000
If you can be honest
and tell me everything,

11
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,160
there's no need to drink.

12
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,240
Qin Feng had told me everything.

13
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:40,320
Dad.

14
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,199
You told me

15
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,161
to be the strongest soldier.

16
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:52,080
I've always followed that goal.

17
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,000
But now,

18
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,960
I feel lost.

19
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,160
My leader said

20
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,040
what I had insisted upon was wrong.

21
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
My best comrade

22
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,640
was sacrificed because of me.

23
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:21,920
He could've retired from the military
and went back home.

24
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
For the past week,

25
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,880
I've been reading his diary.

26
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:39,080
It's as if

27
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm getting to know him again.

28
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,240
He always treated me as his best friend.

29
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:54,320
But me?

30
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,080
Actually, I don't have any friends.

31
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,560
I only thought about myself

32
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,880
most of the time.

33
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,920
Dad,

34
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:07,360
say,

35
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280
is it deserving for me
to not have any friends?

36
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:13,960
I do not deserve their kindness,
am I right?

37
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,320
Many things

38
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,960
had happened.

39
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:31,560
No matter how terrible you feel,

40
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:35,080
the result can never be changed.

41
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,360
Back then,

42
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,920
you were kidnapped because of me.

43
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,480
However, I couldn't go home
and rescue you.

44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,600
I wanted to go back home

45
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:47,480
really, really badly.

46
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,880
But I couldn't rescue you

47
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,079
because I was on a mission.

48
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,197
I can only wait for
the military to give me an answer.

49
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:05,440
Although they did provide me
with good news in the end,

50
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,080
when I saw you again,

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,680
my heart was filled with fear

52
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:14,800
and terror.

53
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,543
Right when a child like you
needed his father the most,

54
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,120
his father wasn't there for him.

55
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,479
When he sees his father again,

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,400
does his father still have the right

57
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,920
to ask his child to show him respect?

58
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,960
I've never thought about that.

59
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,000
When I saw you again,

60
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,120
I wanted to carry you and tell you,

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
"Yue,"

62
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
"I'm truly sorry."

63
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,280
But, what did I do?

64
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,000
I continued to escape from reality.

65
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,040
In order not to face my failure,

66
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,216
I hoped that you could grow strong.

67
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:09,599
I hoped you could grow so strong

68
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,425
that you didn't need
anyone to protect you.

69
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:14,504
I hoped you could protect yourself.

70
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,136
But in the end, I committed
another terrible mistake.

71
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:24,959
You did grow stronger,

72
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,559
but you didn't need anyone.

73
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,554
That means no one needed you too.

74
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,440
When the sun is up,

75
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,359
let's go seek an answer.

76
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,160
Let's go.

77
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
This should be the place.

78
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,320
Do you still remember this place?

79
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:13,240
Do you dare to go down?

80
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:03,800
Scram!

81
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:05,120
All of you, scram!

82
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,160
Scram!

83
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,360
Come.

84
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,640
How did it feel?

85
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,400
So, this was the place
I used to dream about.

86
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,760
In my memory,
this place was like a dark maze.

87
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,400
I couldn't escape
no matter how hard I tried.

88
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,600
I didn't expect it

89
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:50,880
to be this small.

90
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:53,600
It was easy for me to climb out of here.

91
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,232
The things you were terrified of
in the past,

92
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,480
now, they look like nothing to you.

93
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,512
The pain that you think
is insufferable right now

94
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,080
will pass in the future.

95
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,600
If it doesn't go away, it will
stay with you for the rest of your life.

96
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,480
No matter how terrible it feels or
how hard you try to escape from it,

97
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:19,520
you have to learn
how to make peace with it eventually.

98
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,760
Being mature only means two things.

99
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,600
You can still love what you had loved,

100
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:31,440
but you don't need to possess it.

101
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,120
You can still be terrified of
what you were terrified of,

102
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,000
but you can face it now.

103
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,560
Dad,

104
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,560
thank you.

105
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,440
Return to them.

106
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,840
I have nothing else to teach you.

107
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:48,559
Yue,

108
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,657
these are preserved meat sausages
and beef sauce that I made myself.

109
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,240
You loved them since young.

110
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,239
I've packed them for you.

111
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:55,280
You can bring them back.

112
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,440
They won't spoil easily.

113
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,800
Come, I'll pack them for you.

114
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,800
-Come.
-I can pack them myself.

115
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,280
So,

116
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:03,920
you need to wrap
the glass bottle with a cloth.

117
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:06,920
I even made some wontons for you.

118
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,239
I'll cook them for you right now.

119
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,280
It's okay. I'm leaving soon.

120
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,640
If so, I'll pack them for you.

121
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,680
You can eat them on your way there.

122
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,160
Aunt Pei, you should rest.

123
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,479
Look at you.

124
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,400
You're finally back,

125
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,881
but now, you're leaving already.

126
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,280
When I wasn't around,

127
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,919
you did a great job

128
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,200
in taking care of Dad and this house.

129
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,559
Yue,

130
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,720
actually, your father

131
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,560
does miss you very much.

132
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,360
When you're free,

133
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,240
you should give him a call.

134
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,680
I got it.

135
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
I will give you a call too.

136
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,080
Do you blame me

137
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,880
for what happened back then?

138
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,520
Not at all.

139
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,480
Yue,

140
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,960
I've never blamed you for that incident,

141
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:29,600
even though

142
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,120
you might not be willing
to accept me as your stepmother.

143
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
I was motherless since young.

144
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
When my father brought you to me,

145
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
I was so elated

146
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:54,720
when you gave me a hug.

147
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,960
I thought to myself that
I finally had a mother.

148
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,880
But after that,

149
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,400
I was kidnapped.

150
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,200
You suffered a miscarriage
during the chaos,

151
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
and you could never have your own child.

152
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,960
I knew how important
that child was to you.

153
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,080
I...

154
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,599
I didn't know

155
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,560
how to face you.

156
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,120
So, you didn't detest me?

157
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:36,799
No.

158
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,000
I never detested you.

159
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,039
I'm sorry,

160
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,119
Mum.

161
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,400
Silly boy,

162
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,400
it's all in the past now.

163
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,400
I've watched over you as you grew up.

164
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,040
I've long treated you as my own son.

165
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,200
Mum,

166
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,920
in the future,

167
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
I'll be here for you.

168
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,720
Our higher-ups have given us a mission.

169
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,320
They want the Cheetah Commando
to send an elite unit abroad

170
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,599
to participate in the 12th Warriors
International Special Unit Contest.

171
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,359
We're regulars

172
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,080
in the contest.

173
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,880
We've achieved good results in the past.

174
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:52,226
We have to work harder this year.

175
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,839
Captain Qin,

176
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,480
have you confirmed
the candidates for the contest?

177
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,680
(Night combat)

178
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:08,920
(is a common situation
for special unit members.)

179
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,320
(It takes around 30 minutes for our eyes
to adapt to a dark environment.)

180
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,200
(When there's a strong light source,)

181
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,240
(our eyes need another
30 minutes to adapt to it.)

182
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,439
(Due to that, during
night sniping missions,)

183
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,079
(we must protect our aiming eye.)

184
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,200
(When there's a strong light source,)

185
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,480
(we must try to close our aiming eye)

186
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,480
(and observe our surrounding
with the other eye.)

187
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,680
Not bad.

188
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,280
Let's stop here for today.

189
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,720
Captain Leng,

190
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm just getting into the mood.

191
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,120
Let me train for a little longer.

192
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,960
Don't stay up too late.
Take care of your body.

193
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,248
Captain.

194
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:20,962
Is she done?

195
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:23,368
She's still training.

196
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,520
Do you need anything from me?

197
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:26,827
No. I'm just making my rounds.

198
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,440
Have you been training together
with Guo Xiao Xiao every night?

199
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:32,770
She works very hard.

200
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,290
Of course I feel a sense of crisis.

201
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,560
That's why I have to work harder.

202
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:40,193
Are you afraid that she won't be able
to participate in the contest?

203
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,909
She'll train by herself
even if I don't keep her company.

204
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,601
I'll do the same for the others

205
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:48,372
if they require my guidance.

206
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,322
Are you sure you're not doing it
for your own interest?

207
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:54,124
Maybe a little bit.

208
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,908
Guo Xiao Xiao is
the only female member of the team.

209
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,708
I know how difficult it is for a woman
to survive in the Cheetah Commando.

210
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:00,518
That's why

211
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:02,789
I'm taking extra care of her.

212
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,996
Leng Jing, look at you.

213
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:08,283
Look at what time has done to you.

214
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,679
Before this, you never made any mistakes

215
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,920
and you did everything without emotions.

216
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's like you're wrapped around
by a thick shell, you know?

217
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,085
Sometimes,

218
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I do miss the old you
when you first joined us.

219
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:22,033
You were feisty back then.

220
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,279
Alright, I'll continue with my rounds.

221
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,440
Let me give you a reminder.

222
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,048
If you can shatter that shell of yours,

223
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,520
I promise you'll be able
to lead a new life.

224
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,881
Goodbye, Captain.

225
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:26,889
How dare you come back?

226
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,705
Border security was tight.

227
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,241
How did you come back?

228
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,985
Even a fool like him could come back.

229
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,800
There's no reason for me not to.

230
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:40,186
Drop your gun.

231
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,920
Drop it!

232
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:46,033
Hu,

233
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,400
since you've already escaped,

234
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:50,320
why did you come back here?

235
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
Every area is under your control.

236
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,625
Do you think I'm willing to come back
if there's somewhere else I can go to?

237
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,872
I think you came back

238
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:03,848
because you couldn't go back
without completing your mission,

239
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:06,577
am I right, officer?

240
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,440
Tian!

241
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:15,131
I came back

242
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:17,120
because I wanted
to hear this from you personally.

243
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,440
Planting a bomb in the train station

244
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,280
was such a foolish mission.

245
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,360
Were you the one who came up with it?

246
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:27,600
Tai,

247
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,840
did I tell you to plant
a bomb in the train station?

248
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,760
General, he was the one
who planted the bomb.

249
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,880
Say that again if you dare.

250
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,760
I told you to plant
the bomb in the locker

251
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,280
to attract the police's attention!

252
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,720
Who told you to plant it at the square?

253
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,280
You even killed a Chinese soldier.

254
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,280
Now, all entry to the mainland
had been cut off because of you!

255
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,529
You!

256
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:03,280
They only have your picture

257
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:05,320
on the wanted notice.

258
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,760
How about this? You two can
have a go at each other.

259
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,440
What the winner says will be the truth.

260
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,480
I agree!

261
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:15,658
Fine.

262
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,840
What will you guys do?

263
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,760
Is it a fistfight, a Dha fight,
or a gunfight?

264
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Anything is fine.

265
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,080
I'll play along with you.

266
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,901
Fight!

267
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:32,000
Fight!

268
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,119
I hate that arrogant fellow too.

269
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:37,359
Fight!

270
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,880
Fight!

271
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,319
Fight!

272
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,077
Beat him up!

273
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,440
Tai!

274
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,520
Go!

275
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,399
Go!

276
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,840
Go!

277
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
Beat him up!

278
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:13,079
Fight!

279
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,000
Kill him!

280
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:22,628
Kill him!

281
00:24:22,717 --> 00:24:27,901
Kill him!

282
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:32,560
Kill him!

283
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:45,080
I kill to make money.

284
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:48,466
I won't kill if there's no money in it.

285
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
Look who's back.

286
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:34,586
You're back?

287
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,900
Sir, Yan Po Yue hereby rejoins the team.

288
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,160
You're looking pretty good.

289
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,175
-Have you reported to Captain?
-Not yet.

290
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,000
Alright. Go and change.
Gather at the training ground.

291
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,360
-Yes, sir.
-Yan Po Yue!

292
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:52,240
Yes, sir!

293
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:55,794
You're back already?

294
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:58,040
-How's your family doing?
-They're doing pretty good.

295
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:00,416
Did you enjoy the home-made food?

296
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,359
I guess.

297
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:04,961
Yan Po Yue, about face!

298
00:26:05,345 --> 00:26:06,280
Everybody, assemble!

299
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:10,880
A veteran has returned.

300
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,000
This is something worth sharing.

301
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,095
Yan Po Yue, give us a short speech.

302
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:26,160
I've straightened out my thoughts.

303
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:30,920
Is that all?

304
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,359
And,

305
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,600
I missed everyone.

306
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,241
That's all.

307
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,280
Great. Fall in.

308
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,600
Yes, sir.

309
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:57,623
Here's an announcement.

310
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,759
Next month, we'll send out
an eight-man unit

311
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,599
to participate in the Warriors
International Special Unit Contest.

312
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,120
As the top contest for
special unit members,

313
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:08,360
the participants

314
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,160
will face physical tests,
battlefield adaptation,

315
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,640
mental tests, and so on

316
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,400
of the highest calibre.

317
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,682
Our opponents are elite special units
from all over the world.

318
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,160
We will select 16 members
for the selection.

319
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,800
Two members will form a team.

320
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,427
The final eight members

321
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,040
will be the participants.

322
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,520
Four members of Squad 9

323
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:32,680
have been shortlisted.

324
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,400
Next, fall out when your name is called.

325
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,961
-Bai Long!
-Yes, sir!

326
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,000
-Yue Kong!
-Yes, sir!

327
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
-Guo Xiao Xiao!
-Yes, sir!

328
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:50,239
-Xiao Yun Jie!
-Yes, sir!

329
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:53,440
From today onwards,

330
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,480
the four of you will undergo
special training.

331
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,241
Remember,

332
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,360
you guys are representing
the entire Chinese army.

333
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,600
It's only a victory when
you become the overall champion!

334
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,600
Yes, sir!

335
00:28:05,656 --> 00:28:06,497
Come in!

336
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,800
Captain.

337
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:25,607
What's the matter?

338
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:27,400
You finally can't stand it anymore?

339
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:30,446
I'm here to see

340
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:34,040
if I can help out
the participants in any way.

341
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:36,993
What are you trying to do here?

342
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

343
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,800
Do you want me
to redress your injustice?

344
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:41,721
No.

345
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:43,962
I'm just here to help.

346
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:47,272
Not bad at all.

347
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,920
You've changed a lot

348
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:51,320
after your trip home.

349
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:55,431
So, what do you wish to do?

350
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,600
I can join them in their training,
be on the logistics support team,

351
00:28:58,882 --> 00:28:59,760
anything.

352
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,719
We do lack manpower
in the logistics support department.

353
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:07,217
Are you willing to join them?

354
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:08,985
Yes, sir.

355
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:16,682
Report

356
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:18,051
to the logistic management
department tomorrow morning.

357
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,160
They'll teach you what to do.

358
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,119
Yes, sir.

359
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,441
Hello, is this
the logistics support team?

360
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,601
One of my men will
head to your department tomorrow.

361
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:48,807
Observe him for me.

362
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,200
Yan Po Yue, I thought
you were a top soldier?

363
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,680
Why were you sent to our team?

364
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,160
I requested the transfer
of my own accord.

365
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,920
Alright, you can do some
basic maintenance.

366
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,840
Make sure you clean every spot.

367
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,160
Yes, sir.

368
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:41,520
You're not participating in the contest
when you're this good?

369
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,920
What mistake did you commit?

370
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,480
I think this department suits me.

371
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,281
When you aim,

372
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,799
you must avoid the strong light source.

373
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,800
What are you doing?

374
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,368
You're trying to help someone
redress his grievance?

375
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,400
Listen.

376
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:13,680
Even if you were removed from the team,

377
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:15,207
we would never select him
for the contest.

378
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:19,027
But why?

379
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,200
The bomb incident was an emergency.

380
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,120
And, he had done his best
to defuse the bomb.

381
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,240
He didn't commit any mistakes.

382
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,120
He shouldn't have
received such punishments!

383
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,840
He requested the transfer
of his own accord.

384
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:31,817
That's impossible.

385
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:33,640
If you don't believe me,

386
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,240
you can ask him yourself in the armoury.

387
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:41,442
He's such a prideful person.

388
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:43,200
I would be wasting my breath.

389
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,040
He only lives in his own world.

390
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
He can only depend on himself

391
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,600
to get over this.

392
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:07,600
Open the door.

393
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll do it together with you.

394
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,120
No need for that.

395
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,520
This is the last gun.

396
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:12,674
I'll be done soon.

397
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:17,627
Are we

398
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:19,852
still brothers?

399
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,600
You should go to sleep
if you still treat me as your brother.

400
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,440
The special training is harsh.

401
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,601
Shut up.

402
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:27,631
Now, you're guarding the armoury.

403
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,632
What about me?

404
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:31,240
Should I be a gatekeeper then?

405
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,680
I'm doing this of my own accord.

406
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,640
Even if you do this,
Xiao Tian will never return to us.

407
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:39,160
I miss him too.

408
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:41,346
Are you still angry at Captain?

409
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,000
Or are you trying
to annoy the rest of us?

410
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:46,013
I'm staying here
to straighten out my thoughts.

411
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,200
What do you mean?

412
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,080
In the past, I always thought
that I was a bullet.

413
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,320
We assembled a gun

414
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:58,920
so that the bullet that was fired
could kill our enemies.

415
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:01,440
But now, I finally understand.

416
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,960
As a bullet,

417
00:33:04,977 --> 00:33:06,000
my type is faulty.

418
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,755
I can never fit into any gun,

419
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,680
let alone being fired.

420
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm alone.

421
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,800
When you try to force
an unfitting bullet into the gun,

422
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,000
it either gets stuck,

423
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,640
or it causes the gun to jump backwards.

424
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:25,600
Instead of killing enemies,
it'll hurt my teammates instead.

425
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,360
So now,

426
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,000
I just wish to be a gunstock.

427
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,441
There's no one else here.

428
00:33:42,872 --> 00:33:43,992
Be honest with me.

429
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,280
I was too tensed up in the past.

430
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,520
Just like the vows of the Cheetahs,

431
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:06,520
be fearless

432
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,360
and fight together,

433
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,280
I always thought those were empty words.

434
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,359
But now, I finally understand

435
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:17,600
that those words were true.

436
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,999
After I understood that fact, I realised
my gun was warm to the touch.

437
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:24,360
The bullets were soft.

438
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,920
And my comrades

439
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,879
are the most important.

440
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
You've become mature.

441
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Just give me some time.

442
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,240
I will readjust my state and be ready.

443
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
But now,

444
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,400
just leave me to my own thoughts.

445
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,680
Alright, I'll wait for you.

446
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:56,080
But I just want you to know this.

447
00:34:56,404 --> 00:34:57,560
No matter when

448
00:34:57,658 --> 00:34:59,080
or what happens,

449
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:00,720
I'm always here for you.

450
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,480
The firearm you're going to acquire
is more than just a weapon.

451
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,000
You guys must treat it
as your other half.

452
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,120
Give them the guns.

453
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,240
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:39,000
My other half?

455
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:40,720
Shouldn't it be my wife?

456
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,720
Your wife looks pretty shiny.

457
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,425
Being shiny is a useless attribute.

458
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,560
You must be able to aim with it.

459
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,120
Are these even our guns?

460
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
It's as if they were polished with wax.

461
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,760
Xiao Yun Jie.

462
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:57,280
Yes, ma'am!

463
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,360
You're pretty chatty today.

464
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,160
Ma'am,

465
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,022
I'm not used to getting my other half.

466
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,920
Is that so?

467
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,240
If that's so, you can run 10km with her
before you go to the shooting ground.

468
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,201
Yes, ma'am.

469
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,080
About face!

470
00:36:19,816 --> 00:36:21,400
Does anyone else face
the same problem as him?

471
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,560
No, ma'am!

472
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,760
Group One, get ready!

473
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:32,872
Feel your breathing!

474
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,801
Let it envelop every cell in your body!

475
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:39,129
Find the space between
your inhalations and exhalations!

476
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,778
Make it as if pulling the trigger
is a subconscious behaviour!

477
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,919
You can feel it,

478
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,320
but you mustn't guide it!

479
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,840
Begin!

480
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,961
Stop!

481
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,798
Number 1, 10 points!

482
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,199
Number 2, 10 points!

483
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,680
Number 3, 10 points!

484
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,240
Number 4, 9 points!

485
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,680
Number 5, 10 points!

486
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,159
Number 6, 10 points!

487
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,520
Number 7, 10 points!

488
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,961
Number 8, 10 points!

489
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,161
That's all!

490
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,241
Captain Leng!

491
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,240
I've finished the 10km run!

492
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:15,080
Fall in!

493
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,080
Yes, ma'am!

494
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:23,191
Group One, about face!

495
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Group Two, get ready!

496
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,360
Begin!

497
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:40,962
Shooting complete!

498
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,001
Number 1, 9 points!

499
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,441
Number 2, 10 points!

500
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,920
Number 3, 8 points!

501
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,560
Number 4, target missed!

502
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,041
Number 5, 10 points!

503
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:56,402
Number 6, 10 points!

504
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,638
Number 7, 10 points!

505
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,080
Number 8, 10 points!

506
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,282
That's all!

507
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,280
Target missed?

508
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,360
Are you kidding me?

509
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,440
Captain, the rain is too heavy!
My vision was affected!

510
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:22,241
Report my score!

511
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,479
Number 4, 10 points for all 5 shots!

512
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
That's all!

513
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,640
Readjusting one's state rapidly

514
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,040
is the most basic skill that
a special unit member needs to possess.

515
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,320
You committed such a huge blunder
because of the rain?

516
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,800
What makes you think that
you can join the contest?

517
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,679
Yes, ma'am!

518
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,040
Left face! About face!

519
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,000
Captain Leng is right!

520
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,040
I participated

521
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
in the previous contest.

522
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,320
During a shooting match,

523
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,880
a team from another country
stalled time on purpose.

524
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,840
It was already evening

525
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,801
when it was our turn!

526
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,840
We had poor vision!

527
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
That's why we didn't perform well

528
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,280
and failed to become the champion!

529
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:07,280
But, all of us agreed

530
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,360
that poor vision wasn't
the reason we lost!

531
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:11,738
It was because we didn't adapt
to our surroundings actively!

532
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,680
On the battlefield, there are
no perfect surroundings!

533
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,372
All kinds of emergencies will appear!

534
00:39:19,453 --> 00:39:23,320
I hope you guys won't commit
that kind of mistake again!

535
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,399
In the contest,

536
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:26,919
the organiser might change
the events at any time.

537
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,399
The firearms they provide
are unfamiliar to us too.

538
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,439
Facing such obstacles and uncertainties,

539
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,320
we can only acquire victory

540
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,360
by making sure
we're excellent at the basics!

541
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,560
Don't let the environment adapt to you!

542
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,760
We need to learn how
to adapt to the environment!

543
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:40,880
Did you hear me?

544
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:42,120
Yes, ma'am!

545
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,096
Do you know who I am?

546
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,920
Of course.

547
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:33,833
You were the reigning Sanda champion

548
00:40:35,186 --> 00:40:36,000
two years ago.

549
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:37,600
You do know your stuff well.

550
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,721
Bring it on.

551
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,000
-Nice!
-Nice!

552
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,319
-Nice!
-Lock him down, Xiao Xiao!

553
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:24,720
Sun, put your back into it!

554
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,480
-Nice! Hang in there!
-You can do it!

555
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:29,435
Nice!

556
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:33,336
Enough. Get up.

557
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,600
Do not go any further than necessary.

558
00:41:34,824 --> 00:41:36,240
This is not the time
for you to risk your life.

559
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,170
-Nice!
-Nice, Xiao Xiao!

560
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:43,240
Who mopped the floor?

561
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:44,265
It's so slippery!

562
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,960
Sorry about that.

563
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
Hey, you.

564
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,721
I thought you were a great fighter?

565
00:41:57,674 --> 00:41:58,714
I'm from the logistics support team.

566
00:41:59,097 --> 00:42:00,800
Sir, I want to spar with him!

567
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,040
Are you trying to
give yourself an out here?

568
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,160
I'll spar with you.

569
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:06,960
Sir, I only want to spar with him!

570
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:07,904
He said it himself.

571
00:42:09,314 --> 00:42:10,520
He's from the logistics support team.

572
00:42:13,203 --> 00:42:13,963
Sir,

573
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,000
I think sparring with my comrades
is one of my duties too.

574
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,280
Alright then.

575
00:42:24,616 --> 00:42:25,440
Get ready.

576
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,520
Yes, sir.

577
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,160
Sun, you're such a coward.

578
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,600
-Yan Po Yue, be careful.
-I think you should be fine.

579
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,720
-Yan, you can do it!
-Yan, you can do it!
