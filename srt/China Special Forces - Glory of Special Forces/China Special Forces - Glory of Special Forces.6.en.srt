00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,120
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,909
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:34,000
(Episode 6)

4
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
You didn't try hard enough.

5
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,599
Again!

6
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,720
Exert more strength!

7
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:51,800
Again!

8
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:54,720
Again!

9
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,319
Again!

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,760
You're the king of the new recruits.

11
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,879
You're the best!

12
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,559
Lu Xiao Tian!

13
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,600
Stop talking!

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
Relax.

15
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,240
You hit it, Yan!

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,160
I don't trust you.

17
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,800
Look.

18
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Take a look.

19
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,839
My goodness.

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,919
You did it, Yan!

21
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,720
I hit it!

22
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,199
Hell yes!

23
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,199
Move.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,639
It's for you.

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,679
It's the steel ball
that you fired just now.

26
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,760
Pick up the steel balls.

27
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,000
I've been the ball boy
for the entire afternoon.

28
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,800
It's safe to call me
the logistics support.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,479
I should've just stayed home
and peeled potatoes.

30
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,119
Picking up steel balls
is a form of training, too.

31
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,600
Are you training a military dog?

32
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,000
Military dogs are our comrades too.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,039
Hurry up.

34
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,880
That's all for today.

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Meeting dismissed.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,639
Company Commander Li.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,839
I have something to tell you.

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,440
The kitchen squad of
Special Service Company

39
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,520
dealt with the drug traffickers, too.

40
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,800
I suggest

41
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,639
that they join
the actual combat together.

42
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,720
Is there no one else

43
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
in Special Service Company?

44
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,119
Don't get me wrong.

45
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,160
I merely think
that joining the actual combat

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,440
is more helpful to them.

47
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,320
Why is it helpful?

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,399
If the kitchen squad joins the battle,

49
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,800
who will be in charge of cooking?

50
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,440
Staff Officer Ai,

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,360
did someone

52
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,440
beg you to speak for them?

53
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,160
Yes.

54
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
But I personally think

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,839
that you should reconsider
Yan Po Yue's relocation.

56
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
I don't even have to reconsider.

57
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,080
Even if I reconsider,

58
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,160
the answer is still no.

59
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,880
He's not well trained enough.

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,880
Company Commander Li.

61
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
If you really want
to understand him better,

62
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,001
you can go to Staff Officer Zhao

63
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,440
and get his profile.

64
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,239
That lad

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,840
is not the stubborn simpleton
he seems to be.

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,399
Zhou Zi Jian!

67
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,120
Here!

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,320
Fan Jin!

69
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,160
Here!

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,880
Guo Kui!

71
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:48,680
Yes!

72
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,040
Yan Po Yue!

73
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,120
Report!

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,320
He's on duty.

75
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,920
Lu Xiao Tian!

76
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,760
Report!

77
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:02,640
He's on duty.

78
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,520
What duty is that?
Why is all them on duty?

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,680
Company Commander...

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,480
Report!

81
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,240
Report!

82
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,440
Stop dilly-dallying!

83
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:10,320
Report!

84
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,120
They're back.

85
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,760
Fall in.

86
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,520
Yes!

87
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,888
As of now,
the night roll call has ended.

88
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,600
Platoon leaders,

89
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:22,839
take your platoon back!

90
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,680
Yes!

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Left turn!

92
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,279
Forward, march!

93
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,600
Quick, march!

94
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,840
Mission accomplished.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,520
There’s food in the cookhouse.

96
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,360
Guo kept some food for you.

97
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,120
Thank you, Squad leader.

98
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,799
Thank you, Squad leader.

99
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,520
Begone!

100
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,559
The angle of your arm and the cloth

101
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,359
is 75 degrees.

102
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,600
I think

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,720
the wind is Force Four.

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Is your assumption accurate?

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,720
A small discrepancy
can lead to a great error.

106
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,280
I got to know the formula from my dad.

107
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,960
I've never applied it in real life.

108
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,920
You're fooling me around again.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,160
Am I a guinea pig to you?

110
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:28,119
My arm is numb.

111
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:28,920
Stand still.

112
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,320
How is the training?

113
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,480
Squad leader!

114
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,400
Squad leader.

115
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,720
How many times did you hit the target?

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,720
The wind is too strong today.

117
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
I haven't hit the target, not even once.

118
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Is it really because of the wind?

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,240
My grandma has passed away.

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,800
If she's still alive,

121
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,400
I bet she could shoot
better than you with a slingshot.

122
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,360
I...

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
I've never learned
how to measure wind speed before.

124
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,079
Who on earth

125
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,480
knows how to measure
wind speed at birth?

126
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
I picked up the skill from training.

127
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,679
You didn't press yourself hard enough.

128
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,760
Let me teach you a trick.

129
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Who in Squad 247

130
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,200
do you hate the most?

131
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:23,316
Me?

132
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,280
Count me in.

133
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:30,120
Who else?

134
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,481
Don't make me think for you.

135
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,692
Li Xiang?

136
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,485
Do you hate him?

137
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,161
Just tell me the truth.

138
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,471
One more.

139
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,500
Squad leader!

140
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,599
He's from Company One,
Squad One of Platoon One.

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,745
His name is Xiao Fei!

142
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,538
Yan works so hard to put him down!

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720
Very well!

144
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,590
You're a man with spine!

145
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,000
Pretend all three of us
are standing here.

146
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,080
Hit us!

147
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,720
Vent out your anger on us!

148
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,000
Seek revenge all you want!

149
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,400
It doesn't work?

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,760
Let me teach you another trick.

151
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,121
That's how you measure the wind speed.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
The wind speed...

153
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,800
Two slaps.

154
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,120
The distance

155
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,160
is 53 yuan and 20 cent.

156
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,160
Let's pack up and go.

157
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,207
(Fan Jin)

158
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,960
Little brat.

159
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:25,972
Staff Officer Ai.

160
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:26,973
Who are you looking for?

161
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,400
Is Yan Po Yue in?

162
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
Yan Po Yue?

163
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,400
He's hunting bird outside.

164
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Hunting birds?

165
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,040
Since he's not allowed to use the gun,

166
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,120
he's satisfying his craving
with slingshot.

167
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:39,480
Thank you.

168
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:40,520
Don't mention it.

169
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,239
Are you not eating?

170
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,440
No, I'm not eating.

171
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:05,960
Who is that?

172
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,841
Move!

173
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,960
Staff Officer Ai.

174
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,960
Are you okay?

175
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Aren't you taking a lunch break?

176
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,440
You must be really free
to play slingshot.

177
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
Lunch break is not my thing.

178
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
My marksmanship is terrible.

179
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:26,800
I need more practice.

180
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,919
How is the practice going?

181
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,440
Do you think that you're great?

182
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,920
Do you know

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,640
a large part of shooting
is mental attitude?

184
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,960
Shooting with slingshot and gun
are totally different.

185
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,119
When I shoot with a gun,

186
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,679
you may come and take a look.

187
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,559
Let me try.

188
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,919
Try what?

189
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,920
You're kidding me.

190
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,880
You're a staff officer.

191
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,440
Don't downgrade yourself to my level.

192
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm more senior than you

193
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,799
and I'm your superior.

194
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,360
Give it to me.

195
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,520
This is an order!

196
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,840
Yes!

197
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
Do you admit defeat?

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm not thirsty.

199
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,479
You need to drink
even if you're not thirsty.

200
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,559
Here's a toast to you.

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,440
People usually
propose a toast with alcohol.

202
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,159
This is the first time I see someone
proposing a toast with Coke.

203
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:16,880
Let's replace alcohol with Coke.

204
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,119
It'll turn into sweats anyway.

205
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,159
When there are sweats, there are ways.

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,119
What you just said

207
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,960
is for real men, right?

208
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,479
To me,

209
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,320
you're more manly than real men.

210
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,559
You're really something.

211
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,880
You insult others
without using curse words.

212
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,880
Do you know why I came to see you?

213
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,200
I don't know.

214
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,559
But I'm sure it's not for a good cause.

215
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,239
Tell me.

216
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,559
What kind of trouble do you think
you created this time?

217
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,679
I've never created any trouble.

218
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,599
I've fulfilled my duty as a soldier.

219
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:04,360
However, to some,

220
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,559
fulfilling my duty is a trouble.

221
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,479
Yan Po Yue.

222
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,760
Don't think that you're cool
just because you behave wilfully.

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,479
Don't expect everyone
to please you all the time.

224
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,119
This is a military camp, not your home!

225
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,840
You always behave
like an unruly spoiled brat.

226
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,027
You're so arrogant.

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,719
You think you're better than everyone.

228
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,346
That's right.

229
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,640
Many in Squad 247

230
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,000
don't like you

231
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,719
but more in the squad

232
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,320
are concerned about you.

233
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
I'm here today

234
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,280
on Xiao Yun Jie's request.

235
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,760
He wants me to talk to you.

236
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,640
He's really concerned about you

237
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,959
but he doesn't want
to hurt your feelings.

238
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,320
Don't be nosy.

239
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,360
Don't be ungrateful.

240
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,280
I wish I had so many friends

241
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,520
who are concerned about me.

242
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,840
You?

243
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
Do you lack friends?

244
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:40,599
Your father

245
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:43,320
was once in the force.

246
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,720
He's a hero.

247
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:51,080
He took part in
many military operations.

248
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,239
The troop that he was in is...

249
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,280
Did you read my profile?

250
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,120
I went to Recruiting Cadre
for inquiry.

251
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,560
That's how I found out everything.

252
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,320
He and I

253
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,760
are different individuals.

254
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,440
I fought for everything that I got.

255
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,559
It's not because I was his son!

256
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,239
In everyone's heart,

257
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,359
there are always secrets.

258
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,440
However, as time passes,

259
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
those secrets will start expanding.

260
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,640
Even if you have a big heart,

261
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,520
you'll find it difficult
to contain the secrets.

262
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,400
What about this?

263
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,840
If you can trust me,

264
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
you may talk to me.

265
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,880
I promise I won't tell anyone.

266
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,600
When I was seven years old,

267
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,680
I left the army compound
for the first time

268
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,080
to go to school.

269
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,840
On my way back from school,

270
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,120
a few adults abducted me.

271
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,039
Later, I found out

272
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,039
they're the accomplices
of the drug traffickers

273
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,440
cracked down on by my father before.

274
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,599
They did that to get back at my father.

275
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,440
Hello.

276
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,760
Is your father Yan Shi Xiang?

277
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,480
He told me to pick you up.

278
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,401
(They threw me into a dark hole.)

279
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,800
(The hole was really deep.)

280
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,600
(It was so big and cold
at the same time.)

281
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:00,880
(The entrance was really small.)

282
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,359
(There were many kids inside the hole.)

283
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,239
(All of them were abducted
by human traffickers,)

284
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,400
(waiting to be sold.)

285
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,839
(When there was food,)

286
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,199
(everyone fought like dogs)

287
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,279
(for food.)

288
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,920
(But no one dared to fight against them
or run away.)

289
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,320
(That's because we would be beaten up
if we failed to escape.)

290
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
(On one fine day,)

291
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,599
(I reached the top.)

292
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,639
(But no one was
willing to come with me.)

293
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,640
(They shouted at the top of their voice)

294
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,119
(because if I got caught,)

295
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,520
(they would get a corn in return.)

296
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,719
(I could only run away.)

297
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,199
(I kept running)

298
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,800
(as if there's no tomorrow.)

299
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,359
(I didn't know where could I go)

300
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
(or how long had I been running.)

301
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,960
(I only remember the sound of the wind.)

302
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,280
(It gave me a sense of security.)

303
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,720
(In the end,)

304
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,199
(I finally see the familiar
camouflage green)

305
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,560
(at the army compound entrance.)

306
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,560
(At that moment,)

307
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,240
(I knew that I succeeded.)

308
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,560
When I woke up,

309
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,280
I was in the army hospital.

310
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,160
He

311
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,320
was sitting by the bedside.

312
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,319
Starting from that time,

313
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,200
you fell in love with jogging.

314
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,560
Jogging gives me a sense of security.

315
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:26,720
That's great.

316
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,280
You can now speak freely about the past.

317
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,920
Facing up to it

318
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,080
is the real bravery.

319
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,080
After I was discharged
from the hospital,

320
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,839
he started to give me military training.

321
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I learned military formation,

322
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
obstacle course racing,

323
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,319
diving, rock climbing,

324
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,239
and martial arts combat.

325
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,719
So, before joining the army,

326
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,719
you've been trained like a soldier
since you're seven years old.

327
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,160
No.

328
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,719
I didn't have comrades back then.

329
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,199
Cheetah Commando

330
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,959
is where

331
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,479
your father used to fight for.

332
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,040
It's also your ultimate aim
when you joined the army.

333
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,866
Am I right?

334
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,439
It's the sacred place
for the King of soldiers.

335
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:27,760
That's my sole target

336
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:29,993
for my entire life.

337
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,822
The dream is great.

338
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,720
But the reality

339
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,080
is awful.

340
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,840
Haven't you faced something worse?

341
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,800
An army cook

342
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,719
dreaming to be
a member of the Special Service Company.

343
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,359
What is there to be afraid of?

344
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:49,800
Staff Officer Ai.

345
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,040
That's all for today.

346
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,079
I am going to do this on my own.

347
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,119
I don't need sympathy from others.

348
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,520
Yan Po Yue.

349
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,639
We're comrades.

350
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,920
You're welcome to
seek advice from me anytime.

351
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,080
All the best!

352
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,959
Are you hungry?

353
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,719
Throw the targets into the river!

354
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,760
Take it.

355
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,640
Here.

356
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,119
Grab it.

357
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes.

358
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,040
Hit the target

359
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,760
and you get to eat.

360
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:21,839
Here.

361
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,800
One.

362
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,199
Two.

363
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,280
Look.

364
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,920
Do you want to be the shooter

365
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:44,239
or do you want
to be kept in the oil tank?

366
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,640
Delicious food

367
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,640
is only limited to one portion.

368
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,000
The chicken goes to the person

369
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:06,400
who gets it.

370
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,119
Fight for it!

371
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,520
Yan, you're back.

372
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,319
I have something to ask.

373
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:36,680
What's wrong?

374
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
There's a huge tree and the atmosphere
was calm and peaceful.

375
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,640
Under the tree, a man and a woman
were having a private talk.

376
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's not a big deal, right?

377
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:45,760
I...

378
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,439
Begone!

379
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,239
What's wrong, Yan?

380
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:53,839
Did something happen?

381
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,479
In the afternoon,

382
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,920
I hit nine targets out of ten.

383
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,839
You must've hit all the targets.

384
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,760
Or else,

385
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,359
why did Staff Officer Ai come to see you
on purpose?

386
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,479
Was it because she's intrigued by
your heroic past at the sentry post?

387
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,440
That's not right.

388
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,400
I have even more heroic stories.

389
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,280
Guo, you're heroic too.
Why didn't she come and see you?

390
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:13,880
Please accept my interview.

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,560
Was it a pleasant experience

392
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,160
talking to the female staff officer?

393
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,640
That's an admission by silence.

394
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,839
Yan.

395
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,560
Jokes aside. I'm serious.

396
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,119
Let me show you the correct way.

397
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,239
You need to build a good relationship

398
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,719
with your superior at the organisation,

399
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,500
right?

400
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,880
Then, you stand a great chance

401
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,079
to leave cookhouse.

402
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:35,800
First and foremost,

403
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,280
I'll fight my way back to
combat platoon's squad.

404
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,760
Secondly,

405
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:41,880
Staff Officer Ai and I

406
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,719
are merely superior and subordinate.

407
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,400
Stop talking nonsense.

408
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,520
Childish.

409
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,479
Guo, do you think what I said
makes sense?

410
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,000
Isn't that a shortcut?

411
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,239
He practices so hard every day

412
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,400
but no one sees his effort.
What's the point?

413
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,079
I'm troubled.

414
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,640
He has no grit at all.

415
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,359
What can you do?

416
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,040
But I have grit.

417
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,359
One, two, three, four...

418
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,839
Stand there!

419
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,160
What are you doing?

420
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,400
Report, Squad leader!

421
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,680
The company commander is working
overtime to work on some documents.

422
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
He told me to send him some food.

423
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:31,800
Which company commander is that?

424
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,560
The company commander
of Special Service Company.

425
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:33,160
Who are you looking for?

426
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,120
Company Commander Li Xiang.

427
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:34,960
Register yourself.

428
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:35,760
Yes, sir!

429
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,599
One, two, three, four...

430
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,359
What is your name?

431
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,200
Lu Xiao Tian.

432
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
Thank you.

433
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,520
Have you eaten?

434
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:44,920
Go in.

435
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:45,520
Yes.

436
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,719
How dare you wrote
to the cadre to change the shift?

437
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Is that necessary?

438
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,160
Fortunately, this incident
was covered up by Staff Officer Ai.

439
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,680
Or else, you would be
questioning by someone else,

440
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,599
but not me!

441
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,280
Sir,

442
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,359
Yan Po Yue is completely in the dark.

443
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,480
Am I right?

444
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,000
Report!

445
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:39,920
Sir!

446
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,839
It's my fault.

447
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,920
Think twice before you say something!

448
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,160
Whoever wrote the letter

449
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,760
did it for a good cause.

450
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,280
They want me to be better.

451
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,800
What stops you to be better
at the cookhouse?

452
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:50,959
Think again!

453
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,080
Fan!

454
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,920
Here!

455
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,920
I heard that you took him to the hill

456
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,040
for practice every day.

457
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,920
Does he fulfil his duty?

458
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,839
Report!

459
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,960
I fulfil my duty all the time.

460
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,040
Do you fulfil your duty as a cook?

461
00:26:03,592 --> 00:26:05,439
Do you provide adequate logistic support
and cook for everyone?

462
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,680
How many dishes can you make?

463
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,960
Did you hear him?

464
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,719
He says one thing and do another!

465
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,040
Fan.

466
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,560
You need to educate your subordinates.

467
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:18,439
Yes.

468
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,840
Focus on your work.

469
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,800
When you're good at work,
you'll improve in life.

470
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,319
Don't encourage
the unhealthy tendencies.

471
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,200
Understood?

472
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,080
Yes!

473
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,840
Squad leader.

474
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,320
How was it going?

475
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,439
What?

476
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,960
Did the instructor say anything?

477
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:23,719
He told me to intensify
teaching and focus in work!

478
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,160
The supply vehicle
just delivered two tons of rice.

479
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,600
-Go get the rice!
-Yes!

480
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,800
Yan Po Yue.

481
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,040
Yes!

482
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,640
The instructor is right.

483
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,319
We do what we're supposed to do.

484
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,000
Come with me.

485
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,280
Today,

486
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,160
I'm going to teach you my final move.

487
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,480
Pay attention to it.

488
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,440
It's not difficult to learn.

489
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,160
(Braised tofu.)

490
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,600
(It goes well with rice.)

491
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,400
(Add tofu to a wok)

492
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,120
(and fry until the tofu
is golden brown on both sides.)

493
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,961
(Then, add the tofu
to the boiling stock.)

494
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,600
(Thicken the stock with starch.)

495
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,240
(Squad leader said, serving in the army
is no different from cooking tofu.)

496
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,000
(The tofu has to be fried
until golden brown)

497
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,440
(before being braised on low heat.)

498
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
(That's how it gets the flavours.)

499
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,200
(But I think I'm more like the stock.)

500
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,840
(Even when I'm alone,)

501
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,480
(I perform my duty well.)

502
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,520
It's time for assembly!

503
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,920
Fall in!

504
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Calm down.

505
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,560
It's nothing to do with us.

506
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,280
We still have to clean the vegetables
tomorrow morning.

507
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,440
Stop fooling around.

508
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,799
It's late in the midnight.

509
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,679
Why are you making trouble for yourself?

510
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,040
It's a field operation.
Bring your equipment.

511
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,239
Squad leader.

512
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:57,839
Is it a combat?

513
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,839
Hurry up.

514
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,160
Squad leader.

515
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,886
We're heading to the wrong direction.

516
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,280
Why are we alone?

517
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,599
Get down. Get your equipment.

518
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,080
The kitchen squads of
Company One and Two?

519
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,721
What are they doing here?

520
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,839
Fall in!

521
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,040
Count the people.

522
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,480
Everyone from the kitchen squad
of Company One is here!

523
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
Everyone from the kitchen squad
of Company Two is here!

524
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,520
Everyone from the kitchen squad
of Special Service Company is here!

525
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,719
We received order from the higher-ups.

526
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,640
The confrontation drill which was
scheduled at the end of the year

527
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,520
has been carried forward.

528
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,160
In order to find out
our comprehensive military capability,

529
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:06,959
the competition between kitchen squads
which was usually stood alone

530
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,239
will be conducted concurrently
with the confrontation drill.

531
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,079
Today, three companies
will compete with each other.

532
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,560
We didn't prepare anything.

533
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,040
What's there to compete?

534
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,079
Are we competing
in term of cutting skills?

535
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:17,000
The competition will be
the same as the front-line soldiers.

536
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,319
We'll do more than
the front-line soldiers for sure.

537
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,359
The kitchen squad competition

538
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,040
is a five-kilometre loaded march.

539
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,359
You're heading to the south.

540
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,280
Each squad is required to carry
all the equipment and ingredients

541
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,680
and bring them to the designated
destination in the shortest time.

542
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,479
The score of the bottom
will be the final score of the squad.

543
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,239
It'll be taken into the calculation
of the total score.

544
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,680
When all of you have reached
the designated destination,

545
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,439
I'll announce the next instruction.

546
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,400
Understood?

547
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,400
Yes!

548
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,520
My goodness.

549
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The fight has started.

550
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,319
Finally it's happening.

551
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:57,920
Give it to me!

552
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,040
Let me help you!

553
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,119
Hurry up!

554
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,000
Squad leader!

555
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,079
I'm waiting for you!

556
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,719
Squad leader.

557
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,199
Just kill me.

558
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,520
Shoot me to death.

559
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,359
-I can't do it anymore.
-Don't talk rubbish.

560
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,560
I don't want to hold everyone back.

561
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,280
Get up!

562
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,440
I can't do it anymore.
I can't get up.

563
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,800
-Guo, help him.
-I can't do it anymore.

564
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,680
-Here, bring him up.
-Let's go.

565
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,280
Yan Po Yue.

566
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,439
Here!

567
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:54,359
Do you know the rule of the competition?

568
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,119
Report!

569
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,640
You've announced it earlier.

570
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,760
The score of the bottom
will be the final score of the squad.

571
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,000
Why didn't you take care
of your comrades?

572
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,319
Someone has to be the champion.

573
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,959
That's just an excuse.

574
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
That's my target.

575
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,601
Squad leader.

576
00:34:26,452 --> 00:34:27,120
Have some water.

577
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,320
Report! The last member

578
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,399
of the kitchen squad of
Special Service Company.

579
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:32,560
has arrived at the designated spot.

580
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,439
That's all.

581
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,719
The bottom of Company One Kitchen Squad

582
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,198
took 25 minutes and 43 seconds to reach.

583
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,840
The bottom of Company Two Kitchen Squad

584
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,280
took 25 minutes and 54 seconds to reach.

585
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,280
The bottom of Special Service Company
Kitchen Squad

586
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,840
took 26 minutes and 37 seconds to reach.

587
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,439
Company One Kitchen Squad won.

588
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,760
Company One, come here!

589
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,519
Company One always
marches fearlessly onward.

590
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,199
There's something else.

591
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,239
Yan Po Yue of
Special Service Company Kitchen Squad

592
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,399
took 18 minutes and 27 seconds to reach.

593
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,399
He's broken the record
of the loaded march.

594
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,679
The next test is resisting enemy
and launching harassing attacks.

595
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,000
You're required to carry your weapons

596
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,239
and pass through the war zone.

597
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
In the journey,
you have to shoot moving targets.

598
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,840
Under the firepower exchange
of both the warring sides,

599
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,639
make sure you reach the hillside
at three o'clock in clock position.

600
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,440
The final score

601
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,879
is based on the number of members
who reach the hillside safely.

602
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,399
The squad with the most
surviving members wins.

603
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,199
Hide away, everyone!

604
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,360
We're merciless to the kitchen squad.

605
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,840
Isn't it a little too cruel?

606
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,600
If we don't train them in a cruel way,

607
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,639
they'll be butchered brutally

608
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,040
when they're in a battle.

609
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:44,239
Squad leader!

610
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,320
Watch out for 12 o'clock!

611
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,560
Enemies are at nine
and three o'clock, too.

612
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:47,800
We're surrounded by enemies.

613
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,320
We can't fight them head on.

614
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,560
We need to find another way.

615
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,959
Let me distract them.

616
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,239
All of you climb up the hill!

617
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,600
Come back, Yan!

618
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,439
You have only got one life!

619
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,480
Guo!

620
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,800
Come here!

621
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,600
Why?

622
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,399
Let's switch.

623
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,600
Give me your wok.

624
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,399
He's using the wok as a shield.

625
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:43,239
That brat is ingenious.

626
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,360
Company Two, hurry up, move!

627
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,721
Company One, surround them
from the side!

628
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,239
Squad leader!

629
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,320
I dropped my backpack!

630
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:33,813
Rubbish! Pick it up!

631
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,480
Yes!

632
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Lu Xiao Tian!

633
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,280
Watch our belongings.

634
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,399
I'll eliminate them.

635
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,639
Squad leader, wipe them out!

636
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,159
This lad...

637
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,399
He's so crafty.

638
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,120
Didn't you see that?

639
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:30,360
Don't touch me.

640
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,479
We must abide by the drill rules.

641
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,600
It's all done.

642
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:46,760
Squad leader.

643
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,040
I'll go first.

644
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,239
Be steady.

645
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:52,360
Do it like how you shoot with slingshot.

646
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,679
Yan!

647
00:39:57,472 --> 00:39:58,072
Let's switch.

648
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,439
It's full.

649
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,838
I can't hit the target anyway.
Don't waste the ammunition.

650
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:04,639
You need it more.

651
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,480
Take it.

652
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,760
You have to do the same
when you're at the battlefield.

653
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,280
The ammunition will be gathered
and given to the best shooter.

654
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,280
It's a move to improve
combat effectiveness.

655
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,840
You're the best shooter among us.

656
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,880
Take them down!

657
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,800
Strongest Yan!

658
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,600
Report! Four members
of Company One survived.

659
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,639
Report! Five members
of Company Two survived.

660
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,159
Report! Eight members
of Special Service Company survived.

661
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,360
All the members survived!

662
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,280
Fall in!

663
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,919
Yes!

664
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,560
Here's the result of the second test.

665
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,199
There are 20 targets in total.

666
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:30,760
Each target carries five points.

667
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:32,040
The full mark is 100 points.

668
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,919
Company One scores 80 points.

669
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,399
Company Two scores 60 points.

670
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:37,000
Special Service Company
scores 90 points.

671
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,159
Extra 40 points to Company One
as four members survived.

672
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,479
Extra 50 points to Company Two
as five members survived.

673
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,679
Extra 80 points to Special Service
Company as all members survived.

674
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:44,919
Adding two together,

675
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,399
Company One scores 120 points.

676
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,879
Company Two scores 110 points.

677
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,639
Special Service Company

678
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,199
scores 170 points.

679
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,719
In the second test,

680
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,280
Special Service Company won!

681
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,879
Tiger Special Forces
always win when they fight!

682
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,199
It's just a petty trick.
What is there to be proud of?

683
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,879
What's wrong with you, Zhang?
You're a sore loser.

684
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,639
You're carrying a wok too.

685
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,080
Why didn't you utilise it?

686
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,439
If we're on a battlefield,

687
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,040
can your wok withstand bullets?

688
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,159
You're cheating!

689
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,919
We utilized the wok
in a reasonable and clever way.

690
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,679
What plays a large part
when two experts fight?

691
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:18,800
Their brain.

692
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,679
In your world,

693
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,239
wok only serves its purposes
in cooking.

694
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,919
You're one wok away

695
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,360
from becoming an expert.

696
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,719
Since you're in the mood to bicker,

697
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,120
I think you've had enough rest.

698
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,199
Here comes the third test.

699
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,199
In the midst of a war,

700
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,199
you're required to build a stove,
start a fire and cook.

701
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:36,360
You need to cook
four dishes and one soup.

702
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:37,479
The company that
prepares a complete meal first wins.

703
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:37,959
Sure.

704
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,760
Let's do it here.
