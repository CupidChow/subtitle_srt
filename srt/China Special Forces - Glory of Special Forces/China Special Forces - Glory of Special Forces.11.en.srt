00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,240
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,959
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:33,720
(Episode 11)

4
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,360
Yan.

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
First Squad Leader,
I hear gunshots in Zone C.

6
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,375
Who was responsible for that zone?

7
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,520
(Company Commander,
it's Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie.)

8
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
-Send someone there.
-(Yes, sir.)

9
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,320
Yan Po Yue! Xiao Yun Jie!

10
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:45,663
Were you guys hurt?

11
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,160
It's just a scratch. We're fine.

12
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,040
Did you guys encounter
the drug traffickers?

13
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,000
We killed one of them.

14
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,679
But two of them had escaped.

15
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,839
Where did they escape to?

16
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,520
They jumped, no...

17
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,640
They had crossed the river.

18
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,399
I'll leave this place to you guys.

19
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
Good job. Thank you.

20
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,759
You two should rest here.

21
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,960
The rest of you, follow me.

22
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,960
Yes, sir!

23
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,144
Do you need any help?

24
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm fine. Thank you.

25
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,761
You killed him in one blow.
You're pretty good.

26
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:34,680
It was something we've trained in.

27
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,231
Is this your first time killing someone?

28
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:40,304
You've rendered meritorious service.

29
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,320
You'll be awarded when you return.

30
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:52,816
Yan,

31
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
how does it feel like to kill someone?

32
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
My hand feels hot.

33
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,385
We had guns with us.

34
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,720
They only had three knives with them.

35
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,576
But, two of them ran away.

36
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,207
Does this count as a failure?

37
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:23,191
It's a major failure.

38
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,265
Are we going
to accept our fate just like this?

39
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:30,032
Who said so?

40
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:34,008
I can still run and fight.

41
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:36,593
Me too.

42
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:05,464
Everyone, be careful.

43
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,360
Squad Leader, there's
a hydropower station to our 12 o'clock.

44
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,921
The drug traffickers
might be hiding inside.

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,839
There are people inside.

46
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,640
Calling for Unit 01.

47
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,240
We suspect the drug traffickers are
hiding in Zone E's hydropower station.

48
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,000
(We're searching for their accomplices
on the mountain.)

49
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,680
-(Keep a close eye on them.)
-Yes, sir.

50
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
Squad Leader,
Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie are here.

51
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,000
Squad Leader.

52
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:39,933
I'm fine.

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,129
You actually came even though
you were slightly injured?

54
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,519
I have to commend you for that.

55
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,920
They escaped from our grasp.

56
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,138
We need to capture them ourselves.

57
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:46,000
-You...
-Enough.

58
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
Split into groups and stay alert.

59
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,079
Yes, sir.

60
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,839
You two, follow me.

61
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:13,623
Did you know
why I told you two to follow me?

62
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,320
It's because we've engaged
the drug traffickers before.

63
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:17,496
We're experienced.

64
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,600
Nonsense.

65
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:23,360
Were you two in charge
of covering the riverside?

66
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:24,896
Squad Leader,

67
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:27,240
we were hiding on a nameless path.

68
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,200
But no drug traffickers
will take that path.

69
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:31,760
There was a flaw with the battle plan.

70
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,440
Squad Leader,
don't tell me you didn't know about it?

71
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,968
Do you think the flaw you see
is definitely a flaw?

72
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,161
We've gone to check it out.

73
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,322
But nothing happened.

74
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,040
Was that why you defied my order
and engaged the enemies riskily?

75
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,799
It wasn't risky at all.

76
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,200
We formulated a plan for it.

77
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,680
You were already informed
before we came here.

78
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,440
Our enemies are armed,
and they're not afraid to die.

79
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Even if they were to die,
they would drag you guys down with them.

80
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm not afraid to die either.

81
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,560
That's right.

82
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,360
My squad leader told me

83
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:01,584
that when both parties
are unafraid of death,

84
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,370
death will become unimportant.

85
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,839
So, what's important then?

86
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:09,392
To forget about one's life
on the battlefield

87
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,921
is the duty of every soldier.

88
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,080
However, your life is more important
than that stupid dignity of yours.

89
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,799
Do you understand?

90
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,600
I guess so.

91
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,160
I guess so?
That's the problem with you!

92
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,120
I don't have time
to reprimand you two right now.

93
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:30,560
Now, everyone

94
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,240
has to deal with the consequences
just because of your "I guess so"!

95
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,959
Squad Leader, this place is so remote.

96
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,360
Even if the drug traffickers were hiding
inside,

97
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:39,519
I think it wouldn't be a problem.

98
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,599
What do you mean by "I think"?

99
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,559
Both "I guess so"
and "I think" are nonsense!

100
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,360
Calling for Company Commander.

101
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:54,760
We suspect that the drug traffickers are
hiding in Zone E's hydropower station.

102
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,192
Requesting permission for Squad One
to search the area.

103
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,720
(Permission granted. Be careful.)

104
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,862
Yes, sir.

105
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:02,952
You two, follow me.

106
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:05,759
You're not allowed to leave
without my permission.

107
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,958
Let's go.

108
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:55,731
The person inside,

109
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:57,434
come out.

110
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:04,872
Who are you?

111
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,170
I'm Luo Fu Gui.

112
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,280
I'm the doorkeeper.

113
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,229
Show us your identification card.

114
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,552
Do it slowly!

115
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,760
We're searching for drug traffickers.

116
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:29,296
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

117
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,680
-No.
-Are you sure?

118
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:36,680
Yes, sir.

119
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,040
What's inside the building?

120
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,320
-There's nothing inside.
-Unlock the door!

121
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:49,760
Search the building!

122
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,440
Unlock the door as well.

123
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,040
What's upstairs?

124
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,920
There's nothing upstairs!

125
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,280
Don't go up! There's nothing upstairs!

126
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,320
Move aside.

127
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,960
-There's really nothing upstairs.
-Watch out!

128
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,761
Squad Leader!

129
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:23,864
Squad Leader!

130
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,919
Don't shoot!

131
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,239
-How dare you lie to us!
-Come out!

132
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't shoot!

133
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,039
-Come out!
-Don't shoot!

134
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,880
-Come out!
-Don't shoot!

135
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,239
Come out!

136
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,121
Put down your guns!

137
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
-Let go of my family!
-Put down your knife!

138
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,440
Put down your guns!

139
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,007
I beg you! Please save my child!

140
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,359
Daddy!

141
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,119
Daddy is here.

142
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,278
Daddy!

143
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,039
Daddy is here. Don't cry.

144
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,960
Put down your guns!

145
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,760
Please! I beg you guys!

146
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,119
Put down your guns! Do you hear me?

147
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,843
Put down your guns! Do you hear me?

148
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,239
Release the hostages!

149
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:02,551
You can take me with you!

150
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,800
Yan, what are you doing?

151
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,280
Squad Leader has regained consciousness.

152
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,040
Let's go!

153
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,560
Hurry up!

154
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,600
Don't try anything funny.

155
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,000
Squad Leader, hang in there.

156
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,599
Squad Leader!

157
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,920
Back off!

158
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:50,760
Let's back off.

159
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,520
Back off!

160
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,480
Let's back off.

161
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:55,680
Let's back off.

162
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,279
Let's back off.

163
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,200
You can let go of my son now, right?

164
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,240
I'm worried about the soldier.
He's good at combat.

165
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,680
Have you ever tied a swine before?

166
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,599
Remove your belt

167
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,040
and tie him up!

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
Hurry!

169
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:20,905
Turn around!

170
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,000
You'd better tie him tightly.

171
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,246
I'm looking at you!

172
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,160
Sorry about this, Sir.

173
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,400
Hurry!

174
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:36,143
I'm done.

175
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,640
Can you let go of my son now?

176
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,919
One life for two?

177
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,679
You're pretty good at bargaining, huh?

178
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,303
You can take me.

179
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,160
-My baby.
-Daddy!

180
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,159
Daddy!

181
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm fine, my baby.

182
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,880
You're destined to die in my hands!

183
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,239
Save the squad leader!

184
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,640
Tell him that
I won't say "I think so" again

185
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,520
if I can return alive!

186
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,400
Don't just stand there!

187
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,720
Contact the company commander
immediately!

188
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,280
Calling for Unit 01!

189
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,360
Unit 11 was attacked!

190
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,920
Someone was injured! Requesting backup!

191
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:45,240
I think this is far enough.

192
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,679
Should we still bring them with us?

193
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,040
Keep an eye on the soldier.

194
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,880
Company Commander!

195
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,599
Company Commander,
please bring me with you!

196
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,559
-Me too!
-Bring us with you!

197
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,679
Please bring us with you!

198
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,719
Squad One, get on the vehicle.

199
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,719
Yes, sir!

200
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,440
Come down.

201
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,919
We've passed China's border.

202
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:00,562
This is the knife mark
left behind by my brother.

203
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,560
It seems that Big Brother
arrived before the night.

204
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,783
Comrade, what should we do?

205
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:13,889
We lost our goods.

206
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,120
How can we face Red Scorpion?

207
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,440
We should be grateful
that we're still alive.

208
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,640
Border security was tight.

209
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,880
Even Kun Sheng can't make it
through the border himself.

210
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,120
Shall we kill them now?

211
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,239
Keep the soldier alive. We might be able
to sell him for some money.

212
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,000
Go.

213
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:33,976
Guess who's going to die first?

214
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,320
-Come down.
-Wait!

215
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,160
Where are you bringing me?

216
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,000
Comrade!

217
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,800
Comrade!

218
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
Cut the crap.

219
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,040
Where are you bringing me?

220
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Please spare me!

221
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,560
Hurry!

222
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,200
Dig a hole!

223
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm telling you to dig!

224
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,280
Hurry up!

225
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:07,920
Hurry and dig a hole!

226
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,640
Hurry! I'll kill you
if you waste my time!

227
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,400
You have to thank me for this.

228
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:31,184
This place is near China's border.

229
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,160
It's easier for you to find your way
home when you reincarnate later.

230
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:38,553
Enough.

231
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:40,809
I said, enough!

232
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,040
I said, enough! Didn't you hear me?

233
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,839
You're wasting so much time
digging a hole! Get up!

234
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:49,106
Put it down!

235
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Please spare me!

236
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,880
Please!

237
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,800
Get down.

238
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,253
Get down.

239
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,320
I told you to get down!

240
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:03,017
Soldier,

241
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
you'll envy him
when we torture you later!

242
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,561
You guys won't be able to escape.

243
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,560
My brother is nearby.

244
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:39,680
You guys are dead for sure.

245
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,169
Fu Gui,

246
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:56,049
check if he has a cell phone with him.

247
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,280
Sir!

248
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,480
Sir!

249
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,360
There's no signal,
and it's running out of battery.

250
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,399
Boss, we're almost there.

251
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,680
-It's right in front.
-That brat,

252
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,721
he just had to work for Red Scorpion.

253
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,961
Doesn't he know
the kind of people they are?

254
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,000
Does he think
they will care about his life?

255
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,039
Don't be angry.

256
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,320
Your younger brother,
Long, just wants to prove himself.

257
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:01,241
What's the point of proving himself?

258
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,160
Remember this.
We're different from Red Scorpion.

259
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,799
We aren't lunatics.

260
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,360
Ghost,

261
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
bring our men
and scout the area in front of us.

262
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,040
Hurry up.

263
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,480
Kanbo, Narcy, follow me.

264
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:40,840
Okay.

265
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,761
Sir!

266
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,961
Sir, please wake up!

267
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,481
Boss!

268
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,240
Uncle,

269
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,840
why are there two holes here?

270
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,880
It's a Dakota Fire Hole.

271
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,600
It's just a trick.

272
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:08,567
Get down!

273
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,136
He covered the hand grenades with soil.

274
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,560
He made a booby trap
by burying it in this hole.

275
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,760
The moisture in the soil
was being evaporated.

276
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,720
And the hand grenade's temperature
kept rising.

277
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,040
But if no one removed
the layer of soil on top of the hole,

278
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,880
the hand grenade wouldn't explode.

279
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:55,471
The person who created this booby trap

280
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,000
is Long's murderer!

281
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,961
Bring him to me
no matter if he's dead or alive!

282
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,359
100,000 USD.

283
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,359
I'll give you 100,000 USD!

284
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Yes, sir!

285
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:11,449
Sir,

286
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:15,160
will they fall for
the booby trap we had set up?

287
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:17,561
It depends on our luck.

288
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,040
You're bleeding again.

289
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,520
Let me bandage your wound for you.

290
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm fine. We need to leave this place
as soon as possible.

291
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:34,263
Sir!

292
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,708
He's having a fever.

293
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,286
His wound is infected!

294
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,270
Mister Luo,

295
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:12,818
you should leave.

296
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,039
What will you do if I leave?

297
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,594
I'll manage this somehow.

298
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:35,529
Sir,

299
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:38,199
you shouldn't look down on me.

300
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,439
If I ran and left you alone,

301
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,199
I'd cease to be human!

302
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,319
Let's go!

303
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:49,898
You have to go.

304
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:53,017
Your child and your wife
are waiting for your return.

305
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:55,651
I'm a soldier.

306
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,609
This is the appropriate place
for me to die.

307
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:01,391
So what if you're a soldier?

308
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,960
Soldiers are people too!

309
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll bring you back
even if it means I have to drag you!

310
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,333
Let's go!

311
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:08,393
Let's go!

312
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,640
-Boss!
-My leg!

313
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,639
-My leg!
-Don't move!

314
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,360
Bear with it.

315
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:29,489
Bear with it!

316
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,760
A varnish tree. It's poisonous.

317
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,081
We have to amputate his leg.

318
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,368
You two, send him out of the jungle.

319
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:37,672
Hurry! Help him up!

320
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:41,450
Be careful.

321
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,520
My brothers, our target
isn't someone ordinary.

322
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,040
Watch your steps.

323
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,159
Let's continue!

324
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,239
Boss, we've entered
Red Scorpion's territory.

325
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,680
If we fight here,
we'll alert them to our presence.

326
00:25:55,714 --> 00:25:57,033
He killed my younger brother.

327
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,520
I couldn't care less about them.

328
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,641
Let's go!

329
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,961
I found it!

330
00:26:53,865 --> 00:26:55,466
This is dandelion root.
It's a life-saver.

331
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,319
You should leave me behind.

332
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:03,834
No way.

333
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,730
With our current pace,

334
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,851
we definitely won't be able
to travel 10km in one day.

335
00:27:15,194 --> 00:27:16,795
They will catch up to us soon.

336
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:18,833
By then, both of us will die.

337
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,439
I have a son. I'm not afraid of dying.

338
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:24,875
Are you married?

339
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:28,146
-Not yet.
-Do you have someone in mind?

340
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,232
It's fine.

341
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,000
After we leave this place, I'll
introduce a girl to you immediately.

342
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:39,186
Open your mouth. Come on.

343
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:44,337
Don't spit it out.

344
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:45,752
It's good for you.

345
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,199
It relieves heatiness
and neutralises poison.

346
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,199
You must swallow it.

347
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,880
If you do this,

348
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,856
none of us will be able to escape.

349
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:01,977
If so, I'll accept my fate.

350
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:10,810
You can survive this ordeal, you know?

351
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,560
Since young, my dream
was to become a soldier.

352
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:23,585
I even registered for the armed forces.

353
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,839
-What happened after that?
-My father fell sick.

354
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:26,959
I couldn't leave my father behind.

355
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,599
I ended up helping out
my family in the farm.

356
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:32,896
Right before my father died, he told me

357
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,239
that we were farmers.

358
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,199
We have to protect
our lands for the rest of our lives.

359
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,079
After that, I became the guardian
of my ancestor's farmland.

360
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:46,144
You let them take you as hostage
and had saved my life.

361
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:48,617
I need to protect you too.

362
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,560
Here.

363
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,599
If you live, I'll live.

364
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,241
If you die, I'll die together.

365
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:10,434
You're so inconsiderate.

366
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:13,961
What's your goal here?

367
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,714
Even if you die here,
people won't call you a martyr.

368
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,669
What's your goal then?

369
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,857
Since I'm wearing the military uniform,

370
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:26,687
I have to sacrifice myself

371
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:29,225
to save the people
during crucial moments.

372
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,376
Not just you, I would do the same

373
00:29:33,426 --> 00:29:34,505
for other people too.

374
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,918
Don't move.

375
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,320
You should rest for a little longer.

376
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:53,256
What is this?

377
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:14,259
No!

378
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,386
Kanbo!

379
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,640
Save me.

380
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:28,721
Instruct someone
to send Kanbo's body home.

381
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:34,008
I won't persuade you guys to stay.

382
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:35,896
If anyone is afraid,

383
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:37,427
you may leave right now.

384
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:40,594
We were born in the jungle.

385
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,641
How could we be afraid of death
when we weren't afraid of living here?

386
00:31:24,312 --> 00:31:25,473
There's signal here.

387
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:40,186
Take this.

388
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:43,416
Move towards the path
that we had just taken slowly.

389
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:47,327
I'm sure there's signal here since
we just received a text message.

390
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,160
Calm down.

391
00:32:39,552 --> 00:32:40,312
Take your time.

392
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,729
Expand your range
of movement accordingly.

393
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,880
Sir, are you okay?

394
00:33:23,577 --> 00:33:24,617
There's signal here.

395
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:26,698
Who do you want to call?

396
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,677
What do you want to tell them?
I'll call them for you.

397
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:52,101
Hello?

398
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,039
-Company Commander.
-(Yan Po Yue!)

399
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,280
(Where are you?)

400
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:56,880
-(Yan Po Yue!)
-Save me.

401
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,599
(Hello? Yan Po Yue?)

402
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:34,937
They're injured.

403
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:36,104
They're seriously injured.

404
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:37,959
I think they're right in front of us.

405
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,080
-After them!
-Let's go!

406
00:35:51,242 --> 00:35:52,163
Run!

407
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:53,475
Just run!

408
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:57,792
Scram!

409
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:00,513
Scram!

410
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:04,697
Just scram already!

411
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,280
Just run!

412
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:14,544
Don't be silly!

413
00:36:21,297 --> 00:36:23,057
Hurry and scram!

414
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:39,305
Come back!

415
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,584
Drop your guns if you dare.

416
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,360
You bunch of bandits.

417
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:19,752
Without your guns,

418
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,159
you're nothing.

419
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,520
-He's not the culprit.
-Come on.

420
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:28,145
Bring it on. What?
Are you admitting that you're weak?

421
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,120
All of you, kneel before me!

422
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,280
Tell me. Where's the Chinese soldier?

423
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,520
-Tell me!
-I'm right here!

424
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,367
Put down your guns!

425
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,000
-Let go of him!
-Put down your guns!

426
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,319
Put down your guns!

427
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,080
Put them down.

428
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,959
Leave them on the ground!

429
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,481
Leave them on the ground.

430
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,120
Back off!

431
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,090
Back off!

432
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:14,856
Hurry up!

433
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:21,706
You can let go of me now, right?

434
00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:23,848
Why the rush?

435
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:27,003
I'm anxious because I haven't seen

436
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,145
your face yet.

437
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,120
That doesn't matter.

438
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:42,879
Tell me.

439
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:44,700
What's your name?

440
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:48,627
It doesn't matter anymore.

441
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:51,472
Watch out! Someone's here!

442
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,120
Don't be a sissy!

443
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,159
Come out!

444
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,840
My friend, we can talk about this.

445
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:05,199
But, I cannot let him off.

446
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,680
He killed my younger brother.

447
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:12,959
That shot was off the mark.

448
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:15,040
-He's worse than...
-Get down!

449
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,320
All of our brothers are dead!

450
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,679
My friend!

451
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:44,592
I surrender!

452
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,840
Please spare me!

453
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,479
If not, I'll kill him!

454
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,439
Boss!

455
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:56,000
I surrender!

456
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,080
Don't move!

457
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,320
Operation successful.

458
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,403
Wake up.

459
00:40:48,895 --> 00:40:49,736
What's your name?

460
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,199
I'm asking you. What's your name?

461
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,159
Yan Po Yue.

462
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,639
Which force are you from?

463
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:02,522
Squad One of the
Special Service Company, Regiment 247.

464
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:05,135
You're safe now. I will take you home.

465
00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:07,450
Bear with it.

466
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,120
You guys are?

467
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:16,959
Don't be afraid.

468
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,360
We're the Chinese People's Armed Police.

469
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,537
You're inside China's territory now.

470
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,200
Don't worry. You're safe now.

471
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:31,249
Come, have some water.

472
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,481
Thank you.

473
00:41:34,184 --> 00:41:34,942
Sir,

474
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,719
we've killed six enemies
and captured one.

475
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,280
Do we retreat
according to the original plan?

476
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,639
He can't walk.

477
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:41,600
I don't want to carry him on my back.

478
00:41:42,025 --> 00:41:43,280
We can change our retreat route.

479
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,840
We can head to Point D
instead of Point C.

480
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,800
We'll reach there in five minutes.

481
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,760
-Execute that plan.
-Yes, sir.

482
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,760
Patient in Bed 14 has
severe dehydration,

483
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,880
multiple soft tissue injuries
across the entire body,

484
00:42:22,968 --> 00:42:24,847
and stab wounds on
his left arm and left calf.

485
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,760
Luckily, his bones
and nerves weren't injured.

486
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,399
Currently, his blood pressure
is slightly lower than usual.

487
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,000
We've provided him
with debridement and sutures.

488
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,439
He's conscious.

489
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,400
We've given him a sedative shot.
He's asleep now.

490
00:42:33,746 --> 00:42:34,746
What about the patient in Bed 15?

491
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,558
Patient in Bed 15 has a perforating
gunshot wound to his left chest,

492
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,919
a concussion,
and slightly lower blood pressure.

493
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,839
He has undergone the operation.

494
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,800
Currently, he's still in a coma.

495
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,719
Observe him closely.

496
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,560
Yes, sir.
