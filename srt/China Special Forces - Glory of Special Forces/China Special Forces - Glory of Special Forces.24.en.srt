00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,080
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,040
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,640
(Episode 24)

4
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,321
Today's tactical training

5
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,080
requires everyone to hit all targets
and return to the finish line

6
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,959
within five minutes and fifteen seconds.

7
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,840
Any questions?

8
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,680
No, sir!

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,720
Yes, sir!

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,840
Say it.

11
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,399
I believe that with the layout and
difficulty of the training ground,

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,959
we can return in three minutes.

13
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,400
What about casualties?

14
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,550
Can you guarantee there won't be any?

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,440
Report, sir.

16
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,959
Even if we return in ten minutes,

17
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,719
there is no guarantee that
there won't be any casualty.

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,880
Charging and fighting recklessly
with no regard for safety,

19
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,199
that's the way of bandits.

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,120
We are a well-trained
special forces unit.

21
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,279
Every team member

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
must stick to their posts.

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,800
Minimum sacrifice for maximum winning.

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,080
That's what tactics are all about.

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,000
What if the situation on
the battlefield is critical

26
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,240
and a choice must be made?

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,800
Making a choice during critical moment
is the commander's job.

28
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,240
As a combatant,

29
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,880
you must give unquestioning obedience.

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,759
-Bai Long.
-Yes, sir!

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
As his team leader,

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,312
answer his question.

33
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,230
Yes, sir!

34
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,119
In the event of an emergency
or extreme critical situation,

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,720
all personnel must hold a defensive
formation and evacuate to safety.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
Further action will only be taken
after reporting to the superior.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,479
Over.

38
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,919
-Back to your line.
-Yes, sir!

39
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,960
Very good.

40
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,399
Bai Long is very accurate.

41
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,639
And Cheetah

42
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,367
will never implement any approach

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,199
that hasn't been tested in the field.

44
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,909
Alright now. All of you...

45
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,999
Report, sir.

46
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:52,878
I was just offering
my personal opinion.

47
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,399
And your feedback
is well received.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
Report, sir!

49
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,119
Please allow me to simulate

50
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,429
a tactical assault at my pace.

51
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,120
If it brings no significant improvement
to the current performance,

52
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,080
I'll never bring this up again.

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,440
So what if it's improved?

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,440
What does it prove?

55
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,000
Listen carefully.

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,960
I'll tell you one last time.

57
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
On the training ground,

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,478
we can only simulate the atmosphere of

59
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,824
the battlefield and the enemy's
deployment as realistic as possible.

60
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,521
But training isn't real war after all.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,289
In the real battlefield,

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,001
if we advance at your speed,

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,840
putting the mission aside,

64
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,199
this is very likely

65
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,840
to get all your teammates killed.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Therefore,

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,640
this isn't the style of special forces,

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,000
nor is it what this unit is for.

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Any more questions?

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,479
-Report...
-Report, sir. No question.

71
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,559
Did I ask you?

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,519
Any more questions?

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,600
-Yes!
-Okay! Back to your line!

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Now, get into your attack position.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,199
Get ready to attack.
All of you, about face!

76
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,940
Get into tactical position now!

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm in place.

78
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm in place.

79
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
I'm in place.

80
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,199
Captain.

81
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,359
Copy that.

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,799
I've been informed that

83
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,920
your teamwork training
today has been suspended.

84
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,279
Captain has arranged
a new training course for us.

85
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,962
-Report, sir!
-Speak.

86
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,159
-What kind of course?
-An experimental project.

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,680
We'll experiment on your first.

88
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,560
We'll see the effects
and generalize it then.

89
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Captain Yue Kong,
you're a veteran here.

90
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,359
Where do you think we are going?

91
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,480
I don't know either.

92
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,946
I haven't been here before.

93
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,079
What is this place?

94
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:38,509
Halt.

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
Captain,

96
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,200
they are here.

97
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,119
All of you, come in.

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,160
Go in.

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,200
Are you in solitary confinement here?

100
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,039
No.

101
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,469
From now on,

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,479
I'm joining Squad 9's regular training.

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,320
What?

104
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,760
You'll be our training instructor?

105
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,213
No, just a common team member.

106
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,680
Sorry,

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
we're full.

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,840
Ma Liang.

109
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:39,919
Yes, sir!

110
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,120
Go outside.

111
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,212
Yes, sir!

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,720
Alright. It's still eight people now.

113
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,319
We're going to be put in confinement.

114
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,640
It can't be.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,040
Instructor,
what are we going to do here?

116
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,119
Don't call me instructor.

117
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,909
I'm just a common team member

118
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:57,117
like you now.

119
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:00,479
Next,

120
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,521
you will live here for 10 days.

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,799
Basic food will be
provided on regular daily basis.

122
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,760
There is a separate bathroom there.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,080
You can take hot shower.

124
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,279
You can shower whenever you want.

125
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,359
Report, sir.

126
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,599
Speak.

127
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,679
Captain, what are
we training in these ten days?

128
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:18,102
Make your own arrangements.

129
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,159
-Report, sir.
-Speak.

130
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,800
Xiao Xiao is a female soldier.

131
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,480
Putting her with us...

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,921
Are you scared?

133
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Why should I be scared?

134
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,760
Look at Guo Xiao Xiao.

135
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
Even she never thought of herself
as a female soldier.

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,559
What are you afraid of?

137
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,239
Any other questions?

138
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,360
-Report, sir!
-Speak.

139
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,160
So you're just fattening us up.

140
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,359
Interpret it however you want.
Dismissed.

141
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Yes, sir.

142
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,320
Come on.

143
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,200
Captain.

144
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,240
Captain.

145
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
What training course is this?

146
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Just stay there.

147
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
What?

148
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,040
Do nothing, just stay there.

149
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
Looks like this is to
train their endurance.

150
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,880
It's a life of leisure.
Plus they also get hot showers.

151
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,720
What's there to endure?

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,440
What is the purpose of
this training then?

153
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,239
What is the purpose
of the previous training?

154
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,320
Tactical teamwork.

155
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,159
It's the same.

156
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,040
What?

157
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,160
Yan,

158
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,559
they left.

159
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:39,366
Instructor.

160
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,280
May I?

161
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,759
Of course. Make yourself comfortable.

162
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,840
-Awesome.
-Here you go.

163
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,599
-Chill.
-Comfortable.

164
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,241
I feel great.

165
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,121
I get to lie down in broad day light.

166
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,800
This is the first time I feel so good
since I joined Cheetah.

167
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,799
I get to take shower too.

168
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,080
With hot water.

169
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,119
This isn't 3-star,

170
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,679
this is 5-star treatment.

171
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,599
I wonder what the food will be like.

172
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,280
Cheetah's food is good.

173
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,680
What exactly is going on?

174
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:12,415
Did we break rules?

175
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,499
Did you break rules?

176
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
No.

177
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,439
That's right.
Since you didn't break any rules...

178
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,000
Well, why did they lock us up then?

179
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,320
I think we probably are
going on mission soon.

180
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,039
So they want us to
clear our heads first.

181
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
That's impossible.

182
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,080
Our missions are all urgent.

183
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,840
But they are putting us here
for ten days.

184
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,520
-That's absolutely impossible.
-So much talk. Carry out the order!

185
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,559
Captain Bai,

186
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,039
that's exactly what we are doing now,

187
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,959
right?

188
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:37,934
Captain

189
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,480
didn't say we can't talk.

190
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
That's right.

191
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,440
It'll kill us if we can't
talk for ten days.

192
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,599
What?

193
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:50,452
Are you talking back to me now?

194
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,840
Bai,

195
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,239
don't get so serious.

196
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
They didn't do anything wrong.

197
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Learn from Guo Xiao Xiao.

198
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
She didn't even complain.

199
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,479
And look at yourself.

200
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,760
Yes. Let's learn from
Comrade Guo Xiao Xiao.

201
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,799
Let's learn...

202
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,799
You had it coming.

203
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,159
Enter.

204
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,560
Captain,

205
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,040
Guo Xiao Xiao needs to attend
this afternoon's sniper training course.

206
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:24,919
Where is she?

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,480
There is a temporary change
of plan for the afternoon training.

208
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,000
Temporary change of plan?

209
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,480
Shouldn't I be notified in advance?

210
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,719
I'm now officially informing you that
there is a change of the course.

211
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,533
What are they training now then?

212
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,760
Squad 9 is here.

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,839
See it yourself.

214
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,481
What is this training about?

215
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,519
Synergy and cooperation
between team members.

216
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,280
Mainly to improve
the mutual trust between them.

217
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,514
-How long will this training take?
-Ten days.

218
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,919
These kids

219
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,401
are all lone wolves.

220
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,039
I don't believe that

221
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
being locked up together for ten days,

222
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,938
they won't confide in and
bond with each other.

223
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,199
Aren't you two getting sick of it?

224
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,240
I'm alright.

225
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
I've been talking for three days.

226
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,959
My mouth is getting dry.

227
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,361
You two should talk too.

228
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,560
You're doing great.

229
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,280
You talking to them is enough.

230
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,960
Yan Po Yue, talk to us.

231
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,320
What do you want to talk about?

232
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,640
Anything.

233
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,473
You can tell us about your past.

234
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,960
How many fights have you had?
How many relationships have you had?

235
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,319
Why did you join the army?

236
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,921
I've forgotten about my past.

237
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,185
Guo Xiao Xiao,

238
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,920
why do you never smile?

239
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,880
There is nothing worth smiling for.

240
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,121
That's because you're not easily amused.

241
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,400
You'll only give people a
heart attack by doing that.

242
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
That's harsh.

243
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,641
I'm telling you,

244
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,080
I've seen Xiao Xiao smiled before.

245
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,479
-Really?
-When?

246
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,480
When?

247
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:15,186
When she was holding a gun.

248
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,799
Xiao Xiao, I found that

249
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,239
you only see guns as your friends.

250
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,919
Xiao Xiao, when you became a sniper,

251
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,039
didn't they assign you a spotter?

252
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,640
I had one.

253
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,920
What happened then?

254
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,479
We separated.

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,640
She probably couldn't stand your temper.

256
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,360
Probably.

257
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,702
-That's enough.
-Stop it.

258
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:43,823
Xiao Xiao, come here.

259
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,960
-Yes.
-Stop reading.

260
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,799
Let's talk.

261
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,159
-Come on, put it down.
-Shut up.

262
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,799
-Let's talk.
-Let's have a little chat.

263
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,679
-Make space for her.
-Come on.

264
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,760
Sit down.

265
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,559
Talk to us. You can tell us anything.

266
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
-Sit here.
-Tell us anything.

267
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:54,679
Come on, sit here.

268
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,000
-Sit down.
-Yes, sit down.

269
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Tell us anything.

270
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,679
What should I say?

271
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,880
Tell us when was the
first time you held a gun?

272
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,359
Yes, yes. your first time.

273
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:10,565
When I was seven.

274
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,799
Seven.

275
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,719
Yan,

276
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,879
when was you first time?

277
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,426
I told you,

278
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:19,919
I forgot.

279
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,000
He's like that.

280
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,418
Guo Xiao Xiao, you used a
gun when you were seven.

281
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,680
Are you from military family?

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,320
My dad is a forest ranger.

283
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,919
(He was in the army too.)

284
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,960
(He didn't know how to get along
with people after he retired.)

285
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,680
(So, he volunteered
to be a forest ranger.)

286
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
(My mum couldn't take it,
and she went to the south.)

287
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,840
(She never came back.)

288
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,599
(My dad is a taciturn guy.)

289
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,479
(He barely talks.)

290
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,320
(So, I've been quiet
since I was little.)

291
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
I got you.

292
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,571
You took out my gun
without asking me again.

293
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
I want to hunt.

294
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
It doesn't even have bullets.

295
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,920
This gun is useless than twig.

296
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,320
Stand straight.

297
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,841
I'll teach you.

298
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,760
Watch and learn.

299
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,122
What were you chasing?

300
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,201
Rabbit.

301
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,760
Do you know why you
couldn't catch up with it?

302
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,320
Because it's fast.

303
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,921
Because you're behind it.

304
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,840
Now, you're above it.

305
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,639
After finding the prey,

306
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,920
we don't need to eat or drink.

307
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,519
You have to learn to observe
everything around you.

308
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,960
Every footprint on the ground,

309
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,320
every branch on the tree.

310
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,158
I can count all the trees on
the mountain in 30 minutes.

311
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,079
It's not enough. That's not good enough.

312
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,560
You have to memorize

313
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,920
every stone, every branch,

314
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,479
the shape of every cloud you see.

315
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,680
My only friend, Batulu,

316
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,280
left me.

317
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,520
I was 17 that year.

318
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,600
I became even quiet since then.

319
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,960
My dad said perhaps
army is the only place

320
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
where I would fit in.

321
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,440
I joined the army when I was 18.

322
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,720
I was assigned to
some communication headquarters.

323
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,359
I became a signaller.

324
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,160
Copy. Transfer to 203.

325

336

Copy. Transfer to 507.

337
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,280
-Copy. Transfer to 417.
-Transfer to 508.

338
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,521
-Copy. Transfer to 511.
-Copy. Transfer to 538.

339
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,440
-Copy. Transfer to 211.
-Transfer to 413.

340
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,721
Have you seen the new male recruit?

341
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,320
I saw him. He's so handsome.

342
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,000
I think I'm getting tanned.

343
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,200
He's really hot.

344
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,320
Look. She's staring into space again.

345
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,480
(Remember The Sacred Mission,
Produce Best Signaller)

346
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:22,502
(Dormitory 2)

347
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,600
Guo Xiao Xiao.

348
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,280
Yes, ma'am.

349
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,280
Our troop is going to our associate
unit's training base next week.

350
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,001
You'll be in charge of
the communications.

351
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,240
Yes, ma'am!

352
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,080
Well done!

353
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,121
Well done!

354
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,920
Communication Squadron,
Target No. 1, 8th ring.

355
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
Special Service Squadron,
Target No.1 10th ring.

356
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,480
Have the guns in your troop
never been calibrated?

357
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,881
Of course it has.

358
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,839
But why am I getting a feeling that

359
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,521
you guys aren't doing good?

360
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,880
You guys are not better than us.

361
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,613
Let the results speak for themselves.

362
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,480
Look.

363
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,800
Good job! Good job!

364
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,280
Look how smug they are.

365
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,840
So they have a few expert marksmen.

366
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,480
What's so great about that?

367
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,480
It's just an exchange of skills

368
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
with the associate unit.

369
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
Let it go.

370
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,519
Shooting fixed target isn't fun enough.

371
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,119
Why don't we spice it up?

372
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,639
Listen to them.
They even want to spice it up.

373
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,360
Bravo! Bravo!

374
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,280
Want to try it?

375
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,720
-Third Squad Leader.
-Yes, sir!

376
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,159
-Go try it.
-Yes, sir.

377
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,080
This is embarrassing.

378
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,881
I'm too embarrassed to go there.

379
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,680
They are Special Service Squadron.

380
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,520
We rarely shoot
moving targets like this.

381
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,080
It's normal to miss the shot.

382
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,280
We have to save our reputation.

383
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,880
What's so great about
Special Service Squadron?

384
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:13,160
Does our team have any sharpshooter?

385
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,320
Report, sir!

386
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,721
Yes?

387
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,721
Captain,

388
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
I would like to give it a try.

389
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,960
Pardon me?

390
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,081
I would like to shoot
the moving targets.

391
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,440
Bravo!

392
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,481
It wasn't bad.

393
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,079
But this is hardly challenging.

394
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,079
My soldiers don't like it either.

395
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,560
Report, sir!
What would be challenging?

396
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,160
Just shooting one target isn't enough.

397
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:55,805
You should at least shoot three.

398
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,800
We can set up three.

399
00:21:56,913 --> 00:21:58,114
Who will be the shooter?

400
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,800
What's so hard about shooting a target?

401
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,841
-Guo.
-Yes, sir.

402
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,520
-Come here.
-Yes, sir.

403
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,440
Is it funny?

404
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,440
State your name and unit.

405
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,681
Guo Xiao Xiao.

406
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,200
Communication company.

407
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,720
You think she can't do it?

408
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,633
The female soldier in our
communication company

409
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,400
is strong enough to deal with you.

410
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,480
Okay.

411
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,640
Get the targets ready.

412
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,441
Bravo! Bravo!

413
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,000
Bravo!

414
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,439
Bravo!

415
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,439
Great shot! Awesome!

416
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,360
After that, I was assigned to
women's special forces unit.

417
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,580
After going through the training,

418
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,880
elimination, assessment,

419
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,760
I finally became a sniper.

420
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,080
The team assigned me a spotter.

421
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,560
A girl.

422
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,440
Her name was Leng Bing (Cold).

423
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:21,547
Her personality was nothing
like her name.

424
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,520
She wasn't cold at all.

425
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,400
Your name is Guo Xiao Xiao?

426
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,280
Why have I never seen you smiled?

427
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,960
There's nothing worth smiling for.

428
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,521
Of course there is.

429
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,520
There are so many funny things.

430
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,080
When I smile, I look like Akita dog.

431
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,640
So, my nickname is Akita.

432
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,720
What about you? Do you have a nickname?

433
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,160
You don't?

434
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,481
Let me give you one.

435
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,640
You should've seen
that look in your eyes.

436
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,199
You glared at me like a wolf.

437
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:56,052
Can you please stop messing around?

438
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,961
Why should I?
Our instructor isn't around.

439
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,288
You're from Inner Mongolia, right?

440
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,440
I'll call you Grassland Wolf
from now on.

441
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,079
We'll be a team of dog and wolf.

442
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:08,959
What do you say?

443
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,920
Wolfie, wait for me.

444
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,721
Wolf,

445
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,400
do you have a boyfriend?

446
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:23,959
No?

447
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,719
You must've been in
a relationship before.

448
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,280
How many boyfriends have you had?

449
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,079
Tell me.

450
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,000
I'll tell you mine first.

451
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,880
You know,

452
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,680
Communication Squadron's Yang Qing

453
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:42,328
wrote a love letter to
Special Service Squadron's Captain Feng.

454
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:43,639
It has more than 5,000 words.

455
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,761
It's all handwritten.

456
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,640
Impressive, right?

457
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,633
Guess if Captain Feng
accepted it or not?

458
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,507
Look at the left side in front of you.

459
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,439
Left, left. In front of you.

460
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,999
See that big tanned guy?

461
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
He has watched us for two days.

462
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,440
He always eats together
with us during lunch time.

463
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,439
And he keeps staring at our direction.

464
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:23,880
Which one of us do you think he likes?

465
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,839
Happy birthday.

466
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,361
It's not my birthday.

467
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,839
I know.

468
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,960
It's three days later.

469
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,200
I'll be on leave that day.

470
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,880
I might not have time to give it to you.

471
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,520
I don't celebrate birthday.

472
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,120
You didn't celebrate before
because you didn't have me.

473
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,039
Wolf, I'm telling you,

474
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,600
you can't stay quiet all the time.

475
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,080
You'll get sick.

476
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,119
My dad was too quiet.

477
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,841
He kept everything inside.

478
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,360
Then, he got cancer

479
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,520
and died young.

480
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,681
My mother regretted it.

481
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,720
She told me not to
keep everything inside.

482
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,880
I need to get it out.

483
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,342
Even if it's just gossip or
talking bad about people.

484
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,560
Just don't hold it in.

485
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,399
The target has appeared.

486
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
3 o'clock.

487
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,000
Distance, 300 meters.

488
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,719
Wind speed.

489
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,279
This is rare. Xiao Xiao finally smiles.

490
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,600
A team of wolf and dog.

491
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,047
Interesting. It's a good story.

492
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,001
Go on.

493
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,600
End of story.

494
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,199
What does that mean?

495
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,599
Are you still in touch with Akita then?

496
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,440
Yes.

497
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,473
So, they still fell out with
each other in the end.

498
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,119
Gosh, you're worse than me.

499
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,439
How could you say that?

500
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,600
Shut up.

501
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,680
What should we do?
She finally opened up.

502
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,640
Let's just wait.

503
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,759
She came out.

504
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,920
The day she died,

505
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,440
it had just rained.

506
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,360
We went on a patrol duty at the border.

507
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,800
(During that time,)

508
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
(a mysterious sniper
had appeared at the borderline.)

509
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,160
(Four soldiers on patrol were
seriously wounded in a month.)

510
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,360
(The troops divided us
into a dozen groups.)

511
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,000
(We were sent to do a stakeout
in different areas.)

512
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,960
(Waiting for him to show up.)

513
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,000
We finally drew him out.

514
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,519
He's got eye.

515
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,760
This won't work.
If it flies closer, I'll shoot.

516
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,681
Once I fire, doesn't matter
whether I hit it or not,

517
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:33,079
we'll change position immediately.

518
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,000
Got it.

519
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,330
I can feel I'm getting closer to him.

520
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,480
We can't see anything here.

521
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
We need to move down.

522
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,280
Okay.

523
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,280
I'll go first.

524
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,825
You went first too last time.

525
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,841
It's my turn.

526
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,880
What's the difference?

527
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,079
Spotters should be at the front.

528
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,925
After safety is confirmed,
we'll guide snipers into position.

529
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,199
This is actual battle.

530
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
Our enemy is a professional sniper.

531
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,839
And I'm a professional spotter!

532
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,880
Akita!

533
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,179
Akita. Akita.

534
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,120
Are you okay?

535
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,600
Akita.

536
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,160
Are you okay?

537
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:45,766
I'm fine.

538
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
Akita, hang in there.

539
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,360
Don't move!

540
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,921
He's aiming at you.

541
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,720
Wolf, what are you doing?

542
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,960
I'll get the gun.

543
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,640
Stay there. I'll go.

544
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,520
Wolf,

545
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm closer to the gun.

546
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,040
Release the smoke. Cover me.

547
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,560
Are you sure you can do it?

548
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,681
Be careful.

549
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,000
Run!

550
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Akita.

551
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,160
Akita. Akita.

552
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Stay there!

553
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,720
Wolf, stay there!

554
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,158
I'm fine.

555
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,239
Have you spotted him?

556
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,441
No.

557
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,319
Don't move! Lie down!

558
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,681
Akita, don't move.

559
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,680
I'm fine.

560
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,240
I'm just feeling a little cold.

561
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,640
I need to move around.

562
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,679
Akita, don't move.

563
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,240
You have...

564
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,080
You have to...

565
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,040
No!

566
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,600
No!

567
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,200
No...

568
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,521
1 o'clock.

569
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:45,000
Distance, 800 meters.

570
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,840
Wind speed...

571
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,760
Wind speed, 6...

572
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,400
Wolf,

573
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:08,800
remember to talk more.

574
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:13,840
Don't keep everything inside.

575
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,480
Comrade Guo Xiao Xiao
and Comrade Leng Bing

576
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:28,760
have fought bravely and toughly
in Operation Snake Hunt.

577
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,253
You have killed an armed drug
dealer who crossed the border.

578
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,640
Comrade Leng Bing
has unfortunately sacrificed.

579
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,152
She will be named as a martyr
and awarded a first class merit.

580
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,240
And you a second class merit.

581
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,680
Due to Comrade Leng Bing's sacrifice,

582
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,160
the detachment

583
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,600
has decided to reassign you a spotter.

584
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,480
Captain,

585
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,160
may I make a request?

586
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,440
Go on.

587
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,080
I don't need a spotter.

588
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,560
Why?

589
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,440
Snipers are always in danger
of being exposed.

590
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,120
It's safer for me to fight alone.

591
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,680
There is no such precedent.

592
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,119
My code name is Lone Wolf!

593
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
I apply to fight alone!

594
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,479
Please approve this, Chief!

595
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,107
After that,

596
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,320
I went on more missions.

597
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,721
Until the reformation,

598
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,801
the People's Armed Police was
forming a rapid deployment unit.

599
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,160
I was selected by Captain Leng Jing.

600
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,160
She asked me to come to Cheetah.

601
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,840
And I came.

602
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,360
Xiao Xiao,

603
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,520
we all came here.

604
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,040
It's fate that

605
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,200
brings us together.

606
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,320
That's right.

607
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,569
We'll still be separated in the end.

608
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,760
I can fight for you,

609
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,520
bleed for you,

610
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
even die for you,

611
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,360
but I don't want to
make friends anymore.

612
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,400
Batulu and Leng Bing

613
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,280
were my friends.

614
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,281
When I lost them,

615
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,360
the pain was worse than death.

616
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,880
Do you know Leng Bing?

617
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:11,160
She was my cousin.

618
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,400
So, she was the one

619
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,560
who introduced you to Guo Xiao Xiao?

620
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,120
When we talked over phone back then,

621
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,640
she always said
her partner was a genius.

622
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,720
If she hadn't joined the army,

623
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,480
she would've been a gold medallist
in the Olympics.

624
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,960
No wonder Guo Xiao Xiao
only listens to you.

625
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,880
So, this is why you
locked them up together?

626
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,880
You're forcing them to open
themselves up to each other.

627
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,280
As a group,

628
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,680
they have to have mutual understanding

629
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,960
and mutual trust.

630
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:51,400
Everyone has feelings.

631
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,880
I want to squeeze out

632
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,080
their feelings

633
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,640
through these ten days.

634
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Actually,

635
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,880
it was so long ago.

636
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,360
It's time for you to move on.

637
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,920
Xiao Xiao,

638
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,600
Leng Bing was great,

639
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,120
but you're still alive.

640
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:21,767
We

641
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,000
have to move on

642
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,760
and keep moving forward.

643
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,120
I know that.

644
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,640
But when people die,
they're gone forever.

645
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,480
Yes.

646
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,480
But remember this,

647
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,720
you are still alive,

648
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,000
you have to keep moving forward.

649
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:40,920
And you have to live one life

650
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
for both of you.

651
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,400
Am I right, Bai?

652
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,340
Captain Bai,

653
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,840
tell us your story.

654
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,600
Let us know more about you.

655
00:40:58,019 --> 00:40:59,199
Bai and I

656
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,880
had a leader.

657
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,357
-His name is Xiang Fei.
-Shut up!

658
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,399
Xiang Fei

659
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,560
died to save me.

660
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,040
I don't deserve to talk about him.

661
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,480
Ask Bai.

662
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,440
Captain Bai,

663
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,720
why don't you

664
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,760
tell us about it?

665
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,440
Bai,

666
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,480
you don't have to talk about Xiang Fei.
We can just talk about you.

667
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,240
You are team leader.

668
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,040
You have to let your team members
know you better.

669
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,360
I'm just like you, nothing special.

670
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:15,239
What do you want to know?

671
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:16,360
Just tell them

672
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:18,159
the reason you re-enlisted!

673
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,800
Bai.

674
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,840
Bai!

675
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,760
Can't you tell?

676
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,440
Captain Qin locked us up here

677
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,200
for us to confide in each other.

678
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,400
No one can avoid this.

679
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,720
Tell us about it! Come on.

680
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Tell us about your story.
