00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,120
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,962
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:33,640
(Episode 40)

4
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,959
Calling for Tiger Head.

5
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,519
All enemies are approaching Tiger Fang.

6
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,559
Please send reinforcements!

7
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,279
Attack!

8
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,759
Don't let our guests run away!

9
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,559
There's a sniper.

10
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,119
Locate him for me!

11
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,679
You two,

12
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,879
take this path.

13
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,720
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,919
Number 04, retreat!

15
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:02,959
Retreat!

16
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,760
Reloading!

17
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,559
Roger that!

18
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,040
Reloading!

19
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,000
Retreat!

20
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,079
Let's go!

21
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,600
Provide cover!

22
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,559
Number 04!

23
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Go!

24
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,040
Number 02, enter the house!

25
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,441
Number 03, let's go!

26
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,839
Provide cover!

27
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,000
Reloading!

28
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,320
Reloading!

29
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,319
Reloading!

30
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,400
Roger that!

31
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,400
Reloading.

32
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,081
Roger that.

33
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,640
I need more ammo.

34
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,839
Report your condition.

35
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:48,840
Number 01, fine.

36
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:49,520
Number 02, fine.

37
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,440
Number 03, fine.

38
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,400
Number 04, fine.

39
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,840
Number 05, fine.

40
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,359
Number 02 and 03,
you two should leave first.

41
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,719
Number 04 and 05, draw their fire away.

42
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,400
Roger that.

43
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,200
Provide cover!

44
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,039
I'll deal with that sniper.

45
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,519
Stay alive and wait for my return!

46
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,961
(Remember,)

47
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,487
(our mission is
to capture Xing Tian alive,)

48
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
(escort him back to the country
and put him on open trial.)

49
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,080
Retreat!

50
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,439
Lai!

51
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,679
Don't let him escape!

52
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
Smoke bomb and tape.

53
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's go!

54
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,279
Let's support Number 03!

55
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,719
Go to hell!

56
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,680
I'll send you all to hell!

57
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,280
(Qin Feng never told us)

58
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,440
(that it hurt so much when
the bullets hit our bulletproof vests)

59
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,880
(It's as if our internal organs
were ruptured)

60
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,520
(and every single bone was shattered.)

61
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,160
We're the elite special unit members

62
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,960
of the armed police forces!

63
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,640
The badges represent our honour!

64
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,600
(But pain can't hold me down.)

65
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,039
Why are you guys hiding?

66
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,000
Go!

67
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,680
Attack!

68
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,920
Captain!

69
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,120
Please give me a chance.

70
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,000
I want him alive!

71
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,800
Save your ammo
and buy some time for him!

72
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,839
Lai!

73
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Go and find Miya.

74
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,080
Don't come back after
you've dealt with the sniper.

75
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,421
Their reinforcements will arrive soon.

76
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
We can no longer defend this place.

77
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,480
Rendezvous at the sign.

78
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,040
Tiger Claw Two.

79
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,360
Calling for Tiger Claw Two.

80
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,800
The enemy sniper is approaching.

81
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,078
My sniper rifle is busted.

82
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,079
I'm hiding from her right now.

83
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,120
I'll deal with her.

84
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,800
(Roger that. Be careful.)

85
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:10,648
Yan Po Yue,

86
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,001
seems like fate has led us
to each other again.

87
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,080
I told you before.

88
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:17,480
I will come back and beat you up.

89
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,800
We are to rendezvous at the sign

90
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,080
after we've dealt with him.

91
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,200
I'll flank him.

92
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,520
Are you going soft on me?

93
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:17,360
Is that soft?

94
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,320
You'll become a demon

95
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,840
when you stay here for a long time!

96
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,240
Demons should stay in the place
where they belong!

97
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,236
Calling for Tiger Fang One.

98
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,640
Target One has been captured alive.

99
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,878
Mission accomplished!

100
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:26,880
Release the flare!

101
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,121
Number 02!

102
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,199
Who else has ammo?

103
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm out.

104
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,321
-Me too.
-Me too.

105
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,840
Are you okay?

106
00:28:13,772 --> 00:28:14,760
Calling for Tiger Head.

107
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,560
Target One has been
captured successfully.

108
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,880
Target Two has been
rescued successfully.

109
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,680
All members of Tiger Fang
have evacuated successfully.

110
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,320
Most of them were shot.

111
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,520
Please send

112
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,360
a first-rank medical team to receive us.

113
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,160
(Tiger Fang One, this is Tiger Head.)

114
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,400
(The first-rank medical team
has already headed to Point E.)

115
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,280
(We will wait for your return
at Point E.)

116
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,000
(Over.)

117
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:38,839
Roger that.

118
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,720
Thank you.

119
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,560
Yan Po Yue,

120
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,200
do you know that we've met each other

121
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,400
long ago?

122
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,680
Where?

123
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,360
In the cellar.

124
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,920
It was more than 10 years ago.

125
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,559
Back then,

126
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,560
you were the only kid

127
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,760
who had escaped the cellar.

128
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,040
Someone! He's escaping!

129
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,760
Back then, if I took your hand,

130
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,840
I guess I would live a different life.

131
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,400
There are no ifs and buts

132
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,659
in life.

133
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:07,874
Comrades,

134
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:10,794
the armed police forces

135
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:14,837
is marching on

136
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,239
the path of military enhancement
with a new face.

137
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,921
We're a mighty team that can win wars

138
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,880
and a civilised team
that is well-respected

139
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:26,447
by the people.

140
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,520
In the future,

141
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,200
we will do our best to establish

142
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:32,121
a strong and modern armed police squad.

143
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,840
The era has already
given us the question paper.

144
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,120
And now, we're in
the middle of answering it.

145
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:39,922
All of our hard work and efforts,

146
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,880
stubborn fights,

147
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:43,505
and tireless pursuits

148
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:45,904
represent our handwritten answer.

149
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,481
I hope every comrade here

150
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,399
can remember our mission

151
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,600
and be the loyal guardian of the
party organisation and the people.

152
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,860
Comrades, this time,

153
00:31:05,522 --> 00:31:08,841
the Cheetah Commando
has achieved huge success

154
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,560
in Operation Red Scorpion.

155
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,840
They've dealt a fatal blow

156
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:14,409
to Red Scorpion,

157
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:16,240
the border drug scourge.

158
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,120
They've eradicated
the armed drug trafficking organisation

159
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:21,599
that had threatened
the safety of our nation and people

160
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,720
entirely.

161
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,199
In this operation,

162
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,240
the soldiers of Squad One, First Corps
of the Cheetah Special Forces

163
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:30,178
have made enormous contributions.

164
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:31,737
After our discussion,

165
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,160
we plan to commend them
for their meritorious acts

166
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,760
and promote their ranks.

167
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:38,115
All rise!

168
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,601
Qin Feng, captain of

169
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,959
the Cheetah Commando First Corps,

170
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:45,993
has rendered first-class merit.

171
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,084
He will be promoted to the rank of
vice detachment captain

172
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,881
and receive the police rank
of lieutenant colonel.

173
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:53,513
Lu Tu, squadron leader of First Corps,

174
00:31:53,594 --> 00:31:54,474
has rendered second-class merit.

175
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:57,120
He will be promoted to the rank of
First Corps captain

176
00:31:57,896 --> 00:31:59,697
and receive the police rank of major.

177
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,760
Leng Jing, squadron leader
of First Corps,

178
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,039
has rendered second-class merit.

179
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,080
She will be promoted to the rank of
First Corps vice-captain

180
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,440
and receive the police rank of major.

181
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,600
The warriors of Squad Nine, First Corps,

182
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,639
Yan Po Yue, Guo Xiao Xiao,
Bai Long, Xu Yang,

183
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:22,335
have rendered second-class merit.

184
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,359
They will receive
the police rank of lieutenant.

185
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,200
Salute!

186
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,975
Mu Qing, member of Squad Nine,
First Corps,

187
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,360
has rendered second-class merit.

188
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,327
Next, we will welcome
Deputy Commander Zhang

189
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:37,167
to award the newly promoted members

190
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,001
with the rank promotion certificates

191
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,681
and military medals.

192
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,920
Right face!

193
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,400
Quick march!

194
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:04,920
Halt!

195
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,239
Right face!

196
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,960
Salute!

197
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,800
Next, let us welcome Yan Po Yue

198
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,239
to give a speech
as their representative.

199
00:34:02,937 --> 00:34:04,176
Today, I'm lucky enough

200
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:07,376
to be standing here.

201
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,543
Here's a notice from the captain!

202
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,200
Squad Nine, assemble!

203
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,360
There's a dinner party tonight!

204
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,599
A dinner party.

205
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,240
Squad Nine, everybody.

206
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,639
Bai Long?

207
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:24,986
Xiao?

208
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,641
Xiao.

209
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,920
I'm on leave.

210
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,201
Fine. Let's go.

211
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,120
Salute!

212
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:44,313
Sir!

213
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,559
Squad Nine is here!

214
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,266
Six of us should be here!
Only two of us are present!

215
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,598
Four of our members are on leave!

216
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,054
What's going on?

217
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:52,100
Did all four of them apply for leave
at the same time?

218
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,041
Yes, sir.

219
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,655
Xiao Yun Jie was
the only person in his room.

220
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:57,239
The rest left their dorm
after applying for leave.

221
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,879
They left their dorm at this time?

222
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:01,194
There's only one place they will visit.

223
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,184
Do I have to trouble you
to make the trip?

224
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:05,568
Or should we wait for their return?

225
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,872
(Grave of Xiang Fei)

226
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,399
Salute!

227
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:49,751
(Grave of Yue Kong)

228
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,688
(Grave of Lu Xiao Tian)

229
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,703
The military medals
I'm carrying right now

230
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,639
represent the trust our
party organisation has in me.

231
00:36:26,257 --> 00:36:27,937
They represent

232
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,720
the hard work and perseverance of
the armed police forces.

233
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,520
They represent the countless injuries
and sacrifices of our comrades.

234
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,481
Today,

235
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:38,623
I stand here

236
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,560
to accept the medals for
those who were sacrificed!

237
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,280
The Cheetah Commando
will never forget about them.

238
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,520
History

239
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,840
will never forget about them!

240
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:30,920
Sacrifices might occur in any fight.

241
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,240
Since you've joined
the Cheetah Commando,

242
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:33,760
you need to learn how to accept it.

243
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:35,720
If you don't want to accept that fact,

244
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:39,719
you must do your best
to achieve complete victory.

245
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:40,840
What is complete victory?

246
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:42,985
Zero death and mistake!

247
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:45,242
So,

248
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:47,080
you guys have to work extra hard.

249
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,730
You need to strengthen yourself.

250
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,600
It's fine if you don't want
to attend the dinner party.

251
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,120
Now, I will issue
a new order to you all.

252
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:56,145
Yan Po Yue.

253
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:58,352
Yes, sir!

254
00:37:58,489 --> 00:37:59,249
Guo Xiao Xiao!

255
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,399
Yes, sir!

256
00:38:01,703 --> 00:38:02,383
Bai Long!

257
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,719
Yes, sir!

258
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:04,559
The three of you,

259
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:06,000
together with Xiao Yun Jie,

260
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,640
will be sent

261
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,240
to the Special Police Academy
for training.

262
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:11,360
You all will depart by tomorrow.

263
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,920
Training?

264
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,680
What kind of training?

265
00:38:14,785 --> 00:38:15,465
You have to learn

266
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,880
how to be
an excellent special unit commander.

267
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,640
The instructor from
the academy is already here.

268
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,280
Instructor Ai,

269
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,280
meet your new students.

270
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,160
Staff Officer Ai.

271
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,440
I mean, Miss.

272
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:32,120
Have you finished your
postgraduate studies?

273
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,120
I'm doing my PhD now.

274
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:35,400
In what field?

275
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:37,560
Special Forces Command.

276
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,561
Amazing.

277
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,760
I guess you'll command us now.

278
00:39:48,113 --> 00:39:49,073
In your eyes,

279
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,081
I'm just an armchair hero.

280
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:52,360
Am I right?

281
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,879
Of course not.

282
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:58,088
I'll be your student soon.

283
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,120
I'm also a researcher at the
Centre for Intel and Strategy Studies.

284
00:40:02,937 --> 00:40:03,777
This time,

285
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,159
in response to
the global anti-terrorism trend,

286
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,719
our higher-ups requested us

287
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,097
to draft elite soldiers from different
special units into the academy.

288
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:14,192
We are to train them,
research them, and observe them

289
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,241
to prepare for new battle requirements.

290
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,680
And you guys

291
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,200
will be my research targets.

292
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,159
Sure.

293
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,720
Research me all you want.

294
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,720
Do you still remember what you said

295
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,000
before you left Regiment 247?

296
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,320
I said I would work hard to be the best.

297
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,760
Do you think you've achieved your goal?

298
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,120
Back then, I was a frog in the well.

299
00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:55,080
I was too childish.

300
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:59,760
Actually, I'm one of
the worst soldiers in the unit.

301
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,400
In our unit, one third
of our members are veterans

302
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,480
that had gone through countless battles.

303
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,760
The rest of them are elite soldiers
brought up by the veterans.

304
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,360
It's all because of
our deceased brothers here.

305
00:41:18,785 --> 00:41:20,666
We were baptized by blood and death.

306
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:22,960
We've tasted the sorrow
of losing a comrade.

307
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,200
That's how the Cheetah Commando
became a soulful unit.

308
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:36,320
All of them are
the most valuable treasures

309
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,800
of the special forces.

310
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,840
Yue Kong,

311
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,000
the best sniper in Cheetah Commando.

312
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:00,320
When it comes to shooting,

313
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,720
no one

314
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,611
can compare with him.

315
00:42:09,183 --> 00:42:10,960
Infrared anti-sniper detection system.

316
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,240
Your enemies used an
infrared anti-sniper detection system.

317
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,463
When a sniper pulls the trigger,

318
00:42:19,544 --> 00:42:21,240
the bullet trajectory
will be traced immediately.

319
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:23,280
And, it will launch an accurate
retaliation at the perpetrator.

320
00:42:23,993 --> 00:42:26,840
No matter how tough you are,
you won't be able to avoid it.
