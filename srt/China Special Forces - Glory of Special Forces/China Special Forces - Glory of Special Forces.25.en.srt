00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,040
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:31,035
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:33,760
(Episode 25)

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,760
Captain Qin locked us in here

5
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,600
for us to confide in each other.

6
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:39,705
No one can avoid this.

7
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,159
Tell us about it! Come on.

8
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,120
Tell us about your story.

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm not willing to talk about my past

10
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,336
because

11
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:11,720
it's a long story.

12
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
(I lost my father when I was six.)

13
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,680
(He worked outside all year long.)

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,280
(I couldn't even remember
what he looked like.)

15
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,880
(The only impression I had of him
was the design of his urn.)

16
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,280
(After I grew up,)

17
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:31,720
(my mother told me that
my father was a hero.)

18
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,160
(He sacrificed his life)

19
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
(to save a drowning passer-by.)

20
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:39,240
(In our village, the Bai family
was pretty influential.)

21
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:41,960
The village chief was my second uncle.

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,839
But that didn't give our family
an advantage over others.

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,792
After my father was gone,

24
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,160
they hoped

25
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,320
that my mother could remarry
and leave the village together with me.

26
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,960
They wanted to take our land.

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,200
My mother may look gentle,

28
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:00,040
but,

29
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:02,960
she's more stubborn than anyone else.

30
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,440
Sister-in-law,

31
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,720
you see, it's been three years
since Yong Qiang had passed away.

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,880
You're a woman, and you're trying to
raise Long Long yourself?

33
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:10,680
This...

34
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,679
This isn't the best choice, am I right?

35
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,560
I've discussed this
with your brother-in-law.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,158
I've arranged a blind date for you
at the outer village.

37
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,199
He's okay with it
even though you're a widow.

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,920
It all depends on you now.

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,840
If you're okay with it,
I'll make the preparations.

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
Second Sister-in-law,

41
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,920
you must be referring to Wang Liu
from the Li Village.

42
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right.

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,681
He's still single even though
he's over 50 years old.

44
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,640
That's him.

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,520
His brother is a good friend
to your brother.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,520
So, what do you think?

47
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,160
No, thanks.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,840
I heard that he leads
a dissipated life and he's lazy.

49
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,759
Qiao Ling,

50
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,837
I know you're prideful.

51
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,080
But, you're raising
your child alone as a woman.

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,399
You see, people will bully you

53
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,280
if you don't have a man in the family.

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,560
Second Sister-in-law,

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
I can still withstand this.

56
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,840
We can talk about it
after Long Long has grown up.

57
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:10,833
You're

58
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,400
pitiful too.

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,360
A few years ago,
Long Long's father was...

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,800
Although he had passed away,

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,080
we still think that the Bai family
has let you down.

62
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,080
I've come up with a solution.

63
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,440
If you think it's inconvenient for you
to remarry with a child,

64
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
you can let us adopt your son.

65
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,440
We will surely treat him well.

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,800
Second Sister-in-law,
what are you saying?

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,600
You and Second Brother
don't need to worry about us.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
I will surely raise Long Long well.

69
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Why are you so stubborn?

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,359
Mum, I'm back.

71
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:56,720
Long Long, wait.

72
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:58,240
Long Long, you're back?

73
00:04:58,721 --> 00:04:59,440
Second Aunt.

74
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:03,680
What happened to your face?

75
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,121
It's nothing.

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,761
I fell on my way home.

77
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,920
Go and change.

78
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Second Sister-in-law, I think Bai Zhu
should be home by now.

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
You should head back and cook for them.

80
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,280
You should consider Wang Liu.

81
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,040
I still need to give him a reply.

82
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,279
Why wasn't our family in the list?

83
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,559
Our family is so poor!

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,279
Why wasn't our family included too?

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,640
Is your family in the list?

86
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,080
I couldn't find our names.

87
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,120
This is nothing.

88
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:00,600
Zhao Qiao Ling,

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,120
do you know where you are?

90
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,480
You should knock before you come in.

91
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:07,640
Isn't this the village committee centre?

92
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Why did you close the door
so early in the morning?

93
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,839
I was just trying to help out
the villagers of Bai Village.

94
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,160
This is my duty.

95
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,040
I appreciate your intention,

96
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,840
but you can take this away.

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,640
-Thank you, Village Chief.
-You can resume your work.

98
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,200
-You too.
-You're too courteous.

99
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,959
What?

100
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,680
Do you guys need anything?

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,440
Second Brother, they own
two houses, you know?

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,160
Why are they included
in the poverty aid list?

103
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,240
They have plenty of children.
Therefore, their expenses are huge.

104
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,126
The money they used to build the houses

105
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,759
was his wife's dowry.

106
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,526
Now, they're doing poorly.

107
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,400
They're so poor that
they have to sell them away.

108
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,079
Second Brother,

109
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,000
Bai Long is Yong Qiang's only son.

110
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,399
He's your nephew too.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,320
Only the two of us were left

112
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:08,200
after Yong Qiang had passed away.

113
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,039
Everyone in the village

114
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,226
knows how difficult it is for us.

115
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,959
It's impossible for us not
to be included in the poverty aid list.

116
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,366
I, Zhao Qiao Ling, am a prideful person.

117
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,840
If it wasn't hard for us
to make both ends meet,

118
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,120
I would never apply for
the poverty aid programme

119
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,760
in order to receive monetary aid.

120
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:33,520
Sister-in-law,

121
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,160
I know what your family is dealing with.

122
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,160
But this time, they have a formula

123
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,760
to see who is eligible for
the poverty aid programme.

124
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,959
For example, your family
only has two people.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There are few people in the family.

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,200
But when we divided the land,

127
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
you still got Yong Qiang's share.

128
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,960
We've already been very kind to you.

129
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:02,618
There's another way.

130
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,000
You can give up the land.

131
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,280
By doing so, you'll end up
in the poverty aid list naturally.

132
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,937
(Grave of Bai Yong Qiang)

133
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,440
You were still young back then.

134
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,840
There were plenty of things
I didn't tell you.

135
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:34,863
Our land and house

136
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:37,777
already existed when
your father was still around.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,880
These are the only things your father
had left behind for you.

138
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:44,593
You must protect them, understood?

139
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:47,600
My ability is limited.

140
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,449
You might suffer under my care.

141
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
But I will give it my all

142
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,880
for your sake

143
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,920
and your father's sake.

144
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:05,240
Your second uncle and aunt
even wanted to adopt you.

145
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:08,479
In the end, they just want to
get their hands on our land.

146
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:12,600
Mum, I won't go anywhere.

147
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,080
I'll stay with you.

148
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,479
Long Long, remember this.

149
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:18,480
No matter when,

150
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:21,720
the land belongs to our family.

151
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
You must protect it.

152
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:27,128
If not, your father

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,640
won't be able to find his way home

154
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,840
when he comes to visit us.

155
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,960
When I'm dead,

156
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,680
bury me right beside your father.

157
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,880
Mum, you won't die.

158
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
After I grow up,

159
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,880
I will surely build a two-storey
Western-style house for you.

160
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,800
No, I will build a three-storey house.

161
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,680
By then,

162
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:57,800
you can live on the highest floor.

163
00:09:58,184 --> 00:09:59,720
You can lead a comfortable life.

164
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,360
Second Uncle and Aunt
can only watch us from the outside.

165
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:04,920
I won't let them in.

166
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,039
I don't want that.

167
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,120
I just hope

168
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,520
that you can grow tall and strong.

169
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,080
I hope you can be like your father

170
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,360
so that you won't be bullied.

171
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,080
Bai Long, stop right there.

172
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,440
Come here.

173
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,919
Stop right there.

174
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,281
I told you to come, did you hear me?

175
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,479
Hurry up.

176
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,449
Call me Dad.

177
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,559
Come on.

178
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,280
-Hurry up.
-Call me Dad.

179
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,640
His father is a ghost now.

180
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,433
Why do you want to be his father?

181
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,000
My good son, call Dad right now.

182
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,240
Hold it right there!

183
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:52,335
Stand there!

184
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,600
Stand straight!

185
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
Who told you to fight?

186
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:07,560
Now, you get into fights with people?

187
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,760
You even stabbed him with a bottle?

188
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,119
Will you stab him
with a knife next time?

189
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,400
I did so much in order to raise you!

190
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,560
But fighting is
the only thing you've learned?

191
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,321
-They insulted you first.
-I did so much to raise you.

192
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,680
That's why I fought them!

193
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,527
Does that mean you can fight them?

194
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,039
Does that mean you can do so?

195
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,257
If you keep getting into fights,

196
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:28,872
what if you die out there one day?

197
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,800
You'll be just like your father then!

198
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,799
You're my son!

199
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:55,624
What should I do if I lose you?

200
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,559
(I have to protect my mother.)

201
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,746
(I cannot make her upset anymore.)

202
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,320
(That's why I trained,)

203
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:08,807
(ate,)

204
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,160
(and ran with everything I have.)

205
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:12,760
(I hoped that I could
grow tall and strong.)

206
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:18,400
(There's no longer a place for us
in the village.)

207
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,680
(I only have one path ahead of me.)

208
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:29,777
I'm on the recruit list!
I'm a recruit now!

209
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm a recruit now!

210
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm a recruit now!

211
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,121
Bai Long!

212
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,640
Bai Long, isn't this you?

213
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:38,889
Both of us are recruits now!

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,880
We're recruits now!

215
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,000
We're recruits now!

216
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,760
I'll tell Mum about this!

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,159
At that time,

218
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,160
I thought heroes don't exist.

219
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:28,239
We call them "heroes"
because we don't know them well enough.

220
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,680
But I didn't expect to see a true hero

221
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:34,017
on my first day in the military camp.

222
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:36,600
He was the squad leader who received me.

223
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:38,880
His name is Xiang Fei.

224
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,280
(Although the training was tough,)

225
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,160
(it was nothing)

226
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,920
(compared to the hardships
I endured in my village.)

227
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:58,120
(Under Squad Leader Xiang's lead,)

228
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,480
(our hearts were warm,)

229
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:01,840
(and we were driven.)

230
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,800
(We were fired up every day.)

231
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
(No other squads)

232
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,640
(could top ours.)

233
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,520
(From a squad leader,
he became a platoon leader.)

234
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,760
He was the best member
of the special forces ever.

235
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,449
It's you, not him.

236
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,680
Did I tell you to speak?

237
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm just stating the fact.

238
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,832
Ever since

239
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,591
Bai Long joined
the Cheetah Special Forces,

240
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,520
he was basically first place
in everything.

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,159
And, during an anti-terrorism
manhunt operation,

242
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
even though he was seriously injured,

243
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,880
he annihilated every enemy
through sheer determination

244
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:19,943
and excellent skills.

245
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,359
He was awarded with
a second class merit.

246
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,520
Enough! Xiang Fei was
the reason I was awarded!

247
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,400
I'm nothing without him!

248
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,200
Platoon Leader.

249
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,760
What's the matter?

250
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,375
Do you think you can go
wherever you want

251
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,359
just because you were awarded
with a second class merit?

252
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,041
Do you think you can skip training now?

253
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,840
Platoon Leader,

254
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,093
there's a family emergency.
I have to head back immediately.

255
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,520
What is it?

256
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:57,320
My...

257
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,241
My mother is sick.

258
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,080
You're lying.

259
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,000
You're trying to lie to me?

260
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,240
You suck the most at lying.

261
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,440
Tell me what's going on.

262
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,600
I received a phone call yesterday.

263
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,080
It was from my mother.

264
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,799
She said that my second uncle
has become the village director.

265
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,800
He's working together with the
demolition office to tear down my house.

266
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,200
Have they completed
the necessary procedures?

267
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,000
Second Uncle said he's the law there.

268
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,560
I always talked about
protecting my country.

269
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,400
But now, I can't even protect
my own house, let alone my country.

270
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
Follow me.

271
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:47,960
Tell me then.

272
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,360
What do you plan to do?

273
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,520
Platoon Leader, please don't stop me.

274
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,760
What are you trying to do?

275
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,280
Are you trying to
go against them by yourself?

276
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,560
You don't intend to call me for a fight?

277
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,680
Do you still treat me
as your elder brother?

278
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,400
Those monkeys think they're kings
because there are no tigers there.

279
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:14,599
I'll see how capable they are.

280
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:17,199
Wait here.

281
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,399
I'll send a report to our higher-ups.

282
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
I have to help you to apply for leave.

283
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,640
If you leave without a valid reason,
you'll be a deserter.

284
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,160
Even if you're in the right,
you'll be in the wrong.

285
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,640
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

286
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,360
Zhao Qiao Ling, you'd better move.

287
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
We're trying to work here.

288
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,600
Mum!

289
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:02,760
Mum, I'm back.

290
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:04,369
You're back?

291
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,439
It's great that you're back.

292
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,120
Seems like our Long Long
has become sturdier.

293
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:13,984
Hello, Madam.

294
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,719
I'm Bai Long's platoon leader.

295
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm here to see how you're doing.

296
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:21,943
Please come in...

297
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,240
I guess there's no place
for you guys to sit.

298
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,239
Long Long, you're back?

299
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
You can help us to persuade your mother.

300
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,360
The government wants to demolish
the house to build a new road.

301
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,606
But she just sits there all day long.

302
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,320
I can't start my work like this.

303
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,760
Look.

304
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,480
She has already signed the agreement.

305
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,719
She has received the subsidy as well.

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,280
She has to obey
the agreement, am I right?

307
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,520
Nonsense!

308
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,600
I've never signed the agreement!

309
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,920
And I've never received any subsidies.

310
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,960
If you demolish my house,

311
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,640
where can I stay?

312
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:58,800
Where can I stay?

313
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,280
You can only receive the subsidy
after the house is demolished.

314
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:03,392
How about this?

315
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,200
You can follow me to the office
and get your money right now.

316
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,680
Guys, you all witnessed her
signing the agreement, right?

317
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,439
-That's right.
-Hello.

318
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,480
Are you

319
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,400
the village director?

320
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,120
Are you Long Long's leader?

321
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,360
Hello, Leader.

322
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,040
So,

323
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:25,720
can you help us out with this?

324
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,680
This is the government's policy.

325
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,680
We have to cooperate with them, right?

326
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,359
I have a question.

327
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,800
How much did the government
give for the relocation payment?

328
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,520
50,000 yuan.

329
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,120
50,000 yuan?

330
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,320
It's like this.

331
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,199
Bai Long's house
belonged to his grandfather.

332
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,680
It was my father's house.

333
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,880
That's why the relocation payment
has to be split into three shares.

334
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,240
One for my elder brother, one for me,

335
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,320
and one for Bai Long.

336
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:58,600
Right before Dad died, he made it clear

337
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,800
that the house belonged to Yong Qiang.

338
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,800
He had already given his money
to you and Big Brother.

339
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,400
Zhao Qiao Ling, when you say something,
you need to show proof.

340
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,440
Where's your proof?

341
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,720
Think about it.
We've been nice to you all these years.

342
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,640
You have to search your conscience
when you speak.

343
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,480
Even if the government is trying
to reclaim the land here,

344
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,560
we also need an agreement like this,
am I right?

345
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,720
That's right.

346
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,680
Enough!

347
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,040
You're only paying her 50,000 yuan
for the reclamation payment?

348
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,560
Where do you want them to stay?

349
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,400
Do you think
you're reclaiming the land here?

350
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,479
You're just trying to kill them.

351
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,000
Move aside!

352
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,680
Move aside!

353
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,000
Move aside!

354
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,160
Dad! Why are you
wasting your time with them?

355
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,199
Bai Long, you're a coward!

356
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,080
You're asking
the armed police to help you out?

357
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,720
You guys are obstructing us
from performing official duties!

358
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:47,093
Listen up. We will

359
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,566
demolish this house by hook or by crook!

360
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,960
You guys are wearing
the military uniform!

361
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,880
If you dare to hit us,

362
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,440
that means you'll be
charged for causing affray!

363
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,120
Bai!

364
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,560
Listen up.

365
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,920
Bai Long

366
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,119
is my soldier.

367
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,160
How dare you try to contain
the Chinese military?

368
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,720
Today,

369
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,199
I'll show you guys

370
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,760
how bloodthirsty we are.

371
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,118
You guys did great.

372
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,079
They deserved to be beaten up.

373
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,479
That's right.

374
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,200
What happened after that?
How did you guys resolve it?

375
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,599
The village was alarmed by the incident.
An investigator came.

376
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,600
He found out

377
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,240
that they forged my mother's signature
for the reclamation agreement.

378
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,479
Several villagers came out
and testified for my mother.

379
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,480
Back then, my grandfather did
leave the house behind for my father.

380
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,520
My second uncle was
dismissed from his post.

381
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
Bai Zhu was held in custody
for some time.

382
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,280
The village allocated a piece of land
to my mother

383
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,480
and gave her some compensation.

384
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,319
That's pretty fair.

385
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,161
It was difficult for us
to fight for our rights.

386
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,920
Both Xiang Fei and he

387
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,199
were punished because of me.

388
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,632
It's worth it!

389
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,240
It's totally worth it!

390
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Enough already. Resume with your work.

391
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:30,640
This is not a big deal.

392
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,119
It's just a punishment.

393
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,520
I just need to be kept
under surveillance for a few days.

394
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,520
That's great.

395
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,640
When I'm kept under surveillance,

396
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:39,439
I don't need to be annoyed
by you brats. Go back.

397
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,360
Platoon Leader,

398
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,520
I would like to be
fully responsible for this.

399
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,959
What are you saying?

400
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,680
What has this got to do with you?

401
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,120
This is my second class merit.

402
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,320
It's none of your business.

403
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,040
I'm planning to quit the army.

404
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,839
Listen up.

405
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,480
You know nothing else
besides being a soldier.

406
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,160
What will you do
if you quit being a soldier?

407
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,960
I know.

408
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:24,000
But,

409
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:26,560
I have to take care of my mother
for a certain period.

410
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,240
I need to rebuild our house.

411
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,840
After that, I'll take her
to the hospital.

412
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
Alright. How about this?

413
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:37,706
I'll write a report to our higher-ups
and help you to apply for leave.

414
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,319
I'll help you
apply for a long leave, okay?

415
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,880
No, Platoon Leader.

416
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,280
I only realised that my mother
was seriously ill after I went back.

417
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,960
I'm very worried about her.

418
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,680
And, I'm afraid my second uncle
and his gang

419
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,839
will disturb her when I'm not around.

420
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,720
I'll return home and
exact my filial duties first.

421
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:08,840
When everything has settled down,

422
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,279
I'll return to the army.

423
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:12,720
I can enlist in the military
for a second time.

424
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,280
I hope that Cheetah Special Forces
can accept me by then.

425
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,520
Platoon Leader,
please grant me your permission!

426
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,600
Listen up.

427
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,160
We'll stay right here

428
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
and wait for your return.

429
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,040
(After I returned to the village,)

430
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,840
(my mother was getting
weaker and weaker.)

431
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,159
(I did everything I could
to rebuild our house.)

432
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,721
(I wanted to complete the three-storey
house for her before she passed away.)

433
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,200
(But, she passed away)

434
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,280
(on the day the house was completed.)

435
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,880
(I cried the entire night.)

436
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,120
(I thought I could get over it
after crying through the night.)

437
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,880
(I thought the toughest part was over
after that.)

438
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,960
(However, I received a call.)

439
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,880
(They told me)

440
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,120
(that Xiang Fei was gone.)

441
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,360
In order to save this guy,

442
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,440
Platoon Leader Xiang was
killed by a landmine.

443
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,440
Why didn't you watch
where you were going?

444
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,280
Why did you let someone else save you
after you stepped on a landmine?

445
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,200
During Operation Cobra,

446
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,200
the drug cartels set up a trap for us.

447
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,000
We had to fight for seven days and
nights before we could leave the place!

448
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,000
Fei was buried there.

449
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,400
And that was the deepest scar
in every old member's heart.

450
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,200
I'm still alive

451
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:51,480
because of Fei's sacrifice.

452
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,840
So, no matter how you treat me,

453
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,960
I will accomplish the mission
that he couldn't.

454
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,880
Alright now.

455
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,040
(I erected a tomb for Xiang.)

456
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,400
(It was right beside
my parents' graves.)

457
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:29,360
(The people who were closest to me
were all together now.)

458
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,840
Captain,

459
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:05,440
I'm honoured to be
on the same team as you.

460
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,880
In the future,

461
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,440
when the members of Squad Nine
are in danger,

462
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,800
I will protect you guys just like

463
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:26,960
how Platoon Leader Xiang
had protected us.

464
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:37,080
All of them are hot-blooded fellows.

465
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,400
They just lack a fuse

466
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:41,240
to light them up.

467
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
You two haven't eaten yet, right?

468
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
Come, take one each.

469
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,160
Liu, I knew you were concerned about me.

470
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,800
As an instructor, I should be
more concerned about the captain.

471
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:54,400
Comradeship is as deep
as the sea indeed.

472
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:55,760
We must teach them about it.

473
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,510
Stop acting like a smart alec.

474
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,335
Do you think this training of yours
is effective?

475
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:01,624
Why should I adopt it
if it's not effective?

476
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,969
Just look at the screen yourself.

477
00:29:08,728 --> 00:29:09,968
They're eating. There's nothing to see.

478
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,880
Now, those fellows can sit down
and have a meal together.

479
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,200
That's an amazing improvement.

480
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,136
I've read the profiles of
the new recruits in detail.

481
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:25,625
You've put the candidates
with the strongest personalities

482
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
and best results on the same squad.

483
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,119
This type of enclosed training
may look simple,

484
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,839
in reality, it serves to help them
understand each other on a deeper level

485
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,719
and make them clash, thus
forming chemistry between them

486
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,319
and enhance the strength of the squad.

487
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,789
Was I spot-on?

488
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:41,457
You do know me the best.

489
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:45,400
Actually, I wanted to make some changes
to the training plan

490
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:47,000
and add this section into the plan
since last month.

491
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:51,214
I did notice that.

492
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,680
When it comes to combat and training,
I understand you and trust you fully.

493
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,764
But of course. If not, our higher-ups
wouldn't pair us up.

494
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:00,476
That's right.

495
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,160
I hope they can become
close comrades soon.

496
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,448
If they want to be as close as us,

497
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:07,998
they have to go through
life-and-death situations together.

498
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,160
Just finish your food.

499
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,517
Whose turn is it now?

500
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:16,638
Take the initiative.

501
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,107
Raise your hand and speak.

502
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,106
Come, have some oranges.

503
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,960
Here you go.

504
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,841
Okay.

505
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,520
-Catch it.
-Be careful.

506
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,680
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

507
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:30,560
I don't take oranges.

508
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,000
But why?

509
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:33,200
For no particular reason.

510
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,840
Are you allergic to oranges?

511
00:30:35,176 --> 00:30:37,000
He doesn't like them.
You guys can enjoy them.

512
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,840
So pretentious.

513
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,880
If you starve him for three days,
he'll devour the orange peel.

514
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,200
Over my dead body!

515
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,960
Why did you shout?

516
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:49,080
Did you swallow live bullets just now?

517
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:50,840
Yue Kong is right.

518
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,160
When you're on the battlefield,
orange peel tastes amazing.

519
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,239
I'll take tree leaves,

520
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,319
barks,

521
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,040
mud, and rocks over them!

522
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:01,136
Stop it.

523
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,560
Bai, time to eat.

524
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:04,280
Let's eat.

525
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,080
The last meal I had with my family

526
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:24,760
was oranges.

527
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,160
Jie, have some oranges.

528
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,160
No.

529
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,880
You should replenish your Vitamin C.

530
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,600
He's been pulling a long face
for the entire month.

531
00:31:45,682 --> 00:31:47,480
Do you want the game console that badly?

532
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:49,720
It'll depend on
your mid-semester test result.

533
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,200
What result do you want?

534
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,600
Xiao, the game console is useless.

535
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:54,753
It's not useless!

536
00:31:54,823 --> 00:31:56,624
It can help me to improve my grades.

537
00:31:56,752 --> 00:31:58,280
I'll get you one if you're ranked
within the top 100 students.

538
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,960
The top 150 students!

539
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,240
How dare you still bargain with me?

540
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,080
Who do you think
will be playing the game console here?

541
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,600
Fine, I'll take up your challenge.

542
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,160
I can borrow you
my game console if you want to.

543
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:08,120
I wonder who he takes after.

544
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,200
You should go to
the parent-teacher meeting next time.

545
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:12,200
Mum, if it's Sports Day,

546
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,239
I'll surely come in first place for
long-distance running, sprints,

547
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,839
high jump, and long jump.

548
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,599
That's enough.

549
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,121
You're sounding like a monkey.

550
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,240
Come.

551
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,040
My condolences.

552
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,000
It's fine. It's been so many years.

553
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,520
Sorry, Bai.

554
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,040
-And Yue.
-It's fine.

555
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,600
Come, let's eat.

556
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,359
Let's eat.

557
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,720
Let's eat.

558
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,120
Xiao Yun Jie.

559
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,840
What happened after that?

560
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,880
After that?

561
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,960
After that, I encountered this fool.

562
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,800
Are you two childhood friends?

563
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:02,720
Childhood friends?

564
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,080
We weren't that close
when we were young.

565
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:06,720
He didn't dare to look me in the eyes.

566
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,000
Look at his face.

567
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,760
He does look like this since young.
He looks like a scum.

568
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,120
Everyone in the school
wanted to beat him up.

569
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,760
But you're the only person
I wanted to beat up.

570
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,760
I just want to eat.

571
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,960
If so, how did you two become so close?

572
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,800
Tell them.

573
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,000
You tell them.

574
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,960
Just tell them already.

575
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,840
I don't want to be reminded
of your stupid face back then.

576
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Fine.

577
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:33,920
I'll tell them.

578
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,320
He's trying to exaggerate the story.

579
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,400
I beat him up during our first meeting.

580
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,320
Nonsense!

581
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:42,760
-Are you sure about that?
-Of course.

582
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,160
-Come, let's fight right now.
-No need for that.

583
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,680
I'm sure I was the one
who had beaten you up.

584
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,160
Did you remember my Shadowless Kick?

585
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,600
Don't say that. I'm eating, you know?

586
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,640
This is Jie's bank book,

587
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,080
house ownership certificate,

588
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,040
and house keys.

589
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,520
He couldn't find any help
after the accident.

590
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:01,280
My son and I were doing
all the errands for him in the hospital.

591
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,560
This is the hospital's receipt.

592
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,400
The amount should be correct.

593
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,520
Thank you.

594
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,560
We've been neighbours for over a decade.

595
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,479
I've watched over Jie
since he was a kid.

596
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,920
I didn't expect such
an unfortunate event to happen.

597
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,280
Don't worry. His aunt and I
will take good care of Jie.

598
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:18,946
Here, have some oranges.

599
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:20,273
Take them with you.

600
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,840
Take them.

601
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Take them.

602
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,280
We'll make a move first.

603
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,440
I'll call you

604
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:31,478
if I have any questions.

605
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:33,800
Jie, let's go.

606
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,080
Goodbye, Granny Li.

607
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:41,639
Go now.

608
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,280
See you.

609
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:49,119
Your aunt is unwell today.

610
00:34:49,815 --> 00:34:50,839
She's waiting for you at home.

611
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,559
We've finished
the school registration for you.

612
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,200
You can head to school by tomorrow.

613
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,160
Your aunt and I love quiet surroundings.

614
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,720
We rest early usually.

615
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,760
You can take your time
and get accustomed to life around here.

616
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,560
-Why are you so quiet?
-I thought you like quiet surroundings?

617
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,879
This kid.

618
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,159
Stop it!

619
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,081
Stop fighting!

620
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,712
Stop fighting!

621
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,960
Stop!

622
00:35:31,887 --> 00:35:32,607
Yan!

623
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,320
Look at your son!

624
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,520
Why did you fight? Are you okay?

625
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:36,619
What's the situation?

626
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,600
-He started the fight!
-You stepped on my oranges!

627
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,760
Yue!

628
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,120
-Does it hurt?
-Complete a 5,000m run with weight!

629
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,360
If not, you won't get to have dinner.

630
00:35:50,256 --> 00:35:51,680
Sorry about that.

631
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,720
I've just made some preserved meat.

632
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,400
I'll send some to you guys tonight.

633
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,520
Do you think we need your food?

634
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,440
Look at you. You started a fight
after you just arrived.

635
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,520
Look at all the soil!

636
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,520
Stop nagging him! Let's go home!

637
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,240
-See you!
-Sorry about that.

638
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,160
Let's go back.

639
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:07,640
Stand up.

640
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,879
Good morning, Teacher.

641
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:13,840
Good morning, everyone.

642
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,840
Today, we have a new student with us.

643
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,040
His name is Xiao Yun Jie.

644
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,040
Please welcome him.

645
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,880
Yan Po Yue!

646
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,600
Is it recess time now?

647
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,280
It's time to get off work!

648
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:38,640
Stand up!

649
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,040
Did you go stargazing last night?

650
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,720
How dare you sleep at school?

651
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,200
Why didn't you move your bed here
while you're at it?

652
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,160
Fine, you can stand at the back
for this period.

653
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,040
It can perk you up.

654
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,080
Wait.

655
00:36:51,928 --> 00:36:53,160
We have a new student here.

656
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,760
That's Xiao Yun Jie.
He's a sports student too.

657
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,520
In the future, he'll be your deskmate.

658
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,640
You two must get along with each other.

659
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,360
We will get along with each other.

660
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:12,600
Alright.

661
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,720
Everyone, turn to page 55.

662
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,480
Let's continue from where we left off.

663
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,280
The north country scene,

664
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:21,400
a hundred leagues locked in ice.

665
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,000
A thousand leagues of whirling snow...

666
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,000
Yan Po Yue!

667
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:29,800
Isn't this the vocal class?

668
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,000
We exchanged our period.

669
00:37:31,237 --> 00:37:32,040
I'll make a move first.

670
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,880
Wait!

671
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,360
You're pretty good at using your vocals.

672
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,680
Your voice was pretty loud just now.

673
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,920
Why didn't you tell me
that you were this good?

674
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,760
Alright, I'll have a chat
with your mother tonight.

675
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,840
-Aunt, don't do that.
-Stand outside!

676
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,120
Don't close the door!

677
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,800
Make sure that I can see you!

678
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,800
Your things are under my desk.

679
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:15,040
Here you go.

680
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,760
Stop fighting.

681
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,560
Ms. Jiao will return soon.

682
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,680
Sorry about that.
I didn't do it on purpose.

683
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,040
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

684
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,320
I'm Xia Li, the class's study committee.

685
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:52,136
In the future, you may find me
if you have questions about your study.

686
00:38:54,961 --> 00:38:55,880
Yan Po Yue,

687
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,360
the Sport's Day registration is open.

688
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,080
You should join an event.

689
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:01,200
No.

690
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,760
You and Chen Hui

691
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,959
are the only two sports students
in Ninth Grade.

692
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,199
You should join an event.

693
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,080
If not, Chen Hui will win all of them.

694
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,280
He can win whatever he likes.

695
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,200
I won't join any events.

696
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I'm a sports student too.
I'll join an event.

697
00:39:19,328 --> 00:39:20,800
What event are you good at?

698
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:21,640
The 800 metres.

699
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,160
I always came in first place
in my old school.

700
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:34,160
Xiao Yun Jie has joined that event.

701
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,760
You should join other events.

702
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,360
I like the 800 metres.

703
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,640
You aren't happy with me, right?

704
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:41,240
See you on the race track.

705
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,159
Fine.

706
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,280
You can do it!

707
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,719
You can do it!

708
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,801
Hui.

709
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,520
Aunt...

710
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,679
Ms. Jiao, if I didn't fall,

711
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,800
I'm sure I would've come in first place.

712
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,120
I saw that.

713
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,960
You didn't trip anyone
when you extended your leg.

714
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,047
Instead, you tripped yourself.

715
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:10,159
No, I...

716
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:10,959
Alright now.

717
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,000
You're pretty good for coming in
third place after falling on the track.

718
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,000
Sit down.

719
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,560
(Next, participants of
the 800 metres men category,)

720
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,240
(please head to the inspection area.)

721
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,400
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie.

722
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,920
Yan Po Yue, Xiao Yun Jie,

723
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,800
good luck!

724
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,120
Thanks.

725
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,360
Why are you trying to show off?

726
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,600
You can come in third place
if you're that capable!

727
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,240
Sit down!

728
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,360
It's useless for you to pray for help
at the very last second.

729
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,920
Stop being sarcastic.

730
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,480
You'd better apologise to me
if you lose.

731
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,480
Apologise to you?
And compensate you with oranges?

732
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,840
Only brats care about apologies.

733
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,360
I only care about my capability.

734
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,160
On your marks!

735
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,920
Get set!
