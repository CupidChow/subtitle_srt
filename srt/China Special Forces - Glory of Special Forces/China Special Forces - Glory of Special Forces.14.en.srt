2
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,000
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,760
(Episode 14)

4
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,639
Didn't you come to me to talk about him?

5
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:40,222
He has recovered from PTSD.

6
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,004
The whole company witnessed it today.

7
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,720
I sent him there.

8
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:51,640
Throwing such a brat to you,

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,321
he must've given you a lot of trouble.

10
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:56,080
He's a diamond in the rough.
He's worth it.

11
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,200
He's one-track minded.

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
Just like me back then.

13
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,960
I wanted to join Cheetah too.

14
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,520
I participated twice
and got eliminated twice.

15
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,200
I hope

16
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,160
he can be

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
the lucky one.

18
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,400
The one with talent

19
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,000
should have good luck.

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,560
Goodbye, sir.

21
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,000
Get in.

22
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,281
What are you waiting for?

23
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,760
Get in. Come with me to the sentry post.

24
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes, sir.

25
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,640
Company One's sentry post is at the top.

26
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Have you been there before?

27
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,720
-No, sir.
-Right. You're with Special Service.

28
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,120
There is no reason for you
to visit Company One's post.

29
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,320
Let's go.
We have a long way to go.

30
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,960
Sir,

31
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,960
what's inside your briefcase?

32
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
It's bulging.

33
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,520
Open it and see for yourself.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,960
You're bringing so many
notebooks to the post.

35
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
Take it out and have a look.

36
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,441
I write down notes as I go.

37
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,440
These notebooks

38
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,881
are full of names and family situation
of frontline soldiers of each company.

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,321
I receive emails from everyone

40
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
on the local area network.

41
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,881
They would tell me

42
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,440
even private matters like blind date.

43
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,121
Out of 365 days a year,

44
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,600
I spend 200 days visiting various posts.

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,080
They all laugh at me,

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,480
jokingly called me
Regiment Commander of Wheel.

47
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,520
Only through zero-distance contact
with the soldiers,

48
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,999
can I understand
the real situation beyond papers,

49
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,240
so that I can guide the field better,

50
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,560
to mentor and solve the problems
of the grassroots organization.

51
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
In a word,

52
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,160
we must keep our comrades in mind.

53
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,840
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,320
You train hard every night.

55
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:06,673
Why?

56
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:09,164
I want to stay in good shape,

57
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,160
and wait for the chance
to participate in the selection.

58
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,000
You were in an actual battle.

59
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,807
What do you want to
do most in the battle?

60
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,880
I want to destroy the enemy

61
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,950
and fulfil my duty as a soldier.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,920
That's all?

63
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:24,840
That's all.

64
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,040
Killing an enemy and saving a comrade,

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
of these two,

66
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,602
which matters more to you?

67
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:37,920
My comrades are capable
of protecting themselves.

68
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,560
If they are injured, we have medic.

69
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,680
It's too kind to call you
one-track minded.

70
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,800
You brat, you only think of yourself.

71
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,840
Sir,

72
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm just being honest with you.

73
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,840
Yan Po Yue,

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,320
I've approved you to
participate in the selection.

75
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,480
Really?

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,000
No.

77
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,920
You're too wild.

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,400
I have to leave you in
the hands of someone more capable.

79
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,920
Yes, sir!

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
Thank you, sir!

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
When you get there,

82
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
maybe you can really find your

83
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,360
original aspiration of being a soldier.

84
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,680
Regiment Commander!

85
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,881
You brats.

86
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,201
How's the food today?

87
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,800
It's great. Stay for dinner, sir.

88
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,759
Sir, the solar water heater
has been installed.

89
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:55,982
Have a shower first.

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,840
Okay.

91
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,680
I'll stay for dinner today.

92
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,200
Give me my bottle.

93
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
You don't have to stay here with me.

94
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,880
Go back with the car.

95
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,440
Sir...

96
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,801
Go back.

97
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,080
Before you go,

98
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,160
there are many people
you need to say goodbye to, got it?

99
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
Comrades,

100
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:00,440
I'm a recruit of Squad One of

101
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:02,640
Rapid Deployment Brigade's
Special Service, Yan Po Yue.

102
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,600
I just received an order
from my superiors

103
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,440
to continue guarding Hill 713.

104
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,640
Your honour and glory

105
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,399
will remain on the field.

106
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,440
We will hold on to it.

107
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,520
We won't let the enemy
seize even an inch of our land!

108
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,200
Regiment Commander has released you?

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,079
You knew that already?

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
He just approved it yesterday.

111
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm leaving too.

112
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Where are you going?

113
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,040
The military academy.
For postgraduate study.

114
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
For three years.

115
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,600
In the future,

116
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,560
a better me will meet a better you.

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,960
I will continue
to strive to be the best.

118
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,720
I heard you. I'll be waiting.

119
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Sir, I want to give you a gift.

120
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,440
I really didn't have many options.

121
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,079
So this is what
I look like in your eyes.

122
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,680
No, you're much more handsome than it.

123
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,840
You punk.

124
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,080
You finally did it.

125
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Your efforts paid off.

126
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,040
Let me tell you,

127
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,240
The suffering days are ahead of you.

128
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,960
What? Want to fight me?

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,560
Those are not suffering days,
it's sweet days.

130
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,480
You brat.

131
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,480
Have you visited other guys?

132
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,560
I have. Guo, Tian,

133
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,240
Sha, Long, I've bidden them farewell.

134
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:24,799
It suits you.

135
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,680
Is it?

136
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,640
Have you talked to Company Commander?

137
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
I'm going to see him now.

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,920
Go now! He's leaving too.

139
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,040
I thought I would have
more time.

140
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
I didn't know it would come so fast.

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,400
Throwing a farewell party
isn't too much, is it?

142
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,400
I didn't even go to
the headquarters' farewell party.

143
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,280
At least have a meal with us then.

144
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,360
Bid everyone farewell.

145
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,760
I've said all I have to say.

146
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
Li, what do you want then?

147
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,760
A simple goodbye will suffice.

148
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,000
Any other requests? The
company will try to meet them.

149
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,360
If it's beyond our company's means,

150
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,760
I'll make a request to the regiment.

151
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,120
No request.

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,720
Oh, right,

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
I do have one.

154
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,680
My train is at 5am tomorrow.

155
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,840
I'll leave alone,
I don't want anyone to see me off.

156
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,560
You're making this difficult for me.

157
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,880
From a personal perspective,

158
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,880
we've been working together
for over two years.

159
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,680
From the work perspective,
I'm Instructor.

160
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,120
When we have new recruits,
we hold welcome party for them.

161
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,160
Now that a veteran is leaving,
there won't be any farewell party?

162
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,400
Not to mention that
you're a company commander.

163
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,800
You won't even meet

164
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,920
my last request.

165
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Why?

166
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,720
After I'm gone,

167
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,600
there will be a new company commander
coming in.

168
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,680
They need to forget me
as soon as possible

169
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,320
to adapt to the new environment.

170
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,120
I don't wish to put other
people to any inconvenience.

171
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,800
Salute!

172
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,440
Please say something, sir!

173
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,560
This isn't a memorial service.

174
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,120
No need to be so serious.

175
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:18,965
Today

176
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,880
is my last day as company commander.

177
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,240
Having a company commander like me,

178
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,960
you all must've suffered a lot.

179
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,600
We serve the people!

180
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,800
I am the ninth commander
of Special Service Company.

181
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,560
After I'm gone,

182
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,960
soon you'll have your
tenth company commander.

183
00:14:58,278 --> 00:14:59,518
I hope you...

184
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,800
I hope you will

185
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,400
continue to train hard
under the leadership

186
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,480
of the new company commander,

187
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,360
maintain the prosperity
and stability of our country

188
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,920
and safeguard the security of our land.

189
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,166
Comrades

190
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
who are not here today

191
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,600
are on duty on the frontline.

192
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,680
Please send them my regards.

193
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I wish them good health
and success in their work.

194
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,560
And I hope all comrades

195
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,680
will return

196
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,920
safe and sound

197
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,160
from your future missions.

198
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,560
When I was in
the hall of honour just now,

199
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,560
I saw pennants,

200
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,840
awards,

201
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,480
military medals.

202
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,680
If

203
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,080
I can come back one day,

204
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,880
when I come back,

205
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,080
I hope to see more of them.

206
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,320
Stop crying.

207
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,880
Listen to me, Zhang Tian Yang,

208
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,360
You have wounds.

209
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,000
remember to protect yourself

210
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,841
during training.

211
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes, sir!

212
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,440
Xiao Yun Jie!

213
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,320
Yes, sir!

214
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:14,720
Remember my strictness,

215
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,880
not my perversions.

216
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,120
Gao Zhun.

217
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes, sir!

218
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,360
Eat well and build your strength.

219
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,239
Grow bigger.

220
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,640
Zhou Zi Jian.

221
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,520
Yes, sir!

222
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,281
Keep in mind that

223
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,920
when you put on the uniform,
we become comrades in arms.

224
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,879
We are a family.

225
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,280
Unity is above all.

226
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,085
We have only one common goal,

227
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:23,102
to defeat the enemy.

228
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,240
Yes, sir!

229
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
(Excellent Military Skill, Fine Conduct)
(Number One)

230
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
(Joint Effort In
Capture of Drug Dealers)

231
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
(Model Company
For Grassroots Construction)

232
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:46,640
Comrades,

233
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,959
comrade Xiao Fei will represent
Company One

234
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,160
in the special forces selection.

235
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
Today,

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,760
instead of wine,
we'll toast with beverages.

237
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,680
Let's wish Squad Leader Xiao
a good luck in this selection.

238
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,839
May he bring honour to our company,
bring glory to our regiment.

239
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,239
Yes, sir!

240
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,601
Xiao Fei, say something.

241
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,839
I'm ashamed to say,

242
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,186
I've participated in
the selection three times

243
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,041
since I joined the army,

244
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,720
and I got eliminated every time.

245
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
But this time,

246
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,640
I'm well prepared.

247
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,640
I'll get good results,

248
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,599
and I won't let our company down.

249
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,440
I'll finish my glass first.

250
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,839
Good!

251
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,199
You're not in Secret Service anymore.

252
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
What are you doing back?

253
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,997
You're not in
Secret Service anymore either.

254
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,921
I'm sorry, sir.

255
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,041
You're right.

256
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,040
I should remind myself too.

257
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,881
I'm not in
Special Service anymore either.

258
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,154
Regiment Commander has allowed me
to participate in the selection.

259
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,521
I'll leave in three days.

260
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,480
Good for you.

261
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:29,026
Yes, sir.

262
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,800
I got something to say to you.

263
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,987
I participated in the selection too,

264
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,120
but I was eliminated.

265
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,881
We're counting on you now.

266
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Second,

267
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:43,693
the selection is difficult.

268
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,680
Be prepared for anything,

269
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,880
not just physically, but also mentally.

270
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,240
I hope you succeed.

271
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,360
I'll keep that in mind.

272
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,280
I got something to say to you too.

273
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,960
First,

274
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,159
thank you.

275
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,720
Second,

276
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
I hope we will meet again.

277
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll accept the first thing you said.

278
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,400
As for the second,

279
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,200
the world is too large.

280
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,280
Once I leave the regiment's gate,
it'll be hard to meet again

281
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,920
Sir,

282
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,920
I'll always remember you.

283
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,440
Always remember
Tiger Special Service instead.

284
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,280
Alright now. Go back.

285
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,040
Let's play basketball for a while.

286
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,000
You like to fight alone, don't you?

287
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,160
Come on!

288
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,560
Get fired up.

289
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Look like a soldier!

290
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,800
Watch me!

291
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,720
When you have no teammate,

292
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,840
you have to rely on yourself.

293
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,240
Liu Qiang! Come play with us!

294
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,360
Sir!

295
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,280
(Company Commander bids farewell to
Special Service with a basketball game.)

296
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,920
(In the history of
Tiger Special Service,)

297

(he is just a small coordinate.)

298
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,400
(but to him,)

299
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,840
(Tiger Special Service is
the meaning of his life.)

300
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,800
(Many company commanders like him)

301
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:15,280
(have passed down the responsibility)

302
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,280
(and dignity of a soldier
from one generation to the next,)

303
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,480
(and imprinted
the military duty and mission)

304
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,720
(deep into the heart of every soldier.)

305
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
(Special Service is still
Tiger Special Service)

306
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,640
(even without Li Xiang.)

307
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,000
(But because of Li Xiang,)

308
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,680

has spread throughout the regiment.)

319
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:01,519
Report, Chief!

320
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,640
Participants in
Cheetah Special Forces Reserve

321
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:06,959
skills assessment have been assembled.
Please advise.

322
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,079
All of you are our
carefully selected talents.

323
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,480
You're representing
Rapid Deployment Brigade

324
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,680
to participate in
the special forces selection.

325
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:15,560
This selection is carried out

326
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,840
due to the deepening reform of
our national defence and military,

327
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,599
due to the integration and expansion of

328
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,920
Armed Police Force and Cheetah Commando.

329
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,640
We have to add new forces

330
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,520
to the existing ones,

331
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,280
so each unit will pick
the best and strongest soldiers

332
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,680
to participate in the selection.

333
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:34,800
You will face the toughest test.

334
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,160
You will face soldier kings
from different units.

335
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,720
Let up for even just a bit
and you're out.

336
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,280
If you pass the selection

337
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,640
and become a reserve member,

338
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,200
you will face the toughest training
in the army

339
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,039
and the most dangerous missions.

340
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:51,062
Of course, this is also your honour!

341
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,400
And your pride!

342
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,599
I wish you success,
and may you bring glory to our regiment!

343
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:08,400
It's getting dark.

344
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,479
Where exactly are they taking us?

345
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,479
We haven't eaten or drunk.
We can't even stop to pee.

346
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,760
Look at what is that at your feet.

347
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Don't touch it.

348
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:27,920
Squad Leader, this isn't locked.

349
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,000
-He's right.
-Let's take a peek, just a peek.

350
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,280
Let me tell you,

351
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,280
they're not as kind
as you think they are.

352
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,920
The stuff inside might
not be what you want.

353
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,480
Do you even know...

354
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,440
Explosives?

355
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,359
Smoke sticks?

356
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,601
Whoever can't take it anymore,
just pull it.

357
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,120
It's for us.

358
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,840
I'd advise you to use it
as soon as you get out of the car.

359
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,560
It'll save you from all the sufferings.

360
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Squad Leader Xiao,

361
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,880
I heard that you've participated
several times for this selection, right?

362
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,160
Did you pull it every time

363
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,960
you got out of the car because
you couldn't stand it anymore?

364
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,080
I'd rather eat it

365
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,520
than use it.

366
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,840
We're here.

367
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:41,601
Guys,

368
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,120
we got an SUV for you

369
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,600
at the next pickup point.

370
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,719
Besides me and the driver,

371
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,200
the vehicle will only
carry three more people.

372
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
As for you guys,

373
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,880
who gets to ride in that SUV,

374
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:52,440
how are you going to get your spot,
we don't care.

375
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,517
If any of you think this is stupid
and you want to give up,

376
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,160
just pull the smoke stick in your hand.

377
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,360
A support team will come

378
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,002
to provide you with hot soup and bread.

379
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:01,924
And

380
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:03,880
chocolate.

381
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,640
Squad Leader Xiao,

382
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:36,280
should we...

383
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:39,548
They're laying a trap for us.

384
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Once he said only three people
can get in the car,

385
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:45,507
everyone will start to
scheme against each other.

386
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,560
I don't believe they set the test

387
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,560
just to watch us fight each other.

388
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:55,160
They said they prepared an SUV

389
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,640
with three empty seats, right?

390
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,560
But they didn't say

391
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,640
only three people would
be allowed to pass the test.

392
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,719
Who says that a jeep
can only accommodate five people?

393
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,960
I saw with my own eyes

394
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,199
a Jeep 212 had managed

395
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,560
to accommodate 11 people.

396
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:12,320
The most important thing now is unity.

397
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,120
What do you think, Squad Leader Xiao?

398
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,600
I don't care.

399
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,760
You are all dragging me down, anyway.

400
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,280
Squad Leader Xiao, don't you think
you're being too sure of yourself?

401
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,200
-Am I?
-Are you not?

402
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,800
Why don't you try it now?

403
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,600
Enough, Yun Jie. Stop.

404
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,640
Squad Leader Xiao,
let's stay united, okay?

405
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:35,760
Save your strength.

406
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:39,246
I have a plan.

407
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,760
Hear me out.

408
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,040
Sir, distress signal is spotted.

409
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,760
What kind of men
did the 247th Regiment send us?

410
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,280
Drive.

411
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,800
Stay alert.

412
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,960
What are you doing?

413
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,480
Chief!

414
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,920
Stop there.

415
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,680
What are you doing?
You want to fight me?

416
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,600
Squadron Leader, surrender.

417
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,760
You guys think you can beat me?

418
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,000
You don't seem to be very brilliant,

419
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,240
but you have a lot of guts.

420
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,840
You got the nerve to
capture your examiner.

421
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:12,041
How do you want to do this?

422
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,600
One by one or together?

423
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,079
I'll go first.

424
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,680
-I'll be the second.
-I'll be the third.

425
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,159
When Jian is tired,
it'll be my turn.

426
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,959
I'll be the fifth then.

427
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:24,324
I'll be last then.

428
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,479
Fine, fine! I surrender.

429
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,841
The six of you together will crush me.

430
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,760
You guys win this round.

431
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,720
Tell me.

432
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:42,160
What's your next step?

433
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,120
Sir,

434
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,000
we're from Rapid Deployment Brigade's
Special Service.

435
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,239
As you can see,

436
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,479
there are six of us here,

437
00:32:47,622 --> 00:32:48,622
but you only want three.

438
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:50,566
We have no intention
of killing each other,

439
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:52,720
so please give us a chance.

440
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,359
Sir, they broke the rule!
You can't take any of them.

441
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,400
Shut up!

442
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,920
You said it yourself.

443
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,640
As long as we can find the pick-up SUV,

444
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,719
get in, and we'll pass.

445
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,000
We found the vehicle.

446
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,920
You're also under our control.

447
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,804
That means we passed.

448
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,000
Who said you passed?

449
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Did you tell them that?

450
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,361
This round

451
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,280
is wilderness survival assessment.

452
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,521
You're supposed to

453
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,240
find food on your own
in this Gobi Desert.

454
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,561
Hold on, sir,

455
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,039
look at your car.

456
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,640
Isn't the food on that car
also in this Gobi Desert?

457
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,520
There's nothing wrong with that.

458
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,118
Untie him first.

459
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,599
Okay. Thank you, sir.

460
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,959
Sorry, man.

461
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,880
Please don't be hard on us
in the future.

462
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,400
This is so dirty.

463
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,720
Let me tell you,

464
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,520
I'll let you pass this round,

465
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,520
but I will not forget this.

466
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,480
Get in!

467
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,960
Sir, what's your name?
How should we address you?

468
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,080
Anything. Driver, or captive,
anything you want.

469
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,360
Don't be mad at us.

470
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:11,320
We had no other option.

471
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,267
We were afraid that
you would leave us there.

472
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,320
Then, we wouldn't even be
able to find the gate of the base.

473
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,319
Just consider this as
you're observing us closely

474
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,400
as our leader.

475
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,313
That's right.

476
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,200
I can't afford to be your leader.

477
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,120
Sir,

478
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,959
we will do whatever you say,

479
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,801
follow your orders,

480
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,719
and try to show you our value.

481
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,040
Squadron Leader, please forgive us.

482
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,719
So,

483
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,239
tell us about the rules
of the training after this.

484
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,239
Yes, yes.

485
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,840
Tonight, we will arrive at the site of
actual combat drill of this assessment.

486
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,320
There are a total of 60 soldiers
participated in this selection.

487
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:45,078
You need to form a team of three,
with anyone you like.

488
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,480
You'll compete against other teams.

489
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,560
Your goal is to enter the centre of
the designated area in the drill site.

490
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,800
The final two surviving groups

491
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,559
will become reserve members
of special forces.

492
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,080
Members of other groups

493
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,879
are still on wilderness survival test.

494
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,320
When you arrive later,
you can prepare first.

495
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,440
Squad Leader, it's free combination
of three people.

496
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:02,311
The three of us are
sitting in a car now.

497
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,080
That already makes us a team,
doesn't it?

498
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,800
What about Zi Jian and Gao Zhun?

499
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,879
Never mind them.

500
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,119
They and Xiao Fei are
from the same hometown.

501
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,160
-They are already complicit with him.
-That's right.

502
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,720
Yan Po Yue,
you're from the headquarters.

503
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,320
Are you willing to form a team with me?

504
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,000
Sir, what are you talking about?

505
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,318
You're treating him like an outsider.

506
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:25,239
Yan hasn't been in the
headquarters that long.

507
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,400
Right, Yan? Say something.

508
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,120
Sir, I'm willing to fight alongside you.

509
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,560
That sounds so touching.

510
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,439
Fine, but I have a request.

511
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,800
You must listen to my command
in all your actions.

512
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,680
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

513
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,080
I mean, about yesterday,

514
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,720
you can't tell anyone.

515
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,240
Copy that, sir.

516
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,959
Go on. Take them to freshen up.

517
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,840
Yes, sir.

518
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,480
Wake up. We're here.

519
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,640
-Captain.
-You're back.

520
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:41,920
You can go.

521
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,200
How did it go? How many are left?

522
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,480
Six.

523
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,799
What happened?

524
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,680
Didn't I make it clear?
I just want three men.

525
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,720
What's wrong?
You got off on the wrong foot?

526
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,400
I let my guard down and got ambushed.

527
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,360
They managed to ambush our
Squadron Leader Lu Tu.

528
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,401
Interesting.

529
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,360
Special forces' weapons are so cool.

530
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,919
The best soldier deserves the best gun.

531
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,249
If I can join special forces,

532
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,175
I'd love to live in this armoury.

533
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,479
Give me this sniper,

534
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,597
and I can hit the target
at 500 meters farther.

535
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,640
Right. Keep bluffing.

536
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,921
Whatever.

537
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,840
Zi Jian, Gao Zhun.

538
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:37,527
Squad Leader.

539
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,400
You both heard about
the selection rules, right?

540
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,360
Three person a team,
competing against one another.

541
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:43,279
Sir,

542
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,910
actually we've discussed
about this in the car.

543
00:37:46,313 --> 00:37:47,873
We're going to team up
with Squad Leader Xiao.

544
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,559
We just haven't got
a chance to tell you.

545
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
Here's the thing, sir.

546
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,680
We and Squad Leader Xiao
are from the same hometown.

547
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,799
That's why we...

548
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,080
I have no problem with
whoever you want to team up with.

549
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,519
Squad Leader Xiao.

550
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,040
Zi Jian and Gao Zhun are
soldiers of Special Service.

551
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,160
Please look after them.

552
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,600
Listen up.

553
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
You all

554
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,560
have GPS digital maps on you.

555
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,880
It can locate and display yours

556
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,880
and your teammates' locations.

557
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,320
And it has pinned the location of
the central area you need to go to.

558
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,480
The moment you step out of
the troop carrier,

559
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,320
get into mutual attack mode instantly.

560
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,600
The smoke pack on the eliminated
personnel will emit red smoke.

561
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,280
You all didn't bring enough food.

562
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,560
So,

563
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,800
our drone will drop
some supplies periodically.

564
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,287
After the supply lands,

565
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,961
it will emit blue smoke.

566
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,640
And of course,

567
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,840
whether you can get it
depends on your ability.

568
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:46,479
48 hours later,

569
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,160
we will pick up the two groups

570
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,199
that make it till the end
in the central area.

571
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,680
Am I clear?

572
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,800
Yes, sir!

573
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,000
Chen Dian.

574
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,920
Yes, sir!

575
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,399
Get ready to board the car
and head to the site.

576
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,320
Yes, sir!

577
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,639
All participants will be sent

578
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,040
to different starting points.

579
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,760
On my command.

580
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,520
All of you, right face!

581
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,360
Board the car!

582
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,520
Oh my!

583
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,040
It looks so real.

584
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,440
It's like shooting a movie.

585
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,680
It is real.

586
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,600
It's a real battle.

587
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,640
Yan Po Yue, check our current location.

588
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,160
We are 5 km from the central area.

589
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,160
Get moving!

590
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,960
Get moving!

591
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,440
The building at six o'clock

592
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,600
has an open view and
is suitable for concealment.

593
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,080
Turn your communicator to channel one.

594
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,760
Yan Po Yue, find a high point
to keep a lookout.

595
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,479
Search nearby buildings,
confirm its security.

596
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,400
Yes, sir!

597
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,159
Shots fired at seven o'clock.

598
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,080
Yun Jie, I'll guard the window.
I'll leave the door to you.

599
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:39,959
Yes, sir.

600
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:49,160
Sir, we have guests at one o'clock.
