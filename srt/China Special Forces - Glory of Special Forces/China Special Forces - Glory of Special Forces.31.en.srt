00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,040
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,100
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,520
(Episode 31)

4
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,440
The supply depot in the
west zone was ambushed.

5
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,120
All war equipment has been destroyed.

6
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:47,560
What is the current kill ratio?

7
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,559
10%.

8
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,360
It's only been six hours.

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,840
-Report, sir!
-What?

10
00:01:57,772 --> 00:01:58,572
Report, sir.

11
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,919
It's dinner time.

12
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,840
What are we having for dinner?

13
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:17,786
Roast beef with potatoes.

14
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,839
Stir-fried dried tofu.

15
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,240
Scrambled eggs with hot peppers.
Fried soybeans with pork skin.

16
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,119
Seaweed soup.

17
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,439
Good.

18
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,000
Serve the meal.

19
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,439
Why are you still standing there?

20
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
I said serve the meal.

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,920
Can we catch Three Shells Qin
alive on a hungry stomach?

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,279
Who is happiest if we don't eat?

23
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,041
Cheetah. Am I right?

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,440
Go on, distribute the dinner.

25
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,320
Let's eat.

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,869
Do not stress-eating.

27
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,022
Just eat until your
stomach is 50% full.

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,239
While you are eating,

29
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,999
I'd like to say a few words.

30
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,240
First of all,

31
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,720
do not panic.

32
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,320
Our absolute superior force...

33
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,840
is 25 times higher than the enemy's.

34
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:07,958
As long as we maintain our ground,

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,605
go head to head with them,
protect every inch of our land,

36
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:11,886
and persevere until the end,

37
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,800
victory will be ours!

38
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, sir!

39
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,960
Our drill this time,

40
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,445
they are not allies,

41
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:19,582
but enemies!

42
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,079
They are terrorists
who invaded our country.

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,679
We are the last resort of our people!

44
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,909
Even if we die,

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,563
we will still hold
our ground like nails!

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,001
Each team reports your kill ratio.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,921
Combat Team 1, no casualties.

48
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,639
Combat Team 2, three men down,
five men left.

49
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,399
Combat Team 3, no casualties.

50
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,720
Combat Team 4, four men down,
four men left.

51
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:44,253
You guys did well during the day,

52
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,881
but the kill ratio is a bit high.

53
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:52,953
Let's take a break. We'll eat now.

54
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:05,326
While you guys are eating,

55
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,159
I'm going to tell you a story.

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,040
Imagine this.

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
The enemy has invaded brazenly.

58
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,514
After years of battle,

59
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,479
both sides are exhausted.

60
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:19,522
According to intelligence,

61
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,336
the enemy's top brass
has decided to end the war

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
as soon as possible at all costs.

63
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:29,081
So, they set up

64
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,080
a biological weapons base
in deep mountains.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,000
They try to develop

66
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,007
a new type of biological weapon,

67
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:39,040
which would be
a fatal blow to our force.

68
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:42,200
This is when

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,880
the main characters
of the story come in.

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,321
And that's you guys.

71
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,399
You are up against a bio-weapon base

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,440
guarded by terrorists many times

73
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,119
higher than our force.

74
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,480
You must destroy

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,280
over 50% of this base,

76
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:03,679
so that the enemy won't be able to
resume production in a short time

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,200
and we have a chance of survival.

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,120
This is not a drill.

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
This is war.

80
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,240
It is a war that we must win,

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
even if we have to do whatever it takes

82
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,681
to poke a hole in the sky.

83
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:18,786
We must destroy, tear down

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,519
and wreck the enemy's barracks.

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,960
Next,

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,399
I'll assign new combat mission.

87
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,680
This is the enemy's barracks.

88
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,880
Team 1, 2 and 3,

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,342
you will gather in the east,
south and west respectively.

90
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,385
Four soldiers as the attack team,

91
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,519
two as sniper cover team,

92
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,990
two for the outer perimeter security.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Team 1,

94
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,360
your main mission,
destroy the enemy's fuel depot.

95
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,947
Team 2, destroy the
enemy's weapon depot.

96
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,967
Team 3,

97
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:53,953
your target is the
enemy's command centre.

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,240
You will behead all their

99
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,559
command personnel.

100
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,440
Team 4,

101
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,478
set up ambush formation
on the perimeter.

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,640
Before the general attack,

103
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,520
we'll destroy their electrical system

104
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,146
with graphite bombs.

105
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,280
Our night vision goggles
and laser pointers

106
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,801
are insulated.

107
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,408
But we have to turn off
our electronic scopes

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,657
and all electronic devices.

109
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,199
Once the enemy's electrical
system is destroyed by us,

110
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
the general attack begins.

111
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,759
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Next,

113
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,801
let's poke a hole in the sky!

114
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,479
Chief,

115
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,372
why don't you get in
the command car first?

116
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,079
It's just not safe to be here.

117
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,860
I'm the largest bait.

118
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:40,377
If I'm gone,

119
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,120
the cheetahs will smell it.

120
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,080
-What's going on?
-What happened?

121
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,600
Our enemy has not yet
shown himself. Sit down!

122
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,399
They launched
rain-proof anti-hail rocket.

123
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,920
The target isn't our base,

124
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:40,500
but in the rain clouds.

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Looks like the real
attack is about to begin.

126
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,640
This is bad.

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,600
It's graphite bomb.

128
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,680
What's going on?

129
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Activate the backup generator now!

130
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,600
-Report, sir.
-Speak.

131
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,280
Those rascals used graphite bombs
on our barracks.

132
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
The entire power supply
system of the barracks,

133
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,080
including the electrical system
of our vehicles has been burned.

134
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,520
Is this still a drill?

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,560
It's not like we killed their father.

136
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,200
Do they really need to go
to such extent to destroy us?

137
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,480
Pass my order verbally to all units.

138
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,522
Remain at their posts.
The enemy is coming!

139
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,400
Yes, sir!

140
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,119
Cheetah dispersed the clouds
with the anti-hail rocket,

141
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,759
and fired graphite thread with rocket.

142
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,640
Originally,

143
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,352
graphite thread would

144
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,080
suspend in the air
for more than ten hours

145
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,119
before it falls.

146
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,719
But after calculation,

147
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:22,239
they fired while the fog
was rising in our barracks

148
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,239
 and visibility was at its lowest.

149
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,560
Graphite threads accelerate their
descent when they encounter fog.

150
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,360
Through the interaction with the fog,

151
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,278
the threads made all the circuits

152
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,800
in our barracks burn out.

153
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,200
They are trying to create
an environment with

154
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,080
the lowest visibility, which is
best suited for melee combat.

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
I think you should hide first.

156
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,960
Don't let Three Shells Qin catch you.

157
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,285
He likes to play with
explosives and weather.

158
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
He is trying to take advantage
of the chaos he created.

159
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
And I'm going to empty this place.

160
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't worry.

161
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,960
It's a minefield out there.

162
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,280
They can't get in.

163
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,640
Go.

164
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,800
Alert! Alert! Cheetah is here!

165
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
(Teams, attack.)

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,880
Go!

167
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,920
Go.

168
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
Second floor, one o'clock.

169
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
(Keep pressing them.)

170
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,599
Go.

171
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
This is bad.

172
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,760
Take cover!

173
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,480
Attack team of Team 1
is scattered around nearby.

174
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,939
Team 2 was ambushed in the B-3 area.

175
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,720
Reinforcements are needed immediately.

176
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
On the tower.

177
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Sniper! Hang on tight, Yan!

178
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,520
Sniper at three o'clock.

179
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,760
Retreat.

180
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,080
Team 2, find the sniper.

181
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,520
Let's go to Team 2's sniper position.

182
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,400
Yes, sir!

183
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Let's shoot our way out!

184
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,920
Their fire is too heavy.

185
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,680
Go!

186
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,520
Go.

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,760
(Blue Team's ammunition depot
 is destroyed.)

188
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:29,641
(Good job.)

189
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,159
(Keep looking for fuel depot.)

190
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,560
Yan, hang on tight!

191
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,440
Yan, that's the command centre.

192
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,560
Let's go.

193
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,720
I'll draw their fire! Be careful, Yan!

194
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,400
Kill a few more of them!

195
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,201
A04 to A01.

196
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,440
Copy. Please speak.

197
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,880
Blue Team's mobile unit
is back on defence. Over.

198
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,280
Copy. Over.

199
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,680
Attention, all attack teams,

200
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,158
Blue Team's mobile unit
is back on defence.

201
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:45,479
All units retreat before they are
completely back on defence.

202
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,000
-Retreat!
-Cover!

203
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
Retreat!

204
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,240
Report, sir.

205
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,601
The tactical command centre is fake.

206
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,121
Halt!

207
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,639
What's going on?
Did I say all units retreat?

208
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:20,840
Who told you to get in?

209
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,360
(Retreat immediately.)

210
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,000
We're attacked by a lot of
blue soldiers here.

211
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,146
A01, rescue our soldiers.

212
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,320
B01, break out at three o'clock.
Draw fire.

213
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Copy that!

214
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,160
Go!

215
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:42,619
Go!

216
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,200
Be careful, go back!

217
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,320
Sniper team, hold back Blue Team's
defensive team. Buy us time!

218
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:50,872
Copy that!

219
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,640
They're here.

220
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,520
A01, A01,

221
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,320
our position has been compromised.
We're unable to provide fire support.

222
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,440
Please retreat now!

223
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,880
Retreat!

224
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,080
Grenade!

225
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,280
Reload.

226
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:43,447
Go!

227
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,040
Go!

228
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,599
(Communication equipment is broken,
we can't contact other teams.)

229
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,160
Stop!

230
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Stop!

231
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,240
Regiment Commander,

232
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,520
communication equipment
has been fixed.

233
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,400
Good job.

234
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
This is Liu Chuan Ming.

235
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,680
Do you read me?

236
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,040
Squadron 1 in appointed position.

237
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,689
Squadron 2 in appointed position.

238
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Squadron 3 in appointed position.

239
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,839
Report, sir. Special Service Squadron
in appointed position.

240
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,759
Round up the cheetahs!

241
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,280
Capture Three Shells Qin alive!

242
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,839
Turn the Cheetahs into kittens!

243
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,520
Capture Three Shells Qin alive!
Turn the Cheetahs into kittens!

244
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,439
Capture Three Shells Qin alive!
Turn the Cheetahs into kittens!

245
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,719
Capture Three Shells Qin alive!
Turn the Cheetahs into kittens!

246
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,000
Brothers, let's finish off Cheetah!

247
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,280
Yan Po Yue! Xiao Yun Jie!

248
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,439
The guys and I will cover you!

249
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,879
You two get ready to run!

250
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,950
We're not leaving without you.

251
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,920
We're Cheetah!

252
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,747
No. If we all retreat together,
it'll make us an open target.

253
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,479
I don't care how you're going
to do it, just get out of here!

254
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,239
Expand Blue Team's kill ratio
to the maximum. Got it?

255
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,921
Find their fuel depot.

256
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,600
Retreat!

257
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,120
Someone's coming. Stay alert.

258
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,359
Xiao Xiao. Xiao Xiao.

259
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,759
-What?
-Take it.

260
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:03,760
Take it.

261
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,480
I'll cover you.

262
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,440
Get out of here.

263
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
Judging by the situation,

264
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,800
it won't be possible for us both
to get out of here safely.

265
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,520
I've hit my 25 targets.

266
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,680
You haven't, right?

267
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:17,960
Hurry up and finish it.

268
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,560
Brothers of Blue Team,

269
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,479
I'm right here!

270
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,600
Charge!

271
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,119
Don't let Cheetah get away!

272
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,560
Mu Qing, draw fire!

273
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,520
I'll go from the back.

274
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,400
Got it.

275
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,240
Cover me!

276
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,640
There's no way to escape!

277
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,640
It's the fuel depot.

278
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,600
Advance.

279
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,600
Go after him!

280
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:44,987
Give me the gun.

281
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,200
Are you okay?

282
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,120
I'm fine.

283
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
Come on.

284
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,840
That was fun!

285
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,200
I still don't like you,

286
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,561
but

287
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,173
dying on a battlefield with you,

288
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,519
I don't hate it.

289
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,160
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

290
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,919
-Report, sir.
-Speak.

291
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,120
We've wiped out Red Team.

292
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,920
Three Shells Qin was
shot and eliminated too.

293
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,280
What is our kill ratio?

294
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,239
Still in the count.

295
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,239
Definitely not more than 40%.

296
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:46,686
We definitely won!

297
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,040
But it's not less than 35%, right?

298
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,240
A special forces squad with 32 personnel

299
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:07,012
against our combined rapid deployment
detachment with nearly 1,000 personnel.

300
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,600
They actually caused
35% of our battle damage.

301
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,800
And this is just a drill.

302
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
If this was a real battle,

303
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,200
if our opponent was
a batch of enemies like them,

304
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,400
and both sides chose
to fight until death,

305
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
given that this example
couldn't be replicated,

306
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,319
think about how much time,

307
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,920
effort and blood we must be put in

308
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,880
to defeat them.

309
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,840
I have to say,

310
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,321
quality over quantity.

311
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:31,600
They did it.

312
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,560
Three Shells Qin.

313
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,200
Captain Qin.

314
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,681
How come you're dead?

315
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,481
It's too soon.

316
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,560
Come on.

317
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,441
Put your hands together
for the brothers of Red Team.

318
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,160
You did not

319
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,800
lose in this drill.

320
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
Cheetah will never lose.

321
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,160
What makes you say that?

322
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,520
1 to 37.5.

323
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,920
Ten minutes into the battle,

324
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,320
and I exceeded my target.

325
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,920
Liu,

326
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,961
a friendly reminder,

327
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,680
do a head count again.

328
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,240
The drill isn't over yet.

329
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,680
29.

330
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,240
There are three missing.

331
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,800
How did you do the head count?

332
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:43,320
Sorry, Chief.

333
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,840
According to the rules of this drill,

334
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,359
Red Team must inflict 50%

335
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,079
heavy loss on Blue Team

336
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,280
to win this drill.

337
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,920
I made a rough estimation.

338
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:13,439
Even after you used graphite bombs

339
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,280
to destroy our electrical system,

340
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,719
you've only caused 38% of damage.

341
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,720
You have three people left.

342
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,041
No matter how good they are,

343
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,200
how are they capable of

344
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,320
causing 12% of damage to us?

345
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,440
12%? It's simple.

346
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,738
I've made arrangement.

347
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,640
At this point,

348
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:35,598
if I don't tell you,

349
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,319
you must think I'm bragging.

350
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,520
But if I tell you,

351
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,720
it seems to be against
the rules of the drill.

352
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:44,301
How about this?

353
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,680
Liu, I'll only tell you.

354
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,020
Whether these three soldiers

355
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,199
can cause 12% of damage to you,

356
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,319
it's up to you to judge.

357
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,320
I'm curious.

358
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
How are you going to do that?

359
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,520
What do you think, Liu?

360
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,360
Are you surprised?

361
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,520
Eight captains and vice captains

362
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:27,873
had these bombs on them.

363
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,120
If this were a real one,

364
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,921
it would be filled with
80 high explosives

365
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
made of a mixture of TNT and RDX.

366
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,960
Effective killing radius
of more than ten meters.

367
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,520
Sorry, guys.

368
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:40,759
You guys are dead.

369
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,920
You're now corpses.

370
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
This is against the rule.

371
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,681
Who says you can't put
a bomb on a corpse?

372
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:48,839
You kept saying that you wanted
to catch Three Shells Qin alive.

373
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,280
Well, you couldn't catch me alive.

374
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,878
Now that I'm dead,

375
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,040
you top commanders would come here

376
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,521
to identify my body.

377
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,793
Also,

378
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,560
who came up with the slogan
of turn the Cheetahs into kittens?

379
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,280
Doesn't that tell me clearly about

380
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,038
the importance you place
on the fruits of victory?

381
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,479
So, my final blow is I bet that

382
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,559
you would come here

383
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,320
to confirm the fruits of victory.

384
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,639
Cheetah could still bite

385
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,560
even when it becomes a corpse.

386
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,000
Three Shells,

387
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,997
I have to admit that

388
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I let you take advantage
of my curiosity and vanity.

389
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,040
According to the rules,

390
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,119
as the top commander of Blue Team,

391
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,440
my life is worth 3%.

392
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,599
Plus all our officers within your

393
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,160
effective killing radius.

394
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,319
You've exceeded 40%.

395
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
But let me remind you,

396
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,960
the drill isn't over yet.

397
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,560
Sun Ning!

398
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,720
Yes, sir!

399
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,480
You are now the top commander

400
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,999
of Blue Team.

401
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,359
Rest assured, Chief,

402
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:56,638
I will lead Blue Team

403
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
to win the final victory!

404
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,600
Liu,

405
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,040
he can leave,

406
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,971
but you can't.

407
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,779
Cheetah, let's put our
hands together for him.

408
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,029
The detachment commanders
touched the enemy's booby trap,

409
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,120
all of them are dead.

410
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,280
I'm Operations Staff Officer, Sun Ning.

411
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,034
I will now take over command.

412
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,300
There are still remnants of enemy

413
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:25,982
on the battlefield,

414
00:31:26,695 --> 00:31:28,278
so our final task is to

415
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,439
wipe them all out.

416
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,493
-Am I right?
-Yes, sir!

417
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,635
I can't hear you!

418
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,720
Yes, sir!

419
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:36,295
According to our intelligence,

420
00:31:36,376 --> 00:31:37,583
the Red Team soldiers that got away

421
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,587
are Yan Po Yue,

422
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,881
Xiao Yue Jie,

423
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,280
and a spotter, Guo Xiao Xiao.

424
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,319
Both Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie

425
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,920
once served in our company.

426
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,600
Those who were in the same
squad with them, step out of the line.

427
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,360
Okay.

428
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,720
I am sure

429
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,614
you know the enemy

430
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,760
better than others.

431
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,389
-Zhou Zi Jian.
-Yes, sir.

432
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,559
-How many men have your squad lost?
-Report, sir. Six men.

433
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,880
Pick some men from other squads,

434
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,000
make up for the men that you lost,

435
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,080
-form a 15-man operational team.
-Yes, sir.

436
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,119
Let me ask you, when they
were in the same squad with you,

437
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,960
compared to your training performance,

438
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,920
-were they any good?
-Report, sir!

439
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,041
-They are both stronger than me!
-Shut up!

440
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,200
Keep this in mind, your individual
comprehensive strength

441
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,200
is better than both of them together.

442
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,719
Everyone in the team you lead is

443
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,761
stronger than the three of them.

444
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,679
The three of them are now spent force.

445
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,797
They can only rely on
guerrilla warfare to disrupt us.

446
00:32:40,086 --> 00:32:42,127
Ignore their tricks.

447
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,880
No matter what situation you encounter,

448
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:46,400
you must take advantage of
your strength and fight steadily.

449
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:47,881
Launch frontal attack against them.

450
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,280
Don't take risk, don't be greedy
for credits and don't be discouraged.

451
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,560
This way, you can suppress
their survival space little by little

452
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:58,800
until they become caged rats.

453
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,439
Is that clear?

454
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,360
Yes, sir!

455
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:04,387
-Gao Zhun!
-Yes, sir!

456
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,948
Pick the best comrades

457
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,451
from your own company.

458
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,292
Form a 15-man combat team as well.

459
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,079
The team led by Zhou Zi Jian
will launch frontal attack,

460
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:16,319
and your team will encircle them.

461
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,600
We'll keep Yan Po Yue on the run
until he gets exhausted.

462
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:20,400
I'd like to see how long Yan Po Yue

463
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,719
can last under this high-intensity

464
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,840
combat environment.

465
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,800
Yes, sir!

466
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,320
-Zhang Tian Yang!
-Yes, sir!

467
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,839
Pick 15 of the best snipers
from the detachment

468
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,441
to form a sniper squad.

469
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,920
I don't care what method you use,

470
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,319
you must restrain Guo Xiao Xiao,
the sniper with Yan Po Yue,

471
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,480
so she can't shoot easily anymore.

472
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,680
Yes, sir.

473
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:43,000
After so many days of rain,

474
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:44,213
the ground is muddy.

475
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,028
No matter how careful Yan Po Yue

476
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,896
and Xiao Yun Jie are,

477
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,159
it is impossible for them
to erase all the traces

478
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
they left along the way.

479
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:52,933
These are the three of them.

480
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,280
Zi Jian, execute long-range raid
with your team,

481
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,599
be right on their tail.

482
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,945
Force them to be on the run
all the time and have no place to hide,

483
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:00,727
keep them exposed on the battlefield.

484
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,760
Yes, sir.

485
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,960
Gao Zhun.

486
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,840
Yes, sir.

487
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,560
While they start running around
in circles in the mountains,

488
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,760
trying to get rid of Zi Jian's team,

489
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,839
you will lead your team

490
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,478
to move slowly along the centre.

491
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:11,079
Choose the most suitable time,

492
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,279
the most suitable location,

493
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,159
and trap them there.

494
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:17,764
-Yes, sir.
-I'll split sniper squad into teams.

495
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,120
A team of three.

496
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,239
There will be five teams.

497
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,440
Scatter around them.

498
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,109
The best team

499
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,599
will move in tandem with you, Zi Jian.

500
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,919
You'll attack on two different fronts.

501
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,165
The other four teams

502
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,800
will be assigned to
different sniping position.

503
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:30,974
You will carry out fixed point sniping,

504
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,639
with the primary objective of
killing the sniper of Red Team.

505
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,600
Yes, sir!

506
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,679
All rise!

507
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:41,585
You are the best shooters
in the detachment.

508
00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:43,476
They have only three persons,

509
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,495
and one of them is female soldier.

510
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,598
Two special company teams
plus a sniper squad

511
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,918
against three cheetahs.

512
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,601
If we can't kill the target

513
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:52,834
by tonight,

514
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:54,513
it will be a failure for all of us.

515
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,184
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

516
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,960
Set out!

517
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,440
Squad Leader,

518
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,640
we're being open target now,
aren't you afraid of their sniper?

519
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:06,846
Didn't you hear what Zhang say?

520
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,440
He is leading a three-man sniper team.

521
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,358
They're 200 to 300 meters away
from us on the right flank of our team.

522
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,959
The second their sniper shoots us,

523
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,439
our snipers, who aren't walking with us,

524
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,239
will find their hiding place instantly

525
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,039
and shoot them.

526
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,080
What if their sniper
shoot our snipers first?

527
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,520
Once they shoot one sniper,

528
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,600
the other two will hide.

529
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,680
It's two against one.
We still outnumber them.

530
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,524
And we can engage in
stand-off with their sniper.

531
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,464
Besides, we would also rush
over to support our snipers.

532
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,382
If their sniper doesn't retreat from
the stand-off, she'll still be dead.

533
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:31,485
Sweet.

534
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,719
Let's speed up.

535
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,360
There are snipers.

536
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,640
There is more than one.

537
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,880
Can Xiao Xiao handle it?

538
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,999
We'll create opportunity.

539
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,520
It's an outbreak minefield. Retreat.

540
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,320
Sniper!

541
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,400
Cover Xiao Xiao!

542
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,921
Team 2, two o'clock.

543
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,320
Advance 200 meters.

544
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,880
Squad Leader,

545
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,719
we're in stalemate.

546
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,600
What should we do?

547
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,200
There is only one
sniper on the other side.

548
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,280
As long as we put pressure
on Yan Po Yue and Xiao Yun Jie,

549
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,480
she'll cover them.

550
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,200
You few,

551
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
get around the minefield!

552
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,240
Yes, sir!

553
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,440
Yan Po Yue,

554
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,400
haven't you made any progress in
Cheetah over the past few years?

555
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,705
Did you learn anything?

556
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,000
Why do I feel that
you're worse than before?

557
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,840
Where is your fierceness from when
you stuck me with a wooden gun?

558
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,320
Cover!

559
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
Are you mad that I said that?

560
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,640
Come out if you dare!

561
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,480
Don't just shoot at trees.

562
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,800
One shot.

563
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
Just one more shot from you.

564
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Yan Po Yue, would you
like me to say more?

565
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,880
Got you.

566
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,960
West 15.

567
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:09,999
Go after her.

568
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,599
Their sniper has been exposed.

569
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,640
-Leave her to Squad Leader Zhang.
-Yes, sir.

570
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,120
Let's unite our strength with Gao Zhun,

571
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,880
and take down Yan Po Yue
and Xiao Yue Jie.

572
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,720
Go!

573
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,510
This won't do.

574
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,560
We're trapped.

575
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,760
We still have a smoke bomb.
Let's throw it out to buy us some time.

576
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,840
Okay.

577
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:14,879
Let's get rid of them.

578
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,200
I'll meet you down the estuary.

579
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,560
This seems to be snapped off on purpose.

580
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,040
Take cover!

581
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,200
Darn it, we walked into a trap.

582
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,880
The shots that exposed her position.

583
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,840
(First shot, west 30.)

584
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,640
(Second shot, west 15.)

585
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,360
(The third shot was fired
close to 300 meters.)

586
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,200
(The shooting range
that met these points)

587
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,399
(requires the right angle and cover.)

588
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
(From this distance,)

589
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,360
(I still have the chance to
fire twice within 0.5 seconds.)

590
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,881
Team 1,

591
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,399
advance 80 meters.

592
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,199
Team 2 and 3,

593
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,040
advance 150 meters.

594
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:32,397
Team 4 and 5,

595
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,959
advance 150 meters.

596
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,880
All stay low when you move.

597
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,080
Over.

598
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,880
Zhou Zhou.

599
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,361
You got killed by me.

600
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:01,854
It's not bad, right?

601
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,400
Xiao Yun Jie,

602
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,680
that's quite a trick.

603
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,160
But is one life for one life
really necessary?

604
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,079
Is it worth it?

605
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,440
It is.

606
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,440
It's totally worth it.

607
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,721
Besides,

608
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:16,926
it's not one-for-one.

609
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,157
It's 25 to 1.

610
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,840
You happened to be my last victim.

611
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:20,719
I...

612
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,759
Zhou Zi Jian,

613
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,719
you're bad-tempered, and your
performance isn't very good too,

614
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,320
but we wouldn't underestimate you.

615
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,280
Once you're eliminated,

616
00:41:32,477 --> 00:41:34,000
Yan would have
a better chance of survival.

617
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,200
As long as he's still alive,

618
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:36,167
we'll win.

619
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:37,925
Thank you for praising me.

620
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,440
You're welcome.

621
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,041
Most importantly,

622
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:43,071
do you know why I'm telling you so much?

623
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,360
What are you looking at?

624
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,719
Let me see.

625
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,009
So much time has passed.

626
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,720
I wonder how far Yan has run.

627
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,000
-What are you waiting for? Go after him!
-Go! Go!

628
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,239
Go! Go!

629
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,840
You're unbelievable, Xiao Yun Jie.

630
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,560
Zhou Zhou.

631
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,480
Let go.

632
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,161
Stay away from me.

633
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,040
-Report, sir.
-Speak.

634
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,600
Ammunition depot in the west zone was
ambushed, but the damage isn't serious.

635
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,360
The enemy's goal was
to steal the ammunition.

636
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
How much did they stole?

637
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,479
Still counting,
communication is intermittent.

638
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,320
What is the kill ratio at the moment?

639
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,439
Rough estimation, 43%.

640
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,399
♫ The sun sets in the west
painting the sky red ♫

641
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,318
♫ Soldiers hit the target
and return the barracks ♫

642
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Get your hands off me.

643
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,520
So petty.

644
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,680
I haven't had a hot meal in days.

645
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,159
I wonder what we're having today.

646
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,599
Why are you so full of crap?

647
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,600
Can you just shut up?

648
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,360
This is my style.
