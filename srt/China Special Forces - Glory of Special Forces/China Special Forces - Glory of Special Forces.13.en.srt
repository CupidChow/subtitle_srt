1
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,080
(Glory of Special Forces)

2
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,000
(This series is Shanghai's
major literary and artistic project)

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,840
(Episode 13)

4
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,720
I'm begging you!

5
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,120
I'll do anything as long as
you don't suspend my training.

6
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,600
You're back. Is everything okay?

7
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,881
Where are the others?

8
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
Political science class.

9
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
You haven't eaten, right?

10
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
You must be starving.

11
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,800
I've saved you dinner.

12
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,838
It's all your favourite dishes.

13
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,320
It'll cheer you up.

14
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,919
Gao Zhun and Zhou Zi Jian

15
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,080
think it's too dangerous
to live with us.

16
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,920
Actually, they are

17
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
just afraid that
we would beat them up.

18
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:59,120
So, they requested to change room.

19
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,280
This is great.

20
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,160
Now that they're gone. It's peaceful.

21
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,960
They're out of sight,
we won't be bothered anymore.

22
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
Here. Dig in.

23
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,001
Xiao,

24
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,079
I'm fine, right?

25
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,799
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

26
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:34,263
Of course you are fine.

27
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,680
Look at you, you are as strong as an ox.

28
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
Listen up!

29
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,406
In accordance to the regiment's order,

30
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,868
I will now announce

31
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,120
the list of participants for
the special forces selection.

32
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,640
There are four soldiers
from our company.

33
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,840
-Zhang Tian Yang.
-Here!

34
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:12,512
Xiao Yun Jie.

35
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:13,393
Here!

36
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:15,964
Zhou Zi Jian.

37
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Here!

38
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,960
Gao Zhun.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Here!

40
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:22,183
The four of you

41
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:25,702
will represent Special Service
in the special forces selection.

42
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,278
I hope you will carry forward
the spirit of the tiger.

43
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,440
Make your company proud,
make your regiment proud.

44
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,321
Report!

45
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,359
Speak.

46
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Why am I not included?

47
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,080
Yan Po Yue.

48
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,760
Step out of the line.

49
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
Come with me.

50
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,118
Instructor,

51
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:57,320
I came first in all my training.

52
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,160
I'm perfectly healthy!

53
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,760
Why won't you let me go?

54
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,200
Sit down first, have a glass of water.

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,960
I don't want water!
And I don't want to sit!

56
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,400
I just want to
participate in the selection!

57
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,801
It's just a selection.

58
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:16,733
Don't take it too seriously.

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,361
I joined the army

60
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,520
just to achieve this goal!

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,920
People can have many goals in life.

62
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
When you think it through,

63
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
you can set another goal.

64
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,760
Going to the selection is one path,

65
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
being a correspondent for
Regiment Commander

66
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,164
is a better path to go.

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,241
I'm not going!

68
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,920
This is an order.

69
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,480
Being a correspondent for
Regiment Commander is a great job.

70
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,200
Other people don't even
have this chance.

71
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,400
This is Regiment Commander's order?

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
You think anyone can be
Regiment Commander's correspondent?

73
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,119
Go back and pack your things.

74
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,200
I'll take you to his office tomorrow.

75
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,360
Yan Po Yue...

76
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,080
Instructor,

77
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,760
please,

78
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,680
let someone else go.

79
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,479
Yan Po Yue,

80
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
with your current medical condition,

81
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,200
this is the best possible arrangement
the regiment can get for you.

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
To tell you the truth,

83
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
soldiers who have
the same condition you have

84
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,120
are arranged for early discharge.

85
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
At least this way,

86
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
you can stay in the army.

87
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:44,040
Yan? Yan?

88
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:45,399
I need to use the toilet now.

89
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,600
Can you open the door?

90
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
Yan?

91
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
Open the door, Yan.

92
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,120
Yan?

93
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,920
Yan?

94
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Get out of the way.

95
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Yan Po Yue?

96
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,160
Yan Po Yue?

97
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,880
This is insubordination, you know?

98
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,040
This is a disgrace to our company,

99
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,160
to Special Service.

100
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
-Yan, open the door.
-Come out.

101
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,120
-What's going on?
-Open the door.

102
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,879
Company Commander.

103
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,239
-Company Commander.
-Company Commander.

104
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,200
Company Commander,

105
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
he's been in there after dark.

106
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,760
He locked the door from the inside
and wouldn't come out.

107
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,559
Yan Po Yue,

108
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,599
you're too old to be
acting like a child.

109
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,640
Come out now!

110
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,001
It's useless, sir.
We've called for him a long time.

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,559
Yan Po Yue,

112
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,837
do you have any idea
what the situation is?

113
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,280
Regiment Commander is waiting
for you in the office.

114
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,239
Why are you standing there?
Push open the door.

115
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,039
Yes, sir.

116
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,333
Push harder!

117
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,200
Instructor, the door is locked
from inside. It's impossible.

118
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,280
Let me try it!

119
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,239
Zi Jian, hurry.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Vice Squad Leader!

121
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,239
Are you okay?

122
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,959
Instructor, this door is too sturdy.

123
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,599
-Po Yue.
-Too sturdy.

124
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,040
Zi Jian failed to break down the door,

125
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
I'll be the next to try.

126
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,239
If I get hurt,

127
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,839
you'll have to take me
to the hospital later.

128
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,479
Get some tools to pry the door open.

129
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
-Wait!
-Yan Po Yue.

130
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,382
Those who want to use the toilet,

131
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:15,720
go to the next building.

132
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,280
The rest, back to your room!

133
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:18,833
Let's go.

134
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,840
You two, go back.

135
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,960
Company Commander.

136
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,840
Open the door.

137
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,640
Yan Po Yue...

138
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,045
Go back.

139
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,920
Just go.

140
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,560
Just go.

141
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,440
Go.

142
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
(Toilet)

143
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,320
Yan Po Yue,

144
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,040
there is only me now.

145
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:02,340
Tell me

146
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,441
why.

147
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,240
It's unfair.

148
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
Remember the blood
that was thrown at you?

149
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:20,652
No matter how hard you trained,

150
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,860
if you get killed with
a single shot on the battlefield

151
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,240
before you get a chance to play hero,

152
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
do you think

153
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:29,318
that is fair?

154
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:32,503
If that's my fate,

155
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,799
I'll accept it.

156
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,160
What you want to do,
you have to get it done.

157
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,960
And if you can't get it done,
you'll die.

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,720
If that's the case, how many times
you will have to die then?

159
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,520
The attack on the post didn't kill you.

160
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,880
The pursuit at the border
didn't kill you.

161
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,120
But being a correspondent

162
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,080
will kill you?

163
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,360
You even locked yourself up.

164
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
Let the people outside

165
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,560
see your dignity.

166
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
This door is your dignity.

167
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,960
I can't let it go.

168
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,559
When the veterans called me Psycho King,
I couldn't let it go too.

169
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:27,469
But

170
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,200
I came around,

171
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,960
and I was even a little proud of it.

172
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,920
How did you come around?

173
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,720
The stricter they think I am,

174
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,920
the happier I am.

175
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,400
Because that's the only way

176
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,600
I can train a group of fine soldiers.

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,679
If your company commander is a softy,

178
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,160
will you still put your life at risk
and follow his order?

179
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,640
Do you really think

180
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,640
this door can stop me?

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,200
But today,

182
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,600
I don't want to open this door.

183
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,639
Because you see it

184
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,720
as your dignity.

185
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,200
I can't bring myself to do it.

186
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,040
In front of the boundary pillar,

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,040
you told me to stand up straight
and never bend down,

188
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,520
to guard the border of our land.

189
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,160
I won't be able to do it anymore.

190
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,480
But you remembered it.

191
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,000
And I believe that

192
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,680
you will remember it

193
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,360
forever.

194
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm leaving too,

195
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,520
just like you.

196
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,920
You have a whole life ahead of you.

197
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,760
We leave this battlefield,

198
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,920
and go to the next one.

199
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,400
We all have to get used to it.

200
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,320
Remember,

201
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,880
Secret Service is a gun,

202
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,400
you are a bullet.

203
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,360
All along the road are scenery.

204
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,520
You have to fly all
the way to the target.

205
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,280
The 10th ring.

206
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,520
I want you to hit the 10th ring.

207
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,719
Can you do it?

208
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,480
One, two, one.

209
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,360
One, two, three, four.

210
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:14,640
One, two, three, four.

211
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
(I've walked this road countless times.)

212
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,200
(It has now become a string.)

213
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,000
(A string that connects me
to Special Service).

214
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,760
(I'm on one end,)

215
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,440
(Special Service is on the other.)

216
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,159
Faster!

217
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,800
Pick up the pace!

218
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,480
Keep going! Why did you stop?

219
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,440
You can't practice alone?

220
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,760
I'm taking a break.

221
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,720
You see Yan Po Yue as your friend.

222
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,640
Has he even given you a call
after he went to the office?

223
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,400
Zhou Zi Jian!

224
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,720
That's right!

225
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,839
When I ran into him in
the commissary the other day,

226
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
he turned around to avoid me
when he saw me.

227
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,468
Our squad leader got hurt

228
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,640
trying to save him.

229
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,640
Xiao Yun Jie, you're a smart guy.

230
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,400
All the participants in
our company are here.

231
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,960
You should know better

232
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,560
from now on.

233
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Are you done?

234
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,320
Little Buddy, let's have a 5km race.

235
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
-The loser will wash the winner's shoe.
-You're on. Don't cheat!

236
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,720
Pick it up!

237
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,120
Come with me.

238
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,000
Help me massage my legs.

239
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,240
Down, further down.

240
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,160
That's it.

241
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Press harder.

242
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,172
Stop massaging like a girl.

243
00:17:14,797 --> 00:17:15,757
Harder.

244
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,520
Lie back down.

245
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,480
Sir,

246
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,960
you can stop.

247
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,641
It's bad if anybody sees this.

248
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,280
You're my soldier.

249
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,600
Who else but me can do this?

250
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,368
This brat here?

251
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
He doesn't know how to do this.

252
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:31,214
He may hurt your muscle.

253
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,400
Sir, I know what I'm doing.

254
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,560
Of course you do.

255
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,940
You won't be my soldier if you don't.

256
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,720
Zhang Tian Yang,

257
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:42,519
tell me,

258
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:44,526
you've just recovered,

259
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,120
won't intense training affect your body?

260
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:49,326
Sir, I'm really fine.

261
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,320
You're fine?

262
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,119
How much longer can you push
yourself just by relying on will?

263
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:53,935
Let me tell you,

264
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,102
always remember that

265
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:58,440
body is the foundation of everything.

266
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,599
This chance didn't come easily.

267
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:03,078
And the places are limited.

268
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
I came from a village.

269
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,039
I'm going to be discharged next year.

270
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,280
If I don't give my all this time,

271
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,640
there will be no next time.

272
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,920
There may be no next time,

273
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,040
but there is still the rest of life.

274
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,800
How will you feel

275
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,480
if you end up having disability?

276
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,696
I don't want to embarrass you

277
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,120
and our company.

278
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:32,160
Xiao Yun Jie.

279
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,040
Yes, sir.

280
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,519
Take him to the medical unit
for infrared therapy.

281
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,440
Yes, sir.

282
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:37,481
It's fine, sir.

283
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:38,720
It's good for you!

284
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,760
Go!

285
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,480
Hold on.

286
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Did Yan Po Yue

287
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,320
contact you?

288
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,960
No.

289
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
Staff Officer Ai.

290
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,800
How are you adjusting?

291
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,760
Everything is good.

292
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:51,720
Now that there is no more training,

293
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm quite at my leisure.

294
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,400
Big boy, you're eating so little.

295
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,160
It's enough for me, sir.

296
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,681
I don't need to train anymore.

297
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,001
I don't need to eat much.

298
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,080
(Regiment Commander is a busy man.)

299
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,320
(He needs to inspect the post,)

300
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,760
(watch the place everyday.)

301
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
(I'm busy too.)

302
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,800
(Sweeping and mopping the floor,)

303
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,320
(sending and receiving mail,
sorting newspapers,)

304
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,400
(the only thing that is missing
is training.)

305
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
(Many soldiers envy me.)

306
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,320
(But I'm nothing)

307
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,520
(after I leave the battlefield.)

308
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,760
Young man, you've been here
for almost a month, right?

309
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:09,919
Yes, sir.

310
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,920
How do you feel?

311
00:22:14,907 --> 00:22:18,266
Do you want the truth or the lie, sir?

312
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,960
What's the lie?

313
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,640
The lie is I feel bad.

314
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:27,360
What's the truth?

315
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,560
I feel really terrible.

316
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,481
Do you know what it means

317
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,641
to be my correspondent?

318
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,880
Yes.

319
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:41,559
Your previous two correspondents

320
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,720
got into military school.

321
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,440
They'll be cadres in the future.

322
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,040
I pick only the best soldier

323
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,000
to be my correspondent.

324
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,720
I just want to be the best soldier.

325
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,655
I don't want to be a correspondent.

326
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,520
I know.

327
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,160
You came from a military family

328
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,840
and you were groomed to be soldier.

329
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,081
If you wanted to be a cadre,

330
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,683
you wouldn't have joined our regiment.

331
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,560
How about this?

332
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,440
I'll give you another option.

333
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,440
I can recommend you to the guard unit
in the division headquarters.

334
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:12,480
Would you like that?

335
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:19,802
Sir,

336
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,440
the pattern of human warfare

337
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,320
from ancient times to the present

338
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,320
is categorized into four major stages.

339
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,720
The first stage, cold weapon era.

340
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,642
Second, hot weapon era.

341
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:32,548
Third, nuclear weapon era.

342
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,559
And fourth, information warfare era.

343
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,039
You brat, are you testing me?

344
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,000
I wouldn't dare to.

345
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,200
I just want to elaborate on

346
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,240
the significance of the work
of guards in these four stages.

347
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,440
Okay. Lay it on me.

348
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,240
In the cold weapon era,

349
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,840
in order to protect
the commander-in-chief,

350
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:54,721
the guards used their physical strength.

351
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,282
In the hot weapon era,

352
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,921
the guards needed to engage in
fierce battles with enemy forces

353
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:00,762
and protect the command post
from the siege.

354
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,481
In nuclear weapon era and
information warfare era,

355
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:03,560
with the help of
internet communications,

356
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,800
command post no longer
needs to be on the frontline.

357
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:06,841
And the guards' job

358
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:08,802
is just to set up a perimeter

359
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:09,841
around the command post,

360
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:11,363
keeping outsiders out.

361
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:12,882
Once the command post is exposed,

362
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:14,361
the enemy's missiles will attack.

363
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,440
Guards don't play much of a role at all.

364
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,120
Sir, I want to be on the attacking team,

365
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:21,440
not on the passive team,

366
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
and I don't want to be away
from the battlefield.

367
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,680
So you're just trying to say that

368
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:32,200
you still want to participate
in the special forces selection.

369
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,200
I want to join the special forces!

370
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,680
Fine.

371
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,920
Let's say you go to the selection

372
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:51,802
and pass,

373
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,520
do you know what awaits you?

374
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,240
-Yes.
-No, you don't!

375
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:01,882
There you will receive
the most brutal training.

376
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:04,319
You'll face the highest elimination,

377
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
fatality and disability rates
during training.

378
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:07,461
I know that.

379
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,360
Okay.

380
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:10,441
Even if you try your best and pass,

381
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:12,282
you will continue to train hard

382
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:13,961
day and night in a little-known place,

383
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,281
always stand ready to carry out
the most difficult tasks,

384
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:17,761
face the most powerful opponents

385
00:25:17,762 --> 00:25:19,002
and the test of life and death.

386
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:20,481
-I can handle it.
-You can?

387
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,930
If you die,

388
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,516
except the troops,
no one will know your name,

389
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
no one will know what you've done.

390
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,001
Brat,

391
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,560
there is a fork in the road
ahead of you.

392
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,240
If you choose to stay,

393
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,120
you will become a promising cadre
in Rapid Deployment Brigade.

394
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,560
If you choose to leave,

395
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,680
it means that you will always remain in

396
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,800
an offensive stance in
the first half of your life.

397
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:49,481
You will have to keep the
mentality of advance or die.

398
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:50,642
Everyday, you'll train
as hard as you can,

399
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,920
run faster than the people around you!

400
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:54,682
Always keep yourself at the peak!

401
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,520
If you aren't ready for that,

402
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,360
I hope you won't make
this decision easily!

403
00:25:58,441 --> 00:25:59,321
Sir, I know that...

404
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:02,002
Also, the army needs the best soldier,

405
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:04,280
not a killing machine.

406
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,520
Take a half-day off.

407
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,240
Ai Qian Xue will take you to a place.

408
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:25,481
She went through a lot of trouble

409
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,359
to help you.

410
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,320
No matter what you see later,

411
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:42,282
(Mental Ward)
don't be surprised.

412
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:48,721
It's the cannon ball!
It's the cannon ball!

413
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,961
Get down! It's the cannon ball!

414
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,441
It's the cannon ball! Get down!

415
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:55,241
Down! It's the cannon ball!

416
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:58,081
Get down! Down!

417
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:00,442
Why did you have to watch TV
while he was around?

418
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:01,761
The volume was already very low.

419
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:03,321
I didn't know he would barge in.

420
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:05,920
-Down! It's the cannon ball!
-It's okay, it's okay.

421
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:08,495
Let's go back to the bomb shelter.
It's okay.

422
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,841
-Alright now.
-It's okay.

423
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,042
Let's go back to the bomb shelter.

424
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,241
It's okay.

425
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,441
The enemies are gone.

426
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:17,162
Look up.

427
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,920
Those old men just now

428
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:23,882
are veterans who survived several wars

429
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,721
of the Republic.

430
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,040
They came back from
an ocean of blood and corpses.

431
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:33,400
They won the wars for us,

432
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:36,760
with the price of
losing themselves forever.

433
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:43,002
PTSD.

434
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,800
Combat stress reaction.

435
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:47,242
Thirty percent of soldiers

436
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,320
experience these symptoms,

437
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
but it may occur

438
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,680
early or late on different people.

439
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,400
I don't have it!

440
00:27:58,214 --> 00:27:59,814
The bayonet practice last time,

441
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:02,248
it was Zhou Zi Jian
who went hard at me first.

442
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,679
He pushed me to the edge!

443
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:06,407
I'm not sick. I really am not!

444
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:07,961
Why won't you trust me?

445
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:08,882
Listen to me.

446
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,000
There are really a lot of soldiers
who have conditions like this.

447
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,480
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

448
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:16,705
Besides, even if you admit it,

449
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:18,632
it doesn't mean you're a weak.

450
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,783
I am not sick!

451
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,840
I'm healthy.

452
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:22,720
Why won't you let me
participate in the selection?

453
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,479
Comrade Qin Ge,

454
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,160
why aren't you resting in the dorm?

455
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:42,040
Report, Chief!

456
00:28:42,282 --> 00:28:43,580
My name is Qin Ge!

457
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,440
Communication soldier, Company One,
Battalion One, 384th Regiment.

458
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,200
I'm ordered to hold Hill 309

459
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,400
to the last man!

460
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,280
Fire at me! Fire at me!

461
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Comrade Qin Ge!

462
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,920
Yes, ma'am.

463
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,360
Comrade Qin Ge,

464
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,760
your comrade from 384th Regiment

465
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
has been ordered to relieve you.

466
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,080
Comrade Qin Ge!

467
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,440
Your company has fulfilled its duty.

468
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,761
Now I command you

469
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,961
run back to your company!

470
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,440
Yes, sir!

471
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,600
One, one, one, two, one.

472
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:55,601
One, two, three, four.

473
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:58,682
One, two, three, four.

474
00:29:58,682 --> 00:30:01,040
One, two, one. One, two, one.

475
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,321
One, two, one.

476
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:17,200
Seeing others help you
see yourself clearly.

477
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,519
Only by seeing yourself clearly

478
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,880
can you really move on.

479
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,440
Can I come visit them more often?

480
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,640
Yes.

481
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,680
Whenever you want to come,

482
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
I'll ask Regiment Commander
to grant you leave.

483
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,000
Have some fruit.

484
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,521
One, two, one.

485
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,440
One, two, one.

486
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,719
One, two, one.

487
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,241
Halt!

488
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,480
Comrades, your paces are neat.

489
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,840
Let's try it again.

490
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:06,320
About face!

491
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:11,402
Quick march!

492
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,720
One, two, one.

493
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
Here comes Mapo tofu!

494
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,041
Let's eat!

495
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,720
Is it nice?

496
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,040
It's nice!

497
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:37,880
It's delicious.

498
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,400
(By spending time with the seniors,)

499
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,520
(my mind starts to
become steady and calm.)

500
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,400
(At the same time, I deeply realised
the cruelty of war,)

501
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,600
(and understood that
peace did not come easily.)

502
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,762
(But it depends on us to)

503
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:58,321
(defend this hard-fought peace.)

504
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,360
(And this has strengthened my ambition.)

505
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:21,562
I feel great.

506
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:24,922
How is it?

507
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,199
How's what?

508
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,550
Being the regiment commander's
correspondent.

509
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:33,751
Future military school candidate.
How are you doing?

510
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,401
What do you expect?

511
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,120
It's about the same as retirement.

512
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,600
Save it.

513
00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:45,319
It's so nice to be able to
enjoy the air-conditioning.

514
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,680
Do you have to act like this?

515
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,360
I do.

516
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:50,708
If it was for you, would you go?

517
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,880
I would. Of course I would.

518
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,961
I can get into the military school
and be an officer.

519
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:59,520
I will bring honour to my family.

520
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,640
Do you think I'll believe it?

521
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,280
You and I don't care about keeping face.

522
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,120
So, you do know that.

523
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,400
Then, why didn't you call me
after you left?

524
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:14,880
I even thought you're retired.

525
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,720
Zhou Zi Jian said you avoided him
when you saw him the other day.

526
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,200
It really pissed me off.

527
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,762
It wasn't about saving face.

528
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,479
I just didn't want to give him
a chance to show off.

529
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,480
Look at you.

530
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,560
You're doing this again.

531
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,600
That's enough. Stop, stop.

532
00:34:39,721 --> 00:34:41,160
Get up, come on.

533
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,120
Get up now.

534
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,080
You're just too tense.

535
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,080
Do you want to relax?

536
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:51,167
Once you slow down,

537
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,320
other people will surpass you.

538
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,400
I want to surpass others,

539
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,040
especially now.

540
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,360
You still want to
participate in the selection?

541
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,240
If I can't participate this time,
I'll try again next time.

542
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,200
If I still can't get in next time,
I'll just keep trying.

543
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,760
I'll keep practising

544
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,840
until I can participate
in the selection.

545
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,320
Yan,

546
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
tell me,

547
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,040
have you got over it?

548
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,159
Don't hold back, be honest with me.

549
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:37,562
Okay.

550
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,440
We're having combat training
tomorrow morning.

551
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,400
You will come and prove to everyone that

552
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,679
Yan Po Yue

553
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,440
is back.

554
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,680
Is the office leader here
to inspect our training?

555
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,560
Company Commander.

556
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,839
What are you doing here?

557
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,440
I took a day off with
Regiment Commander.

558
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,073
I applied to come observe and learn

559
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
What's there to learn?

560
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,400
It's not like you've
never done this before.

561
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
I would also like to

562
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,480
be their sparring partner.

563
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,280
Why are you really here?

564
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:58,520
I want to prove that

565
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:00,160
I've recovered.

566
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,080
Sir,

567
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:10,600
I really got over it.

568
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,320
Who

569
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,000
is willing to go a few rounds
with Yan Po Yue?

570
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,841
We are to shed our blood
on the battlefield,

571
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:29,800
not on the training ground.

572
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,840
Sir!

573
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,200
I will do it.

574
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,140
Don't go easy on him!

575
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,040
Yes, sir!

576
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,880
Ready to combat!

577
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,919
He's getting serious again.

578
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,120
Are you alright?

579
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,200
I'm fine.

580
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,640
-Report!
-Enter.

581
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,200
Regiment Commander.

582
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,640
Have you bought your ticket?

583
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,640
The morning after tomorrow.

584
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,040
It's good that you're leaving now.

585
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,480
I heard that

586
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,600
our regiment is the first reform unit.

587
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,160
Division headquarters
has received the order.

588
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,960
The announcement will be
made in the next few days.

589
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,520
What are the changes?

590
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,080
You are demobilized.

591
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,240
Why do you still want to know?

592
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,920
I've been in our regiment
since I joined the army.

593
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,080
It's been over 10 years.

594
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,920
Diverse some parts, retain some parts.

595
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,360
Political Commissar is already
working on it.

596
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:37,983
He has been talking to
the cadres separately.

597
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,760
That's all?

598
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,040
What do you mean that's all?

599
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,400
We'll be relieved.

600
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,800
Relieved?

601
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,000
Our instructor's wife

602
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:56,800
just got transferred here
from the provincial capital.

603
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,480
They can finally get together now.

604
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,800
And Vice Company Commander,

605
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,880
he has just got himself
a local girlfriend.

606
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,840
Oh, right,

607
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,400
isn't your daughter going to take
her high school entrance exam this year?

608
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,280
Where are they moving us to?

609
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,520
Honestly, I don't know either.

610
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,840
Then...

611
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,760
Will we keep the designation?

612
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,880
No.

613
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,880
It'll all be merged into a new unit.

614
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,320
Li Xiang.

615
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,880
Come. Sit. Sit.

616
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,840
By the way,

617
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
I'd like your opinion

618
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,120
about something.

619
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,640
Is it about Yan Po Yue?

620
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,160
Yes.

621
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,200
Our home is gone,

622
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,280
and you're still worrying
about one soldier.

623
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,840
Didn't you come to me to talk about him?

624
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,360
He has recovered from PTSD.

625
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,160
The whole company witnessed it today.

626
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,960
I sent him there.
