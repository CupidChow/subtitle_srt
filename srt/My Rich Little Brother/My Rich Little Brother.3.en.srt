Zhengzheng.

Zhengzheng.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,440
Zhengzheng, don't be scared.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,080
You're just having a nightmare.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,120
Since that accident,

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
Zhengzheng always has nightmares.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,840
Yesterday,

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,040
thank God you were there.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,200
That accident...

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,120
It means...

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,960
Zhengzheng

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,800
had an older sister called Xin Yingying.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,960
When he was ten years old...

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,320
Zhengzheng.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,480
Zhengzheng.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,600
I'm going out.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,320
Stay home and listen to Dad,

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,040
alright?

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,440
Be good.

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Dad, I'm leaving.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,640
OK.

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Be careful out there.

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,800
Sure.

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,240
Ahh!

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,280
Zhengzheng witnessed it all.

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,840
He was badly traumatized

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,280
and ended up developing

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,960
PTSD,

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,120
post-traumatic stress disorder.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,640
His mind

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,960
has been closed since then.

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,360
And his body refused to grow up.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,480
Well...

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,280
What can we do

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,360
to help him?

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,040
Travel back in time.

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,880
Return to that day.

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,600
Back in time?

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,240
We can recreate the events of that day

43
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,960
and make him relive

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,160
what happened that day.

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
Through exposure therapy,

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,640
we can force him to accept reality.

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,920
But

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
isn't this

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
too cruel?

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,780
It's better to rip off the band-aid.

51
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,840
This is the only way to help Zhengzheng.

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,160
Zhengzheng.

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,160
Zhengzheng.

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Sister.

55
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,560
Stand here and don't move.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,960
By recreating the scene,

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,920
we can strongly trigger his memories

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,880
and force Zhengzheng to grow up

59
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,280
through exposure therapy.
