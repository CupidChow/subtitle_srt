00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,960
Since you've always liked your sister so much,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,680
why don't I take her home and marry her,

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,720
so she can be your sister-in-law?

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,920
What are you guys talking about?

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,120
Why aren't you eating?

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,720
Here. Come on.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,280
Yingying.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,560
I'm coming to see you now.

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,580
Mr. Wei, this is my plan for next month.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,760
Please take a look.

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
We've already achieved

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,120
this month's goal.

15
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,080
Not bad.

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,440
Keep it going.

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,440
Mr. Wei.

18
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,120
Let's have dinner together

19
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,320
after work today.

20
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,640
Meili,

21
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,800
I have a date.

22
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,640
With who?

23
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,280
Yingying.

24
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,960
I can't retreat anymore.

25
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,400
Wei Yingying!

26
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,760
You again!

27
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,120
There is in fact room for two,

28
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,800
but only one of each gender.

29
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,920
I won't share that with you!

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,160
Zhengzheng,

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
what are you doing here?

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,200
I thought your brother was coming.

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,640
Yingying,

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,640
do you have feelings

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,800
for my brother?

36
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,400
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,680
It's not something that a kid should think about.

38
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,760
Back then,

39
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,400
it was you who would say nice things

40
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,480
and look out for me.

41
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,040
I don't want that anymore.

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,040
From now on,

43
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll be the one to protect you.

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,560
Zhengzheng, are you out of your mind?

45
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,840
Wait up.

46
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,800
I'll be right back.

47
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,560
I'll stop pretending.

48
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm admitting it.

49
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
I like Wei Yingying.

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
Since we were kids,

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,800
I've never competed with you

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
for anything you wanted.

53
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,160
Great.

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,640
Thank you, brother.

55
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Yingying.

56
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,640
I have something to say to you.

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,160
Yingying,

58
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,440
I've had feelings for you for a long time.

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,360
Don't you know that?

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
Stop treating me like a child.

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,040
Zhengzheng,

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,160
stop it.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,160
In my mind,

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
you are always that naive, affectionate little brother,

65
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,480
who always called me sister with a sweet voice.

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,760
Why are you like this now?

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,640
You know what?

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,160
In the past two years,

69
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,560
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
It was not a coincidence

71
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
that we met again.

72
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,840
I was looking for you.

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,320
When I laid my eyes on you,

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,640
I felt like my heart would beat out of my chest.

75
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,360
From that moment on,

76
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,760
I promised myself

77
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,280
that I would never leave you again.

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,400
Zhengzheng,

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,080
just go home.

80
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,360
My mind is a mess right now.

81
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm not a child anymore.

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,040
Please

83
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,760
take me seriously,

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,920
and think it over, just once.
