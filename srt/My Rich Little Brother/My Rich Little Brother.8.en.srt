00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,680
This is our factory's car.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,640
Hello.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,880
Your grandpa is sick

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,240
and he asked me to call you back.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,440
Hurry up.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,320
Just come.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,200
Alright.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,160
Wait for me downstairs.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,720
I'll pass my work
to someone else before coming down.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
It's my bad. It's my bad.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,120
I shocked you.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,760
Huanxi,

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,680
I've told you many times

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,600
that we are not a good fit.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,720
I don't see it that way.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,240
I will return the money

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,640
to you as soon as possible.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,800
Search the frequent locations of this car.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,120
Find the area it stays for the longest time.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,280
Got it.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,360
Why are you drinking tea, Grandpa?

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,480
This is the towel to wipe feet!

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,240
Grandpa.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,680
Grandpa, how are you?

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,600
Is it serious?

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,240
Before I leave this world,

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,920
I want you to have a family.

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,760
That way, I'll rest in peace

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,520
when I die.

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,880
What are you talking about, Grandpa?

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,320
Just rest well.

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,360
Grandpa,

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,160
rest assured.

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,760
You can count on me for this.

37
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm getting the marriage certificate
with Yingying tomorrow.

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,840
Such good luck

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,520
will make your sickness

40
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,760
go away.

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,400
Grandpa.

42
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,280
Just rest and get better.

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
I don't like Huanxi.

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm not marrying him.

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,760
Yingying.

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,240
Huanxi has been so nice to you

47
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,800
all these years.

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,400
Don't be ungrateful.

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
Who are you marrying,

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
if not him?

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Marry me.

52
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
Who are you?

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,880
Xin Zhengzheng.

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
Nice to meet you, Grandpa.

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,480

Stealing my wife...

what are you doing here?

60
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,120
I was worried about you,

61
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
so I followed you here.

62
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,200
Yingying,

63
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,000
you had a boyfriend all along?

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,320
No.

65
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,420
Zhengzheng, you shouldn't have said that.

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,920
I was helping you out.

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,640
Sister.

68
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,040
Are you sure you don't need me here with you?

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,520
Just go back.

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
I'll go back to work

71
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
after Grandpa gets better.

72

Alright.

Whatever you want.

75
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,840
You head on in first, Sister.

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I'll watch you go

77
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,920
