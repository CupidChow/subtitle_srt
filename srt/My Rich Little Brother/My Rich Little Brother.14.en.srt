00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,360
I didn't think you could be that sweet.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,640
How did you know I love roses?

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,360
Well...

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,920
It's for Yingying.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Your sister.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,240
She already left

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,360
to hand out flyers.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,760
Why was she doing that again?

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,920
None of my business.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
Your sister insisted on doing it.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm going to look for Yingying.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,480
He's gone.

15

Come out.

Thank you, Meili.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,400
Who are you making jealous now?

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,440
Such a rich, tall and handsome guy is after you,

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,800
yet you're hiding from him.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,800
Me and him...

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,120
We're not a good fit.

22

Our ages

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,200
and our families...

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,200
Take it from me,

26

found her own prince.

27

We're not a good fit.

Yingying.

33
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,600
Yingying, open the door.

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,600
Why are you hiding from me?

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,320
Zhengzheng.

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm also upset that you feel like this.

37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,120
But I just don't know

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,920
how to face your feelings.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,520
Maybe not seeing each other

40
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,920
would be best for you.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
Zhengzheng.

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,080
Have you been waiting here the whole night?

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,640
I'm worried about you.

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,440
Why are you torturing yourself like this?

45

Yingying,

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,600
I can't figure out

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
why you don't want to see me.

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
I've been thinking all night.

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,120
Zhengzheng,

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,760
just give me some more time.

to the old times without worries, alright?

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
Just you wait, brat.
