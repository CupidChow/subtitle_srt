Come on.

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,000
- Come on.
- No.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,800
What's this about?

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,680
It's a good thing.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,160
You'll find out.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
Come on.

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,200
Yingying.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,600
I see how hardworking you've been.

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
You are indeed qualified to be manager.

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,440
I admit it.

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,280
Thank you all.

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,720
Thanks.

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,000
Zhengzheng, look.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,600
This is our company's new project.

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
It's good.

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,800
Right?

19
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll make some food

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,720
to celebrate.

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,800
Wait, wait.

22
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,860
Zhengzheng, you almost burned down

23
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,560
my kitchen last time you came to cook.

24
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
Why don't you let me do it?

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,920
Rest assured, sister.

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,640
This time,

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,840
I made sure to study cooking in advance.

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
You won't be disappointed.

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,840
Zhengzheng,

30
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,920

special meal for us?

32

But this is really the most beautiful

fried egg I've ever seen.

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,720
Enjoy.

35
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,260
Here.

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,240
A candlelight dinner...

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,000

Hitting on my fiancé...

40

I'll beat you up whenever I see you.

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,920
Let go of me! You are hurting me!

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,920
Don't you know

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
that our families agreed for us to get married again?

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
I am your fiancé.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
Let go.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,760
You'd better

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,720
stay away from my woman.

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,640
Otherwise,

49
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,440
there is nothing I won't do.

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,960
Xin Zhengzheng,

51
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,560
I'll show you

52
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,480
that you are wrong.

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,800
Yingying,

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,720
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,960
I haven't been protecting you.

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,680
Zhengzheng.

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,680
You should go.

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,520
Go to her.

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,840
You two are a better match.

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,720
Yingying.

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
I'll leave now.

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,120
We're not a good fit.

are in two completely different worlds.
