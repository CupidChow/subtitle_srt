00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,560
Yingying.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,720
Who is this?

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,840
Yingying.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,200
You...

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,000
Mr. Wei.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,280
Thank you for saving me.

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Don't thank me.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,040
I was worried you were in a bad mood,

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,880
so I came to check on you.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,800
But then I saw you coming here.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
It's a good thing I came.

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,560
Sorry.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm a bit late.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,080
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,480
We are playing a random game now.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,600
We wrote one character down

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,640
on the back of each piece of paper.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,800
Then we are going to turn them over

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,880
to see what word it spells.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,300
Well, well...

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,000
Well...

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,600
Mis-

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,240
tress

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,800
Wei!

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,320
Of course she must have some skills

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
or how could she reach the manager position?

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
Do you really believe it's because of her sales?

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,320
Why don't you take more days off?

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,400
Thank you for your kind gesture, Mr. Wei.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
But

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,280
I don't want

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,800
to have the title of the manager

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
just because of your kindness.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
So

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,560
please take it back, Mr. Wei.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,320
You're already admitting defeat?

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,400
Here.

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,760
The monthly sales of Wang Meili.

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,920
If you can do better than her in this month,

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,200
you will totally deserve

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,560
this manager position of yours.

44
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,800
There are two more days left.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,040
Well...

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,440
I'll give it a try.

47
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,280
Women should depend on themselves.

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,400
To work.

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,600
And to fight.

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
You...

51
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,120
What are you doing here?

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,800
I've been waiting outside your building for ages

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,760
and I didn't see you,

54
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,560
so I got worried.

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,520
I bought some food

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
and came here to check on you.

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,640
Didn't you go to be with someone else?

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,080
I already explained it to you.

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,880
I was being set up.

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,760
The only person in my heart

61
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,600
is you.

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't buy it.

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,720
I'll be here with you.

64
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,680
I won't bother you.

You are indeed qualified to be manager.
