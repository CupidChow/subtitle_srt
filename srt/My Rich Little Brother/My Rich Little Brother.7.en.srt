Let's buy Baoman company.

You're usually
not interested in the business.

Ahh!

I personally

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,400
conducted an on-the-spot investigation
of this company.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,440
It's not bad at all.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,880
It has a lot of potential.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,600
It's not a big deal.

Before Dad left the country,

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,680
he had intended to purchase

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,600
some internet biotech companies anyway.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
And can I run it

20

Sure.

I'll talk to Dad.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,360
Dad said it before leaving

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,440
that you should study hard

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
and not waste time on romance.

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,400
Rest assured, Brother.

The second young master

How can you leave!

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,800
I didn't expect

46
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,080
that the second young master
of Xin family would be cured.

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,760
We shouldn't have canceled your engagement.

48
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,720
You're not as popular anymore.

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,640
If you can get engaged
to Xin Zhengzheng again,

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,840
then overnight

51

Zhengzheng,

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,940
I know you don't want to see me.

56
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,980
But

57
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,500
I've talked to my father

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,620
and he agreed to allow our engagement again.

59
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,260
Since you chose to cancel it,

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,260
I don't think there is any need to do that.

61
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,020
I didn't want to cancel it.

62
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,180
I was not following my heart, Zhengzheng.

63

I know that.

don't call me Zhengzheng, call me Mr. Xin.

just give me one more chance.
