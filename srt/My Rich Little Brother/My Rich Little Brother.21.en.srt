Let me stay here.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,520
Don't listen to him.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,080
Let him go and I'll stay.

Let go of Yingying.

I'll stay.

Don't listen to him. Let him go.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,560
Yingying, listen to me. Yingying.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,760
If you're gone,

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,360
I'd be better off in hell.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,640
I beg you,

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,240
just go.

Zhengzheng,

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,520
I didn't realize

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,720
how much you mean to me until today.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,000
I love you.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,040
I've always loved you.

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,120
If you leave today,

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,240
I will suffer

23

for the rest of my life.

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,160
So,

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,040
the surviving one is the saddest one.

26
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,440
Just endure

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,080
this suffering.

28
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,800
No.

29

Yingying.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,360
I can't take it.

31
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,280
What are you waiting for?

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,400
Do it.

Zhengzheng.

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,680
Who would have known

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,680
you were such a desperate couple?

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,280
Bao Bei'er,

38
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,960
are you aware that you are breaking the law?

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,040
Sue me.

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,120
I'll tell them that I was acting.

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,680
What crime am I committing?

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,280
Zhengzheng.

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,440
Yingying.

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,280
Are you alright?

45
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,120
Bao Bei'er.

00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,200
What are you doing?

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,360
If you hurt Yingying,

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,200
I won't let you get away with it.

49
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,920
I won't hurt her.

50
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,240
In the first place,

51
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,760
I wanted to set up a situation

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,440
where you could plainly see

53
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,480
the real her,
leaving you when things got tough.

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,600
Who could've known

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,240
you'd put on

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,240
such a sad and romantic act.

57
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
You take each other more seriously

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,560
than your own lives.

59
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,960
I lost.

Yeah.
