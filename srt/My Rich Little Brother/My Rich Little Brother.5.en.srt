How's this, then?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,240
I'll finish handing them out
in twenty minutes.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
And then you can buy me drinks.

6

Twenty minutes?

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,280
There are so many flyers.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,600
I doubt if I can hand them out
in one afternoon.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,040
yet you can get it done in twenty minutes?

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,000
There you go, lying again.

Wait, why did I say "again"?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,320
This is the era of mobile internet.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,560
There's such a thing
as algorithmic recommendations.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,320
As long as I set the right key words

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,520
and add a sense of wisdom,

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,960
people will definitely flock to me.

Please take a flyer.

Sure.

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,120
All out?

25

Yes.

Here's some water.

that's when I came here.

So now it's been

more than a decade.
