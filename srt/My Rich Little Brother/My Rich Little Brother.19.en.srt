With this cabbage,

in the entire field.

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,680
Don't you think it's too fake?

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,880
It's fine. That's normal for this business.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,800
Bao Bei'er, let's do one more take.

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,920
Back up a bit.

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,600
Stop shooting. Stop!

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,440
Something's wrong.

Fine. Fine.

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,280
Enough.

19
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,960
Stop recording.

20
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,640
Something's wrong.

21
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,080
Why are you freaking out?

22
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,640
Look at me.

My Lady, something's wrong.

27
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,040
It's terrible for you.

28
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,200
What could be that bad?

29
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,520
The investors pulled their funding.

30
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,760
This movie is finished.

31
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,680
You have to stop the shoot!

32
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Pulled their funding?

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,760
The Xin family bought the investors' company.

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
Xin Zhengzheng.

35
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,040
What should I do?

36
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
I want to keep acting.

37
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,960
It's fine.

38
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Let me deal with it.

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Mr. Xin.

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
You're all grown up now.

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,040
When I first saw you,

42

Out with it.

Leave if you have nothing to say.

46
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,720
The investment company
recently bought by the Xin family

pulled their funding from Bao Bei'er's movie.

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
So can you...

49
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,920
Can you help us out?

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
It's company business.

51
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,360
I don't have a say

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
in such business ventures.

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,080
Little brat,

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520

55
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,240
I know what you've done.

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,120
Wei Yingying

is my woman.

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,800
If you dare touch her again,

59
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I can't guarantee

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,160
what I will or won't do.

I'm sorry.

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,440
I want to be alone for a while.

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
Zhengzheng is sick.

Don't listen to him.
