Yingying,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,960
you shouldn't have to
handle such heavy work, right?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,840
Have a seat.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,600
Quite right!

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,080
Have a seat, Yingying.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,880
Have some water.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,960
Have some fruit.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,440
What's going on?

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,280
Why am I being replaced?

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,400
I don't care who the new boss is.

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,720
I won't accept this.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,040
What's going on?

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,800
It's you.

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,560
It's been a while.

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,680
They say we have a new leader here.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,440
The beauty of our sales department

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,440
wants to invite you out for dinner.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
What about lunch? We can go together.

21

Zhengzheng,

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,360
guess who I saw today at work?

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,640
Your older brother.

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,240
It's been two years

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,960
and he seems even more mature.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,460
Is this the surprise you talked about?

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,640
What are you doing here?

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,720
What's wrong with your head?

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,040
Let me see.

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,440
I'm done with all the work

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,600
purchasing this company.

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,800
It's just that Dad asked me

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,080
to run it personally.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,320
Didn't you agree to let me do it?

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,960
I never saw you being so keen

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,040
on running a part of the business.

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,520
Could it be

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,800
there's another reason?

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,800
Mr. Wei is really handsome.

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,840
And this restaurant is pretty nice.

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Miss Wei,

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,360
to congratulate you on your promotion,

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,080
let's raise our coffee cups

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,960
to toast your success.

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Mr. Wei,

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,440
I happened to be wondering
if we could talk about this.

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,400
With my current work experience,

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
I am not qualified to be a manager.

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,480
So

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,920
I think it would be better

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,680
for me to take my time

52
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
and work my way up slowly.

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,120
That's fine.

54
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Let's put business aside.

55

Zhengzheng.

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,040
What a coincidence.

57
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,520
Take a seat.

58
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,480
How's your injury?

59
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm fine.

60
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,440
Why didn't you

61
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,680
ask me out to this meal?

62
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
I'd like to touch up my makeup.

63
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
Mr. Wei,

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
where is the bathroom?

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
Just down the hall.

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
I still don't know where.

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,920
Why don't you show me the way?

68
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,280
Do you remember this place?

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,960
Wow.

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,160
It's still the same.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,760
Tomorrow.

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,160
Tomorrow
I'll officially confess my love to you.

73
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
I won't be your little brother anymore.

74
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,840
I want to be your official boyfriend.
