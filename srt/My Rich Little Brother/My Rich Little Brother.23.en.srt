Help.

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,160
Help!

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,360
Zhengzheng.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,440
I'm back.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,920
Never leave me again.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,240
I will always be by your side,
protecting you.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,680
Believe me,

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,480
okay?

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,240
It was all just a dream.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,840
Zhengzheng,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,640
this is the 360th day since you left.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,080
I've been thinking about you

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,760
every single one of those days.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,000
You will come back to me, right?

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,560
I always feel like

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,600
that day is coming.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,880
Maybe

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,480
you are outside my door right now.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,160
And I can see you as soon as I open it.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,240
Yingying,

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,160
you should learn to adjust.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,960
Don't make us worry about you all the time.

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,320
Let's go to work.

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,080
Zhengzheng

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,320
loves this milk brand. It's his favorite.

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,840
When I first met him,

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,000
he asked me to buy it for him,

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
which cost me half my salary back then.

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,600
I felt so bad.

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,000
Yingying,

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,120
you should learn to accept reality.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,320
Zhengzheng has been gone
for too long without any news.

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,880
Maybe he has...

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,520
No way.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,160
Zhengzheng will be fine.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,840
He promised to protect me.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
He never lies to me.

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,160
And I can always feel

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
that he is still out there.

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,960
Yingying.

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,720
Zhengzheng can't be here.

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,120
But you still have me.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
I really feel bad

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,360
seeing you like this.

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,080
Mr. Wei,

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,320
I want to be by myself for a while.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,320
Just leave it on the desk.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,520
I'll take a call.

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
Hello, Mr. Wei.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm outside your building now.

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,040
Let's go to the company together.

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,760
Sure.

Forgive me.

I will find out the truth soon

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
