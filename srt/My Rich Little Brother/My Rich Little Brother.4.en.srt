She'll ruin the plan!

Zhengzheng's sister
is meant to be gone from his life.

Zhengzheng.

Do you remember it now?

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,560
I do.

10

Sister is back.

Why didn't you follow the plan?

Mr. Xin,

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,600
I thought it would be too much

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,640
for Zhengzheng.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,520
I asked the psychological specialists
in my medical school

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,160
and they gave me some better advice.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,080
is Zhengzheng alright?

Have a seat.

is under control.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,320
The doctors detected

31
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,680
that his brainwaves

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,200
are changing,

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,240
