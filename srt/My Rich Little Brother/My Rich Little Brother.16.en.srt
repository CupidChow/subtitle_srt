Xin Zhengzheng!

00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,960
Come out here!

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,640
What?

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,100
- What's wrong?
- Get out.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,240
You scumbag! You're all bullying me.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,280
Scumbag?

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,960
Xin Zhengzheng.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,120
I said I didn't want to see you.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Just leave.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Yingying.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,920
It's me.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,560
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,760
Well.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,760
Your grandpa is sick.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,960
Again?

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,320
Is it serious this time?

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,680
He is in the hospital now.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,880
I... I...

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,280
You didn't pick up my calls.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,800
What's with you?

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,200
I've been doing all the work...

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Enough. Cut it out.

25
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,040
Come on.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,800
Huanxi.

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,760
I thought we were going to the hospital to see my grandpa.

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,640
What are we doing here?

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,200
He won't be out any time soon.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
We should grab some things for him.

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Come with me.

Have a seat, Yingying.

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,280
I'll go pack things up.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,720
What...

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,520
Why is it so empty here?

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,440
Hello.

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,280
You again.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,920
If anything happens to Yingying,

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,240
I won't let you go.

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,520
You'll ruin your chances, getting so worked up.

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,440
Listen to me.

43

What do you mean?

46
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,240
Take her to Siqile Hotel tonight.

Room 304.

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,160
And make her drink that bottle of water on the table.

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,240
And then,

50
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,600
it's up to you.

51
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,280
Why should I trust you?

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,480
Why are you helping me?

53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,240
Humph.

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Helping you?

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm helping myself.

56
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm taking back what belongs to me.

57
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,600
Hurry up, Huanxi.

58
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,040
Grandpa is waiting in the hospital.

59

Yingying,

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,080
have some water first.

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,200
This water...

Of course she must have some skills,

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,040
or how could she reach the manager position?

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Do you really believe it's because of her sales?

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,160
Women should depend on themselves.

71
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,360
To work.

72
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,520
And to fight.
