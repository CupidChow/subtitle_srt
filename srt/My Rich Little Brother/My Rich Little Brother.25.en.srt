3
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,000
Who is it?

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,600
Who is it?

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,600
Don't come for me.

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,680
I didn't mean it.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,800
You've been gone for years.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,480
Why are you still haunting me?

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,560
I killed your sister.

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,360
I was drunk.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,440
I didn't mean it.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,840
Who could've known
you would stop growing as a result?

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,320
If it weren't for you,

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,280
I would have owned
this family a long time ago.

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
But it's fine,

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm getting it at last.

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,360
Not only the company

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,000
but also your woman.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,000
I

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,320
am the real son in this family.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
You were really a good big brother to me.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,720
Zhengzheng.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,680
You killed my sister.

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,560
I didn't.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,840
I didn't mean to.

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,240
Where have you been all this time?

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
I was worried about you.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,440
You killed my sister.

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,120
You faked the account books

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,960
to transfer the company's money.

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,400
I've been doing

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,840
my research on you
in secret over the last year.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,120
This is all the proof I've gathered.

34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,760
What else can you say now?

35
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,400
There is only one thing
that I can't figure out.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,440
We've been treating you like family.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,560
Why are you doing this to us?

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,040
Dad.

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,360
Did you see it all clearly?

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,040
Wei Yifan.

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,120
You are such an ungrateful monster.

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,800
You almost fooled me.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,080
I treated you like my own family.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,040
But you...

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,960
Zhengzheng.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
When did you treat me like family?

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,080
Since I was a kid,

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,240
I could never touch anything you wanted.

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,560
I had to step away
and let you get what you wanted.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,520
I had to please you in everything.

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,600
But for what?

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,000
This company is my father's legacy, too.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
Do I have to live like that

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,280
just because he died young?

55
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
I just want to take back what's mine.

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,760
But why are you all pushing me?

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,000
Why?

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,760
We were brothers.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,040
So I'll give you a chance
to turn yourself in.

60
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,440
Never.

61
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,360
Why do you have to
make me out to be a bad guy?

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,760
Why are you pushing me?

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
I'll take everything of yours.

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,920
Just disappear.

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Zhengzheng.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,640
Zhengzheng.

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,040
Zhengzheng.

68
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,840
Did you get

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,920
all the proof?

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,440
All recorded.

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,520
When did you set it up?

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,080
Zhengzheng.

73
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
It's you.

74
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,640
I knew you were always around me.

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,120
I give you my blessing.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,080
I saw it all.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,080
Would you have come out if I didn't say that?

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,960
You were tricking me into showing myself.

79
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,320
Why are you doing this to me?

80
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,720
I have my reasons.

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
I wanted

82
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,680
to find out the truth on my own

83
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,280
to protect Yingying

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,600
and to avenge my birth sister.

85
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,360
But

86
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,760
Yingying found out.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,400
And

88
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,560
(Xin Group's next boss, after a long wait)
she perfected my plan.

89
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,880
We set you up on purpose

90
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,280
to get you to tell us the truth.
