Yingying.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,840
Yingying.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,960
Are you still thinking about Zhengzheng?

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,120
You're having take-out again.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,920
It's not healthy.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,160
When will you get yourself together?

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,040
If Xin Zhengzheng is alive,

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,640
how can he have stayed hidden all this time?

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,920
Sorry.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
I'll wait for you downstairs.

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,400
(Xin Group's next boss, after a long wait)

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,180
(Siqile Hotel's security cameras caught Wei Yifan)

15

(Saved Yingying in Siqile Hotel)

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Forgive me

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,280
for not getting closer to you.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,880
(Got close on purpose)
I discovered some bad guy,

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,320
who may be hurting those close to me.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,440
And it seems to have something to do

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,200
with my birth sister's death.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,720
To protect you,

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,280
I had to leave.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
I had to pay attention to you

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,560
and to protect you in secret.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,160
Forgive me.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
I'll find out the truth soon

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,480
and get back to you.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,480
Mr. Wei.

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,400
Still can't let go?

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,320
Still waiting for Yingying?

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,600
Sincerity is the key to everything.

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,880
Persistence breaks down every wall.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,400
Such a dedicated lover.

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,360
Mr. Wei.

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,960
Yingying.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,920
How about

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,840
we have dinner together?

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,200
OK.

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,080
Let's go.

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,360
Yingying agreed today.

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Is she finally out of the shadow
of losing her boyfriend?

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,000
You are home.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Get some rest.

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,440
Mr. Wei.

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,160
Let's get married.

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,560
I agree.

48
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,880
I'm willing to marry you.

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,600
It's been 15 years

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,960
and this day finally came.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,760
Since my dad passed away,

52
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,920
I came here

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,600
like an outsider.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,840
But tomorrow

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,200
I'll be the real son of this family

56
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
and get control of the company

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,680
and the house

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,920
and your woman.

(Next episode)
But why are you all pushing me?

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,760
Why?

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,680
Why do you have to
make me out to be a bad guy?

63
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
Why do you have to push me?

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,040
I'll take everything of yours.

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,360
Just disappear.
