Baoman Biotechnology.

Why does this company's name

It was a real coincidence
bumping into you yesterday.

It must be

There were so many flyers.

28

Did you really give them all out?

Like a dream.

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,160
Is anyone bullying you

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,440
in the company?

38
