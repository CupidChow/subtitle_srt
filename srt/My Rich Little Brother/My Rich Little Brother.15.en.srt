00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,720
Sister.

00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,320
Zhengzheng.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
Zhengzheng.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,880
I twisted my ankle.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,000
Why are you wearing high heels?

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,080
Zhengzheng,

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
I knew

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,040
you still care about me.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,800
I know you hate me

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,360
for canceling our engagement when you were sick.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,000
But

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,880
it was hard for me back then too.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,040
Every day since that day,

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,640
I've been living in hell.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,320
Countless times,

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,000
I went to the place we played together as kids,

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,320
imagining you'd show up.

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
But you never did.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,640
Zhengzheng,

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,240
can you forgive me?

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,680
There's someone I like already.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,280
Don't come see me again.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,880
I don't want her to get the wrong idea.

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Zhengzheng.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,080
Hello.

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,400
Do you want to know

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,880
who stole your fiancé?

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,960
Yingying.

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
Your fiancé is here.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,680
And he is giving candies to everyone.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,520
Here.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,720
Fiancé?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
Right, it's that rich

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
and chubby guy from last time.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,160
There.

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,680
Here.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,360
Take one.

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,760
Take it.

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,520
Congratulations.

Huanxi.

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,120
He is not my fiancé.

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
What are you doing, Huanxi?

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,760
Stop it.

47
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,280
How could you be my fiancé?

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
Yingying.

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,440
Don't be shy.

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,080
We do have

51
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,240
an engagement certificate.

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,640
Look.

53

Look.

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,220

57

I've never once been

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,640
humiliated like this.

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,440
And you?

60
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
You're already engaged,

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,680
so why did you steal my man?

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,640
So she's also a mistress.

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,840
She looked so innocent.
