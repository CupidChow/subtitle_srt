00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Zhengzheng.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,400
Zhengzheng.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,640
Zhengzheng, what's happening?

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,600
Look at me.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,640
Zhengzheng.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,640
Zhengzheng, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,200
I'll do anything you say, OK?

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,440
Don't scare me like this, Zhengzheng.

11
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,880
Zhengzheng. Don't touch me.

12
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,760
Yingying.

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
He probably fell ill again

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,160
due to some strong triggers.

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,880
Hello. Dad.

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,640
I really like Wei Yingying.

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,600
I...

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,720
Absolutely not.

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,200
Wei Yingying helped

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,880
both you and our family,

21
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,680
but our families are too different.

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,000
You can't be together.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,760
Dad.

24
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,880
I really...

25
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,440
I...

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,600
Again,

27
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,360
he chose to close his heart

28
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,480
as a reaction to something
that he couldn't accept.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Rest assured though,

30
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,760
he is undergoing treatment now.

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,560
He will be alright.

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,760
No way.

33
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,720
I don't believe it.

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,200
How could such a thing happen?

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,680
- I don't believe it.
- Yingying.

36
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,520
Calm down.

37
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,320
He'll be fine.

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Zhengzheng,

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,040
as long as you wake up,

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,680
I'll agree to anything you say, alright?

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,000
Zhengzheng.

42
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,800
Look,

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,880
it's such a nice day today.

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
It's like the day we met

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
for the second time, in the mountains.

46
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,120
You were showered in sunlight,

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,440
sparkling.

48
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,880
Since that moment,

49
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,120
I've been falling in love with you.

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,040
I just couldn't face my own feelings.

51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,800
Zhengzheng,

52
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,120
when you get better,

53
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,560
let's officially be together,

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,960
alright?

55

However long it takes,

56
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,280
I'll wait for you.

57
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,600
Sister.

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
I heard you.

59
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,840
You woke me up

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,400
from being lost in dreams again.

61
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,720
Yingying.

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,520
Who are you?

63
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,040
Where is Zhengzheng?

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,680
Where am I?

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,560
Yingying.

66

Yingying.

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
Yingying, are you alright?

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm fine.

71
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,200
If you dare touch her,

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
I won't let you get away with it.

73
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,760
Listen to me,

74
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,680
only one of you

75
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,400
can survive tonight.

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
Let go of her.

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,160
I'll stay.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Don't listen to him.

79
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,440
Let him go and I'll stay.

80
