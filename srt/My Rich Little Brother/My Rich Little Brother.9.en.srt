I...

Let me see.

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,560
It's serious.

7
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,240
Will it leave a scar?

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,920
Liu Huanxi was too harsh.

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,920
Rest assured.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,080

You should leave now.

13

You can't mess with the Liu Family.

He's the richest man in our village.

They don't deserve to fight me.

Grandpa.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,560
Why are you always
so afraid of the Liu Family?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,800
I know

20

they've been helping out a lot
these past few years.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,080
How much did they give us exactly?

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,880
I will pay them all back

23

I was admitted into a college.

and let him beat up my son.

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,160
I must teach her

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,440
some serious lessons.

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,440
Mom.

38

It's none of Yingying's business.

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,720
We should blame it

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,200
on that brat.

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,040
Look at how cowardly you are.

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,240
No wonder

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,080
they are not afraid of us.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,640
But

45
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,840
we still have something

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,200
to hold over them.

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,240
I'll bring it over for you.

48
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,120
OK.

Sleep in Grandpa's room.

53

Be careful and don't catch a cold.

Yeah.

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,600
the money is almost paid off
these past few years.

58
