(The chairman of Xinzheng Group, Xin Fanyan)
I'm Xin Zhengzheng's father.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,640
Father?

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,280
No father would restrain his own son.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,160
He is sick.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,880
I found the best medical team

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,160

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,640
But he left

OK.

(Executive director of Xin's Group,
Wei Yifan)

22
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,440
My future daughter-in-law is here.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,720
(Bao Family's daughter, Bao Bei'er)
Have a seat.

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,120
Mr. Xin.

25
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,520
Please don't keep calling her that.

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,480
It won't be good for Bei'er.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,680
And this is...

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,120
This is my company's agent.

(Dissolution of Engagement)

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,320
Canceling the engagement?

33
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,480
Why was he engaged at such a young age?

34
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,640
The Xins and Baos
have been friends for generations.

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,960
They were engaged

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,280
since they were kids.

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,080
Didn't you say we were here to pay a visit?

38
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Mr. Xin,

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Bei'er is a celebrity now and she's been
invited to both TV shows and online dramas.

40
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,200
If people found out
that she is already engaged

41
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,480
and her fiance is a kid

42

who's not even normal at all...

43

Shut your mouth!

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,040
How can you say such things?

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,200
Zhengzheng.

46
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,280
Zhengzheng.

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,640
Do you remember our childhood times?

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,160
Zhengzheng.

49
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,200
Let's play together.

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
Do you hate me that much?

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,560
Since that accident,

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,520
Zhengzheng refuses
to get close to any female.

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,680
You are the first woman

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,960
that he's lowered his walls for.

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,400
That accident?

56
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,040
What happened?

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,880
Alright.

Please don't say that.
