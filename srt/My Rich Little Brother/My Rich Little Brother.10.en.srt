Don't worry.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's go look for him right now.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,600
Come on.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,000
Uncle Wei.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,480
Is your memory going

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,720
in your old age?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,120
It's written down here in black and white.

11
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,680
Do I need to remind you again?

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,920
(Engagement)
I'm begging you.

13
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,440
- Grandpa.
- Just let it go!

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,520
Grandpa.

15
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,640
Stop begging them.

Let's go.

17
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,160
You're just going to leave?

18
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,960
You think you can take advantage
of our Liu family being small?

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,400
We will ask for

20
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,840
the entire debt to be repaid today.

Shuangxi Furniture Factory.

24
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,360
You should be familiar with it.

25
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,600
It's ours.

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,280
What a coincidence.

27
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,720
This factory

28
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,360
sits right on our Xin's Group's land.

29
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,440
If you dare cause troubles again,

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,560
I'll force you to move premises tomorrow.

Sister.

35
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,720
Let me take care of you.

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,960
Cut it out, little brat.

37

What I'm saying is,

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
let me take care of you,
just like how you did for me before.

Sister.

42
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,080

Are you alright?

Sister.

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,600
You can't walk like this.

48
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Let me carry you on my back.

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,260
No need. I can walk on my own.

50
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,080
Come on.

51
