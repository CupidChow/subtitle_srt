00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,560
It's me.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,400
Zhengzheng.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,520
Have a seat.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,360
I'm cooking.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,960
Zhengzheng.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,040
You...

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,520
What are you wearing?

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,320
Let me see.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,320
Are you wearing your dad's clothes?

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,240
Here. Have a seat.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,280
Have some water.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,640
Is there anything you want to eat?

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,840
I'm cooking.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,440
You're a kid.

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,640
Why are you bringing flowers over?

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm not a kid anymore.

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,240
You're not a kid anymore.

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,880
What are you then?

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,520
Tell me.

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,560
Don't pat me on the head.

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,360
You don't get it at all.

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,440
Alright.

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,760
You're not a kid anymore.

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,520
Well then,

28
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,720
let's do something

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,720
that adults do.

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,600
Something that adults do?

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
It's really

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,680
my first time.

33
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,160
I can't do it very well yet.

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,400
It's fine.

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,440
I'll teach you.

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,600
Here.

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,880
Take off your clothes.

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,280
Put on the apron.

39
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,600
- Watch out for the oil.
- Sister.

40
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,720
I burned it.

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,560
It happens.

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Add some water.

43
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,400
Fine.

44
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,280
Go and answer the door, Zhengzheng.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,120
Come here, Sister.

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,520
I'll answer the door.

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,560
- You...
- You...

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
What are you doing here?

49
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,160
I should be asking you this question.

50
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Mr. Wei.

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,920
What are you doing here?

52
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,720
I...

53
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
As the chairman of the company,

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,600
I wanted to check
on my employees' daily life.

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,960
Does every chairman bring flowers

56
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
when they check on their employees?

57
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,520
Wow.

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,880
So beautiful.

59
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,320
Is something burning?

60
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,240
I'll turn off the stove.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,760
Let me.

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
Let me.

63
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
Mr. Wei,

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,360
you shouldn't do such things.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
Mr. Wei,

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,960
I didn't know you are a good cook.

67
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
Enjoy.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm warning you,

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,440
don't you try for my sister.

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,480
Your sister

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,240
is really a good girl.

72
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,160
Since you've always liked her so much,

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,880
why don't I take her home and marry her,

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,920
so she can be your sister-in-law?

75
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,980
♪I worry if you'd get nervous♪

76
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,800
(Next episode)
I like Wei Yingying.

77
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
Since we were kids,

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,680
I never competed with you for anything

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
that you liked.

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,000
From now on,

81
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,920
I'll be the one that protects you.
