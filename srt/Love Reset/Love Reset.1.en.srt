1
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:04,865
We've been in a relationship
for 6 years.

2
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,134
Six years.
I feel like throwing up.

3
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,469
I'm the crazy one.

4
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,371
Yeah, she was crazy,

5
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,940
so I broke up with her.

6
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,641
We were so happy

7
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,810
so got married right away.

8
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,388
Wow, look at you!

9
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,056
Congratulations!

10
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,725
Our Na-ra looks gorgeous today!

11
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,660
You're so pretty.

12
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:34,394
When is it our turn?

13
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,296
Seriously!

14
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,665
- Let's get a picture first.
- Mmm.

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,370
Gone!

16
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,241
Na-ra's gone to get married...

17
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,010
and I'm...

18
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,979
Gonna go to hell.

19
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,681
Sure.

20
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,283
You can go anywhere.

21
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,287
Please, just get out of my bar.

22
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,721
How could she get married
within two months

23
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,423
after a blind date?

24
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,894
His ex-girlfriend
got married today.

25
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,197
Apparently he's filthy rich.

26
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,465
That jerk Tak-ho.

27
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,768
His friend wants to go to hell,

28
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,137
and he's gonna stare at
his phone all night?

29
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,406
Well, he did bet
his life on crypto.

30
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,341
Even quit his job yesterday.

31
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,679
See, I told you to be careful
about breaking up!

32
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:26,713
Right?

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,215
Grown man got cold feet

34
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,218
for failing your bar exams!

35
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,054
Bro.

36
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,389
I did it all for Na-ra.

37
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,527
Stop making excuses, you idiot.
That's your insecurity talking.

38
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,277
Ma'am? We're ready for you.

39
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,450
Gone...

40
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,020
Yo. Let's go.
To the club, it's on me.

41
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,888
- You're a check-n-block, bro.
- What's check-n-block.

42
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,324
Check your face and blocked.
You won't even get in.

43
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,826
- Then what do we do?
- Buy the whole club.

44
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,361
- Buy it?
- Let's buy it.

45
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,329
I'm going!

46
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,466
Where do you want to keep going?

47
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,669
The wedding. The bride.

48
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,703
Ugh...

49
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,971
To steal the bride.

50
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,073
You're too late, idiot.

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,743
The wedding's over by now!

52
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,879
Na-ra... I can't live without you.

53
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,115
- I'll be back.
- Hey, hey!

54
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,484
- You're too late!
- Seriously.

55
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,820
- Hey! Dude!
- Geez... that dumb brat.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,187
Hey, go after him.

57
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,256
Whatever. It's raining.

58
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,524
Ahh!

59
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,497
Hong... Hong... Hong...

60
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,904
Na-ra... I was just on my way...
to steal you...

61
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,377
The taxi driver's waiting outside.

62
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,079
Go pay him.

63
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,482
Oh... Okay.

64
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,759
Was he really trying
to come get me?

65
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,294
Y... y... yeah.

66
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,596
He wanted to crash the wedding
to steal you.

67
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,964
- Was just heading out.
- Yes, really.

68
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,932
What a coincidence.

69
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,501
Did you get scared too?

70
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,470
Really?

71
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,709
Na-ra.

72
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,846
Forgive me.

73
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,495
Don't be late next time.

74
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,465
Okay.

75
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,674
Did I tell you I'm the crazy one?

76
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,712
So did your wedding go smoothly?

77
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,317
Yeah, I just got here.

78
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,185
I'm going to be okay, right?

79
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,721
Of course, stop worrying.

80
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,656
Mom is already on our side.

81
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,026
I'm not going to get
a face full of water, am I?

82
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,995
What are you talking about.

83
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,964
My mom is sweet,
like a schoolgirl.

84
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,999
Like some lady next door.

85
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,007
I've never seen a lady like this
in my neighborhood.

86
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,879
I was curious

87
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,881
who made my daughter run away
at the altar.

88
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,150
Excuse me.

89
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,556
In front of all those guests.

90
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:00,360
Humiliating my family like that.

91
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,128
I was curious...

92
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,498
Who he could be.

93
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,201
I'm sorry!

94
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,406
Drink. You look nervous.

95
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,047
Thank you.

96
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,620
Let me get straight to the point.

97
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,389
Your job?

98
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,690
I'm studying for the bar exam.

99
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,058
Unemployed.

100
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,461
Any money saved up?

101
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,997
- Security deposit for my room...
- Enough.

102
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,233
I don't need to hear any more.

103
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,451
Noh Jung-yeol, you're a smart man.

104
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,755
So I'm sure you know
what this means.

105
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,330
I can't take this money.

106
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,801
I beg of you to rethink this.

107
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,437
Use this money for your new home.

108
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,273
Huh...?

109
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,908
Put it towards the apartment

110
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,576
I've arranged for Na-ra.

111
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,351
Thank you, mother-in-law.

112
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,019
Mmm.

113
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,823
Unpleasant to my ear,
"mother-in-law."

114
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,259
Just because I'm allowing it

115
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,861
doesn't mean I consider
you my son-in-law.

116
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,296
I understand.

117
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:46,700
I'll work hard to be accepted
as your son-in-law.

118
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,835
I'll consider you my son.

119
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,704
Just call me “Mom."

120
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,177
I have one last question.

121
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,246
You're full of twists...

122
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,383
You'll have to win over
General Hong.

123
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,354
Oh, father-in-law...
I mean, Dad, right?

124
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,855
Die, you prick!

125
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,256
I love Na-ra!

126
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,691
Please allow
Hong Na-ra to marry me!

127
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,460
I love her more!
I love her more, you filthy jerk!

128
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,695
What's your deal.

129
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,263
Okay, we get it. Stop.

130
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,032
Stop what? I'm not stopping crap!

131
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,034
Daddy, stay tough.

132
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,502
These idiots put a stain

133
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,170
on your 40-year military career.

134
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,739
- You, shut your mouth.
- You prick!

135
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,808
I love Jung-yeol
more than you, Dad!

136
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,487
Crazy wench...

137
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,535
Get up.

138
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,207
Take your mother inside.

139
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,010
- I'm going to kill this jerk.
- Dad, are you crazy?

140
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,980
Dad! You're being crazy! Dad!

141
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:07,981
- Please shoot me!
- You prick!

142
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,882
- Just go home!
- If you won't approve...

143
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,384
- Dad! Dad!
- Hey!

144
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,886
Don't move, you chump!

145
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:13,953
...then I'd rather die!

146
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,887
Open your goddamn eyes!

147
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,456
- Dad!
- Bang!

148
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,392
- Release your trigger finger!
- Hey!

149
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,494
- I'll shoot you!
- I'm never giving up!

150
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,330
- I'll pull the trigger, jerk!
- Shoot me!

151
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,566
- Bang!
- It's loaded!

152
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,401
Just one shot!

153
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,171
I'm okay with it!

154
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,506
- Na-ra! I'll be fine!
- No, you are not!

155
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,874
- Don't move, jackass!
- Dad, please!

156
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:35,908
You don't think I'll shoot you?

157
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,578
- Dad, stop it!
- I'm a three-star general, jerk!

158
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,246
- Stop it!
- I'll shoot!

159
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,951
Dad should've shot him that day.

160
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,020
He told me it was a blank.

161
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,955
In the end, we got married.

162
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,357
Since I blew up one wedding,

163
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,793
we had a small one
with only family.

164
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,797
Is my granddaughter
getting remarried?

165
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,467
She's not getting remarried,

166
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,137
we're just having
another ceremony.

167
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,644
The groom is different.

168
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,015
This guy, that guy,
they're all the same.

169
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,187
I heard they were rich.
Seems like it.

170
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,291
Is that a mosquito net
on her head?

171
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,292
Shush.

172
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,561
- That's a mosquito net.
- Stop it.

173
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,297
Don't shush me.

174
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,099
Humph.

175
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,342
Congrats

176
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,479
Only a lil bit

177
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,885
Don't fight

178
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,689
Don't get divorced either

179
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,526
My daddy

180
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,830
Is a soldier

181
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,900
You'll die

182
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,037
You'll get shot

183
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:17,443
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you

184
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,512
I love you

185
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,514
Alright, here we go.

186
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,816
One, two!

187
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,460
That really sounds like
something out of a movie.

188
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:35,895
It still feels like one.

189
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,766
Although the genre
turned into a thriller.

190
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,004
Ah, almost.

191
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,708
You...

192
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,611
You just tried to kill me...

193
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,049
That's murder. Murder.

194
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,452
Attempted murder, idiot.

195
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,955
Did you get your lawyer's license
from a raffle?

196
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,091
- So stupid.
- You freaking...!

197
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,367
Goddamit...!

198
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,735
Action!

199
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,241
Why are you doing this
during work hours?

200
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,244
Sir...

201
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,146
You're starting to
feel like a man to me.

202
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,815
Do you really want
unemployment benefits?

203
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,050
Choose.

204
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,352
Fire me now...

205
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,622
Or kiss me.

206
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,531
- Cut!
- I'm sorry.

207
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,334
- Cut. Cut.
- That's a cut.

208
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,469
- Cut, cut!
- Sheesh...

209
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,438
How many takes do we need?

210
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,973
Take 13.

211
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,808
I wasn't asking that.

212
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,077
These actors can't
even kiss properly.

213
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,114
That's because you changed
the script on the fly.

214
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,250
Maybe if you gave them
clearer directions.

215
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,519
Hey, producer. Are you ignoring me
cause I'm a rookie?

216
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:09,789
- No, it's not like that.
- Director.

217
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,024
Am I really kissing her

218
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:12,959
because I don't wanna give
unemployment?

219
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,193
That's kinda weird.

220
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,098
Why don't you explain it to him.

221
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,467
- Explain what.
- Your love story.

222
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,735
It's well-known in the industry.

223
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,671
You know, the kind of romance

224
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,273
that you and your husband share.

225
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,709
What's so romantic about
being with that fool?

226
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,879
(Lawyer Noh Jung-yeol)

227
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,257
All our clients keep
looking for you.

228
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,593
I'm flooded with work. Flooded.

229
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,095
Isn't our firm going too far?

230
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,364
I need to renegotiate my salary.

231
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,900
Ah, I'm so jealous.

232
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,503
I want to establish myself
and get married too.

233
00:13:59,105 --> 00:13:59,972
What do you want?

234
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,874
To get married.

235
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,448
Just... date.

236
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,951
Nevermind, don't date either.

237
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,052
You might get married.

(Soju)

240
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,907
Hong Na-ra!

241
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,376
Are you kidding me?

242
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,777
What is this?

243
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,978
Are you crazy? Huh?

244
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,547
Is this fridge
your alcohol cabinet?

245
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,649
Are you the only one that's busy?

246
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,285
I'm busy too, I work my ass off!

247
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,678
You too...
I'm sure you know what I mean.

248
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,494
What the heck!

249
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,130
He's like a mosquito.

250
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,432
I have no clue why they exist,

251
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,768
but they keep coming back
no matter how many I kill.

252
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,137
They say God is fair.

253
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,839
And he is fair.

254
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,041
He gave me
the intelligence and the looks,

255
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,811
but he gave me that woman.

256
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,013
He said handsome.

257
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,815
Hey.
If you're handsome,

258
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,418
99% of this country is
Timothee Chalamet.

259
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,487
Mmm, no idea who that is.

260
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,988
He keeps doing this.

261
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,323
How am I
supposed to live with him?

262
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,291
“How am I
supposed to live with him?"

263
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,259
I told you not to do that!

264
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,895
- You always whine, whine...
- Stop it.

265
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,631
This is a court of law.

266
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,036
Your love presented you
with a movie-like wedding.

267
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,472
How did you end up here?

268
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,140
Movie-like...

269
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,542
You know how it is.

270
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,877
Once you hate someone,

271
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,245
you can't even stand
the sight of them eating.

272
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,148
Just want to plug their nose
every time they breathe.

273
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,450
Since when did it
become like this?

274
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,919
When did all those
hateful feelings start?

275
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,120
(Dung-yeol)

276
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,390
Since we started
preparing for the wedding.

277
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,427
Saying the apartment's too big for
the two of us,

278
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,762
saying a studio is fine.

279
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,432
The stinking pride of that man.

280
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,335
He insisted
he'll handle everything,

281
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,937
so he's still paying mom back.

282
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,372
He reeks of inferiority complex.

283
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,307
- Yeah!
- What a nutjob.

284
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,075
“Nutjob" is a bit harsh.

285
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,343
He's still Na-ra's husband.

286
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,411
What's wrong, do worse.

287
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,813
I'll allow it.

288
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,515
Jung-yeol's a prick.
That jerk.

289
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,751
A freaking piece of a jerkhead.

290
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,120
His ID says a jerk, that prick.

291
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,622
Delightful.

292
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,557
I never thought him
to be like that.

293
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,825
Why not.

294
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,461
He always acted so righteous
ever since we were dating.

295
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,797
The bibimbap he always eats
is Korean pride,

296
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,699
while my love for pasta
is European snobbery.

297
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,101
Is he some
kind of freedom fighter?

298
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,405
You should've been there.

299
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,908
He'd mix his bibimbap
while saying...

300
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,410
Do you know bibimbap?

301
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,045
Pulling that kinda crap.

302
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,279
I think I'm going to barf.

303
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,548
I didn't want to mention this
cause it's embarrassing.

304
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,549
What is it.

305
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,218
The highlight was the honeymoon.

306
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,388
So...

307
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,791
Just like she begged,
we went to Switzerland.

308
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,962
Right? We make it to Swiss.

309
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,230
Then what are we supposed to do?

310
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,232
Go on our honeymoon, no?

311
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,601
Sure.
Why, you didn't?

312
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,404
She wouldn't leave the damn room.

313
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,240
Why not?

314
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,712
To her, traveling isn't touring.

315
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,881
It's for relaxing. Relaxing.

316
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,249
She goes all the way to Swiss,

317
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,251
and says soaking in the vibes
is enough,

318
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,620
feels no need to go sightseeing.

319
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,121
In freaking Switzerland!

320
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,290
Why did we go all the way
to Swiss then?! Why?!

321
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,628
These are our honeymoon photos.

322
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,198
Do these... look like
honeymoon photos to you?

323
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,501
My mother saw these and said...

324
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,607
She thought these were from
my father's hiking club.

325
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:33,445
He came to our honeymoon
in his father's hiking gear.

326
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,115
Who has money for new gear.

327
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,752
- As a jobless man.
- Oh, don't start this again.

328
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,122
Hold up. Ugh!
You're going to do this again?

329
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,357
Wow!

330
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,958
Wow, seriously!

331
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,727
- Babe.
- Mmm?

332
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,362
My classmate has a little sister.

333
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,564
She's getting married.

334
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,299
Let me borrow $100, as a gift.

335
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,770
Why would you take care of
a classmate's sister.

336
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,138
You're jobless.

337
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,025
Haven't you run out
of your allowance yet?

338
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:21,994
I don't need it.

339
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,929
I'm jobless,
where would I spend it?

340
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,906
Why are you so late?

341
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,674
Is it snowing hard outside?

342
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,977
I was studying and
didn't realize the buses ended.

343
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,212
So I thought about riding a taxi,

344
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,447
but I'm jobless.

345
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,249
So I walked home.

346
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,150
Jobless people
don't spend taxi money.

347
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,720
What should we do
for your mother's birthday?

348
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,423
Should we just gift her some cash?

349
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,559
You're the one with a salary.
Up to you.

350
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,760
What do I know.

351
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:55,928
I don't know anything.

352
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,929
I'm jobless.

353
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,465
Stop that crap!

354
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,699
You're insufferable!

355
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,201
Jobless! Jobless!!

356
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,236
Jobless!!!

357
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:10,242
You're driving me insane!
Goddamn lunatic!

358
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,681
We shouldn't waste any rice.

359
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,518
I'm jobless.

360
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,126
She was born with a silver spoon.

361
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,727
She lived a plentiful life,

362
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,329
she doesn't understand
people like us.

363
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,031
How can he blame me for that?

364
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,300
Is it so hard to
accept our differences?

365
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,335
Why does he try to force

366
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,037
their experiences on me?

367
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,371
“Their" experiences?

368
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,341
Do you want to know
what I heard the most

369
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,377
from my mother-in-law?

370
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,152
You've never tried this cause...

371
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,754
you're born rich, right?

372
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,090
Never tried this

373
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,258
cause you're born rich, huh?

374
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,268
Hey!

375
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,237
Why are you using
so much dish soap?

376
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,006
You can wash
the entire town's dishes

377
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,842
till next year with that.

378
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,844
And would you look at that!

379
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,379
How can you leave
the water running,

380
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,981
what's wrong with her?

381
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,652
Mom. Stop making things
hard for her.

382
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,120
Don't say things like that.

383
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,589
Dad, I've mentioned it at home too

384
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,792
but habits are hard to break.

385
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,098
Whew... expensive habits
could be a problem.

386
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,401
Is it because she's born rich?

387
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,570
Let's see how you guys are living.

388
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,874
What the hell is this...

389
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,476
Bananas keep longer outside,

390
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:54,480
you can't put this in the
fridge and expect to eat it.

391
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,483
How frustrating.
Look at this chicken.

392
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,319
You have to eat this right away!

393
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:03,522
What will you do
with this dry chicken!

394
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,392
Boil it so you can
finish it, okay?

395
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:07,760
So frustrating.

396
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,828
You're buying
all these side dishes!

397
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,164
It's cheaper to buy them
these days, Mother.

398
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,067
How is buying cheaper?

399
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,369
How in the world can
buying be any cheaper?

400
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,505
Are you messing with
me cause I'm uneducated?

401
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:23,843
It must be...

402
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,713
Cause you're born rich, right?

403
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,152
Is your family motto,
"Let's ooze inferiority complex?"

404
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,654
What does buying a few side dishes

405
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,756
have to do with being born rich?

406
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,693
She was just worried
for our household.

407
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,230
What's so wrong
about trying to be frugal?

408
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,565
Is that so bad?

409
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,970
It's so strange.

410
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,572
Why does a man who devotes
his life to reducing expenses,

411
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,742
dry his privates with a hairdryer?

412
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,343
- Hey!
- Hmm?

413
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,179
Why does that matter right now?

414
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,559
Is Jung-yeol still washing?

415
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,661
He's trying to be
ridiculously clean.

416
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,997
A grown man's scared of
some spilt wine...

417
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,201
You should wash yourself more.
You smell.

418
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,771
It didn't get
on the chair, did it?

419
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,706
It's bothering me. Oh geez...

420
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,909
Ki-chul.
Please tell Uncle to hurry up.

421
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,811
- Okay.
- Okay.

422
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,785
Uncle!
Auntie's telling you to hurry up.

423
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:47,126
Mom! Uncle's blowing
air up his butthole!

424
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,096
Ugh, makes me barf
just thinking about it.

425
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,269
Unbelievable.

426
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,638
Your honor. This human...

427
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:02,007
I mean this woman.

428
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,710
She doesn't even wash, period.

429
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,011
More than you do.

430
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,448
I counted every time she washed
her hair in a week, but!

431
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:12,084
It was the most futile exercise
in human history.

432
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,453
Why? Because it
never happened once.

433
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,722
I wash it at the hair salon
because our hairdryer's rotten.

434
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,225
I could look past it
if she was only dirty.

435
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,795
But, whenever she drinks,
without ever washing...

436
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,265
she asks for the dirty.

437
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,166
Hey!

438
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,005
Jung-yeol.

439
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,346
My baby Jung-yeol

440
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,717
is the sexiest when he's studying.

441
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,586
I'm studying, so let me study...

442
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,756
So I just came from
an awards show afterparty.

443
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,560
And so many people
were hitting on me.

444
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,628
You know
I don't give out my number.

445
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,031
But they kept begging me,

446
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,533
begging me
to take their business cards.

447
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,903
(Call Taxi/Massage PC Cafe)

448
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,805
You will never know,

449
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:10,676
how tiring
this kind of life can get.

450
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,012
I have no clue.

451
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,515
What's wrong with your face?

452
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,716
What?

453
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,553
- What about my face?
- Anxious.

454
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:25,057
- You're anxious.
- Yes, I am anxious.

455
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:28,560
So let's get you to sleep, okay?

456
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,829
No, no, no, no, no, no.

457
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:34,700
I can't go to sleep
leaving you anxious.

458
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,402
You can. You can.

459
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,638
I'll make you un-anxious.

460
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,040
No thanks...

461
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:42,975
Hmm.

462
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,353
- Blegh.
- Ew, your mouth smells like ass!

463
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,454
Ouch.

464
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,090
Are you okay?

465
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,925
I told you, I...

466
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,628
Ugh...! Aaugh...!

467
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,769
As if you're so clean and holy.

468
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,807
At least be good at it then.

469
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,043
I think I'm better than you.

470
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,078
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

471
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,281
- "Yeah, yeah."
- You're sooo amazing.

472
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,615
"Sooo amazing."

473
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,452
So is that why you
cheated on me?

474
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,257
- Good morning.
- Morning!

475
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,326
- Good morning all.
- You too.

476
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,795
Good morning.

477
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,764
I don't like
the color of your tie.

478
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:39,665
Sorry?

479
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:43,769
It makes you look old.

480
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,141
Oh... does it?

481
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,778
You're free for dinner, right?

482
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,780
Sure.

483
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,982
I mean... Surely not.

484
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,952
She's just a junior
who has a crush on me.

485
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,921
Do I?

486
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:03,922
Why?

487
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,957
Just admit you like them young.

488
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,459
No need to pretend.

489
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,295
I want to pick you a tie.

490
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,131
And have dinner together.

491
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,435
I can buy dinner.

492
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,669
Do you like bibimbap?

493
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,405
Feels like a date.

494
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,844
If infidelity is the cause,

495
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,112
then she'll have the advantage

496
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,714
in terms of alimony
and property division.

497
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,416
Why would something so important

498
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,552
be left off the records?

499
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,855
Because the one
who cheated is actually her.

500
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,659
He's the one who shat the bed
and got himself fired.

501
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:41,827
Why is he blaming me?

502
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,161
Did I fire him?

503
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,897
Idiot director, seriously.

504
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,934
You know how directors are.

505
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,236
Half are nutjobs,
the rest are sleazeballs.

506
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,609
So, what kind of director are you?

507
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,377
Nutjob? Sleazeball?

508
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,546
Me?

509
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,183
I'm nuts...

510
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,051
for art.

511
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,158
I should've knocked his teeth in.
Sleazy nutjob.

512
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:16,194
Ah... I think you'd lose.

513
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,529
You don't know how to fight.

514
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,798
Who hits like that,
are you Superman?

515
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,335
- So fresh, very cool.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

516
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,504
- Just shut up, okay?
- Am I wrong?

517
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:26,471
- You little...
- Wanna hit me?

518
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,806
Please!

519
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,543
We've heard all we needed to hear.

520
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,446
Lastly, was there
a particular incident

521
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,281
that made you
first consider divorce?

522
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,817
His existence itself is
my reason for divorce.

523
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,920
I've always had a jinx
related to my bar exam.

524
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,854
He's a coward,

525
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,856
so his stomach
gets upset every time.

526
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,893
It doesn't just get upset.

527
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,295
It's irritable bowel syndrome.

528
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,632
It has ruined
several of my bar exams.

529
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,670
Considering it my last chance,

530
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,773
I had just fallen asleep
the night before...

531
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,477
Well, to be precise,
in the early hours of my exam day.

532
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:10,482
Jung-yeol!

533
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,450
Oop.

534
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,453
My baby. Were you sleeping?

535
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,090
Oh, cutie.

536
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,926
My movie's getting made.

537
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,762
I signed the contract!

538
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,831
My exam is tomorrow.

539
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,334
Oh right. Did you have dinner?

540
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,036
I said my exam is in a few hours.

541
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,838
Oh right...

542
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,172
Shall I order you something?

543
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,843
Aaugh!

544
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,045
Did you eat?

545
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,782
Did you eat...

546
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,335
What the hell.

547
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,172
Wha...!
What is this!

548
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,810
What! Come on!
What...!

549
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,580
What the heck...!

550
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:19,918
What the...

551
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,254
With a severe lack of sleep,

552
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:26,091
along with the fear of
irritable bowel syndrome

553
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,726
and the pain of hunger looming...

554
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,995
I had to take the exam.

555
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,498
Well. You did pass.

556
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:40,038
I devoted my entire 20's
to studying for the bar.

557
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,607
For this woman.

558
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,544
But this woman, she only pursues
her self-realization

559
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,613
by abandoning her household
just for her measly...

560
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,015
"Measly?"

561
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,951
measly, that measly
moviemaking stuff.

562
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,486
I as well,

563
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:57,689
went through hell trying to
support this shameful man!

564
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,457
I threw away my entire youth!

565
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,227
I no longer want to waste my life!

566
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:07,399
So you're both sure
that you want this divorce?

567
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,804
- Yes.
- Yes.

568
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,742
What's with the 30-day
consideration period.

569
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,078
Just kill me when I ask for it.

570
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:22,414
3000 days we waited, 3000.

571
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:25,250
Wow, I actually
survived 3000 days.

572
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,319
- What's 30 days more?
- Jerk.

573
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,687
30 days.

574
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,422
Why, you can't wait 30 days?

575
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,357
It's only 30 more! Huh?

576
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,794
I'm setting an alert.

577
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,668
Stop following me, get lost!

578
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,871
Drop me off at my office,
I'm in a hurry.

579
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,038
Why would I?

580
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,074
Hey. Who's making
the payments to that car.

581
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,008
I am.

582
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:53,211
- So what. Get out of my face.
- Hey.

583
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,481
Fine.

584
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,817
I'll leave.

585
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,319
Hey!

586
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,854
You jerk!

587
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,656
Stop right there!

588
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,740
Back there.

589
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,808
You said the first moment
you considered divorce

590
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,243
was the day of your exam.

591
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,181
And?

592
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,117
Why did you hold that in till now?

593
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,890
- You still like me, huh?
- You're insane.

594
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,461
- You make me vomit.
- Jerk.

595
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,662
So tell me, I'm asking you.

596
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,097
"Tell me, I'm asking you."

597
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,632
I told you not to do that.

598
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,033
"Told you not to do that."

599
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,869
Don't play with me right now.

600
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:51,770
"Don't play with me."

601
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,605
Are you mad? I'm sorry then.

602
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:54,606
Stop it.

603
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:55,607
"Stop it."

604
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,342
Do it one more time!

605
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,343
"Do it one more time."

606
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,345
I'll do it two more,
three more times.

607
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,325
Yoouuu...

608
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,027
Freaaking...

609
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,730
Jaccckkk...

610
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:27,072
Assssss...

611
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,593
Rich...

612
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,762
(Day 33)

613
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,230
(Day 32)

614
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,198
(Day 31)

615
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,901
(Day 30)

616
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,186
Where...

617
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:18,957
Am I?

618
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,694
Holy crap! Sis!
You're awake!

619
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,929
Sis! Are you okay? Can you see?

620
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,164
Do you recognize me?

621
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,600
Oh my boy! My boy!

622
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,637
My Jung-yeol, oh my Jung-yeol!
My Jung-yeol!

623
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:33,838
I need to go get your father!

624
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,607
Mom! Sister's awake!

625
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:38,343
Keep your eyes open!
Keep them open!

626
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,112
Jung-yeol's father!
Jung-yeol's father!

627
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,499
So, how many do you see?

628
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,401
Two.

629
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:05,971
Look here.

630
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,806
How many do you see?

631
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,607
Say three. Three.

632
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,744
Shush, seriously.

633
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,681
- Four.
- You got it, four is right. Yes.

634
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,683
Both of them are normal.

635
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,487
As a doctor for over 20 years,

636
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,389
I've never seen
anything like this.

637
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,957
It's a miracle,

638
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:27,192
straight out of a medical drama.

639
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,361
A miracle, truly.

640
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,996
The car must've been
so sturdy, huh?

641
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,631
- Yeah.
- It's because our boy bought it.

642
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,866
- That's right.
- Right.

643
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,701
Look who bought the house...

644
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,904
We'll keep our eye on their
progress for the next few days.

645
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,107
Thank you so much.
That's all we need.

646
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,075
- Just a few more days to recover.
- Thank you doctor.

647
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,578
Thank you.
Oh, what a handsome fella.

648
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,579
Thank you so much.

649
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,949
- Oh my baby.
- Met the wrong woman,

650
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,451
had to bring you back
from the gates of hell.

651
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,353
Watch what you say!

652
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,255
Look who's struggling

653
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,656
because of your bum-like son!

654
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:02,761
- "Bum?"
- In-law, relax.

655
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,495
We didn't say he was a bum.

656
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,397
We said he was "bum-like."

657
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,699
Watch it.

658
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:10,268
This or that,
isn't that the same thing?

659
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,604
Stop trying to spin your words.

660
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,340
You want to catch
some fists tonight? Huh?

661
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,541
Excuse me.

662
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,744
Yes? What is it?

663
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,914
I'm sorry as
you seem busy, but...

664
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,151
Who are you?

665
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,587
What's wrong with him?

666
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,522
You got a screw loose?

667
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,091
I thought you fixed your accent

668
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,426
cause you didn't want to
sound like a hick.

669
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,162
My child, did you bonk
your head too hard?

670
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:38,596
Huh?

671
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,466
Hey, is your brain okay?

672
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:43,935
Na-ra! What's wrong!

673
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,271
I don't know, it's just instinct!

674
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,441
She ain't right either.

675
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,342
It's amnesia,

676
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,445
with symptoms of
dissociative identity disorder.

677
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,580
Amnesia...

678
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,981
How do we...

679
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,017
Is my son retarded?

680
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,819
No, he is not.

681
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:04,923
He won't have any impairment
to his everyday behavior,

682
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,257
but he did lose memory of himself

683
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,094
and the people around him.

684
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,865
You know how it is
in those soap operas.

685
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,267
The protagonist
gets in an accident,

686
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,770
loses their memory
and wanders about,

687
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,339
then falls in love only to realize

688
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,340
that they were born
to a billionaire family,

689
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,043
pitting their
deathbed-ridden father

690
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,247
against the poor lover,
stuff like that.

691
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:32,083
Glad they're not
long-lost siblings.

692
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,384
You must watch a lot of dramas.

693
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,788
Yes, I even rewatch
the great ones on demand.

694
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,356
Imagining that
I'm the protagonist.

695
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,858
Then how do we treat them?

696
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,326
Do they need surgery?

697
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,429
Will her memories return?

698
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,064
I suppose another car accident

699
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,066
or a timely bonk to the head

700
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,434
will bring them back.

701
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,070
- Right, doc?
- It's possible.

702
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:55,006
Dramas aren't
all based on fiction.

703
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,110
There was a true case
of an American man

704
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:02,714
who recovered after
being hit by a baseball.

705
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:06,451
- We're married?
- Married?

706
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,987
Yes. They told me
you two were married.

707
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,197
Oh, hi...

708
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:24,135
Wow, awesome.

709
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,405
I married well.

710
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,540
What the heck.

711
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,375
- Sorry?
- Huh?

712
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,011
Did you just curse at me?

713
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,113
I cursed at my past self.

714
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:40,985
Crazy wench.

715
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,388
Seriously, crazy wench.

716
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,224
Wedding Picture?

717
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,298
We look good together, huh?

718
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:01,773
Hmm?

719
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,577
What's this?

720
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,750
- Jung-yeol!
- Jung-yeol!

721
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:13,885
- Jung-yeol!
- Jung-yeol!

722
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:14,719
Jung-yeol!

723
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,555
Jung-yeol, speak to me now.

724
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,591
Jung... What the. Oh my gosh!

725
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,125
He's bleeding!

726
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,460
He's bleeding!

727
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,729
See? I told you
the rock was too big!

728
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,001
I'm your mother, you see?
Can you remember me?

729
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,104
- You told me you were.
- He's not back.

730
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,639
Oh no, what do we do...

731
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,374
I didn't want to do it,

732
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,476
but your mother
kept forcing me to.

733
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,411
Want me to call the police?

734
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,647
Call what?

735
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,750
No need, I'm his mother.

736
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,752
We're his parents.
Father and mother.

737
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,821
- Yes.
- Domestic violence.

738
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,556
No worries, doc.

739
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,226
I'm alright.
No need to call the police.

740
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:56,794
It's nothing like that!

741
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,229
It's just a family tragedy.

742
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,231
Family, we're family.

743
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,777
Excuse me.

744
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,282
Excuse me.

745
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,350
Huh?

746
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:24,021
Do you know

747
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,190
what the 15th
of next month is supposed to be?

748
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:28,860
If I remembered,

749
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,828
I wouldn't be lying here
right now.

750
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,864
Right.

751
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,801
Uh? You fixed your accent.

752
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:38,936
I got hit with a rock

753
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,037
and passed out,

754
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,105
must've wiped it out of me.

755
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:45,710
There's an alert set for that day,

756
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,012
so it must be important.

757
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,480
You don't...?

758
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,083
Maybe a wedding anniversary
or something?

759
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,052
Must be your divorce anniversary.

760
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,421
What?

761
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,458
You are getting divorced.

762
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,859
Divorced?

763
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,430
We're getting divorced?

764
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,200
You know, the court gives you
a month to deliberate.

765
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,935
To kill each other
during that time.

766
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,005
You should be relieved
for the accident.

767
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,874
If not,

768
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,143
one of you
would've killed the other.

769
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,447
No, no way.

770
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,716
It's better than
both of you dying.

771
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,020
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

772
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,521
Who in their right mind would tell

773
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,623
that to someone
who almost died...

774
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,392
Why are you speaking down to me?

775
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,062
It's been a few days,

776
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,564
we're acquainted now.

777
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,566
Well, anyways.

778
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:47,238
Live the rest of your lives...
repenting.

779
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,575
Why?

780
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,211
They're free to leave tomorrow.

781
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,951
That's great news,
I won't need to see her anymore.

782
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,485
Please watch over my daughter-in...

783
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:05,957
I mean, this lady's daughter.

784
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,558
Take care of her please.

785
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:11,896
I wish good health
for your son as well.

786
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:13,598
Okay.

787
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:17,335
But why are you trying to
split up the married couple?

788
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,442
I'm just offering
my opinion as a doctor.

789
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:28,012
Living in the same environment
from before the accident

790
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,481
will help greatly in
recovering their memories.

791
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,684
A new environment will
stimulate their brain less,

792
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,020
and delay their recovery.

793
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:40,425
- Hey, in-law.
- What.

794
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,264
As the doctor suggested,

795
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,899
why don't we keep them together

796
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,936
until their divorce is final?

797
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,306
I don't think so.

798
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,509
Our kids can't even
remember who they are.

799
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,845
Isn't it a parent's duty,

800
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,814
to try to help in any way we can?

801
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,451
It kills me that

802
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,555
they can't even remember
their own parents.

803
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,290
But what'll we do

804
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,859
if they fall in love
all over again?

805
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,962
If you have any ulterior motives,
don't even try me.

806
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:18,896
I can see clearly

807
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,165
where my Jung-yeol stands now.

808
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,435
I can say the same for you.

809
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:26,937
When the divorce is done,

810
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,506
I'm sending Na-ra
to study overseas.

811
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:30,208
That's welcome news.

812
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:34,645
I was worried your daughter
might come crying back.

813
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,181
Mmm. Sounds like something
your son might pull.

814
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,251
Never! He's the winner in this.

815
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,254
Divorce is
but a scratch these days,

816
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,122
he'll brush it off and start anew.

817
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,960
Then you agree with me on this.

818
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:50,862
Agree on what?

819
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,397
To try to recover their memories,

820
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,368
but to make sure
they get divorced.

821
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:03,107
No way! No way in hell!

822
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,076
Am I some servant?

823
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:08,246
Why do I have to
watch those idiots?

824
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,915
Because she's your older sister.

825
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:16,020
She's your daughter,
you go ahead and do it.

826
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,625
I'm not telling you to bathe her.

827
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:25,096
Just stick by her side.

828
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:28,232
Can't we just stick them
in an asylum?

829
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,104
What if they smear crap
on the wall?

830
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,572
Hey.

831
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,608
I can hear you.

832
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:42,213
Yes, it's a little rude
with us sitting right here.

833
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,952
Hey lady... I mean, mother.

834
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:51,288
I don't like this either.

835
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,091
Do I have to live with this man?

836
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,294
He's not my style,

837
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,064
and what if he tries
to force himself on me?

838
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:03,634
You two are definitely sisters.

839
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,271
Both families agreed to this.

840
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,174
Just do as you're told.

841
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:21,619
How fortunate
that I know the passcode.

842
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,860
Is this a home for a human?

843
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,597
Oh the smell, it reeks.

844
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,199
Is there a dead body somewhere?

845
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,502
This can't be a kitchen.

846
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,505
Let me take a look.

847
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,210
Thank goodness
there are no bodies.

848
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:50,848
With the husband
drinking this much, no wonder...

849
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,451
Mmm, that's all you.

850
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:58,289
How hard did he make my life,

851
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,690
causing me to drink this much.

852
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,526
Might as well buy a new house.

853
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:09,834
I can feel in these photos...

854
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,637
murderous intent.

855
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,639
Yup.

856
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:16,841
Sorry.

857
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,586
(Want to watch baseball
together next time?)

858
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,230
Ah, what the hell is this!

859
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,434
Ouch.
What do you want!

860
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,739
You have to stay
vigilant out there.

861
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,140
"Vigilant?"

862
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,242
Watch over them,

863
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,411
so they don't fall back in love.

864
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,146
I don't want to!
You do it!

865
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,549
I can't stay here all day.

866
00:46:58,616 --> 00:46:59,717
What about Dad.

867
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:03,354
I don't want to. I can't.

868
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:06,023
I have to start
preparing for auditions.

869
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:09,159
Ugh... Are you going to
keep doing that?

870
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:13,331
No, I'm going to keep doing this!

871
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:23,507
Please, mother.

872
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,976
I must've been crazy.

873
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,580
Rest up after you finish cleaning.

874
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,449
We have an important
meeting tomorrow.

875
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,286
You two.

876
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:38,289
Don't forget
that you're getting divorced.

877
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,830
Bye...

878
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,970
No. Over here. Not there.

879
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:53,971
Don't you see the dust?

880
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:57,474
No, a little more.
No, no, right next to you.

881
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,078
Why can't you see it?
It's right there.

882
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:04,715
No, the dust is here. Clean this.

883
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:05,783
No, here!

884
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,819
Hey!!
Why aren't you cleaning?

885
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,188
I am with my mouth.

886
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,493
Hey! I told you
to clean the sofa first.

887
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,095
Sheesh...

888
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,372
You're back from the dead.
Have a drink.

889
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:31,375
Was it you who was hospitalized?

890
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,513
What the...

891
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:40,084
Why is the stench of my dad
piercing through my pork?

892
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,886
Oh.

893
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,958
After my shower,
I applied a bit of toner.

894
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,600
Why do you smell like
such an old dude?

895
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:57,968
Didn't it sting?

896
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:00,337
Not my face.

897
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:04,041
How did you live for years
with this smell?

898
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,744
I mean,
I guess you don't even wash.

899
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,182
Miss Na-ra, why did you do that?

900
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,653
My hand just did it by itself.

901
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:17,788
Why'd you hit her so hard.

902
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:20,157
- Are you alright?
- What.

903
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:21,492
With the chicken leg, she...

904
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,695
I'm used to it.
She was being nice on that one.

905
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:35,172
Alright. I'm only going to
say this once so listen up.

906
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,410
The only reason you two are here
is to remember

907
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,179
how horrid your memories were.

908
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,783
Every time you see each other,
go "ugh!"

909
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,685
Uggh!

910
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,521
Aaugh!

911
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:54,658
Freak out like that. Okay?

912
00:49:58,729 --> 00:49:59,596
Should we beat her?

913
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,499
You already did.

914
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:19,783
Where are you going?

915
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:32,262
Where in the hell are you going?

916
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,733
To... To pee.

917
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,602
Hurry up.

918
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,438
Don't even think about
entering my sister's room.

919
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,574
Got it.

920
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,312
I should get him
a pissing pot or something.

921
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,248
Really, I'm just going to pee.

922
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,255
(Finding memory)

923
00:50:58,322 --> 00:51:00,624
That's a great idea.

924
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:05,128
The more people that can tell them
about their past,

925
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,297
the better.

926
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:08,966
(Hong Na-ra and Noh Jung-yeol
Finding memory)

927
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,805
Bang.

928
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,107
Ugh.

929
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,379
Huh?

930
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,850
I think your father
really likes me.

931
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:33,857
Miss Na-ra.

932
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:39,396
Your mother seems to have
an extragant side.

933
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,533
A bit much.

934
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:45,703
I'll make you remember everything.

935
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,571
We will now take
the time for all of you

936
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,306
to share your memories

937
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:52,576
with Mrs. Hong Na-ra
and Mr. Noh Jung-yeol.

938
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,011
Please come sit in the order

939
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,446
that we've provided you.

940
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,015
Number one!

941
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,016
Na-ra.

942
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,018
This is your homeroom
teacher from our senior year.

943
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:07,257
Do you remember getting caught
smoking in the classroom?

944
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,293
Let go of me!

945
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,128
I got fired because of you!

946
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:12,096
Don't you remember?

947
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,830
You said your goal in life was...

948
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,465
I'm the director!

949
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,834
To live alone
as a senior citizen.

950
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,906
- Hello?
- Pass.

951
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,474
- Ki-chul, please.
- No!

952
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,642
Auntie's waiting.

953
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:30,280
Uncle is there. He's gross.

954
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:35,085
Was I some trashy child abuser?

955
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:39,423
- I don't like him!
- I'm not safe either.

956
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,826
- No way, I'm not going!
- Hong Ki-chul!

957
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,397
Whew, Na-ra looks
fashionable today.

958
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,664
She was always pretty.

959
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,666
The mystery is
why she married this dude.

960
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,535
Right, I asked her
before they married.

961
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:53,771
Whether idiots are her type.

962
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,440
You really don't remember me? Huh?

963
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,908
Bro, bro, bro.
You remember at your bar,

964
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:59,376
celebrating their 100th day?

965
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:01,311
Na-ra was so drunk.

966
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:03,013
Hehe. So cute.

967
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,916
I fell in love
for this killer smile of yours.

968
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:08,885
Show me more, show me more.

969
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,022
- Show me...
- Get off me, prick. Having fun?

970
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:15,392
- Sorry.
- Why are you leaving?

971
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,129
Killer smile...

972
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,766
Killer... smile.

973
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,435
That's a murderer's smile.

974
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,571
Who is he trying to kill?

975
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:34,478
Sir. So we served
in the military together?

976
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,414
Yup. I was late entering the army,
cause I'm from overseas.

977
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:40,451
I gave up foreign citizenship
for this country.

978
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:44,354
Really? Your citizenship? Where?

979
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:45,756
Foreign.

980
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:52,629
Then you must know
how Miss Na-ra and I met.

981
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,931
Of course I do,

982
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,067
you ungrateful dick.

983
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:58,268
Ugh, ugh!

984
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,672
I'm the one who introduced
you to each other.

985
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:03,573
Introduced?

986
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,310
Yeah. Before I owned my bar.

987
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,379
When I was
a businessman in Gangnam.

988
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,123
We're leaving, okay?

989
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,525
- Huh?
- Good luck on your test tomorrow!

990
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,859
Okay, I'll see you in class!

991
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,195
Study! Study hard!

992
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,632
- Good luck studying!
- Got it, thank you.

993
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,004
(Businessman)

994
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,640
Yeah, what is it!

995
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:38,842
Yeah.

996
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:41,678
Why?
You need a lady?

997
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,013
Check. Check please.

998
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,681
- What?
- The check please.

999
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,683
Death? Whose death?

1000
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,919
The check, check, check!
Check! Please!

1001
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:51,188
Okay I got it, I'm not deaf!

1002
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,457
Don't worry, what kind of student
has any money these days.

1003
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,525
It's on me.

1004
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,326
Thanks brother, then I'm off now.
Food was great.

1005
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,529
- Leaving so soon?
- I have a test tomorrow.

1006
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,531
- A test?
- Yeah, final exams tomorrow.

1007
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,933
So you're saying
you need a lady quickly!

1008
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,268
- No, I'm leaving.
- Okay, I'm on it!

1009
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,270
Here, let me help you.

1010
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:09,673
You can't woo
anyone like this. Okay?

1011
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,142
No, brother. Stop.
I don't need it.

1012
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:16,146
Miss. Seoul National student,
Seoul National.

1013
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,581
Find yourself an intellectual.

1014
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:18,982
Move over.

1015
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,752
Here we go.

1016
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,321
Have fun, okay?

1017
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,160
Alcohol.

1018
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:31,995
Sorry?

1019
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,264
- Drinks!
- Drinks! Drinks!

1020
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,767
Okay, one second.

1021
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,590
You must be pretty frugal.

1022
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,426
I hear that a lot.

1023
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,261
You'll be rich one day.

1024
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,098
Among everyone trying to flaunt,
this is much better.

1025
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,283
Wasn't much of an introduction,
if we met at a club.

1026
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,118
I did introduce you.

1027
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,887
You said we met for 30 seconds.

1028
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,723
30 seconds was plenty.

1029
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,525
It was the set up
to a fateful moment.

1030
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,429
How many times have I told you
not to smile like that?

1031
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,398
Okay, okay! Go work, brother!

1032
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:43,066
Then how am I supposed to smile?

1033
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,236
You're so bitter that
your smile comes out like that!

1034
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,171
Just smile sweetly.

1035
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:49,706
Or only show your bottom teeth

1036
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,209
or something like that, okay?

1037
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:54,678
There's so many ways to smile.
Maybe your eyes can be nicer.

1038
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:55,679
Oh!

1039
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:58,615
- Why?
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

1040
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,586
- W... wai... wai... wait!
- What do we do!

1041
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:03,487
- Relax!
- What do we do!

1042
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,255
- Relax!
- She can't breathe.

1043
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:06,756
I'm going to squeeze you!
I'm going to squeeze you!

1044
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,158
What are you doing?

1045
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,401
Are you okay?

1046
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,403
Here, here, sit.

1047
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:26,510
Hey. Are you alright?

1048
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,612
Do you recognize me?

1049
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:33,317
Out of the way!

1050
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:37,154
I saved her life.

1051
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,590
Well, a little cliche.

1052
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,926
But isn't love always so?

1053
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:45,796
Love. Like a movie.

1054
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,701
So that's what brought
Miss Na-ra and I together.

1055
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:51,668
No.

1056
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:54,638
She dated the ER doctor first.

1057
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,441
Look at me. How do you feel?

1058
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:00,711
I like you.

1059
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:05,082
Those two dated for a few months.

1060
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,150
Sparks flew.

1061
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:10,854
They shared a steamy romance.

1062
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,990
So fierce.

1063
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:17,127
One day, she wore
just a doctor's coat...

1064
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,061
Stop.

1065
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:20,864
You're not very close to me,
are you?

1066
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,299
Listen till the end.

1067
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:23,767
Okay.

1068
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:29,840
So a few months go by,
but one day...

1069
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:40,717
Look over there.

1070
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,489
She's crazy.

1071
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:58,301
(Give her a break
Boyfriend cheated on her)

1072
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:07,511
Eung-gook! Here's the "screw you"
you deserve, jerk!

1073
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:15,519
From the club...

1074
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,263
Here it is, here it is.

1075
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,134
I'm sorry.

1076
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:32,836
I'm sorry.

1077
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,835
Do you recognize me?

1078
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:16,146
It's been a while.

1079
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:50,213
Jung-yeol. I heard you
made the honor roll.

1080
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:53,984
At Seoul National University?

1081
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,353
Wow. That's amazing.

1082
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,257
Are you also planning to
go to law school?

1083
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:03,026
- Wow. Really?
- Sure.

1084
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:08,732
Then I'll soon have a lawyer
as a lil bro. Ha. Haha.

1085
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,701
Whatever legal troubles
we get into,

1086
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,737
we'll be fine
with Jung-yeol by our side.

1087
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,672
That's right.
Noh Jung-yeol the lawyer!

1088
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,407
(Want to watch baseball
together next time?)

1089
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,044
Boys like this kind of stuff...

1090
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:22,946
Sorry?

1091
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,649
Unless you want to meet
some auntie at a hiking club,

1092
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,218
don't do this.

1093
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:33,757
Okay.

1094
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,092
Number.

1095
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:38,962
Number.

1096
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,298
M... mine?

1097
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:45,402
010... 4428...

1098
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,604
Four as in foreshadow...

1099
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,973
Four as in fourth wall...

1100
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,975
Two as in cut to...

1101
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,877
I contacted him first?

1102
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,347
- Me?
- Yes, you crazy wench.

1103
01:01:57,414 --> 01:02:00,717
You were blathering on about
his killer smile and whatnot.

1104
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:02,418
You had the eyes of a lionness

1105
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,721
who just found food to play with.

1106
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:06,222
Right.

1107
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,959
We should've packed some food
and went to stop her that day.

1108
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:09,993
Seriously...

1109
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,462
Where's the soy sauce?

1110
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,998
I didn't have
time to come that day.

1111
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,733
I was so busy then, remember?
Dating that guy.

1112
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,334
Full schedule. Back in my prime.

1113
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,702
Ask me any and all questions
you may have.

1114
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,238
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1115
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:26,543
Well, now that I look at him...
dressed like this...

1116
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,744
not bad.

1117
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:34,951
You should've called.

1118
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:36,786
We could've picked you up
at the terminal.

1119
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:40,356
No need. Not a problem.

1120
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,859
I've arranged this today,

1121
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,028
so just trust me and follow along.

1122
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,930
You two, keep your minds empty.

1123
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:50,033
That way the hypnotism
works better, okay?

1124
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:51,768
Hypnotism?

1125
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,603
Trust me.

1126
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,640
Breathe in.

1127
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,680
Breathe out.

1128
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,383
Breathe in.

1129
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,222
Breathe out.

1130
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,826
Breathe in.

1131
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,598
You have just lost your memory.

1132
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:24,301
Because of a car accident.

1133
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,145
Yoouuu...

1134
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,213
Jackass!

1135
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,955
Who's... the jackass?

1136
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,924
Me.

1137
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:53,129
Why do you think
you're a jackass?

1138
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,665
Na-ra...

1139
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:00,904
hates me... as her husband...

1140
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:07,710
Well then, let's visit the moment
you felt she hated you the most.

1141
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:08,945
Quickly, on three.

1142
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,613
One, two, three.

1143
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:24,727
On the morning of...
my bar exam...

1144
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:25,895
What the.

1145
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,897
Aaugh...

1146
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,432
No!

1147
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:33,269
The pot is on fire.

1148
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:36,740
And how did that happen?

1149
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:41,644
Then what do you see
inside the pot?

1150
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,885
I'm cooking cabbage porridge.

1151
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:54,724
Jung-yeol has
irritable bowel syndrome.

1152
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,796
I have to feed him
something at least.

1153
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:10,239
Today, we recovered
pieces of your memory

1154
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:13,243
through hypnotic healing.

1155
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:17,781
Please tell each other
how you felt.

1156
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:20,283
Miss Na-ra,

1157
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,653
I'm... I'm sorry.

1158
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:27,524
I didn't know you were
just trying to feed me.

1159
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:30,427
I truly am a jackass.

1160
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,996
Don't say such things
about yourself.

1161
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,699
Mr. Jung-yeol, you're such a sweet
and warm-hearted person.

1162
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,601
- Thanks to you...
- No, no, no.

1163
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,803
They might have
a friendly divorce.

1164
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,805
- Why would they divorce
- If I'm sweet and warm-hearted,

1165
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,641
- if they were getting along.
- You're an angel reborn.

1166
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:48,010
They'll start to hate
each other soon. I'm sure.

1167
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:49,712
Jung-yeol, you jackass.

1168
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,047
Stop it.

1169
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,716
Okay. Thank you.

1170
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,986
This doesn't seem right.

1171
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,156
The attempt itself wasn't bad.

1172
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,658
(Promising only
the best treatment)

1173
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:06,262
The more diverse the stimulation,

1174
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,498
the more effective it will be.

1175
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:11,167
Why are you standing
there like that, doc?

1176
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,903
Why don't you send them
to their workplaces?

1177
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,572
Their workplace?

1178
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,006
It's their warzones.

1179
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,742
Their stress from their past

1180
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,045
might kickstart their recovery.

1181
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,184
Hello.

1182
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:34,724
Oh, gosh... Amnesia.

1183
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,695
I heard about your accident,

1184
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,698
but I never thought
you'd forget me.

1185
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,535
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

1186
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:47,570
Not at all.

1187
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,774
You really can't recognize me?

1188
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,846
- Ah, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

1189
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:02,952
So how do you plan on
completing your work?

1190
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,086
For the time being...

1191
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,389
Time to go
if you're done cleaning.

1192
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:07,957
Oh! Welcome back, sir.

1193
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,326
Here, let me...

1194
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,896
- You're back early, boss.
- Over here.

1195
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,898
Boss. Have a great day.

1196
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,034
- You have a good one too.
- Yep.

1197
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,302
No rush.

1198
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,607
As the CEO of our law firm,

1199
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:29,779
I believe it'll be tough for you
to continue your duties here.

1200
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:33,449
It would be best if you
resign for health reasons,

1201
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:37,754
and return once
your memory comes back.

1202
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:39,656
Okay.

1203
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,559
But...

1204
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,895
Are you the real CEO?

1205
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,172
So you are real?

1206
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,208
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1207
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:06,316
Can we talk real quick?

1208
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,518
I'm not religious.

1209
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,286
Hong Na-ra!

1210
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,264
I heard you dropped
out of this project.

1211
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,065
Yeah. So?

1212
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,800
I've made my decision.

1213
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,536
Because I'll regret it
if I'm too late.

1214
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,105
Or you can just...
keep regretting.

1215
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,710
It's hard for me to say this
to a married woman.

1216
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:34,744
Well, you don't have to.

1217
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:36,980
I need to clear
my name from the rumors.

1218
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:38,214
What?

1219
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,149
You visited my home

1220
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,018
because we were working
on the script, right?

1221
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,486
All you did was
monitor my progress,

1222
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:44,820
making sure I was eating
and drinking properly.

1223
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,023
We had nothing
sexual going on, right?

1224
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:50,860
Ah! Now I understand.

1225
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:52,762
No wonder something felt off,

1226
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:53,963
I had a strange feeling.

1227
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,598
It made me anxious

1228
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:57,200
that I couldn't remember,

1229
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,603
But I was just popular is all.

1230
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,038
Haha...! Oh sorry.

1231
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,707
- No, thank you.
- Oh okay.

1232
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:06,376
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

1233
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,343
Let's never meet again.

1234
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:10,847
Alright, I'll go knowing that
there's no misunderstanding.

1235
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,649
Good luck on your shoot.

1236
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,084
Okay, I'm leaving now.

1237
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:24,994
No, no, no.

1238
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:27,497
I'll remember you

1239
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:38,241
Remember... you... u

1240
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,262
I can't understand myself.

1241
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,131
Why did I want a divorce?

1242
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:08,104
You're kind of cute.

1243
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,009
Sorry? Did you say something?

1244
01:10:13,076 --> 01:10:14,610
Huh?

1245
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:15,812
- What?
- Huh?

1246
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:17,413
What?

1247
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,348
I said,

1248
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:21,818
you're cu... kind of.

1249
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,420
W... what?

1250
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,756
You're cu... a lil bit.

1251
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:29,292
What...?

1252
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:32,895
What I'm saying is.

1253
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:36,099
You're c... alright?

1254
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:51,080
I'll remember
the scent of your shampoo

1255
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,701
Whoa!

1256
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,374
Miss Na-ra. Miss Na-ra!

1257
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:53,743
I... Ugh.

1258
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,486
Oh...!

1259
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:06,923
Sister-in-law. I'm sorry.

1260
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:49,966
What are you doing?

1261
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:53,603
Ahh... I'm just...

1262
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:59,442
My head hurts reading up
on all these laws.

1263
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,278
I can imagine.

1264
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,714
Whoa, what the hell.

1265
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,449
I remember!

1266
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:09,785
Like this.

1267
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,721
Like this.

1268
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:17,092
That's how you fed each other
strawberries in bed?

1269
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,128
- Like...
- Naked.

1270
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,631
Yes. That's right. Like that.

1271
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,265
It's just a fragment
of your memory,

1272
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,134
but this is a great sign.

1273
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:29,772
It means sexual instinct
is stimulating your brain...

1274
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:35,544
Why don't you
try sleeping together?

1275
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:43,886
You mean like...

1276
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:46,422
just sleeping, right?

1277
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:48,724
No, like sleeping.

1278
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,964
What's so strange about
a married couple doing so?

1279
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,933
Thanks to your mothers' efforts,

1280
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,969
we're seeing
signs of your recovery.

1281
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:04,273
But we're going to need more
willpower from the both of you.

1282
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:28,164
Ha... haha...

1283
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,155
Miss Na-ra, are you busy tomorrow?

1284
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:54,490
Would you like to
watch some baseball?

1285
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,458
The doctor did
ask for more from us.

1286
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,729
It's definitely not
a date so no pressure.

1287
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:04,734
No worries if you're busy.

1288
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:16,679
(Not busy at all)

1289
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,182
You going to an awards show?

1290
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:21,250
Where are you going?

1291
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,252
You don't need to know.

1292
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:31,961
Oh, today's trash day.
I should take out the trash.

1293
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,363
Where's the trash.
I'm in trouble if I don't.

1294
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,532
Ah, here's the trash.

1295
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,138
I thought you're just
taking out the trash.

1296
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,041
Yes. I am.

1297
01:15:48,144 --> 01:15:51,847
Ah well. You have to
look classy for the neighbors.

1298
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:55,918
Isn't that... too much class?

1299
01:15:58,254 --> 01:15:59,288
This might be overdoing it.

1300
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,835
What the hell... He's so creepy.

1301
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:18,607
Do you remember anything?

1302
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:22,745
It does feel familiar...

1303
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:26,648
But I can't remember anything.

1304
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,251
So this is how it feels
to lose our memory.

1305
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:32,588
We probably didn't hate each other
when we were here.

1306
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,462
What do you think went wrong?

1307
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:48,170
I guess some things
are better left forgotten.

1308
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:57,680
If... our memories
don't come back.

1309
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,015
Maybe, just maybe.

1310
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,554
Would you...
like to start fresh...

1311
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,655
Oh!

1312
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:12,828
- Lucky!
- Oh, wow. Awesome!

1313
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,131
Hey!

1314
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:16,632
I need to get home too.

1315
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,568
Yes, we're sorry.
We're leaving now.

1316
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,103
Young people these days
do whatever they want.

1317
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:26,675
Aren't you hungry?
Wanna eat something?

1318
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,379
How about something simple,
like pasta?

1319
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,817
Oh pasta. Pasta, pasta.

1320
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:37,419
Pasta isn't bad, but...

1321
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,623
Do you know bibimbap?

1322
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:47,830
Mmm.

1323
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:50,032
We can eat both like this.

1324
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,669
Seriously.
Why didn't I think of this?

1325
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,205
Cheers.

1326
01:17:58,374 --> 01:17:59,441
Cheers.

1327
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:54,730
You know how in dramas,

1328
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:57,099
it suddenly starts to pour.

1329
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,068
Whoa!

1330
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:04,506
Use this. I'll go get it.

1331
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,108
Oh...

1332
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,527
Miss Na-ra.

1333
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:38,307
Oh!

1334
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,109
What the hell are you doing?

1335
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,145
- Are you insane?
- Ouch.

1336
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,480
Why did you slap me?

1337
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:46,482
You're the one who kissed me.

1338
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,350
No, I never...

1339
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:51,553
I did!

1340
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,224
I'm sorry!

1341
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,293
Go ahead and slap me too.

1342
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:00,529
Why would I? Are you mad?

1343
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:04,133
W... why did you slap me?

1344
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,036
I don't know, I...

1345
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:10,673
Suddenly, a nice memory
crossed my mind.

1346
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:15,444
Well... that's a relief.

1347
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,550
- Here, hold this.
- Huh?

1348
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:22,818
I'll get the other umbrella.

1349
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,556
Shall we get one more drink?

1350
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:32,194
Yeah... I mean...

1351
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:33,429
Yes.

1352
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:37,232
I didn't slap you on purpose.

1353
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:41,070
It kind of hurt, but I'm OK.

1354
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:53,749
Whoa. Sorry.

1355
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,158
I thought you were making gambas.

1356
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:04,593
Yeah, you were cooking up a storm.

1357
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,295
I burned it all.

1358
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,364
The wok is so hard to use.

1359
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,700
Hey Tak-ho,
are you still riding that coin?

1360
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:13,669
Go home, jerk. Get lost.

1361
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:16,138
- Go do that at home.
- Bro, bro, let him be.

1362
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,940
He needs alcohol
to endure the pain.

1363
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,476
Wow, it's been years
since I saw this group.

1364
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,313
Oh, Ae-ok is here!

1365
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:25,781
Where's Young-ji?

1366
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,115
She's busy with a fling.

1367
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:29,251
A 20-year-old, twenty.

1368
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:32,888
Oh, Johnny's here too.

1369
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:35,657
Johnny?" Why is he Johnny?

1370
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,227
My English name is Johnny.

1371
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,462
You better cut it out
while I'm still nice to you.

1372
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:43,198
Do you know he always
texts me late at night?

1373
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:46,435
Look.

1374
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:49,404
"You asleep?" "You asleep...?"
"You asleep?"

1375
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:50,505
"Are you asleep?"

1376
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,074
Stop drinking so much,
you sleazeball.

1377
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:53,542
What are you going to do
if she's not asleep?

1378
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:55,010
To say goodnight.

1379
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,612
Goodnight, nonsense.

1380
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:59,448
You trying to give her nightmares?

1381
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:01,750
Look, look!

1382
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:04,086
I told you they walked in
with a different energy.

1383
01:22:04,153 --> 01:22:06,088
Hey. With how things
are turning out,

1384
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:07,923
just don't get divorced.

1385
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,526
Well, fine by me...

1386
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,994
See, look at
our hip brother Ki-bae.

1387
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,262
He almost got divorced twice,

1388
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,931
but they're still going strong.

1389
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:17,633
He's something else.

1390
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:19,268
- Mmm.
- Twice?

1391
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,505
Divorce turned out to be
harder than I thought.

1392
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,241
With property division,
consultations,

1393
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,876
the consideration period...

1394
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,144
You guys don't know this.

1395
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:31,146
On the 2nd time,
we even stamped our papers

1396
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:33,182
and went our separate ways.

1397
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,718
But half a year later,
I went for some paperwork.

1398
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,620
And it showed
I was still legally married.

1399
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:39,988
Hmm? Why?

1400
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,090
Both my wife and I were so lazy,

1401
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,660
none of us reported
it to the district office.

1402
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,161
Apparently if you don't
report it in 3 months,

1403
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:47,830
the divorce is
automatically voided.

1404
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,465
Oh, is that right?

1405
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,600
It's a hassle going to court again

1406
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:52,768
so we're still living together.

1407
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:54,903
Isn't breathing
a hassle for you too, bro?

1408
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,938
Lil jerk. It's never
a hassle to beat your ass.

1409
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,807
- Alright, that's enough.
- You could kill me with that.

1410
01:22:58,874 --> 01:23:00,509
Johnny?" Huh?
Do you want to sleep?

1411
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:02,811
Now that you've made it this far,

1412
01:23:02,878 --> 01:23:04,946
- just stop fighting and make up.
- Us?

1413
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:06,314
- Yeah.
- Us? Oh.

1414
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:07,449
How about a love shot?

1415
01:23:07,516 --> 01:23:08,316
- Love shot?
- Love shot.

1416
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:09,351
- Love shot is great.
- Let's do it.

1417
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:10,419
- Ah, we're good.
- Let's.

1418
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,320
- No, no.
- Love shot!

1419
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,922
Love shot!

1420
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,025
Love shot! Hey!
Love shot!

1421
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,527
There we go! They're doing it!

1422
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:21,897
Wow! Woo!

1423
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:26,869
Oh, so sweet!

1424
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:28,070
Wow!

1425
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:41,082
Another love shot

1426
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,684
and they might have a baby.

1427
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,861
Ah. I'm so sorry. So sorry.

1428
01:23:52,928 --> 01:23:55,597
My guy just wouldn't go home.
Sorry, I'm late.

1429
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:57,399
Why are you outside,
where's Na-ra?

1430
01:23:57,466 --> 01:23:58,733
- She's inside.
- Why in my bar of all places...

1431
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,702
Did you drink a lot? How much?

1432
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,538
We popped nine vodka bottles.

1433
01:24:02,738 --> 01:24:03,638
Nine?

1434
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,006
Nine's good, let's open our tenth.

1435
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:06,074
Let's go, go!

1436
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:07,742
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't go in yet.

1437
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:10,245
- I think it's time to go home.
- Yeah.

1438
01:24:10,312 --> 01:24:12,447
Why. It's been years
since we got together.

1439
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,548
No, no! Young-ji!

1440
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:14,449
- Young-ji!
- Young-ji!

1441
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,584
Go, go!

1442
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:18,420
Gosh, what do I do?

1443
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:20,255
I'm supposed to be the boss here.

1444
01:24:20,956 --> 01:24:22,057
Seriously.

1445
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:25,193
Why in my bar of all places...

1446
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,528
Hold up!

1447
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,085
You frickin...

1448
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,656
Ugh, why here, in my bar?

1449
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:01,930
Never came home?

1450
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:04,633
Yeah. Their phones are off too.

1451
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,936
Surely they're not together,
are they?

1452
01:25:08,003 --> 01:25:09,070
No clue.

1453
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:11,106
But they never came home.

1454
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:13,809
They're back!

1455
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:17,913
Did you follow the garbage truck

1456
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,382
all the way to the incinerator?

1457
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,619
- What is this?
- Hi, Na-mi.

1458
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:26,455
Today I'm...

1459
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,490
Whoa. Does a bull
live in this house?

1460
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:33,362
Wow.
Feels like a newlywed's home.

1461
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,997
Nice work.

1462
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:39,067
Nice!

1463
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,403
We were drinking at
brother Ki-bae's bar

1464
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,971
and knocked out altogether.

1465
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:43,939
Nobody asked.

1466
01:25:44,006 --> 01:25:45,474
Where's sis?

1467
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:49,477
Oh, uh. Miss Na-ra?
She's not home?

1468
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:50,946
Why is the door open?

1469
01:25:51,013 --> 01:25:52,314
Oh, Mr. Jung-yeol.

1470
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:55,617
Oh, Miss Na-ra.
You must've met your friends too.

1471
01:25:55,684 --> 01:25:57,285
We spent all night
chit-chatting at her place.

1472
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:58,920
Ah, sounds like fun.

1473
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:01,123
We had a lot to catch up on.

1474
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:05,660
Drink up! Drink up!

1475
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,396
Drink, drink, drink!

1476
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:10,365
Alright! One, two, three, go!

1477
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:12,968
What brings you to my home,
my home, my home

1478
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:15,604
I came to bring flowers,
flowers, flowers

1479
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:16,938
What kind of flowers,
flowers, flower

1480
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,940
Yup. They're singing.

1481
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:21,142
Rock paper scissors!

1482
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:23,412
It feels like
a housewarming party.

1483
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:39,227
(90 Days)

1484
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,071
Cutie.

1485
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:27,743
Do you remember anything?

1486
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:30,579
- Nope.
- Oh.

1487
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:33,648
Drop your honorifics.

1488
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:38,820
Okay.

1489
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:44,225
Why can't we remember...

1490
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:46,995
Do you want to try again?

1491
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:49,331
Sorry.

1492
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,000
That's what I wanted to ask you.

1493
01:27:58,507 --> 01:28:01,409
Pisses me off the more
I think about it.

1494
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:05,514
The owner of that small ass club
wants to judge me?

1495
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:08,016
What the...

1496
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:15,190
What are you
doing in my... Aaugh!

1497
01:28:23,899 --> 01:28:25,133
Sorry.

1498
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:27,369
Sorry.

1499
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:40,148
Mom! Na-ra is raping Jung-yeol!

1500
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:42,484
No, not Jung-yeol!

1501
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:44,486
Sister is forcing herself on him!

1502
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:47,189
- Sister-in-law!
- Not him, her!

1503
01:28:50,692 --> 01:28:52,060
Jung-yeol!

1504
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:54,662
Jung-yeol! Jung-yeol!

1505
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:56,698
- Jung-yeol! Jung-yeol!
- What's wrong?

1506
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:58,266
- Oh, Jungyeol!
- What's wrong with him?

1507
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,435
I don't know...
Oh my gosh!

1508
01:29:01,236 --> 01:29:02,437
How embarrassing.

1509
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:06,374
What the hell did I slip on?
So humiliating.

1510
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:07,309
Are you okay?

1511
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:10,212
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Really, I'm fine.

1512
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,615
Oof. I'm alright. Calm down.

1513
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:15,617
Geez.

1514
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:17,586
Jung-yeol...
I mean, brother-in-law.

1515
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,187
- It's my fault, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

1516
01:29:19,254 --> 01:29:22,290
- Let's visit the hospital.
- No, we're really alright.

1517
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,625
I'm fine.

1518
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,393
I'm totally fine.

1519
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:27,695
Sis-in-law, don't be sorry.

1520
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:29,798
Nothing to be sorry about.

1521
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:33,301
What you saw earlier,

1522
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,137
I hope you can gloss it over
with your mother.

1523
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,307
And here, take this.

1524
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:42,844
Go buy whatever you want. Okay?

1525
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:45,714
Stop it, you're scaring me.

1526
01:29:46,281 --> 01:29:48,983
Just take it,
no need to feel pressured.

1527
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,151
Here, take it.

1528
01:29:50,986 --> 01:29:53,388
Come on. Why won't you take it?

1529
01:29:53,455 --> 01:29:56,224
When an elder gives you something,
you say thank you and take it.

1530
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:58,593
Come on now. It's okay.

1531
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,462
Do you see someone there?

1532
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:02,631
Oh no, he's gone crazy!

1533
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,232
Oh my god!

1534
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:07,502
Sis-in-law, come on. Just take it.

1535
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:10,839
Take this and go to the mall.

1536
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,041
Or better yet, the luxury section.

1537
01:30:13,108 --> 01:30:15,510
And buy yourself one.

1538
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,946
- Or two. Or three...
- Jung-yeol!

1539
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:25,186
Were his eyes always open?

1540
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:28,857
- Hey, Jung-yeol!
- He opened his eyes!

1541
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:30,458
Yo! Noh Jung-yeol!

1542
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,661
- Are you Jung-yeol or Dung-yeol?
- I'm your best friend.

1543
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,629
- Are you okay? How old are you?
- Are you a man or a woman?

1544
01:30:34,696 --> 01:30:36,264
Tell us.

1545
01:30:42,037 --> 01:30:43,104
He looks alright.

1546
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:45,106
Hey, bring your sister in here.

1547
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:46,174
Yeah.

1548
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:48,143
- Are you alright?
- Jung-yeol.

1549
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:51,880
Do you know
how much Na-ra was crying?

1550
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:53,181
She stepped outside to calm down.

1551
01:30:53,248 --> 01:30:54,382
She'll be back soon.

1552
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:58,520
Prick. I canceled my class
and sprinted over here.

1553
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,188
I'll take liquor
as my reward, okay?

1554
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,523
Are you alright?

1555
01:31:02,324 --> 01:31:04,292
- Hey.
- Speak up.

1556
01:31:06,161 --> 01:31:08,129
- You okay?
- Noh Jung-yeol.

1557
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:21,409
I clearly warned you, didn't I.

1558
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:25,347
That you and Na-ra are
supposed to get divorced.

1559
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:31,753
- I pounced on him...
- Shut your mouth.

1560
01:31:36,725 --> 01:31:38,593
You must not have anywhere to go,

1561
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,161
so you can stay here
until the divorce.

1562
01:31:40,929 --> 01:31:43,331
I'm also to blame
for putting you two in here.

1563
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:46,034
You go pack your stuff.

1564
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:49,237
It's my problem. Let me handle it.

1565
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:51,740
I'm your mother.

1566
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,308
Unless you want to burn
this bridge,

1567
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,642
do as I say.

1568
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,555
I've prepared for you
to study abroad.

1569
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:09,958
Get ready to leave
once the divorce is final.

1570
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:13,261
Study abroad? So suddenly?

1571
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:15,797
It was already decided
before your accident.

1572
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:19,601
It wasn't supposed
to be this soon, was it?

1573
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,806
You don't have to study.

1574
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,609
Just go cool your head.

1575
01:32:29,144 --> 01:32:30,979
Please give me some time.
Jung-yeol and I...

1576
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:32,814
Don't you dare bring his name up!

1577
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:45,060
Even when everyone
opposed the wedding,

1578
01:32:45,827 --> 01:32:47,595
I was always on your side.

1579
01:32:48,463 --> 01:32:49,998
As long as you were happy,

1580
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,267
I closed my eyes, blocked my ears,
shut my mouth,

1581
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:54,836
and accepted it all.

1582
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:58,639
You don't remember,

1583
01:32:58,706 --> 01:33:01,943
but you struggled
so much living with him.

1584
01:33:04,112 --> 01:33:07,048
And it hurt me so much
to see you hurting.

1585
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:11,085
That's a past
I don't even remember.

1586
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:13,321
We don't know
what the future holds.

1587
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:19,194
Na-ra. You two are already over.

1588
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,229
What if you start again,

1589
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:23,331
but your memories return?

1590
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:26,234
What will you do then?

1591
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:28,636
Will you stay unhappy
all over again?

1592
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:32,540
Do you want me to see that again?

1593
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:35,510
I can't do it.

1594
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:38,379
I refuse to see you in pain.

1595
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:41,916
Ever again.

1596
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:28,129
Why are you here?

1597
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:32,734
Did you leave something?

1598
01:34:37,539 --> 01:34:39,274
Your memory's back, isn't it?

1599
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:47,549
How did you know?

1600
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,618
I can feel it.

1601
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:55,823
Seems like the eyes of someone
who hates me.

1602
01:34:57,859 --> 01:34:59,527
I'm sorry if you felt that way.

1603
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:05,099
What are you going to do?

1604
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:14,209
Your mother's right. We're...

1605
01:35:18,813 --> 01:35:21,416
I'm glad at least
you found your memories.

1606
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:40,368
(Court)

1607
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:53,414
They told us to wait 30 days,

1608
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:56,150
but...

1609
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,221
The ruling was so fast. Wasn't it?

1610
01:36:02,023 --> 01:36:03,391
Have a nice life.

1611
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,994
- Do you remember your social?
- Yes, I do.

1612
01:37:13,061 --> 01:37:15,696
- Do you remember a beer?
- Of course, I do.

1613
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:17,065
Then get me a beer.

1614
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,201
It's in the fridge, right?

1615
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:29,811
If our memories don't come back,

1616
01:37:31,112 --> 01:37:35,583
do you think we can start fresh?

1617
01:37:40,455 --> 01:37:41,322
Lucky!

1618
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:50,832
I'm glad at least
you found your memories.

1619
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:55,269
(Hope our memories
never come back...)

1620
01:37:57,905 --> 01:37:59,741
I'm late again...

1621
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,965
I want to go to New York too.

1622
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,368
Just take what you need.

1623
01:38:27,435 --> 01:38:29,470
We can send you the rest.

1624
01:38:29,971 --> 01:38:33,307
Ah, I want to go to New York too.

1625
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:35,610
You go ahead and sleep.

1626
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:40,581
I'm sleeping with sis tonight.

1627
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,750
I'm going to miss her.

1628
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,275
(Lawyer's License Certificate)

1629
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:22,557
Yo, Noh Jung-yeol!
Hurry, come outside real quick!

1630
01:39:22,657 --> 01:39:24,058
The owner is here!

1631
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:27,495
- What?
- The owner of this house is here!

1632
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:30,998
Yes, mother-in-law.

1633
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:36,337
What are you doing still here?

1634
01:39:37,872 --> 01:39:39,306
I'll be out within today.

1635
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:41,142
Hurry please.

1636
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,845
It makes me unpleasant
that you're still here.

1637
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:48,149
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- My Na-ra will be

1638
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:53,721
taking the 8:20 p.m. flight
from Incheon Airport.

1639
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:56,424
But I'm here to tell you
this is my house.

1640
01:39:57,758 --> 01:40:00,327
Understood.
Thank you for everything...

1641
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:01,596
No need.

1642
01:40:02,263 --> 01:40:05,566
Just make sure

1643
01:40:05,633 --> 01:40:07,268
you leave before 8:20 p.m..

1644
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:10,972
You don't have much time.

1645
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:19,747
Incheon Airport, Terminal 1.

1646
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:34,262
Hey.

1647
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:36,664
Why are we eating on the floor,

1648
01:40:36,731 --> 01:40:38,232
there's a table here.

1649
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:41,435
That's not mine either.

1650
01:40:41,502 --> 01:40:43,738
Mother-in-law bought us that.

1651
01:40:47,642 --> 01:40:49,277
What time was her flight again?

1652
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,713
8:20 p.m., Incheon Airport.

1653
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,248
Her enunciation was on point.

1654
01:40:56,284 --> 01:40:58,386
I think it's time
for you to leave...

1655
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:04,892
What changes,
I can't win her back now.

1656
01:41:04,992 --> 01:41:08,262
I was just offering you
to see her off,

1657
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:11,098
but I guess
you want to win her back?

1658
01:41:11,499 --> 01:41:12,433
Seems like it.

1659
01:41:14,936 --> 01:41:16,037
It's too late.

1660
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:19,507
We stamped the papers already.

1661
01:41:23,277 --> 01:41:24,845
Did you report it
to the district office?

1662
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:26,314
No.

1663
01:41:27,982 --> 01:41:28,950
What the...!

1664
01:41:31,819 --> 01:41:33,354
I thought you had 3 months
till it's voided.

1665
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:36,757
This jerk... had lines too!

1666
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:40,227
I'm done with crypto.

1667
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:44,932
It's all gone.

1668
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:46,767
They gave him lines...!

1669
01:41:47,335 --> 01:41:50,037
Right,
your divorce isn't final yet.

1670
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,138
You still have 3 months
to report it,

1671
01:41:51,205 --> 01:41:52,306
90 days.

1672
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:55,042
You stupid coward.

1673
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:58,379
It's not over yet!
Okay? You can turn this around!

1674
01:41:58,479 --> 01:41:58,979
Wait! Shhh.

1675
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:01,382
This isn't the time
to be slurping noodles...

1676
01:42:01,882 --> 01:42:03,150
Quiet.

1677
01:42:03,884 --> 01:42:05,353
This is the climax.

1678
01:42:06,354 --> 01:42:07,822
What the hell
are you talking about?

1679
01:42:08,522 --> 01:42:09,624
Flashback.

1680
01:42:10,491 --> 01:42:14,061
Remember the beautiful times
you shared with Na-ra.

1681
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,230
That's it, reminisce.

1682
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:18,265
Get in your feels.

1683
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:24,471
Reminisce... Beautiful times...

1684
01:42:24,538 --> 01:42:25,439
Freaking Dung-yeol!

1685
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:28,576
Hey.

1686
01:42:28,676 --> 01:42:31,245
How many times have I told you.

1687
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:33,014
If you can't aim, then sit to pee!

1688
01:42:33,114 --> 01:42:35,249
I've been saying it all year,
haven't I?

1689
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:37,885
Lift the seat, piss,
then drop it again!

1690
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:43,591
Ew, your mouth smells like ass!

1691
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,493
- Dam...
- Come on...

1692
01:42:46,527 --> 01:42:47,662
Good job, DJ.

1693
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:49,597
Got em.

1694
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,701
Oh no. Why is my hand here?

1695
01:42:57,571 --> 01:42:58,939
Stupid idiot.

1696
01:42:59,306 --> 01:43:00,474
- Open your eyes!
- Please shoot me!

1697
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:01,875
Just go home!

1698
01:43:01,942 --> 01:43:03,310
- Don't you dare move!
- Dad!

1699
01:43:03,377 --> 01:43:04,945
To support this shameful man,

1700
01:43:05,046 --> 01:43:06,847
I threw away my entire youth!

1701
01:43:07,148 --> 01:43:08,516
What is this?
What the hell!

1702
01:43:10,785 --> 01:43:12,353
You know how directors are.

1703
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:14,822
- How do you feel?
- I like you.

1704
01:43:15,389 --> 01:43:18,359
Why would you take care of
a classmate's sister.

1705
01:43:18,426 --> 01:43:19,527
You're jobless.

1706
01:43:20,094 --> 01:43:22,229
You're insufferable!
Jobless! Jobless!!

1707
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:24,198
- Because I'm jobless.
- Job...

1708
01:43:24,265 --> 01:43:25,166
Jobless!

1709
01:43:26,467 --> 01:43:28,769
- How was it?
- What was that?

1710
01:43:29,437 --> 01:43:31,005
Aren't flashbacks
supposed to be beautiful?

1711
01:43:31,939 --> 01:43:33,507
It's goddamn infuriating!

1712
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:37,544
Oh, uhh...

1713
01:43:37,611 --> 01:43:42,016
Try not to think post-marriage.

1714
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:43,584
Let's try again pre-marriage.

1715
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:44,952
Whatever, whatever.

1716
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:47,521
I'll think about it on the way.

1717
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:50,291
- Alright, let's hurry!
- Let's go!

1718
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,695
(Incheon Airport)

1719
01:44:02,303 --> 01:44:03,904
Seriously,
are you a turtle or what?

1720
01:44:03,971 --> 01:44:06,940
Forget about the damn brakes,
just step on it!

1721
01:44:07,007 --> 01:44:07,775
Are we on a field trip?

1722
01:44:07,842 --> 01:44:09,343
Can't you see
Jung-yeol's in a hurry?

1723
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:11,178
Wow, this jerk.

1724
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:13,047
They gave him mad lines.

1725
01:44:13,114 --> 01:44:15,916
Step on it!
We are going to miss the plane!

1726
01:44:15,983 --> 01:44:17,084
Oh?

1727
01:44:17,518 --> 01:44:20,087
- Oh?
- Yo, yo, step on it!

1728
01:44:20,154 --> 01:44:21,955
No, the steering wheel,
steering wheel!

1729
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:26,193
Is this the fastest you can go?
Step on it, there we go!

1730
01:44:28,295 --> 01:44:29,964
Don't be late next time.

1731
01:44:31,866 --> 01:44:33,167
Okay.

1732
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:52,653
Hurry!

1733
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,655
Hey, hey, hey!
What time is the flight again?

1734
01:44:54,722 --> 01:44:56,924
- 8:20 p.m.!
- Hurry!

1735
01:45:02,897 --> 01:45:05,032
- Here it is!
- Hurry!

1736
01:45:05,733 --> 01:45:06,734
Come on, hurry!

1737
01:45:07,334 --> 01:45:08,335
Almost here.

1738
01:45:08,536 --> 01:45:09,303
Follow me!

1739
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,472
- No, wait! Wait!
- It's almost here! Wait!

1740
01:45:17,178 --> 01:45:18,379
Sorry! Sorry!

1741
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:20,848
Sorry!

1742
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:24,685
So sorry!

1743
01:45:24,752 --> 01:45:26,987
- Give that to me!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1744
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:29,190
You're dressed like that?

1745
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:31,025
Ah, I feel so sorry to them.

1746
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:35,863
See ya.

1747
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:37,498
See ya.
Take good care of yourself.

1748
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:42,203
Na-ra!

1749
01:45:43,704 --> 01:45:45,172
Killer timing.

1750
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:48,408
Why'd he bring those idiots,
so unromantic.

1751
01:45:48,475 --> 01:45:50,110
Hong Na-ra!

1752
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:02,122
Okay, we're good.

1753
01:46:06,961 --> 01:46:08,429
That was close.

1754
01:46:11,799 --> 01:46:16,837
We... watched a movie
like this long ago.

1755
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:21,609
I'm sorry, Hong Na-ra.

1756
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:26,680
I've always been
a little late, haven't I?

1757
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:30,985
Even when we first kissed.

1758
01:46:32,953 --> 01:46:34,989
Even when I almost
lost you to another guy.

1759
01:46:36,957 --> 01:46:38,792
Even going to my bar exam...

1760
01:46:40,294 --> 01:46:41,528
And even now.

1761
01:46:44,498 --> 01:46:45,966
I read somewhere,

1762
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:50,938
that break ups happen

1763
01:46:51,805 --> 01:46:53,307
because bad memories
start to outweigh the good.

1764
01:46:54,141 --> 01:46:56,443
I thought that's why
we were getting divorced,

1765
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:00,581
but I had forgotten
how much I loved you,

1766
01:47:01,815 --> 01:47:03,951
how precious you were to me,

1767
01:47:05,552 --> 01:47:09,990
because I let
the bad memories blind me.

1768
01:47:13,527 --> 01:47:14,528
Suddenly...

1769
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,032
I found myself worrying,

1770
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:21,268
what if you leave me

1771
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:23,337
once your memories return.

1772
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:27,241
I don't want to run away

1773
01:47:27,308 --> 01:47:28,809
as the only one cherishing
these memories.

1774
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:38,719
All these beautiful moments
I remember,

1775
01:47:39,653 --> 01:47:40,654
I really want...

1776
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:45,526
you to have them too.

1777
01:47:58,205 --> 01:47:59,540
What...?

1778
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:05,412
Sorry. You looked so serious,

1779
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:06,981
I missed my timing
to take them out.

1780
01:48:25,165 --> 01:48:26,600
I'm sorry, Hong Na-ra.

1781
01:48:33,574 --> 01:48:37,244
I've... always been
a little late, haven't I?

1782
01:48:38,645 --> 01:48:40,481
- Even when we first kissed...
- Let's consider it heard.

1783
01:48:41,849 --> 01:48:44,018
I'm glad to see you smiling again.

1784
01:48:45,753 --> 01:48:47,354
I'm leaving now.

1785
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:50,691
Bye.

1786
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:52,893
- No.
- Hey...

1787
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,929
- N... Na-ra.
- You can't just... go.

1788
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:14,815
You... You...

1789
01:49:15,416 --> 01:49:18,218
You should've called her earlier!

1790
01:49:18,285 --> 01:49:20,788
Don't you have a phone?
You don't?!

1791
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:22,422
What are you doing
not using your phone?

1792
01:49:22,489 --> 01:49:23,890
Is this the Joseon Dynasty?

1793
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:25,525
You thought you'd get
here just in time to say,

1794
01:49:25,592 --> 01:49:27,327
"Na-ra... Please don't go..."

1795
01:49:27,428 --> 01:49:28,895
And you expected her
to come back?!

1796
01:49:28,962 --> 01:49:31,498
Did you think
she would run in for a kiss?

1797
01:49:31,598 --> 01:49:32,699
What do we do with him?!

1798
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:36,470
Is he stupid?! What an idiot!

1799
01:49:37,638 --> 01:49:39,139
Let's go.

1800
01:49:40,607 --> 01:49:42,076
It's kind of awkward.

1801
01:49:45,012 --> 01:49:46,780
- Let's go.
- Wait.

1802
01:49:47,181 --> 01:49:48,915
- Let's go.
- Wait.

1803
01:49:48,982 --> 01:49:50,317
Stop it.

1804
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,199
Maybe you should text her.

1805
01:50:05,866 --> 01:50:08,435
- I forgot my phone.
- Ah...

1806
01:50:09,369 --> 01:50:12,172
Whew, this sucks.

1807
01:50:15,509 --> 01:50:16,543
Uh?

1808
01:50:19,313 --> 01:50:23,684
No, no, no! Sir, wait!

1809
01:50:23,784 --> 01:50:28,622
- Sir, wait!
- No, no! Slow down!

1810
01:50:29,523 --> 01:50:30,991
You got taxi fare?

1811
01:50:35,896 --> 01:50:37,698
That looks dangerous.

1812
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:41,068
Noh Jung-yeol.

1813
01:50:48,342 --> 01:50:49,610
Can you give us a minute?

1814
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:53,080
Do you want to go
look at your phone?

1815
01:50:54,181 --> 01:50:55,349
Oh!

1816
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:11,498
Why are you here?

1817
01:51:14,067 --> 01:51:15,435
Why did you...

1818
01:51:17,004 --> 01:51:18,939
Why! Did! You! Come! Back?

1819
01:51:22,743 --> 01:51:23,544
Oh, sorry.

1820
01:51:24,778 --> 01:51:26,513
I forgot to report our divorce.

1821
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:29,583
You knew.

1822
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:32,753
I started to think it was unfair.

1823
01:51:33,787 --> 01:51:35,222
What about it?

1824
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:37,824
You must've divorced me

1825
01:51:37,891 --> 01:51:40,227
because the bad memories
outweighed the good.

1826
01:51:41,094 --> 01:51:42,362
But I didn't.

1827
01:51:43,897 --> 01:51:45,966
I only have good memories.

1828
01:51:48,735 --> 01:51:49,903
That's unfair.

1829
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,973
You have to wait
until my memories come back too.

1830
01:51:54,474 --> 01:51:57,978
Or, even if they don't come back.

1831
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:00,447
Wait out the reporting period.

1832
01:52:01,215 --> 01:52:03,383
I'll make my decision
in three months.

1833
01:52:08,655 --> 01:52:09,990
No...?

1834
01:52:12,092 --> 01:52:14,094
That's what I was saying earlier.

1835
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:37,017
Then... do you want to kiss?

1836
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:38,585
No, why?

1837
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:44,091
- We have to.
- Says who?

1838
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:46,860
Okay, just a peck. Quick peck.

1839
01:52:46,927 --> 01:52:48,195
I don't want to.

1840
01:52:48,629 --> 01:52:49,863
Don't you watch movies?

1841
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:51,932
This is
when we're supposed to kiss.

1842
01:52:51,999 --> 01:52:53,300
I haven't watched any.

1843
01:52:54,167 --> 01:52:56,436
Forget it, I don't want it either.

1844
01:52:56,503 --> 01:52:58,505
(Right now, do it!)

1845
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:18,391
I'm going to marry him.
Approve of us.

1846
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:19,559
Huh?

1847
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:24,431
General Hong. Relax.

1848
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:27,801
When did you two meet?

1849
01:53:27,868 --> 01:53:30,003
- Yesterday.
- Shoot them both.

1850
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:33,006
M... mother. Mother.

1851
01:53:33,073 --> 01:53:34,408
I'm sorry, Mother.

1852
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:35,809
Babe, run!

1853
01:53:35,876 --> 01:53:39,146
(Im Cheol Hyeong Hwang Sein
Jo Min Soo)

1854
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:42,316
Look.

1855
01:53:42,883 --> 01:53:46,419
We hate each other to
death when we're together,

1856
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:47,921
but miss each other to
death when we're apart.

1857
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:52,759
Doc. Why the hell do
our brains work like this?

1858
01:53:52,826 --> 01:53:54,728
If I knew that,

1859
01:53:54,795 --> 01:53:57,030
do you think I'd
be watching dramas all weekend?

1860
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:03,970
(Kim Sunyoung Jeon No-Min)

1861
01:54:04,037 --> 01:54:05,572
Bro, the crypto era is over.

1862
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:07,007
It's time for stocks.

1863
01:54:07,074 --> 01:54:08,475
Everyone is saying no,

1864
01:54:08,542 --> 01:54:10,543
but this is the perfect
buying opportunity.

1865
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:11,745
According to the M.o.M. reports,

1866
01:54:11,812 --> 01:54:13,013
the whole world
is buying right now.

1867
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:14,414
(Yun GyeongHo
Lee Sang Jin Won U)

1868
01:54:14,514 --> 01:54:15,515
The crypto era is over.

1869
01:54:15,582 --> 01:54:17,217
Now is the perfect time.

1870
01:54:18,085 --> 01:54:20,754
When you're a student,
it's natural not to have money.

1871
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:22,689
Don't worry. I'm loaded.

1872
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:24,224
Drink up.

1873
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:26,760
That little fox.

1874
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:30,097
Oh?

1875
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:34,334
(Johnny: "You asleep?")

1876
01:54:34,401 --> 01:54:36,269
(Song Hae Na Eom Jiyoon)

1877
01:54:39,373 --> 01:54:41,208
(Kang Haneul)

1878
01:54:44,411 --> 01:54:46,113
(Jung Somin)

1879
01:54:54,821 --> 01:54:57,457
(Directed by Nam Dae-joong)

1880
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:18,345
Let's start the audition.

1881
01:55:18,445 --> 01:55:21,381
I wrote this song
after being inspired by

1882
01:55:21,448 --> 01:55:23,517
my sister and her husband.

1883
01:55:23,617 --> 01:55:24,751
Go ahead.

1884
01:55:41,835 --> 01:55:43,770
I'll remember

1885
01:55:44,304 --> 01:55:47,607
The dirtied Dyson

1886
01:55:47,841 --> 01:55:51,378
For me PTSD

1887
01:55:51,678 --> 01:55:54,748
Your stench I'm not okay

1888
01:55:54,815 --> 01:55:56,716
Okay Not okay

1889
01:55:56,783 --> 01:55:58,318
Please stop drinking

1890
01:55:58,385 --> 01:56:00,487
Please wash yourself

1891
01:56:00,654 --> 01:56:03,156
I'm going crazy for you

1892
01:56:03,723 --> 01:56:08,028
Baby don't go

1893
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:23,577
Baby don't go
