1
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,680
Xiao Chuan.

2
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,320
The master saved us from the famine.

3
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,020
He's been feeding and clothing us until now.

4
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,360
How could you do such terrible things?

5
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,039
Thank you for your kindness, master. May you be blessed with great fortune.

6
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,370
May you live a long life.

7
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,560
Father, this child is so pitiful.

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,010
Please have mercy, young miss.

9
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,280
Let this child work at your mansion.

10
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,620
Just a bowl of rice would be enough. Please be merciful.

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,880
What's your name?

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,380
My name is Qin Muchuan.

13
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,759
Xiao Chuan,

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,440
we come from poor backgrounds.

15
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,120
We must know how to be proper people.

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,720
We must learn to be grateful.

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,400
You should know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
Shut up.

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,220
Second Master,

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,520
shut up, shut up!

21
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,640
Xiaochuan was foolish and committed a sin.

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,240
Take this old life of mine to atone for the master's sins.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Shut up.

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,840
shut up, don't say anymore.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,090
You all came to laugh at me, didn't you?

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
You came to laugh at me,

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,480
didn't you all?

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,720
Why are you all targeting me?

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Why?

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
Yan Qiu.

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,520
Why have I never been in your heart?

32
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,079
in your heart,

33
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,079
I'm always just a servant, aren't I?

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,940
I'm going to marry you.

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,920
I just want to see what the Shen family's wealth and glory

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,920
really tastes like.

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,010
Qin Muchuan.

38
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,760
You truly disgust me.

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,640
Fine.

40
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm disgusting?

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,440
Everyone, listen up!

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,050
Shen Hong is extremely hypocritical.

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,970
Years ago, together with Lin Xiangsheng,

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,900
they killed fourteen members of the Wei family.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,440
Fourteen lives.

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,560
The Wei family? It's unbelievable.

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,880
Is that true?

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,680
Old Chairman.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,280
Then he raised the flag of patriotism again.

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,900
This is the good person you chose.

51
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,160
How wonderful indeed.

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,480
Qin Muchuan.

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
Go on.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,480
If you dare to spread rumors,

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,280
I'll risk these old bones of mine to take your life.

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
The Shen family is utterly hypocritical.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,480
You have no right to speak in front of me.

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,320
Neither do you.

59
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,720
Your brother is too.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,600
Let me tell you,

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,920
Yan Qiu and I are the only perfect match in this world.

62
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
No one else.

63
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,140
The Wei family's disaster...

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,540
I know about it.

65
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,960
But I didn't learn about it

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,920
as a member of the Shen family.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,500
I am a survivor of the Wei family's disaster.

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,560
Wei Mingyuan.

69
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,040
You're Old Wei's son?

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
How is that possible?

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,780
Can you explain in detail?

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,560
Yes,

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,890
it's been so many years.

74
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,320
This can't be.

75
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,960
Let me see, this can't be.

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
This is absolutely impossible.

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
This can't be.

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
How could this be possible?

79
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,000
The Wei family's disaster

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,880
wasn't Uncle Shen Hong's fault.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,080
Qin Muchuan,

82
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,280
you have no idea how broad-minded Uncle Shen Hong was.

83
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,160
It's you who

84
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,760
distorted Uncle Shen Hong's care for you.

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,409
You're full of resentment.

86
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,040
If Uncle Shen Hong were still alive,

87
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,159
seeing you like this,

88
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,960
he would be heartbroken.

89
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,800
Let me tell you,

90
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
no matter how bad I am,

91
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,370
it's better than you recognizing a thief as your father.

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,640
I've long let go of past grudges.

93
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
Whether the stories of the past are truth or slander,

94
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,640
they can't hurt me at all.

95
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
Of course,

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,940
you can't hurt Yan Qiu either.

97
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,040
Your grudge with the Shen family doesn't fall on Yan Qiu.

98
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,480
Yan Qiu,

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,960
Yan Qiu, look at me.

100
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,120
Look at me, Yan Qiu.

101
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Yan Qiu.

102
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,440
Take him away.

103
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,020
Brother Mingyuan.

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
Yanqiu.

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,840
It's me.

106
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm back.

107
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Look, my good niece.

108
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,880
Not a single newspaper in Shanghai

109
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,920
is spreading rumors about your father and the Wei family's past.

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,960
Although your uncle is old,

111
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,720
he still has some influence.

112
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
Thank you, Chairman.

113
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
Have you made your decision?

114
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,280
I have.

115
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,159
I want to donate all of my and Second Uncle's shares to the Chamber of Commerce.

116
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,560
Part of it will be used for drug rehabilitation at the charity hall,

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,280
and the rest will be used to support the anti-Japanese efforts in North China.

118
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,159
Good, that shows some of your father's spirit.

119
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,120
But don't worry,

120
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,440
as long as I'm here,

121
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,680
no one will dare to spread rumors about your father.

122
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm not doing this to restore my father's reputation.

123
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,170
I just want to be like my father,

124
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,080
to do something practical for our country.

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,440
That's a great way of thinking.

126
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,360
Your father tried to save the country through industry,

127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,620
but unfortunately met with misfortune.

128
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,280
Look at the situation now.

129
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,520
The Japanese are on our land,

130
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,180
committing all sorts of evil.

131
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
And those officials?

132
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,920
They're living in luxury every day,

133
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,880
fighting among themselves for power and profit.

134
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,440
Don't they know

135
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,520
The country,

136
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,760
the country!

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Without a country, how can there be a home?

138
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,480
Chairman,

139
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,040
you're right.

140
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,200
We've only found six of the Lin family's criminal hideouts so far.

141
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,480
That's not all of them.

142
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,080
You must find the map of drug hiding locations.

143
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,920
Qin Muchuan.

144
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,370
Is the Shen family your family?

145
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
My surname is Qin.

146
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
not Shen.

147
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,920
Don't give me this high-sounding nonsense.

148
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,780
I don't understand why you hate the Shen family so much.

149
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,960
You know what Lin Xiangsheng did to the Wei family.

150
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,640
Yet you still want to frame Uncle Shen Hong.

151
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,920
You know,

152
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,380
Do you know what I hate most about you elites?

153
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,250
You're always looking down on others,

154
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,160
criticizing everyone else's lives.

155
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,720
You and Shen Hong,

156
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,880
you're all the same.

157
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,010
No matter how wronged you feel,

158
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,210
it doesn't justify helping Lin Xiangsheng commit evil.

159
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
You have a choice.

160
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,160
I don't.

161
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,840
Lin Xiangsheng is colluding with the Japanese to traffic drugs.

162
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
You're the middleman.

163
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,440
If you have any conscience left,

164
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
tell me

165
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,210
all the locations where you've hidden the drugs.

166
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
I won't tell you.

167
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,810
You won't find them either.

168
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,440
You're beyond help.

169
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,010
Have you thought about your grandfather?

170
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,440
I bought a house for my grandfather in the countryside.

171
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,160
I even hired servants.

172
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,680
My grandfather and I don't have to be servants anymore.

173
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
But all of this

174
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,760
is gone now.

175
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
Why do you insist on protecting a traitor?

176
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
Just go.

177
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,080
Whether you're Shen Junlin or Wei Mingyuan,

178
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,240
I never want to see you again.

179
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,160
Please,

180
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,820
please take care of Yan Qiu for me.

181
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,620
You don't deserve to say her name.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,560
