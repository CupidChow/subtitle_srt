1
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,120
Mute.

2
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,480
I'm begging you.

3
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,960
Please don't hurt her, okay?

4
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,080
Jingyin, Jingyin.

5
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
You better behave yourself.

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,100
And here I thought you were some big shot.

7
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,160
Do you want to make some money?

8
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,320
What money?

9
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Who are you?

10
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,440
I never thought I'd see the day when the high and mighty Miss Shen

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,120
would end up like this.

12
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,840
Where's Shen Junlin?

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,300
Why isn't he here with you?

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,960
It's you.

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
Mute.

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,720
Surprised, aren't you?

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,890
What are you going to do?

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,320
What else could I do after kidnapping you?

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,479
Naturally, to make you watch.

20
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,320
The one you love risking their life to save you.

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,920
Why have you become like this?

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
You remember this place, don't you?

23
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,639
This is where we were kidnapped last time.

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,160
Back then, even my own servants didn't recognize me.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,560
It's different now.

26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,040
The Lin family is mine now.

27
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,760
I feel that I'm truly happy now.

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,360
This isn't you, Jingyin.

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,640
The person I know is gentle and kind.

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,360
Not like how you are now.

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,880
Shen Yanqiu.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,280
Do you know how much I've suffered?

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,140
When I was young, people saw me as an easy target.

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,440
They lined up to bully me.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,360
At home,

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,720
my father never acknowledged my existence.

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,840
My sister was clearly an ignorant fool,

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,690
yet my father always treated her like a treasure.

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,440
In the Lin family, I was invisible.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,900
No one ever cared about me.

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
This is not a reason for you to become bad.

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,160
Wake up, Jingyin!

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,080
Shen Yanqiu

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,160
You have no right to judge me.

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,840
I've become like this

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,170
It's all because of you.

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,120
Because of your existence,

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,080
No matter what I do,

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,480
Qin Muchuan can't see it.

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,120
Let go of me, let go of me!

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,840
Follow me.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,720
Hurry, load it onto the ship.

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,880
Move faster over there.

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,079
You too, hurry up over there.

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,960
I wonder if the Second Master...

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,890
...has rescued the young miss yet.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,020
Lin Jingyin, stop!

58
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,540
Brother Mingyuan!

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,240
Yanqiu!

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,280
Shen Junlin!

61
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,760
Wei Mingyuan, you came quite quickly.

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,720
What exactly do you want?

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
Brother Mingyuan, leave quickly!

64
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,520
Don't worry about me!

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,780
Don't come any closer!

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,840
Wei Mingyuan, you impersonated Shen Junlin to gain Shen Hong's trust,

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
and deliberately got close to my father.

68
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,240
You deceived my sister's feelings,

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,560
and caused Muchuan to be imprisoned.

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,620
You've done so many terrible things,

71
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,760
yet you want to live happily ever after with the Shen family's young miss.

72
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
What gives you the right?

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
Qin Muchuan, that was his own...

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,519
...fault.

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,880
Lin Jingyin, even now...

76
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,480
...are you still so deluded?

77
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,760
Shen Yanqiu, you clearly don't like Muchuan,

78
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
yet you deceived his feelings.

79
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,280
You're such a hypocrite.

80
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Lin Jingyin!

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
Lin Jingyin!

82
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
Let Yanqiu go first.

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
I'll meet any conditions you have.

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,440
You're in no position to negotiate with me.

85
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,770
What do you really want?

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,480
This place is filled with more than just drugs.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,980
There are explosives too.

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,680
What if I set this place on fire?

89
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,930
How do you think the reporters will cover the Shen family tomorrow?

90
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,890
Lin Jingyin!

91
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,720
You've been deceived by the Japanese.

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,450
The real drugs are being transferred at the dock.

93
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,680
You dare lie to me?

94
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,210
The Japanese have been using you from the beginning.

95
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,360
Wei Mingyuan, are you afraid of death?

96
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,840
I can let you trade one life for another.

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,340
If you're not brave enough to die,

98
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,040
I'll help you by killing Shen Yanqiu.

99
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,160
You'll grow old alone,

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,720
as the head of the Shen family.

101
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Go quickly!

102
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Lin Jingyin.

103
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,680
A life for a life.

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,480
Is that so?

105
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Then take my life

106
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,860
in exchange for Yanqiu's.

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,360
No, Mingyuan!

108
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,080
You can't die!

109
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,280
No!

110
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,159
I've waited so long for you.

111
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,320
Mingyuan!

112
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,159
Shut up!

113
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,680
I don't have time for your nonsense.

114
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
No, no!

115
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,900
Brother Mingyuan!

116
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,440
Yanqiu.

117
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,700
Being able to reunite with you

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,120
is a blessing from heaven.

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,060
I cherish the time we've spent together.

120
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,240
Brother Mingyuan, no! I don't want you to die!

121
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,360
Wei Mingyuan!

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,890
My patience is running out.

123
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
Jingyin, I beg you!

124
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
I beg you to let him go, Jingyin!

125
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
We are good friends.

126
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,360
Aren't we, Jingyin?

127
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,960
I won't allow you to say that.

128
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,480
Stay back, all of you.

129
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,700
Don't come any closer.

130
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,409
Lin Jingyin, tell them to release Yanqiu.

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,920
Hurry!

132
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,760
Let her go!

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Nobody move!

134
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,920
Lin Jingyin,

135
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,280
you're the real liaison between the Lin family and the Japanese.

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Aren't you?

137
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,440
Just kill me.

138
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,120
Don't run. You won't escape today.

139
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,080
Colluding with the Japanese,

140
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,840
do you know what you're doing?

141
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,159
I've done everything better than all of you,

142
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,360
yet everyone despises me.

143
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,280
Why?

144
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,700
Make them leave first.

145
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,290
Get out! All of you, get out!

146
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,170
Lin Jingyin,

147
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,040
you're too full of yourself.

148
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,700
The Japanese can't be trusted at all.

149
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,280
You've been deceived by them from the beginning.

150
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,520
The real drugs aren't even here.

151
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Open your eyes and see what's really in here.

152
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Let's go, Yan Qiu.

153
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
Yan Qiu.

154
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
It's alright now.

155
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,690
You scared me to death, Brother Mingyuan.

156
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,400
it's okay now.

157
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm right here, aren't I?

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,600
Promise me.

159
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,700
you won't do such dangerous things again in the future.

160
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,480
Mr. Lin! Mr. Lin!

161
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
Mr. Qin, he...

162
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,480
Mr. Qin has escaped from prison!

163
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
Hurry up and find him!

164
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,080
Wait.

165
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
It's towards the dock.

166
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,900
Bring guns. Go to the dock.

167
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,290
The Japanese are making moves at the dock.

168
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Jiang Feng is still there.

169
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
We can't let the drugs leave Shanghai.

170
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,580
Yan Qiu, hurry!

171
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,840
Huanghe Road, newsstand.

172
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,640
You must wait for me to come back.

173
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,440
Xiao Chuan.

174
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
Why, why are you here?

175
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,920
What are you...

176
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,880
Where's the box?

177
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,890
Where is the box?

178
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,640
What box?

179
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Did you run out from inside?

180
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,210
Something's wrong.

181
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,850
There must be a problem.

182
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,840
Xiao Chuan.

183
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Come back to the police station with me.

184
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,680
Don't make any more mistakes.

185
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,760
Autumn grows long, missing autumn's form.

186
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,560
Zhou Cai Wang Wang Wang Wang Shao Jiang Xu Wu Zhao Tian Dong Zheng Yang Wu Hong Liu Liu Ma Wu Zhou He Gu Ren Yang Ji Xiang Liu Cai Li Tian Yin Lin Yuan Chuan Hao Yin Lin Lin Yuan.
