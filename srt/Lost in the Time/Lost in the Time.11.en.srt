1
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:46,970
Jingyin.

2
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,560
Oh, it's you?

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,080
My elder sister went to Suzhou.

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,800
Father said since the Lin family has made an appointment,

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,480
we can't stand them up.

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,280
It would be impolite.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,840
So he asked me to entertain the guests.

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm glad it's you.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,620
Otherwise, I'd have to argue with your elder sister again.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,960
Can I sit in the same boat with Mu Chuan later?

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Of course you can.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
Yan Qiu, this outfit is beautiful.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It suits you well.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,600
Thank you for the compliment, Manager Qin.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,400
I bought it.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,460
Second Master has always had good taste.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,640
Xiao Chuan,

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,690
you'll be in the same boat with Jingyin later.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,039
Take good care of her.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,690
Yan Qiu, why don't you come with us?

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,800
The circles of us young people and the elders

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
are different after all.

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,960
Well, I

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,600
prefer to control the direction of the boat myself.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,560
Oh no,

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm not comfortable with you being on a boat alone.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,259
Come on, just sit with Xiao Chuan.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,640
Make the most of this opportunity.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,520
Go ahead.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,800
Then you can make the one with the yellow flag.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,460
It matches your clothes well.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,960
Uncle, why do you look so nervous in my camera?

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,240
Come on, smile.

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,040
I didn't expect Shanghai to have such beautiful scenery.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,960
Yan Qiu, don't stand up.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,040
You might fall.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
It's okay, I can swim.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Come here, let me take a photo of you.

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,840
I don't like having my photo taken.

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,800
Come on.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,840
Why are you being such a wimp?

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Alright.

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,360
Smile.

44
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Don't move around, it's dangerous.

45
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,880
Uncle.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,170
Are you afraid of water?

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,280
I'm not.

48
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,740
I never thought you'd be afraid of water, Uncle.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,280
Mu Chuan.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
Ah.

51
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,140
My father has agreed to our marriage.

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,260
Jingyin, the Lin family has high standards.

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,400
I'm not worthy of you.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,560
What about Shen Yanqiu then?

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,760
Isn't she the same as me?

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,890
Why are you always thinking about her?

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,700
She's different from you.

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,760
I truly like you.

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,460
She only sees you as a brother.

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,880
No matter how she treats me,

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,480
my sincere feelings for her will never change.

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,280
Let's change positions.

63
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,160
Don't move.

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,890
Uncle, I think the boat is leaking.

65
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,440
Hurry, paddle back quickly!

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,120
Yan Qiu!

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,360
Uncle!

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
Yan Qiu! Yan Qiu!

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,280
Help!

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Help! Help!

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,440
Ming Yuan, go quickly!

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Don't worry about me!

73
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,440
Jun Lin!

74
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,700
Let's go together!

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,260
Yan Qiu is still waiting for your letter.

76
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,200
You must make it out alive.

77
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,620
If we're leaving, we leave together.

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,080
Help!

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,040
Yan Qiu.

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,080
Oh, Mu Chuan, it's dangerous!

81
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Don't go over there!

82
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,810
Stay where you are, don't move!

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,280
How cruel of you!

84
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,080
Jing Hao,

85
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,760
you're about to get married.

86
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,620
Your father is really having a hard time letting go.

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,880
I remember you've always loved Suzhou silk.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,240
Tomorrow, I'll go to Suzhou to get more for your dowry.

89
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,280
Tomorrow?

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
I've made plans to go boating with Yan Qiu and Jun Lin tomorrow.

91
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Oh my,

92
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
preparing your dowry is much more important than boating!

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
Listen to your father, dear.

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,760
Oh, alright, I'll go then.

95
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,680
I'll send a few more people to accompany you.

96
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,640
Preparing the dowry is a big deal.

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,180
You should stay there for a few more days.

98
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,160
Alright, alright, I'll do as you say.

99
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,040
Father, I'll be going now.

100
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,040
Alright, alright.

101
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Father, take good care of yourself.

102
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,760
Okay, go on then.

103
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,560
Go on.

104
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,220
Is the study a place you're allowed to enter?

105
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,960
Let her in.

106
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,120
Hmph.

107
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,520
Father, you called for me?

108
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,080
Your sister has something to do tomorrow.

109
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,360
she can't go boating.

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,120
You'll go to the Shen family's appointment in your sister's place.

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,840
We'll all be family soon.

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,210
Get to know them better.

113
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,080
Tomorrow, I...

114
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,040
Qin Muchuan will be there too.

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,520
I know what's on your mind.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,480
You've agreed?

117
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm your father.

118
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
You've grown up, and I've grown old.

119
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,700
If you've set your heart on that Qin Muchuan boy,

120
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
I can't say much against it anymore.

121
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,480
I'll help arrange your marriage in a while.

122
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,540
Thank you, Father.

123
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,280
But you need to do something for me.

124
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,159
You must make sure Shen Yanqiu and Shen Junlin

125
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
board the boat with the yellow flag.

126
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,440
Father, what do you mean?

127
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Since the Shen family won't listen,

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,640
they don't deserve to cooperate with our Lin family.

129
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,640
Father, Yanqiu is my friend.

130
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,920
I can't...

131
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,440
Naive.

132
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,640
You have to choose between your friend and Qin Muchuan.

133
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
The boat with the yellow flag.

134
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Shen Yanqiu boarded it.

135
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
Your daughter obeyed you.

136
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,720
But you still want me dead.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
To you,

138
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,919
I'm always just a disposable pawn.

139
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,810
The boat leak was intentional.

140
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,340
Do you remember who told you to board the boat with the yellow flag?

141
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,740
It was Jingyin.

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,600
But her boat sank too.

143
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,620
It was Lin Xiangsheng.

144
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,600
He used threats and bribes.

145
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,880
He used others to do his dirty work.

146
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,320
and he could still distance himself afterwards.

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,360
Just like when he swallowed up the Wei family back then.

148
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,890
As long as Lin Jingyin died,

149
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,800
no one would suspect Lin Xiangsheng was behind it all.

150
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,400
But Jingyin is his daughter too!

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,280
For someone like Lin Xiangsheng,

152
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,320
sacrificing a daughter he never cared for

153
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,280
means nothing.

154
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,520
The tragedy of the Wei and Shen families

155
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,120
is because of such inhumane villains.

156
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,400
All these years,

157
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,680
I don't know how you've managed.

158
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,360
In the days to come,

159
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,800
I will never disappear from your world.

160
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,420
Second Master.

161
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,520
Second Master.

162
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,320
Do you have...

163
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Spit it out.

164
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,920
Hey, carry on.

165
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,880
Come back.

166
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,690
Tell me what's going on.

167
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,960
Lin Xiangsheng is using the joint venture company's name

168
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
to import a batch

169
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,120
of sulfonamide into the port.

170
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
It will arrive at 7 PM tomorrow night.

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,380
The Japanese are pillaging in the north,

172
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
and there's a sea and land embargo.

173
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,320
Yet Lin Xiangsheng can still import top-quality goods from Japan.

174
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,520
There must be something fishy going on.

175
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,720
We can't wait any longer.

176
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
We'll take action tomorrow.

177
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,480
Alright.

178
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,320
Qiu Zhang Si Qiu Shen
