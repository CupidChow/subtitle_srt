1
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,240
I'm sorry, Second Master.

2
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,800
I promise I won't bother you again in the future.

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,400
Get to the point.

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,040
The information I gathered...

5
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,770
The young man said Xiaochun and Lianye were cleared out overnight.

6
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Where did they go?

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,720
We didn't dare to watch the docks too closely.

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,560
We need to find Lin Xiangsheng's contact as soon as possible.

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,120
To obtain crucial evidence of his drug trafficking with the Japanese.

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,560
Today's incident was his doing.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,880
He's framing me for the accident that happened to the Shen family's only daughter.

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,240
He's trying to force me to be the Lin family's dog.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,840
Don't worry, Second Master.

14
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,170
If anyone dares to harm the young miss,

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,720
I'll fight them to the death.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,400
You should go back and rest now.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,530
Yes, Second Master.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,370
Years ago, on our way back home,

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,680
our ship sank and we were in danger.

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,520
Although we fortunately survived,

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,850
I watched helplessly as the fire consumed my entire family.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,330
Even though all the clues pointed to Lin Xiangsheng,

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
the newspapers covered it up with a single word: accident.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,759
After all these years, I've finally uncovered

25
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
evidence of his smuggling and treason.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
He's been secretly collaborating with Japan.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,560
However, the intermediary,

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,960
who could it be?

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,160
The northern wind guides the nomad horses.

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,040
The southern birds nest on southern branches.

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,880
The northern wind guides the nomad horses.

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,480
The southern birds nest on southern branches.

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,079
Darling.

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,160
Darling.

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,480
Wake up, I've made breakfast for you.

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
Ming Yuan.

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,160
You're so good to me.

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
Aren't we already...

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,340
Why do you still call me Ming Yuan?

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,220
Why is your face so red?

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,290
Are you running a fever?

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,079
Ruyue, Ruyue, your home...

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,640
It's just a bit hot.

44
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,560
It's so hot.

45
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,680
Isn't it only May?

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,040
What did you want to see me about?

47
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,920
I have something to tell you.

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
Our last infiltration failed.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
We alerted them to our presence.

50
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,760
Xiaochun and She...

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
This base has already been abandoned by the Japanese.

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,840
If we want to find the middleman again,

53
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
it won't be easy.

54
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,440
To investigate the smuggling between the Japanese and the Lin family,

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,680
and the secret of drug trafficking,

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,610
you even became their son-in-law.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,810
That's quite a sacrifice you've made.

58
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
That's not the point.

59
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,680
The point is that Lin Xiangsheng is colluding with the Japanese in the drug business,

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,040
bringing disaster to the country and its people.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,370
We must eliminate him as soon as possible.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,480
How is that not the point?

63
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
What did you just say?

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,240
What I mean is...

65
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,640
Lin Xiangsheng wants to kill me.

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
then frame you for it.

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,700
to force you to surrender.

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,740
And he's using the Japanese invitation to test you.

69
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,890
That shows he doesn't trust you at all.

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
So...

71
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,080
Uncle,

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,480
apart from your good looks,

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
do you have any way

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,920
to gain Lin Xiangsheng's trust?

75
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,640
For example, pretending to kill me

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,980
to deceive him into trusting you.

77
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,180
Shen Yanqiu, listen to me carefully.

78
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,080
As long as I'm alive,

79
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,080
no one can harm you.

80
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,040
Why don't we put on another act?

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,159
Let's say...

82
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
The eldest daughter of the Shen family,

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,520
the second largest shareholder of Shen Corporation,

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,360
the sole heir of the Shen family,

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,920
Shen Yanqiu officially declares war on the cruel and tyrannical Shen Junlin.

86
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,970
I think Lin Xiangsheng would be very pleased to see that.

87
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,280
The most important thing is how to let him know.

88
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,120
Junlin.

89
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,960
Junlin, Junlin.

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Are you home?

91
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,840
Look, the messenger has arrived.

92
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,290
It's your turn to play along with me this time.

93
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,640
Go on, go on.

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
Junlin, please open the door.

95
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,080
Junlin.

96
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,640
Junlin, open the door.

97
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,880
Let me explain.

98
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,480
I really didn't know about yesterday's incident.

99
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,080
Junlin.

100
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,920
Lin Jinghao.

101
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,880
Stop knocking.

102
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,409
My uncle won't see a heartless woman like you.

103
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,480
Shut up, Shen Yanqiu!

104
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,560
Don't think you can slander me in front of Jun Lin.

105
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,080
He won't believe your lies.

106
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,560
He is my husband, after all.

107
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,920
You know better than anyone if you're framing me.

108
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,880
A woman like you...

109
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,760
how could you be worthy of entering my Shen family?

110
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,420
Shen Yanqiu, shut your mouth!

111
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,240
You brought this upon yourself.

112
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,520
I should have let them kill you.

113
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,760
Don't think just because your father has some dirty money...

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,640
that you can do whatever you want.

115
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,520
Let me tell you,

116
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,960
I am the eldest daughter of the Shen family.

117
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,480
I will never allow a woman like you to marry into our family.

118
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
Shen Yanqiu, you...

119
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,320
What are you doing?

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,650
Why are you touching me?

121
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,560
I'll kill you!

122
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,290
Uncle, she's killing someone!

123
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,720
She's hitting people!

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,440
You're committing murder!

125
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,840
Uncle!

126
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,480
Shen Yanqiu, have you gone mad?

127
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,760
Jun Lin, look!

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,090
She actually pushed me!

129
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Are you hurt?

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
Uncle,

131
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,960
I can't believe you're still protecting her.

132
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,640
Your heart is as black as hers.

133
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,360
You two are truly a perfect match.

134
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,159
You...

135
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,650
Shen Yanqiu, apologize to Jinghao right now.

136
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
In your dreams.

137
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
Look at her.

138
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,700
Alright, Jinghao. Don't stoop to her level.

139
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,700
I'll see you off here then.

140
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,480
Jun Lin.

141
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
I don't want to leave.

142
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,080
Be a good girl now.

143
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,940
I have some things to take care of.

144
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,880
Then please keep an eye on Yan Qiu.

145
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,680
I understand.

146
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,680
You can go now.

147
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,720
Bye-bye.

148
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,040
Uncle, do you always walk so quietly?

149
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,900
You scared me to death.

150
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Uncle.

151
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
However,

152
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,050
you did a pretty good job acting today.

153
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,360
Think about it, is there any other way?

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,170
Do you really think Lin Jing and I are a good match?

155
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,760
At least it seems that way.

156
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,440
What do you think, Uncle?

157
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,640
The compatibility you mentioned

158
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,570
makes me feel very uncomfortable.

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,880
Young Miss.

160
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,380
Second Master.

161
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

162
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Please, carry on.

163
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,370
I'll go, I'll...

164
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,760
Autumn grows long, thoughts of autumn linger.

165
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,600
Rui.

166
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,440
Zhuo Zihui Zhen, Tian, Jiang Deyu Dong Yajia Qi, Xiao Xiaoqiu Jingjian, Rui.

167
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Shu Jiami Junxi Hui, Zhuo Zihui Zhen, Tian, Jiang Deyu Dong Yajia Qi, Xiao Xiaoqiu Jingjian, Rui.

168
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
Shu Jiami Junxi Hui.

169
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,840
Du.

170
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Pu.

171
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,680
Zhao.

172
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,560
Cheng Yong.

173
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,560
Xiang, Li Zhang.

174
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,240
Ya Yan.

175
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,690
Chen Cao.

176
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,720
Ya Yan.

177
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,360
Wen Yong.

178
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,880
Lian Zhang.

179
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Wen Yong.

180
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,440
Ru.

181
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,480
Ru.

182
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,880
Ru.

183
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,240
Wen, Zhao Qi.

184
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Ye Si, Wen, Zhao Qi.

185
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,160
Ye Si.

186
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,220
