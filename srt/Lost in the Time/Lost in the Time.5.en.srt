1
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,570
Is your throat feeling better?

2
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, much better.

3
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,920
Be careful not to catch a cold.

4
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Your father instructed me to take good care of you before he passed away.

5
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,840
I've forgotten about my father.

6
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,400
I'm all grown up now.

7
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,300
From now on, you...

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,289
are not allowed to run off anymore.

9
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
Yan Qiu,

10
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,840
My men have found out.

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,370
Those arsonists in black yesterday were sent by the Lin family.

12
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,479
Lin Xiangsheng.

13
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,600
Lin Xiangsheng has been coveting the Shen family for quite some time.

14
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,320
He's the closest to the Japanese.

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,280
He's the most likely to get morphine.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,400
So you're saying my father's death is related to him?

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,920
I can't be certain yet.

18
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,440
But I've spread the word early on.

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,640
Dr. Liu.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,040
He had crucial evidence of your father's true cause of death.

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,370
Unfortunately, it's all come to nothing now.

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,200
Your plan was ruined by me.

24
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,600
It's alright.

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,640
At least you know now.

26
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Your father's death is inextricably linked to the Lin family.

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,240
So you've gone to great lengths to be the villain in the Shen family.

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,720
All to avenge my father.

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,079
At least you know now.

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,640
We are not enemies.

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
No matter who you are.

32
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,320
Thank you.

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
Yan Qiu,

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,080
you only need to know

35
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,520
I will never hurt you.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
Second Master, Second Master!

37
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
The car to the Lin family is ready.

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
You may continue.

39
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
What action plan do you two have now?

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,890
How about including me?

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,490
I don't want you to be in danger.

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,960
Do you think I'll just be a good little miss of the Shen family?

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
I can include you.

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,820
But you have to follow my lead.

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,880
Then tell me your plan first.

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,520
You'll act out a scene with me.

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,690
I'll deliberately spread a rumor.

48
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,960
Saying that Lin Xiangsheng is behind the Shen family's young miss being in danger.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Deal.

50
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
So, are we allies now?

51
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,360
Hello,

52
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,159
ally.

53
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
Hello,

54
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,920
ally.

55
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,640
Second Master, I will definitely find out who you are.

56
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,159
And your purpose.

57
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,600
Extra! Extra!

58
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
Shen Hong's body is barely cold.

59
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,800
The eldest daughter of the Shen family was attacked at the Lin family's storage area.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
The Lin and Shen families are at odds.

61
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,360
An orphaned girl was hurt in the crossfire.

62
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,400
Extra! Extra!

63
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,360
Extra! Extra!

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,680
Useless fools!

65
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,610
Such a big living person hidden in our own warehouse,

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
and nobody even knew about it.

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,280
And now the Shen family is smearing my reputation.

68
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,760
Now all the shipping companies in Shanghai are condemning the Lin family,

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,760
saying that we, the Lin family, are disloyal and ungrateful,

70
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,440
cruel and ruthless.

71
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,560
The Shen family has always liked to stir up public opinion.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,159
It's nothing to be afraid of.

73
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,600
It's nothing to fear.

74
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,600
Qin Muchuan,

75
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,480
do you know

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,160
how much money I've lost just on this Tianjin deal?

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,680
Rather than fighting a war of words in the newspapers,

78
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,240
why not use something more tangible

79
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,960
to officially bind the Lin and Shen families together?

80
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,820
This way, all the rumors will collapse on their own.

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Once you, sir, have completely gained control over Shen Junlin,

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,600
the Shen Group will eventually be in your hands.

83
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,640
That's not a bad idea.

84
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Go and arrange it.

85
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,760
What is it?

86
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,680
Father, you promised me to promote Mu Chuan.

87
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,200
The mess he created for me,

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,730
I haven't even settled the score with him yet.

89
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,360
Father, you can't go back on your word.

90
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,080
I think you've gone too far.

91
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Always taking sides with outsiders.

92
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,210
Always revolving around a man.

93
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
Shameless, get out!

94
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,159
Get out now!

95
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
Father, please calm down.

96
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,560
Try the new dessert I made.

97
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,490
It's delicious.

98
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,240
Father indeed hasn't loved you in vain.

99
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Jun Lin just said he wants to come over later.

100
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,130
To marry my precious daughter,

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,360
is his good fortune.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,760
Mr. Lin.

103
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,640
Jun Lin.

104
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,280
Jun Lin.

105
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Uncle Lin.

106
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,200
Your hair has turned much whiter.

107
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,640
You've all grown up.

108
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,240
How can I not age?

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Fortunately, uncle has always been in good health.

110
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,040
But Yan Qiu, you've been through quite a scare.

111
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,679
Are you alright?

112
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,039
Thanks to Uncle Lin's blessing, I'm fine.

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,600
Shen Yan Qiu, what do you mean?

114
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,760
My father has nothing to do with what happened to you.

115
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,200
Those newspapers are all talking nonsense.

116
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Jing Hao.

117
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,080
Uncle Lin.

118
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,280
That's not what I meant.

119
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,240
Don't cry, don't cry.

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,240
It's all dirty water splashed by opponents.

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm used to it.

122
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,360
Jun Lin, look at her, pretending to be kind like a cat crying over a dead mouse.

123
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Do you know how much money these rumors have cost our Lin family?

124
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Do you know?

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,480
Jing Hao, is this how you talk to your sister?

126
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,880
Uncle Lin, please don't blame Jing Hao.

127
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,000
She's been like this since she was little.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's okay.

129
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,160
Jun Lin.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,680
You've done a lot to bring the Lin and Shen families closer,

131
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,240
I've seen it all.

132
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,160
I've seen it all.

133
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,560
Why don't we establish a new company together?

134
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,280
Let's call it Tongxiang Shipping.

135
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,360
From now on,

136
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
all of Lin family's cargo will be handled by the Shen family.

137
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,640
We'll split the profits 50-50.

138
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,770
As for your marriage with Jing Hao,

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,860
let's have it as soon as possible.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,880
Some people can't stand to see our two families unite.

141
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,360
I won't let them have their way.

142
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,220
My second uncle is really fortunate,

143
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,290
to marry such a wonderful wife as Sister Jing Hao.

144
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,000
Of course.

145
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Then thank you, Mr. Lin, for your blessing.

146
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,200
We're family now, no need for formalities, haha!

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,760
Mr. Lin, this is the invitation from Xiaochun He Club.

148
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,800
for the charity dinner.

149
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,960
Xiaochun He Club.

150
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,460
Please take a look.

151
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,420
What the hell is this Japanese Medical Association asking me to donate money again?

152
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Lin Xiangsheng has been coveting the Shen family

153
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,400
for quite some time now.

154
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,360
He's the closest to the Japanese and most likely to get the morphine.
