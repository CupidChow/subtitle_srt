4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
I left a dark seal on the door.

5
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
The Tanshen Talisman

6
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,200
shows the magic used by the person.

7
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,920
If the person uses the magic of Yin and Xie,

8
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,400
it will show black.

9
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,040
If he uses the Taoism,

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,200
it will show white.

11
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
If he is an ordinary person,

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
it will show no light.

13
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,720
Then,

14
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
what is the red one?

15
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,360
Evil cultivation.

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Evil cultivation?

17
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,280
Master said so.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why don't I remember?

19
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,840
Evil cultivation

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,920
is a evil spell of the Western Regions.

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,160
It uses the blood to drive the magic.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,320
Although the power of the magic is limited,

23
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,960
the way of cultivation is extremely cruel.

24
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,280
I think you will be poisoned.

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,600
Someone did it on purpose.

26
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,360
But,

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,040
when did I get poisoned?

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
I live with you.

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,480
Why did I get poisoned?

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,880
I didn't drink the wine on the banquet.

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,960
I didn't touch the food.

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,280
Senior said it was the Northland's plan.

33
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
But why did he report it?

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
If he did it on purpose,

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
then the so-called kindness

36
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,680
may be within his plan.

37
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,360
Besides,

38
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,040
he mentioned Chang'an's evil plans.

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,640
Now there is an evil spell.

40
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
We have to guard against it.

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,080
Then how to guard against it?

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,600
You get up immediately.

43
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,640
Go back to Changxi Palace and explain the situation.

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
I will go back to Chang'an and visit his brother.

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,040
Okay.

46
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:25,320

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,480

48
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,600
Mo Qing!

49
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,740
Let me tell you.

50
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,740
I'm no man.

51
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,760
You are not a man manager,

52
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,260
but you are a graduated student.

53
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,420
Do you remember?

54
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,320
We'll meet again.

55
00:07:51,420 --> 00:08:00,420
You look back at the old days

56
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
Cousin

57
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Long time no see, cousin

58
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,420
You know, we are talking about Yi Lang

59
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
He is having a crush on the county head

60
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,420
This is the second year of the year

61
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,420
It's like a king

62
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Just me?

63
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
I can help you?

64
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
Yes

65
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,420
You have been visiting all the families

66
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Do you know the relationship of the city's door?

67
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,420
I really know

68
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
What's up?

69
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
On the way back from the city

70
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,420
I found a suspicious person

71
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
I want to find out some information

72
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
and solve the puzzle

73
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
If you are not in a hurry

74
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,420
give me two days

75
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
I will go to get familiar with it

76
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
I will ask you anything

77
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,420
Ok, thank you

78
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,420
It's nothing

79
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
By the way

80
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
On the way back

81
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,420
I heard a lot of people talking about the fifth wife

82
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Is she ok?

83
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
She is very well

84
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,420
You have not been in Chang'an for a day

85
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
I have already turned the page

86
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Now you are a new person

87
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,420
You have become an old person

88
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,420
Now people in Chang'an are talking about

89
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
Qinghe county head

90
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,420
is in Ruyi building with a young man

91
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Everyone is looking at him

92
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
and they are all friendly

93
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Young man?

94
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
I am not kidding you

95
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,420
This rumor is true

96
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Half of it is fake

97
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Which half is true?

98
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Which half is fake?

99
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
The current one is true

100
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
The new one is fake

101
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,420
What does this mean?

102
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,420
It's just

103
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
This man is not a new person

104
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
That is my sister's childhood friend

105
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,420
The adopted son of her old family

106
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,420
Pei Jiya, the eldest son of the Pei family in Kunzhou

107
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420
I am Pei Jiya from Kunzhou

108
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,420
The Tan's house can be seen by the people who use the magic

109
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,420
What is the red one?

110
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
Xie Xiu

111
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,420
Mr. Mei, you are back

112
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Where is my wife?

113
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
In the backyard, there are guests in the house

114
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
It's really you

115
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Why are you here?

116
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,420
So, what Mr. Pei is looking for in Chang'an is your wife

117
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Are you surprised?

118
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,420
Mr. Mei is here for my cousin

119
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,420
I heard about your relationship

120
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
What did you say?

121
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I told my cousin about our meeting

122
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,420
I didn't expect that my cousin and Mr. Mei knew each other

123
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
It's really surprising

124
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,420
What kind of question is that?

125
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,420
You don't know what Mr. Mei did?

126
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Don't worry

127
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,420
I just told you the truth

128
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,420
Mr. Mei and I met by chance

129
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,420
Then we met a bandit

130
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
He scared my cousin

131
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,420
He was a little bit scared

132
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,420
He is the hero of Mr. Mei

133
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,420
Later, when we were in the same town, we talked a lot

134
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,420
He and I still admire Mr. Mei

135
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
By the way, cousin

136
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Mr. Mei also wished us to be together

137
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
Look, how generous he is

138
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
He is always generous

139
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Mr. Mei, what are you doing here?

140
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,420
What are you doing here?

141
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,420
Mr. Mei is not interested in others

142
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,420
He is interested in others

143
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,420
The Pei family business is based on spices

144
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,420
My cousin came here for the meeting

145
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
He will stay in the Duke's mansion for the time being

146
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Don't blame me

147
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,420
I always use the word incense

148
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
I am sensitive to the smell

149
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
I am sensitive to the smell

150
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Mrs. Wu

151
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,420
I traveled back and forth from the carriage you drove away yesterday

152
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,420
I think my leg injury must have recurred

153
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,420
I have to disturb you for a few more days

154
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
I'm afraid this is not in accordance with the rules

155
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,420
How can an outsider live in the Duke's mansion?

156
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,420
Mr. Pei can live, so can I

157
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,420
We are different

158
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,420
My cousin and I are childhood friends

159
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
I lived here when I was young

160
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,420
Mrs. Wu and I are friends

161
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
I lived here a few days ago

162
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,420
All right, let's all live here

163
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,420
I can keep ten in the Duke's mansion

164
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Mrs. Wu

165
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
Mrs. Wu

166
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
Didn't Mr. Mei say he would move out?

167
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Why did he come back suddenly?

168
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
Mrs. Wu knew Mr. Mei would come back

169
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,420
I don't know

170
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,420
But my cousin said they met in the West

171
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,420
I guess he might come back

172
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Because of Mr. Pei?

173
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Mr. Mei is so strange

174
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
He is not strange

175
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,420
I think my cousin is strange

176
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,420
I don't know what you think about these two guys

177
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,420
You have to tell me again

178
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,420
Please give me an answer

179
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,420
You are so stubborn

180
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,420
What do you think of me?

181
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Mr. Pei, did you meet me by chance?

182
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,420
There are not so many coincidences in the world

183
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
It's all chance

184
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,420
Did Mr. Pei go to my room last night?

185
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Did Mr. Mei lose something?

186
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,420
No

187
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,420
That's good

188
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
In fact, Mr. Mei doesn't have to guess

189
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
The purpose of my coming to Chang'an

190
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,420
Although the name is Dou Xianghui

191
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
I don't care about it

192
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,420
I only care about my cousin

193
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
I can see that

194
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,420
A few days ago, Mr. Mei said the girl he liked was his cousin

195
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Yes

196
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Since you care about your cousin so much

197
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,420
Why did you say Wu Yuan?

198
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
I have my own reason

199
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,420
It seems that in your heart

200
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,420
Cousin is not so important

201
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Mr. Mei, the room is ready

202
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
You can go to rest

203
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
Thank you

204
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,420
I told you that you should be more careful

205
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,420
I am so kind

206
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
Good morning

207
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,420
I remember when we were young, we often uso the spent talk

208
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,520
But we have Bible- partition after the snack

209
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,980
It takes less attention

210
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,480
It's not so wonderful

211
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Life is getting better and better.

212
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,120
I think the younger generation is better.

213
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,520
Back then, only you and me.

214
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,600
But your brother's head is much better than when he was young.

215
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,440
Yes, it's been years.

216
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,320
I heard that you like the paintings of talented people.

217
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,240
These are all recently published.

218
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
I've found them for you.

219
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,040
I don't like them anymore.

220
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,160
These are all stories about a woman who has a husband,

221
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,880
a lover, a concubine, and a bandit.

222
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,160
Boring.

223
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,400
Although the story is a bit vulgar,

224
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,840
the ending is perfect.

225
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,040
Perfect?

226
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,040
What do you mean perfect?

227
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,880
You're married?

228
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,200
The most important thing in a woman's life

229
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,120
is to find a husband who is as good as you.

230
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,920
Why?

231
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,880
What?

232
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,000
I said why?

233
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,120
The most important thing in a woman's life

234
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,840
is to find a husband who is as good as you.

235
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
A woman is soft and soft.

236
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,040
She should find someone to rely on.

237
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,440
She should have a family.

238
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,480
She should be protected like a treasure.

239
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,920
She will live a life of peace and serenity.

240
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,880
You're right.

241
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,320
The most important thing in a woman's life

242
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,560
is to find a reliable one to rely on.

243
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,560
Why is there trouble again?

244
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,160
This little rat is useless.

245
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,960
Yeah.

246
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,560
Do you have any books here?

247
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,120
What book are you looking for?

248
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,840
The old man of the Four Gates asked me to strengthen the bond of the demon world.

249
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll come to you and find a way.

250
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,800
The bond of the demon world?

251
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
You are...

252
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm the cat's master.

253
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Thank you.

254
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
I have a question for you.

255
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Do you remember the way you made the candy cake?

256
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
Yes.

257
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,360
The cook hasn't come yet.

258
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,960
Maybe he will be back soon.

259
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,120
I'm here to get some food for you.

260
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't have any food.

261
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,800
Someone asked me to give it to the cat's master.

262
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,720
I told you to be careful with your head.

263
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Look, your teeth hurt, right?

264
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't talk about me.

265
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,880
I'm doing this for your own good.

266
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Don't worry.

267
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
I'll go to get the food for you.

268
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
But it's just that your teeth hurt and you're in a bad mood.

269
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
If you scold me, I'll be angry with you.

270
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,120
Those old guys won't do anything to you.

271
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Thank you.

272
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm willing to do anything for you.

273
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
The cat's master

274
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Didn't you put all the sugar in the candy?

275
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
It's too sweet.

276
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
It's easy to hurt the teeth of the little demon.

277
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Why did you start selling it again?

278
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
I don't know.

279
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,120
I heard that you've been very cool these days.

280
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
It's rare for the snake to get such a good news.

281
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
I don't want to either.

282
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
It's just that the news is so loud in Chang'an.

283
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
I can't even hear it.

284
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
You called me here to educate me.

285
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Actually, there's something.

286
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
You're going to beg me?

287
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Isn't this going to be a meeting?

288
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
I've been a judge for years.

289
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
But in the last few days,

290
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
I'm a little bit uncomfortable.

291
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
You're going to quit?

292
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
I can't stand you guys.

293
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
You're like a monster.

294
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
You quit whenever you move.

295
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Say it.

296
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Are you going to help or not?

297
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Please.

298
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Please.

299
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Okay, I'll help.

300
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
But...

301
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
But what?

302
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Speaking of the fragrance committee,

303
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I'm not good at fragrance.

304
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
How can I be?

305
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
There will be a lot of old-fashioned fragrance committee.

306
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
You just need to follow them.

307
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
And Ling Xiao is here.

308
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
He'll help you.

309
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
I'm done with my business.

310
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
I won't bother you.

311
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Okay.

312
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Sir.

313
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
It's time to report Tang Quan.

314
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,120
I was biased about the previous thing.

315
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Don't be angry.

316
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
I read a lot of these medical books.

317
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
I can read them all.

318
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm sorry.

319
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
This is the honey cake I asked for.

320
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
I asked him to make it secretly.

321
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
It tastes just like before.

322
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
The damage to your waist recently

323
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
has almost recovered.

324
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
It's time to report Tang Quan.

325
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Be careful.

326
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
What's going on?

327
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
I'm fine.

328
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Tomorrow morning,

329
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
I'll pick up my wife to the fragrance committee.

330
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Cousin, what are you doing?

331
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I may not be able to see the fun tomorrow.

332
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,120
I'm entrusted with the task of being a fragrance judge.

333
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Then please give me more time tomorrow.

334
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
The fragrance committee.

335
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
The fragrance committee.

336
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
The fragrance committee.

337
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
The fragrance judges today

338
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
are all the masters of the world.

339
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
For example, Master Xie and Master Gao.

340
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
But, sir,

341
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
please stay away from them.

342
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Why?

343
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
You've beaten Master Xie's second nephew

344
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
and beaten Master Gao's nephew.

345
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
But,

346
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
the most powerful one

347
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
is also the main judge today,

348
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
An Bilu.

349
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Master An is here.

350
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Master An.

351
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Master An.

352
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
That's An Bilu.

353
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
He's the best fragrance judge

354
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
in the world.

355
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Master An.

356
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Master An.

357
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Long time no see.

358
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
His judges have decided

359
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
the winner today.

360
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Did you spill your saliva?

361
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Here it is.

362
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
May I ask who this lady is?

363
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Master An,

364
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
she's not well.

365
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
She's not well.

366
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
She's not well.

367
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
This is the sister of the empress.

368
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
She's the second daughter of the Duke of the five states.

369
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Her name is Qinghe.

370
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
So she's the county magistrate.

371
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Master An, please don't stand on ceremony.

372
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
May I ask if you know the fragrance?

373
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
I'm a second daughter.

374
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
You mentioned the fragrance in front of Master An.

375
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Isn't that a bit too much?

376
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
No one dares to say that

377
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
they know a little bit.

378
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
County magistrate,

379
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
you're right.

380
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
You're modest.

381
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
This is

382
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
the manager of the imperial kitchen,

383
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Mr. Ling Xiao.

384
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
You recognize me?

385
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
The fragrance of the imperial kitchen is well-known.

386
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I also know a little bit.

387
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Today is the Dousiang meeting.

388
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I hope Qinghe and Mr. Ling Xiao

389
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
will give us a lesson.

390
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
How dare you say that?

391
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
You...

392
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
You...

393
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Master An recognizes me.

394
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Master An recognizes me.

395
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Master An recognizes me.

396
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Ling Xiao,

397
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
did you smell anything strange?

398
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
What's that smell?

399
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
It seems to be the smell of dog's legs.

400
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Dog?

401
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Where is the dog?

402
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
It smells too strong.

403
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Where is the dog's legs?

404
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Dog...

405
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
You said dog's legs?

406
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
I also recognized that he's Master An.

407
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
I also recognized that he's Master An.

408
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
This Dousiang meeting

409
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
is divided into the ordinary,

410
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
the capable,

411
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
the good,

412
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
and the strong.

413
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
According to the ranking,

414
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,120
the one who chooses the highest fragrance

415
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
will enter the last round.

416
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
In the end,

417
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
the one who is chosen by all of you

418
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
will be the winner.

419
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
The winner

420
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
and the one who is the strongest

421
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
this year

422
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
is Qi Jiaojiao, the man who is hard to find.

423
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Sister Zhen?

424
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
Why is it you?

425
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Where is my wife Liu?

426
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
You like to make trouble so much now.

427
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
I'm worried about you coming here.

428
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
I have to ask Ling Xiao to bring me here.

429
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Okay.

430
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Master An Bilu will be the judge.

431
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Please welcome Master An.

432
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
The Dousiang meeting of Chang'an.

433
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Rise.

434
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,120
I'm the scented master of the nine-bottomed incense room of Qi State.

435
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
I've been traveling abroad

436
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
to find the incense of the country of Mo Luo.

437
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
I've been using Suhe oil

438
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
to seal the incense for 100 days

439
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
and make the incense of the oil

440
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
for you all.

441
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
The formula is quite simple.

442
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
But what's so special about the incense?

443
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Master Gao is right.

444
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
I think

445
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
the incense is very useful.

446
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
It's a very useful incense.

447
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Master Gao is right.

448
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
I think

449
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
the incense is quite interesting.

450
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,120
It seems to have a secret smell in the incense.

451
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
May I ask who this gentleman is?

452
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Pei Jiya from Kunzhou.

453
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
No wonder.

454
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Pei's incense is famous all over the world.

455
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,120
I heard that you are quite proficient in incense.

456
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
I think

457
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
even if you have done the incense-rejecting ritual,

458
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
no one dares to be wise.

459
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Try the natural incense.

460
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Try the natural incense.

461
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,120
What's the smell of the natural incense?

462
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
It's the smell of blood.

463
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
I don't smell anything.

464
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
I don't smell anything at all.

465
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
The incense is very useful.

466
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
I'm afraid that the man named An is infected with cold.

467
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
His nose is stuck.

468
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Nonsense.

469
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Master An has a high taste.

470
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
This is called different reflexes.

471
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
Master Qinghe,

472
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
may I ask

473
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,120
why you only give the natural incense?

474
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
I think

475
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
there is a smell of blood in this incense.

476
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Blood?

477
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Master,

478
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
please explain.

479
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Although this incense is rare,

480
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
it is not easy to pick.

481
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
I heard that the slaves of the country of Moluoguo

482
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,120
risked their lives to climb the cliff

483
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,120
just to get the incense of Chen Xiangmu.

484
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
I don't know how much blood and sweat

485
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
they have put into the process.

486
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
I think the county chief also thought of this place

487
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,120
and thought that this incense was not worth it.

488
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,120
This gentleman is very knowledgeable.

489
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
Master,

490
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
please be careful.

491
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Don't be afraid.

492
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
I'm fine.

493
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm fine.

494
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
I'm fine.

495
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
I'm fine.

496
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
I'm fine.

497
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
I'm fine.

498
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
I'm fine.

499
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
I'm fine.

500
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
I'm fine.

501
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
I'm fine.

502
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
I'm fine.

503
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Toxin becomes toxin.

504
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
What did you do to my sister?

505
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
This incense is called the old-fashioned incense.

506
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Old-fashioned incense?

507
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
This name

508
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
sounds too casual.

509
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,120
I made this incense myself.

510
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Forget it.

511
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,120
Mr. Pei, please.

512
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,120
The old-fashioned incense

513
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,120
The old-fashioned incense

514
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,120
It's the old-fashioned incense.

515
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,120
The old-fashioned incense

516
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,120
The old-fashioned incense

517
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,120
The old-fashioned incense

518
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,120
The old-fashioned incense

519
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,120
The old-fashioned incense

520
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,120
The old-fashioned incense

521
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,120
The old-fashioned incense

522
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,120
The old-fashioned incense

523
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,120
The old-fashioned incense

524
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,120
The old-fashioned incense

525
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,120
The old-fashioned incense

526
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Ya serpent

527
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,120
It's long.

528
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
Directly.

529
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
And evi

530
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Not for long.

531
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,120
The old-fashioned incense

532
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,120
The old-fashioned incense

533
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,120
The old-fashioned incense

534
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,120
The old-ral hooks

535
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,120
You
