00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

little bit of a

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of a

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
little bit of a

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of a

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
little bit of a

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
little bit of a

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit of a

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
little bit of a

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
little bit of a

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
little bit of a

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
little bit of a

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
little bit of a

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
little bit of a

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
little bit of a

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
little bit of a

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
little bit of a

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
little bit of a

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
little bit of a

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
little bit of a

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
little bit of a

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
little bit of a

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
little bit of a

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
little bit of a

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
little bit of a

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
little bit of a

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
little bit of a

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
little bit of a

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,760
Since when did you start to like me?

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,400
Sixth Madam, you and I are childhood friends.

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,960
I knew you were my future wife since I was little.

60
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,200
What other reason is there?

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,960
Childhood friends?

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
This painting is also a childhood friend of yours, right?

63
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,520
No wonder. I always feel that there's something missing in the room.

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,800
So this painting is with you.

65
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,040
The Liu Tai Zhen you knew from the beginning,

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,640
the one you liked the most, the one you were engaged to,

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,120
it wasn't actually me.

68
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,240
The Liu Tai Zhen who was childhood friends with you,

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,120
the one who liked you,

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,600
actually died ten years ago.

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,560
Everyone knows that

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
when you were young, you fell off a cliff.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,640
You were in great trouble.

74
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,520
But you never thought about it?

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,680
A mortal's death.

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,240
Falling off a cliff.

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,000
How could you die and come back to life?

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,360
And as the snake king of the demon world,

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,480
I had to walk around the world.

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,320
My past identity was hard to keep.

81
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,240
So I borrowed his body.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,920
Liu Gongshen knew that his daughter had lost her father.

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,840
But he didn't know that we looked alike.

84
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,200
In fact, we had already changed our fate.

85
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,440
But...

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,240
But Sister Zhen is also a demon.

87
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
But she is clearly Sister Zhen.

88
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
She is art.

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,840
She is art.

90
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,640
She is a demon with a human body.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,400
So she is half human and half demon.

92
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,840
But I am not like that.

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,120
I thought it was Xiao Mu or Senior Chi Hua.

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
What are you looking at?

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,520
I took some five-centimeter secret books.

96
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,040
I am studying them.

97
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,400
Right now, you know me?

98
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,400
Your turn.

99
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,520
Soon.

100
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm the舌道双修,

101
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,200
a stretching wood sword master of all demons.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,080
I know the world's emperor ofcial street defense skill.

103
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,080
You can ask me if you don't know how to do it.

104
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
I'll teach you.

105
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,080
You look down on me?

106
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
The Tao and the Demon are two different things.

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
They can't be combined.

108
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
If you learn it, you'll be the best in the world.

109
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Didn't you say I'm the cat of Chang'an?

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Maybe I'm the only one in the world.

111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:07:10,080
You're not her.

112
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,080
You're not her.

113
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,080
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,080
I shouldn't have kept it from you for so long.

115
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:34,080
But I thought that human feelings would turn in a flash.

116
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,080
I thought that as long as I ignored you, you could fall in love with someone else.

117
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I thought...

118
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Who?

119
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,080
The Demon.

120
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,080
How could you know about human feelings?

121
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,080
How could you judge human feelings?

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
No wonder.

123
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Ten years ago, Sixth Madam had a bad temper.

124
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
She suddenly ignored me.

125
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,080
I did something wrong.

126
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:30,080
But I never thought that you weren't her.

127
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Give me back my Sixth Madam.

128
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Take your time.

129
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,080
What?

130
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
You understood?

131
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Or you were scolded back?

132
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:44,080
You should have gotten used to it.

133
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,080
No comment.

134
00:09:50,080 --> 00:10:08,400
As long as you're not ready, buy my

135
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,640
Oh, never mind. I won't talk about you again.

136
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,880
I'm here to tell you some good news.

137
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,680
I want to be alone.

138
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,420
I won't see you out there.

139
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:26,520
You'll face me one day, Yona-chan, and I will always love you.

140
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,720
How could the Seven Seemieu Hades escape with its explorer?

141
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,580
Such as Lord Longnan combined with something like the seven seemieu

142
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,120
the radish and Rh hairy cultural relics of Xajl has no force�

143
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,600
how can they be affected?

144
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,740
I'm ready

145
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
What's wrong? Why don't I have a dragon?

146
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
You can't fly through the sky.

147
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
You do have a dragon spirit.

148
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
But you also have a dark side.

149
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,520
There are some things that you can only fly through the sky when you put your heart down.

150
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Have a bite.

151
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
You're annoying.

152
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
You look like you're a vegetarian.

153
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Are you scared?

154
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,520
You're a little mortal. You should kneel down and bow to me.

155
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
You used to be obsessed with painting.

156
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Now you've learned to play with mud.

157
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Father, he's not mud.

158
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Little mud, I'll protect you.

159
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
You hide in my arms.

160
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,520
You asked for this marriage.

161
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
You can marry her if you want.

162
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
You can't marry her if you don't want to.

163
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Yes, I regret it now.

164
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I'm not happy. I won't marry Mrs Liu.

165
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Why did you marry her?

166
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
I'm a woman of pure white.

167
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm irresponsible.

168
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I'm better than Mrs Liu.

169
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,520
The usual behavior is just a matter of principle.

170
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,520
How can marriage be subdued by the rules of mortals?

171
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,520
In her heart, we as demons should not be attacked by the group.

172
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,520
We should be free and carefree.

173
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
It's all my fault.

175
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
It's my fault.

176
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Don't go! I haven't changed my clothes!

177
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Don't go! I haven't changed my clothes!

178
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Don't go!

179
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,520
The End

180
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Why are you here, Fifth Lady?

181
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Senior, I need your help.

182
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
It's okay.

183
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
All the babies need full nutrition.

184
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,520
The Chinese special formula, baby super-reverse protection.

185
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Help! Help!

186
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Fifth Sister!

187
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
What's wrong?

188
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Senior Lu Yang!

189
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Don't come over.

190
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Senior Lu Yang, are you okay?

191
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,520
I can't. I can't.

192
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
It's just a hand.

193
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I've seen all of your videos of Changxi Palace, Chen Lian, Tan Xiong and Lu Bei.

194
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
How can it be the same?

195
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Men and women are not close.

196
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
If I treat you, I will touch you.

197
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
This is not reasonable.

198
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Besides, my sister is already married and my husband is in charge.

199
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
If I don't respect you, it's not a good thing.

200
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
There is an explanation for the way to the West Lake.

201
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,520
How can a woman be so unruly?

202
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
This is not right.

203
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
I am a man of the West Lake.

204
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
I am a man of the West Lake.

205
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
I can't do this.

206
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
You...

207
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Fifth Brother, how can you say that?

208
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Fifth Brother, is it really you?

209
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Fifth Brother, are you sure it's you?

210
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Fifth Brother, did you get possessed?

211
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Fifth Brother, what's wrong? Are you okay?

212
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Fifth Brother, are you okay?

213
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
I'm fine.

214
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
I'm fine.

215
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Where are you going?

216
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
What's wrong with you?

217
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Tell me.

218
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Save me.

219
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
What's wrong?

220
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
What's wrong?

221
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

222
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,520
I found something strange on my arm.

223
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
I want to treat it.

224
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Let me see.

225
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
I want to treat it.

226
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
It's the first time I've seen you like this.

227
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
You've lived for hundreds of years for nothing.

228
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,520
You only know how to be old and have no knowledge.

229
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
What can you do without telling me?

230
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
I can't hide it.

231
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Once you tell me something,

232
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
you'll lose everything.

233
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Why don't you just be happy for a few days?

234
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
I understand what happened to Xiao Mao.

235
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,520
It's better to tell me something earlier.

236
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
So that I won't hurt anyone.

237
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,520
I think Mei Si is a fool.

238
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
She can accept you as a demon.

239
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Why can't she accept you as the original Liu Tai Zhen?

240
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Because she doesn't like me.

241
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
She likes the past.

242
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
You don't have to be with me anymore.

243
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Just practice your flying skills.

244
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
You think I'm willing to do your business?

245
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,520
It's you two who are delaying my drawing, okay?

246
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
How about I catch her and you two can talk?

247
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
No need.

248
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I'm going to catch you.

249
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
You're here.

250
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Go talk to your wife.

251
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Hurry up.

252
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Where is your wife?

253
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
What?

254
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Where is my wife?

255
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Where is my Liu Tai Zhen?

256
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
What do you mean?

257
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
What do you mean?

258
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
What do you mean?

259
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Where is my Liu Tai Zhen?

260
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Where is my Liu Tai Zhen?

261
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I'll take you there.

262
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I can't keep you.

263
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
No one can clean up the mess behind me.

264
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
I'm sorry for her.

265
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,520
It's true that you like to have fun.

266
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,520
There must be a lot of fun in the wilderness.

267
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
I'm sorry.

268
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
You're lonely, right?

270
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:29,640
He killed her, and then stabbed her

271
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,360
That's what I want.

272
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,800
Take care.

273
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,360
That woman,

274
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
why can't I save her?

275
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
She doesn't have the disease,

276
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,560
but herıyoruz.

277
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Senior Brother, can you stop shouting? It's scary.

278
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,640
It's an exception to let you enter the secret chamber.

279
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
You can't always start a new chapter for yourself.

280
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Moreover, this is too dangerous. You must not believe it.

281
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
I know your good intentions.

282
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,640
But now that he's in the demon's lair, he doesn't have much time left.

283
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,640
No matter what the ending is, I must go and find out the truth.

284
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,640
So, the magic weapon that came out of the secret chamber

285
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
was able to bring people back to 18 years ago.

286
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Seeing what happened that night...

287
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Yes.

288
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,640
This is too magical.

289
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Using mortal music to reverse the world

290
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,640
is a forbidden technique of the Heaven's path.

291
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Once it's lost, it won't only save your sister,

292
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,640
but you yourself will die in the chaos of time and space.

293
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
I know.

294
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
But as a Heavenly Master,

295
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,640
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

296
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
As a son,

297
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,640
I can't just sit around and watch my parents die.

298
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
As...

299
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,640
I can't just watch my enemies

300
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,640
waste their lives in the body of the person I love.

301
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,640
I have decided that I must do it.

302
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
I hope you will allow me to do so.

303
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Tell everyone to get ready.

304
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Yes.

305
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
It's so ugly.

306
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Are you sure that it's from Changxi Palace?

307
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,640
I'm sure because it's so ugly.

308
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Then what does it say?

309
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Tell me to go to Changxi Palace immediately.

310
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Did the cat palace's matter progress?

311
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
I hope so.

312
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
I just wanted to ask you something.

313
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Recently, Wu Zi Shu has been walking around the streets.

314
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,640
What is he doing?

315
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
I don't know either.

316
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
I don't know either.

317
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
I just want to know.

318
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
I just know

319
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,640
that this is the place you really wanted to go 18 years ago.

320
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
Look.

321
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Thank you so much, Manager Ling Xiao.

322
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
You really saved my life.

323
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
It's nothing.

324
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
I understand.

325
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,640
I'll leave first since you've bought two machines.

326
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,640
There's no wine yet!

327
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
At this hour,

328
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
there are still guests?

329
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
What kind of guests?

330
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
It's clearly a master.

331
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
He's been drinking with me for three days.

332
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,640
If he didn't have money, I would have driven him away.

333
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Master?

334
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Which master?

335
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
I heard that a rich man has been drinking here for three days.

336
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,640
It's actually our Minister Mei.

337
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Manager Ling Xiao.

338
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
You're so familiar.

339
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Won't you treat me to a drink?

340
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
I don't have a drink.

341
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Forget it.

342
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Looks like you really don't welcome me.

343
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,640
At least, I've been in the bath room for years

344
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
to show you my affection.

345
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
It's always sad.

346
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Sad.

347
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
What are you doing here, Manager Ling Xiao?

348
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm here to see you.

349
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
I'm here to see you.

350
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,640
What are you doing here, Manager Ling Xiao?

351
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Me?

352
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,640
I'm just passing by.

353
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
I heard that you're here

354
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,640
to have a laugh with me.

355
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Don't look at me like that.

356
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
I'm also concerned about you.

357
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Why aren't you going home?

358
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm here to see you.

359
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,640
That old man is here to see you.

360
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,640
And you're here to drink?

361
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
What do you mean by that?

362
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I'm here because the wine is good.

363
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
I'm not here to see you.

364
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Yes.

365
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Their wine is really good.

366
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
It's been in the tea house for many years.

367
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,640
It's been loved by many people for ten years.

368
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,640
Just like how you treat my husband.

369
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Manager Ling Xiao can go now.

370
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Okay.

371
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,640
I don't want to be a nuisance here.

372
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,640
I just want to ask you one thing.

373
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Everyone knows that you've been in love with the Liu family for more than ten years.

374
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,640
But ten years ago, the Liu family changed.

375
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
But in these ten years,

376
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,640
have you really not improved your understanding of her?

377
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Have your thoughts and feelings stopped at where they were?

378
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Did something happen to Liu Shu?

379
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Oh, right.

380
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,640
Right. Her wine is really good.

381
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Because they use the Choyang Gui from the southwest.

382
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,640
It's a pity that a few days ago,

383
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,640
their carriage had a problem.

384
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,220
The Choyang Gui from the

385
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,640
So today, they don't have new Gui Hua wine to fill up.

386
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
And your young master is in a hurry.

387
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,640
So...

388
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,640
So you're saying that the good wine is not Gui Hua wine?

389
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm leaving.

390
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
People can't think for themselves.

391
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Everyone else is useless.

392
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Am I right?

393
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Yes.

394
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
Lord Shu.

395
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
What is it?

396
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
I have to tell you something.

397
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm leaving now.

398
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
My master said that since the cat will come back,

399
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
he won't be here.

400
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
I had no other choice.

401
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Don't blame me.

402
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
He's here.

403
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,640
The hand-made work is back.

404
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
What? What's the matter?

405
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Nothing.

406
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Let's go.

407
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Lord Shu, you've been relieved.

408
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
You're in a good mood.

409
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Come in and talk.

410
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
I'm leaving.

411
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Lord Shu, do you have any plans?

412
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Lord Shu, you haven't got the key to the door.

413
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,640
You don't have to be so proud.

414
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,640
How did you know?

415
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
You followed me?

416
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Lord Shu, don't say that.

417
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,640
I saw you looking for the key to the door.

418
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
You were very focused.

419
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,640
I'm not the only one who noticed your key.

420
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,640
You should thank me.

421
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,640
If I hadn't led them away one by one,

422
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,640
you wouldn't have found that place so easily.

423
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,640
It seems that I should thank you.

424
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
What do you want?

425
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,640
I just want to cooperate with you

426
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
and go inside.

427
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,640
You've been in Chang'an for so many years.

428
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,640
You're really capable.

429
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
What should I do?

430
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,640
Lord Shu is your trusted aide.

431
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,640
I need your help to get inside.

432
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,640
Then I can investigate.

433
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
That's the old place.

434
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Only Snake and Cat can enter freely.

435
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Only Snake is in Chang'an now.

436
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
If you want to get inside,

437
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,640
you have to start from Snake.

438
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,640
It seems that you need another aide.

439
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,640
You're really clever.

440
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,640
I think you've figured out how to get the key.

441
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Lord Shu, you want to know the secret of the Ghost Eagle.

442
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,640
You just want to save your cat.

443
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,640
We can cooperate.

444
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,640
After we find the secret of the Ghost Eagle,

445
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,640
we'll both be safe.

446
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Good.

447
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,640
18 years ago

448
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,640
18 years ago

449
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
18 years ago

450
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,640
18 years ago

451
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,640
18 years ago

452
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,640
18 years ago

453
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,640
We need to see the situation of the previous cat.

454
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,640
Then we can find the way to protect her.

455
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
The cat is in danger.

456
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,640
We must save the cat.

457
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I know.

458
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,640
I'll find the way to protect her.

459
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I'll help you.

460
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
I'll help you.

461
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I'll help you.

462
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
I'll help you.

463
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
I'll help you.

464
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
I'll help you.

465
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I'll help you.

466
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
I'll help you.

467
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
I'll help you.

468
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
Thank you, everyone.

469
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Zhu Yu, remember that this is against the law.

470
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
When you go back to the past,

471
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,640
you must not change the cause and effect of the cause.

472
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
I understand.

473
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Let's begin.

474
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,640
If you act rashly, you will be trapped in the past like a gold bracelet.

475
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,640
At that time, I don't know what will happen in this world.

476
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,640
If the plot can be rewritten, everything will change.

477
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,640
I will spend my life waiting for you.

478
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Let fate repeat its pulse, love will reincarnate in the vastness of time.

479
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,640
When time turns into the ocean, I will cross the potential.

480
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,640
I have never left your side.

481
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,640
When time turns into the ocean, I will cross the potential.

482
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,640
I have never left your side.

483
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:22,640
I will not give up my persistence, and let time pass by.

484
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,640
