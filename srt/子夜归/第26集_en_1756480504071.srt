Special coming out tomorrow

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:58,700
Dunming

3
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,700
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,700
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

35
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,700
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,700
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

41
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
tell the차

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,700
the ladder

43
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
What's wrong with me?

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,700
You have two forces in your body that are fighting against each other.

45
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Most of them are the power of your cat attack.

46
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,700
It's hard for you, a mortal, to bear so much demon power.

47
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Indeed, I was dragged by the body of Ban Yang.

48
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
This kind of thing is not difficult to deal with.

49
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

50
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

51
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
This kind of thing is not difficult to deal with.

52
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
If you become a power demon,

53
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,700
this kind of thing will not happen.

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,700
How can it not be difficult?

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
You have been looking for it for more than ten years.

56
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,700
You haven't found the way to break the spell.

57
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
If I say,

58
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,700
now I can turn you into a power demon.

59
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Really?

60
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Absolutely true.

61
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,700
Although this method is too clever,

62
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,700
it seems that you have to try it.

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Xiao Zhen,

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,700
listen to me.

65
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
No matter what,

66
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
I won't hurt you.

67
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
What who said it's really matter,

68
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
But still the face of it.

69
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Good.

70
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,700
But still,

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Why you don't say?

72
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Why?

73
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,700
You know how the hand makes a woman perform herself?

74
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
I can't change anyone's heart.

75
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
If you say no,

76
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Why are you here?

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,100
Where did you go?

78
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,700
Ruoyu Tower.

79
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,500
Don't try to go out with wet hair in the future.

80
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

81
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

82
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

83
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

84
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

85
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

86
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

87
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

88
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

89
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

90
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

91
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

92
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

93
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

94
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

95
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

96
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

97
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

98
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

99
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

100
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

101
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

102
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

103
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

104
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

105
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

106
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

107
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

108
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

109
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

110
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

111
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

112
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

113
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
I'm not going to go out with wet hair.

114
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Cheers!

115
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Hey, who are you looking for?

116
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
What can I do for you?

117
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Didn't you say that you heard a bad voice?

118
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,900
This guy has been making trouble in there for days and nights.

119
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Please, Mr. Sui.

120
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,620
And I'm writing myacco.

121
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,260
Is there any solution for your book?

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,780
These old men

123
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,860
may not know what to do with themselves.

124
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,160
But the pumpkin andorgendum people can make do.

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,320
That's okay.

126
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,340
The most quoting is always correct.

127
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,460
I'll definitely fight against them.

128
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,660
veces chance to win.

129
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,940
ниuds' report can easers other ways.

130
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,160
and use the ancient and small waves to conquer the

131
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
luck of the beasts.

132
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
You are so amazing.

133
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
How do you know everything?

134
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
I don't remember my own origin.

135
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,160
But I think maybe I can find more books.

136
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
You will definitely find more.

137
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
I thought about it.

138
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
I'm new to the demon world,

139
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
and I don't have any trusted subordinates.

140
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
I have two hands.

141
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
I have two hands.

142
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,380
If you follow me and be my first subordinate,

143
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,380
you can open a book store in the human world.

144
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
You can open a book store in the human world.

145
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,380
You can open a book store in the human world.

146
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
Do you dare?

147
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
Okay.

148
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,380
Then you will be my person from now on.

149
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
Uncle.

150
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,380
Xiaozhen.

151
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,380
Come up, uncle.

152
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Uncle.

153
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Do you think it's beautiful?

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Yes.

155
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I remember you didn't like to take medicine when you were a kid.

156
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Then I accidentally found this candy.

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
You like it so much that you can't take it.

158
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
You have to have this candy to take medicine.

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
In the end, our master Shu

160
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
took the shop owner and moved the shop

161
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
to the side of the warehouse.

162
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Of course.

163
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I will take what you want.

164
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Don't worry.

165
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I will help you with the rest of the business.

166
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
I will help you with the rest of the business.

167
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Thank you.

168
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
I am willing to be your good wife.

169
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
We are inseparable.

170
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
We are inseparable.

171
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
There are not so many things like this in this world.

172
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
We exist in this world

173
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
without others.

174
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
We don't have destiny.

175
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
You like that little fish.

176
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Xiaozhen, have you forgotten that

177
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
you are a monster?

178
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
I am a monster, but I am also a human.

179
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
I have friends and family.

180
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Of course, I should have a lover.

181
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
I just live in vain.

182
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,040
I want to experience

183
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
the life of a mortal.

184
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
But he

185
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
is just a mortal.

186
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Xiaozhen,

187
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
do you really believe him?

188
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Yes.

189
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
He is very good.

190
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
I feel at ease

191
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
with him.

192
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,260
So, you mean

193
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,260
I never let you feel at ease?

194
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Uncle,

195
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
we are doing this for each other

196
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
because we are friends.

197
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
But he is different.

198
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,260
He really recognizes me

199
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
and likes me.

200
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
But I also like you.

201
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,260
What did you say?

202
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
Xiaozhen, we have been together for 18 years.

203
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
We have only been together for a few months.

204
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Do you still want to choose him?

205
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
I thought we were best friends.

206
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
Friends?

207
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Wait.

208
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
What are you going to do?

209
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
I am going to call you up

210
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
and have dinner.

211
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Your husband has gone to the temple.

212
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Why is it so early?

213
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
You don't even have breakfast.

214
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
Did my husband

215
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
tell you anything?

216
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
No.

217
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Then,

218
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
I will call the master.

219
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
No need.

220
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
My master never gets up early.

221
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
I put a spell on the demon

222
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
and then I found this place.

223
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
But there is no trace of the demon.

224
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
I know the place of the demon in Chang'an,

225
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
but I don't know

226
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
how to get in.

227
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Even you don't know?

228
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
It seems that the demon

229
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
is really not a small thing.

230
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Who can

231
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
understand the demon's thoughts?

232
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
The scroll of the Xuanjian Temple

233
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
has some records of this place.

234
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
But there are only a few words.

235
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Which words?

236
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
This temple was originally the temple of the king of the devils.

237
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
King of the devils?

238
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
The king of devils

239
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
was the mother of the three living beings

240
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,140
and was honored as the mother of the earth.

241
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,140
And the time of the destruction

242
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
of this place

243
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
was exactly 18 years ago.

244
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,140
18 years ago, Chang'an was basically

245
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,140
the temple of the devils.

246
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,140
If this temple

247
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,140
is a place of connection between the two realms,

248
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,140
it is also a good place to get involved.

249
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,140
But even this temple of the devils

250
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
is not small.

251
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
The wildness of the devils is not small.

252
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,140
The riot of that year

253
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
is also not small.

254
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
It seems that they

255
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
are very confident in the barrier they set.

256
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Master once said

257
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
that if there is a barrier,

258
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
there must be a way to open it.

259
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Let's go.

260
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Mrs. Liu.

261
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
I heard that Minister Mei is sick.

262
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,580
I came to visit you.

263
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,580
Sick?

264
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,580
Is it my disease?

265
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
So many things.

266
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Look, there is a bird here.

267
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
When did it happen?

268
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
Mrs. Liu, please.

269
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,580
This is so cute.

270
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,580
Look, look.

271
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
There are two more.

272
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
Mei Si.

273
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Mrs. Liu.

274
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Mrs. Liu.

275
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Mrs. Liu.

276
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Why are you here?

277
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Aren't you affected by the power of the devils?

278
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Are you sick?

279
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
No. I swear.

280
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm really fine. Look.

281
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
What power of the devils?

282
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Do you want to fight again?

283
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Come on, talk to me.

284
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
I'll walk.

285
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,020
I'll stand here.

286
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,020
Grandpa, you are so nice.

287
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Don't blame her.

288
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
I told her a few days ago

289
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
that I haven't seen you for a few days.

290
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
I miss you so much.

291
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
I just said it.

292
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,020
I didn't expect grandpa to be so nice.

293
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Xuan Hui is a big friend of the Yelong Clan.

294
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,020
How did you buy her?

295
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,020
She is so good for you.

296
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
She is so kind to you.

297
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
She is so kind to you.

298
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
I...

299
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I think I like her because of the snake.

300
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Since you are here,

301
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
I have to remind you something.

302
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
You were rejected by the devils

303
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
when the cat got married.

304
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
They said I was your wife.

305
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
They said I was your wife.

306
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
It's a rumor.

307
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Did you hear it?

308
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,460
I...

309
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
I heard it.

310
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,460
You are so stubborn.

311
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
You are so stubborn.

312
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
You always talk about our marriage.

313
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
You always talk about our marriage.

314
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Mei Si Lang,

315
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
if you hear anything,

316
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,460
don't misunderstand.

317
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
I know.

318
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I know.

319
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Be careful!

320
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
Si Lang!

321
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Si Lang!

322
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
Si Lang!

323
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Don't touch me!

324
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
Si Lang!

325
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
This is...

326
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
The bear king.

327
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Let's go.

328
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Let's go.

329
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Are you okay, Mrs Liu?

330
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
I was so happy to see you.

331
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
I forgot to tell you that

332
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
the snake was in the mansion.

333
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
They were spreading the bear king.

334
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
You forgot it?

335
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
I will remember it next time.

336
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
I...

337
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Did you fall?

338
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
It hurts more and more.

339
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Let me see.

340
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
You are bitten by a snake.

341
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Si Lang!

342
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Si Lang!

343
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Si Lang!

344
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Are you okay?

345
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Go to a doctor who can cure the snake.

346
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Yes.

347
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
I remember that

348
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
I didn't ask you out today.

349
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
I came here to ask you for help.

350
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
I thought about it after I went back.

351
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Although the temple

352
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
is not that good,

353
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
it may not be the best.

354
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
You want to help us?

355
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Yes. It's easy to talk to you.

356
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
I discussed with the chief.

357
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
I want to set up camp in Chang'an.

358
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
I want to use the power of the imperial family

359
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
to break the barrier.

360
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
You have decided?

361
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Yes.

362
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
The chief has agreed.

363
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
You have a plan?

364
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Yes.

365
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
I was a little hasty.

366
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
No hasty.

367
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
I discussed with the chief all night.

368
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Believe me. I can break the barrier.

369
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
I will tell you the formation.

370
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
No need.

371
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
You are the second in Changxi Palace.

372
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
No one dares to be the first.

373
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,900
That's true.

374
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
But you are a man of war.

375
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
I came here

376
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
to borrow a picture of Chang'an.

377
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Okay.

378
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Zhu Yu.

379
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,120
If I remember correctly,

380
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
the temple was built

381
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
under the assistant of Changxi Palace.

382
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Am I right?

383
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Yes.

384
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
No wonder.

385
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,120
There is a formation to deal with monsters.

386
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
I think the structure around Tianjin

387
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
is very similar to the old books in Changxi Palace.

388
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
This formation

389
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,120
should be able to see the body of the monster.

390
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,120
It's a pity that

391
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
it's too old and no one has repaired it.

392
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Just a bow.

393
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Okay, don't move.

394
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,120
It hurts.

395
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
It hurts.

396
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Okay, don't call me.

397
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Can you be gentle?

398
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Don't move.

399
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
It's moving.

400
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
You scared me.

401
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Why are you shouting?

402
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
How is it?

403
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Don't worry, Master Mei.

404
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
The wound of the fourth son is not serious.

405
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
The snake venom is also cleared.

406
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
That's good.

407
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
I'm tired.

408
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm going to sleep.

409
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Goodbye.

410
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Thank you.

411
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
You came at the right time.

412
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
I discussed with Minister Liu

413
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
a few days ago.

414
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
You two have already decided on a child.

415
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Now you two

416
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
are getting old.

417
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
This matter should be discussed again.

418
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Uncle.

419
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
I know.

420
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
My fourth son

421
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
has no reputation in the palace.

422
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
He doesn't know the skills of the valley.

423
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
His body is weak.

424
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
He has no skills in the talent.

425
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
He has no skills in the sword.

426
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
What's wrong?

427
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Am I wrong?

428
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Fortunately,

429
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
he is a real man.

430
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
He has admired you for many years.

431
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
If you marry him,

432
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
with the strength of the Mei family,

433
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
he will not treat you badly.

434
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
This matter

435
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
should be discussed again when my father is here.

436
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Don't worry, Miss Liu.

437
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
You two are friends.

438
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
We are happy to be parents.

439
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
We are friends?

440
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
On the wedding day of the Qinghe County Lord,

441
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
my fourth son was drunk and threw salt.

442
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Everyone heard it.

443
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Today you two met.

444
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
You are so concerned

445
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
about my fourth son.

446
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Is it wrong?

447
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Actually...

448
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
I don't want it.

449
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
What?

450
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
I said I don't want to get married.

451
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Are you full of your stomach?

452
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Your mother is holding you back.

453
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
What do you want to do for so many years?

454
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Everyone is watching.

455
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Look at the paintings in your room.

456
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
You are so beautiful.

457
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Who are these paintings?

458
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Who are these paintings?

459
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
You are going to have a heart attack.

460
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
What are you doing?

461
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Don't worry, Miss Liu.

462
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
He was bitten by a snake.

463
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
His tongue is hurt.

464
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
He will be fine in a few days.

465
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
He will be a successful man in the future.

466
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
He is a playful person.

467
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
He will change.

468
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Don't worry.

469
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
I will take him to the door.

470
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
I will marry him.

471
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
I will not let you down.

472
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Father, I am serious.

473
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
I don't want to get married.

474
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I don't want to marry Miss Liu.

475
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
What are you talking about?

476
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
You want this marriage.

477
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
You can marry him if you want.

478
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Yes.

479
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
I am not happy.

480
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I don't want to marry Miss Liu.

481
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
How can you give me this kind of son?

482
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
You always say that.

483
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
I am the rat in the family.

484
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Say it again.

485
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
You said that.

486
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
I am the most unfilial person in the family.

487
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
I don't want to delay Liu Qing.

488
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Institute of Law

489
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Your father is so ruthless.

490
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Grandpa, why are you always the one who is busy?

491
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Of course, I am free everyday.

492
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,120
I have nothing else to do except to watch the show.

493
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,120
That... that lady Liu who got rejected by you,

494
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
asked me to ask you something.

495
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,120
What did she say?

496
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
She said why you rejected her.

497
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I am a woman who is innocent and irresponsible.

498
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,120
I am stronger than her.

499
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,120
So you are afraid that she will propose to you and you will be famous?

500
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,120
She is a monster.

501
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,120
The name of Lady Liu is just a name.

502
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
What can she do?

503
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,120
I have to propose to her.

504
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,120
I didn't know her identity before.

505
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,120
I have to follow the rules of the mortals.

506
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
But she is such a powerful monster.

507
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Her behavior is just a matter of principle.

508
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,120
How can she be fooled by the rules of the mortals?

509
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Let me see.

510
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Here.

511
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Here?

512
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,120
My head.

513
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Let me see.

514
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
I forgot.

515
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Go away.

516
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
She said that?

517
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
So in her heart,

518
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,120
we as monsters should not be controlled by the group.

519
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,120
We should be carefree and carefree.

520
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
I am sorry.

521
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
I am sorry.

522
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Sleep well tonight.

523
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
I will be waiting for you.

524
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I will be waiting for you.

525
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
I will be waiting for you.

526
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I will be waiting for you.

527
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
I will be waiting for you.

528
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
I will be waiting for you.

529
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
I will be waiting for you.

530
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
I will be waiting for you.

531
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
I will be waiting for you.

532
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
I will be waiting for you.

533
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
I will be waiting for you.

534
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
I will be waiting for you.

535
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
I will be waiting for you.

536
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
I will be waiting for you.

537
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,120
It seems that I have to leave.

538
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Lord Shu.

539
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
What's up?

540
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
The monster has been missing for a long time.

541
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
I have been asking about it.

542
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Do you need to report to the Palace Master?

543
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,120
It's normal for the monster to have a bad experience.

544
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
It's no big deal.

545
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
But if I don't go...

546
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Yes, Lord Shu.

547
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
I will be waiting for you.

548
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
I will be waiting for you.

549
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
I will be waiting for you.

550
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
I will be waiting for you.

551
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
I will be waiting for you.

552
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
I will be waiting for you.

553
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I will be waiting for you.

554
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I will be waiting for you.

555
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
I will be waiting for you.

556
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
I will be waiting for you.

557
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
I will be waiting for you.

558
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
I will be waiting for you.

559
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
I will be waiting for you.

560
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
I will be waiting for you.

561
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Don't call me.

562
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,120
To help him become a monster,

563
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
it's your fate.

564
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
I will be waiting for you.

565
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
I will be waiting for you.

566
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
I will be waiting for you.

567
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
Third Brother,

568
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
did you find anything?

569
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
No.

570
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
But I have found a way to open the demon room.

571
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
What?

572
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
You found a way so quickly?

573
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Shiyi,

574
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
although you don't have to do the work this time,

575
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
you don't have to be sad.

576
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
You will have a chance in the future.

577
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I will go in and have a look.

578
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
I will be going now.

579
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Shuangxiang,

580
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
are you hungry?

581
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
I am hungry.

582
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Do you want to eat something delicious?

583
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Yes.

584
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Let's go.

585
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Please give me two bowls of food and two respect.

586
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Okay.

587
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
You two.

588
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Are you all okay?

589
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Enjoy.

590
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
The soup is clear as water, but the taste is very good.

591
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Do you like it?

592
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Very good.

593
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Brother Xiao,

594
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I'm not as good as you in terms of cultivation,

595
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
reading, writing, medicine and martial arts.

596
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
But in terms of food,

597
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
I'm definitely an expert in this.

598
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Let's say this water-based mutton soup is exquisite.

599
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
If the tiger cake is dry,

600
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
it will be a great deal.

601
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
You know a lot.

602
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
What else do you know?

603
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
I also know

604
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
that just a dish of water-based mutton

605
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,120
can give out different common features.

606
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
The common feature is that it has a lot of pepper,

607
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
while the common feature is that it has a lot of fennel.

608
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Then you guess

609
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
what this dish is like.

610
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
It's definitely the common feature.

611
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
I found out a few days ago

612
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
that his family has a lot of pepper.

613
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Just this bowl can put up to 20 grams.

614
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
That's why I've been thinking about it.

615
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
You have a good eye.

616
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Of course.

617
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
You can see it from so far away.

618
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
As long as I want to.

619
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
What did you see

620
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
after the night of the dream?

621
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
I saw the tiger...

622
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Tiger...

623
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Tiger cake.

624
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Ah.

625
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Brother Chi,

626
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
how did you know?

627
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
You were so nervous that day.

628
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
You were so abnormal after the arrival of Chi Hua.

629
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
You've been practicing for years.

630
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
But you've never been confused about catching demons.

631
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
You're very active.

632
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
That night,

633
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
you must have encountered something important

634
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
and chose to hide it.

635
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
I'm going to be a hero.

636
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Who can I hide this for?

637
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Yeah.

638
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Who?

639
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
In Chang'an,

640
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
it's the Ruyi Pavilion

641
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
that can make you hide such a big thing.

642
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,120
It's just that the lady who helped you.

643
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
So that night,

644
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
you saw her.

645
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
I saw her.

646
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,120
That day,

647
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
I was behind the Ruyi Pavilion

648
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
and I saw something.

649
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,120
I saw the lady holding a cat.

650
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
And then they disappeared in a second.

651
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
I was just thinking.

652
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,120
So she must have gone to pick up the cat demon.

653
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Don't you want to be a hero?

654
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,120
Why would you release a demon for your own personal interests?

655
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Brother Chi,

656
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
even if the lady is a demon,

657
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
she's not a bad demon.

658
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Otherwise,

659
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
there are so many people coming and going every day.

660
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Someone has died long ago.

661
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Besides,

662
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,120
she's still with your wife every day.

663
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
She's with her every day?

664
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Brother Chi,

665
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
didn't you say

666
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
that the demon is the best at seducing a man?

667
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,120
The lady who made you fall in love with her,

668
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
is she really a fox?

669
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
The Demon's Lair

670
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
You look so happy.

671
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
What's the matter?

672
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
I've been busy with the demon's work for a long time.

673
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Now Uncle has finally found a way to transform into a full demon.

674
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
I'm happy.

675
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Then tell me about your happiness.

676
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Be careful not to be seen by your ordinary young man.

677
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,120
A couple shouldn't have secrets.

678
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
But I have to be responsible for the demon.

679
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,120
I feel guilty about him.

680
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Don't be naive.

681
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
If he knows,

682
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
then you don't have a husband.

683
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,120
You don't know if you have a life or not.

684
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I don't know.

685
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
No, I believe him.

686
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Not everyone is a demon.

687
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Just like Xiao Si,

688
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,120
he knows you're a demon,

689
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,120
but he still doesn't change his mind.

690
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Mei Si,

691
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
he's a fool.

692
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Your young man is not stupid.

693
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
He's not stupid.

694
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
But I believe

695
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,120
that there are evil people in this world.

696
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
There are also demons who are kind and kind.

697
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Mei Zhu Yu is not a person who can't tell good from evil.

698
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,120
He and I have made all the preparations.

699
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
My two masters.

700
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Okay, I'm done.

701
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
I'm leaving.

702
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Uncle, what's the matter?

703
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,120
A few masters have entered Chang'an.

704
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
What?

705
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Sorry to bother you.

706
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
You really want me to fix this formation?

707
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
It's broken.

708
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Xuanjian Temple has this.

709
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
We shouldn't beat him.

710
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,120
If we can fix it,

711
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
maybe we can enter the netherworld again.

712
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Yes.

713
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Okay, I'll try.

714
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Can you let the people stand under the formation?

715
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120
If they are mortals, there is no difference.

716
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,120
If they are demons,

717
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,120
they can see the body in this netherworld.

718
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Boss,

719
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
I've already investigated

720
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,120
what those masters were planning in Chang'an.

721
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
It's a pity that they are very evil.

722
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
I didn't see anything.

723
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,120
I can't let them come.

724
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,120
If they want to be demons,

725
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
they have to ask me.

726
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Ah Xiang.

727
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Master Maogong.

728
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Master Maogong.

729
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Master Maogong.

730
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Master Maogong.

731
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
Master Maogong.

732
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
Master Maogong.

733
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
Master Maogong.

734
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Master Maogong.

735
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Please do me a favor.

736
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Yes, Master Maogong.

737
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
Master Maogong.

738
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
Master Maogong.

739
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
Master Maogong.

740
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
Master Maogong.

741
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Master Maogong.

742
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Master Maogong.

743
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Master Maogong.

744
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Master Maogong.

745
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Master Maogong.

746
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Master Maogong.

747
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
