1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
a little bit of

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
a little bit of a

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit of a

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
little bit of a

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
little bit of a

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
little bit of a

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
little bit of a

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
little bit of a

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
little bit of a

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,040
The little demon is injured,

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,240
so he needs to use his body to heal himself.

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Use his body to heal himself.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,080
He's as big as you.

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
How can you get in?

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't care.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
You figure out a way.

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,320
How many times have you said it?

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm a snake.

50
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,920
A snake!

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,560
Right, right, right.

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,240
You don't eat it.

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,800
If you don't eat it, I'll eat it.

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm a top-class good ink.

55
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
Luckily, I didn't break it.

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,120
This kind of good ink

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,760
is the best for painting.

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm going to draw a demon sketch

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,600
and give it to you as a gift.

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
The demon you know

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
is a very good friend of mine.

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm going to draw a demon sketch

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
and give it to you as a gift.

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
I saw it from the demon sketch on the table.

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
There are records of it.

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Why do you need to draw it again?

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:05,320
It's just a

68
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
book that can recognize the snake as a mud-sweeping spirit.

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
You...

70
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,800
The demon is born in the heaven and earth.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
It's a thousand times more beautiful.

72
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
You mortals have never heard of it.

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
You've seen it.

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
It's not the same.

75
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
It's not like me, a demon.

76
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
You're a demon?

77
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Then you must be very knowledgeable.

78
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
You know everything.

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
I don't want you to keep bothering me.

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm very annoyed.

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
I'll just say something to you.

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,800
It's also a way to pay off your recent kindness.

83
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Okay, okay, okay.

84
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
You talk slowly.

85
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll change my words as you talk.

86
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Hmm.

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Hmm.

88
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I,

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm

90
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,800
different.

91
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Hmm.

92
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:07,800
It

93
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
is

94
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
k

95
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
how

96
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,800
What you hear is a fire demon that has been cultivating for thousands of years.

97
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
This fire has long teeth and has divine eyes.

98
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
It is a fire spell.

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
The eyebrows have a fire shape mark.

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
It is three fingers tall.

101
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,800
When the power of the demon is increased, it can be turned into eight big demons.

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
When does its power increase?

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,800
The fate of the demon is that the eyebrows are attacked.

104
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Oh, I see.

105
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
How is it?

106
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,800
But the fire demon that has been occupying a mountain in heaven and earth

107
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
has been turned into this shape by you.

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Overall, it is not bad.

109
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
It has a special face.

110
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
How is it?

111
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
It is really good.

112
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
It is like a sound.

113
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
The fire demon has been turned into a fire demon.

114
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
It is a fire spell.

115
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
It is a fire spell.

116
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
It is a fire spell.

117
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
It is a fire spell.

118
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
It is a fire spell.

119
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
It is a fire spell.

120
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
It is a fire spell.

121
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
It is a fire spell.

122
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
It is a fire spell.

123
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
It is a fire spell.

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
It is a fire spell.

125
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
It is a fire spell.

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
It is a fire spell.

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
It is a fire spell.

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
It is a fire spell.

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
It is a fire spell.

130
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
How is it that you find it so strange?

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
The fire spell is completely buried.

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
The demon's body will be in danger.

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,480
POWER

134
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,660
Not good.

135
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
tour

136
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
네

137
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
해

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,880
Mei.

139
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:07,020
Shan Aberате!

140
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
Which one is real and which one is fake?

141
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Even I can't tell.

142
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,020
What did you hear?

143
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
I heard everyone in the city was talking about it.

144
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,020
They said

145
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,020
you were kicked out of Chang'an by the County Lord of Qinghe.

146
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,020
They also said that the County Lord of Qinghe

147
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
is happy to see you.

148
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,020
They also said that two lords

149
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,020
invited you to live in the Duke's mansion.

150
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,020
Just like the melon in the summer.

151
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,020
One by one.

152
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,020
One by one.

153
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,020
I haven't finished the story before.

154
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,020
This one.

155
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,020
I heard about the Dou Xiang Hui.

156
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
They said that the strong and powerful

157
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,020
Mei's husband saved the County Lord.

158
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,020
When I thought about it,

159
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,020
such an outstanding and outstanding person

160
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,020
is definitely not our Mei Siliang.

161
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
Okay, stop talking.

162
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,020
What's the matter?

163
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,020
You asked me this morning.

164
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Something important.

165
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
Mei, this case

166
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,020
is indeed a bit tricky.

167
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,020
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,020
Mei, this case

169
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
is indeed a bit tricky.

170
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,020
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,020
This...

172
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
This...

173
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,020
Little Nijo, Little Nijo.

174
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,020
What's the noise?

175
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,020
The whole house is covered with blood.

176
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Why did it become ink?

177
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,020
Where did the blood come from?

178
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,020
You probably didn't sleep well last night.

179
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
You must have seen it wrong.

180
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Little Nijo, look at the painting I drew.

181
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Why is the tiger demon lighter?

182
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Maybe your ink didn't get good.

183
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,020
Impossible. I've been painting since I was a child.

184
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,020
The ink is fine.

185
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,020
You're doubting the demon.

186
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,020
I...

187
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,020
I didn't.

188
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,020
Do you want to hear the other demons' stories?

189
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,020
I don't want to hear the other demons' stories.

190
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,020
Do you want to hear the other demons' stories?

191
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,020
I want to hear.

192
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,020
Today,

193
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,020
we'll talk about the legendary 16 demon,

194
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Pi Ning.

195
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,020
His head

196
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,020
was originally a 16.

197
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,020
But he usually

198
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,020
acts like a pretty girl.

199
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,020
He covered his face

200
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,020
with a long hair.

201
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,020
When fighting,

202
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,020
he shook his head and threw away his long hair.

203
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,020
The 16 inside

204
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,020
is invisible.

205
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
Like a flying target.

206
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
It's a good secret.

207
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,020
Shake your head when fighting?

208
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,020
Little Nijo,

209
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,020
are you really not lying to me?

210
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,020
Why would I lie to you?

211
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,020
Just like the one in the human world.

212
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,020
What... what is it?

213
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,020
A wave.

214
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,020
I once fought a ghost with a road demon.

215
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,020
The eyes of that thing

216
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,020
were growing on the back.

217
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,020
It could turn the king around

218
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,020
and see through the six eyes.

219
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
The four horns on the head

220
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
were very sharp.

221
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,020
I heard that it was used to grind wine on the bark of the poisonous leaves.

222
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Time passed by.

223
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,020
It was hard to save the poisonous.

224
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
In this world,

225
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,020
not only flowers, animals,

226
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,020
can turn into demons.

227
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,020
If the air is filled with blood,

228
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,020
it's even more stupid.

229
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,020
A demon

230
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,020
was born in the human's

231
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,020
jail.

232
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,020
It's said that

233
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,020
one day, someone in the jail

234
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,020
shed tears.

235
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,020
Blood

236
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,020
spilled on the dice

237
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,020
and turned into blood.

238
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,020
The dice demon was small

239
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,020
but very strong.

240
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
Six whole bodies

241
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,020
and 21 eyes

242
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,020
were all dead.

243
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,020
The more I saw it,

244
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,020
the more I knew it.

245
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,020
I still remember

246
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,020
there was a place

247
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,020
that was deserted for many years.

248
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,020
There was a piece of broken glass

249
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
in the front yard.

250
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
I couldn't see it

251
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,020
but I could see the wind

252
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,020
and swallow it.

253
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,020
It was a

254
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,020
skill of attack.

255
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,020
The sky is full of stars

256
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,020
and the moon is dark.

257
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
The earth is full of ghosts

258
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,020
and the world is not peaceful.

259
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,020
I said

260
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
last night,

261
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,020
a demon appeared in Chang'an.

262
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Its shape was like a ink

263
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,020
and changed a lot.

264
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,020
It seems that

265
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,020
people in Chang'an

266
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
are getting worried.

267
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,020
It seems that

268
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,020
people in Chang'an

269
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,020
are getting worried.

270
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,020
Did you hear that?

271
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
A demon appeared in Chang'an.

272
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,020
I heard that it was a pig.

273
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
You're lying.

274
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Where did you hear

275
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020
about the demon?

276
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Many people in the city

277
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
spread the news.

278
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Let's go.

279
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,020
Brother Mei,

280
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,020
what are you talking about?

281
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
I heard that many people in Chang'an

282
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
started to discuss about the demon.

283
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,020
Impossible.

284
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,020
We told the people nearby

285
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,020
not to talk about it.

286
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,020
We were afraid that it would cause an upheaval.

287
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,020
It was only a day

288
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,020
before the news spread.

289
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
It's not just a few rumors.

290
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
You mean

291
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
someone is behind the scenes

292
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
to push the column?

293
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,020
It's possible.

294
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
So you want me to check

295
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,020
the list of people in Chang'an?

296
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,020
I think the key is the ink.

297
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
The power in the ink is not the demon.

298
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
It's more like a

299
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,020
evil trick.

300
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Evil trick?

301
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
What is it?

302
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,020
Have you heard

303
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,020
about the holy magic?

304
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,020
No.

305
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
It's a forbidden trick.

306
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
The one who loses has not been trained for many years.

307
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
He's paid the price of his body.

308
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
Brother Mei, how did you

309
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
find out about the holy magic?

310
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Right.

311
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,020
If the demon is dead,

312
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,020
it will become a form.

313
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,020
It's not a demon

314
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,020
without a body.

315
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,020
That's the holy magic.

316
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,020
It will integrate its consciousness

317
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,020
into the external object

318
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,020
and then it will be able to control the external object.

319
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,020
The mark of the tiger after death

320
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
is the external part of the holy magic.

321
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,020
I see.

322
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
Give it to me.

323
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Here.

324
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,020
How should we

325
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,020
investigate the loser?

326
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,020
Should we start from the ink?

327
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,020
We can only use this stupid method.

328
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,020
The Xuanjian Bureau is handling a case.

329
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,020
I need to go to the account book.

330
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
The account book is the secret of my shop.

331
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,020
You can't

332
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,020
steal it.

333
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,020
Fine.

334
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,020
Please come with me.

335
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,020
The Xuanjian Bureau? I don't want to go.

336
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
I'll take it. Wait a minute.

337
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,020
Eunuch Jin.

338
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,020
Eunuch Jin.

339
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Take care.

340
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Boss, let me see the account book

341
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
that that person just saw.

342
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020
Which one did you tear?

343
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,020
My account book is not a big radish.

344
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,020
I want to see who has walked through it.

345
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,020
Please look.

346
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,020
Please look.

347
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,020
This is this.

348
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,020
Ge!

349
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
Ge!

350
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Ge!

351
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
Ge!

352
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Ge!

353
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Ge!

354
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,020
So, the Mo-Yao of Chang'an is the one who created these paintings.

355
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
Brother!

356
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Get up! Get up!

357
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,020
Brother!

358
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,020
Come on.

359
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
Get away!

360
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
Stop!

361
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,020
If you want to save him, don't come over!

362
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,020
Hurry!

363
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
Hurry!

364
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
What's wrong?

365
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
No!

366
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,020
Little Zhuyu?

367
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
Are you awake?

368
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Why am I here?

369
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
What's wrong with me?

370
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
What's wrong with you?

371
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,020
Why did you kick the table?

372
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
I didn't kick it.

373
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Did you see anything?

374
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
What?

375
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
Look at the painting.

376
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
I'm talking to you.

377
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
I'm talking to you.

378
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
What are you looking at?

379
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,020
I'm not in the sky.

380
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,020
Why are you looking at the sky?

381
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,020
What are you talking about?

382
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
I want to ask you.

383
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Which one do you like,

384
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
Mr. Pei or Mr. Mei?

385
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,020
You sent a will to let me enter the palace

386
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,020
just to say that?

387
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Mr. Mei

388
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
is a good person

389
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020
to save you.

390
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
But his background is not good.

391
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,020
Pei Jia

392
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
is a good person.

393
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
He's also a good match for you.

394
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
It's a pity that if you marry him,

395
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
he'll go to Kunzhou.

396
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,020
Don't worry, sister.

397
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,020
Mr. Xue is a big thing in life.

398
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
You have to take good care of him.

399
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
I don't have time to waste.

400
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Zheng, you're old.

401
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,020
It's time to get married.

402
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
If you don't get married,

403
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,020
no one will want you.

404
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
If I don't get married,

405
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,020
I'll be happy

406
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,020
to be with the one I love.

407
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,020
Where are you going?

408
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,020
I haven't finished yet.

409
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,020
You keep saying that.

410
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
I'm getting goosebumps.

411
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,020
If I don't get married,

412
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
I won't marry you.

413
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
I won't marry you.

414
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,020
You...

415
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,020
Sister,

416
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
don't be angry.

417
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
I really have something to do.

418
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,020
I'll go back first.

419
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,020
Look, look.

420
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
Look.

421
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
You're not serious.

422
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,020
Don't be angry.

423
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,020
I'm so happy.

424
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
I'll take two.

425
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
I want one.

426
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,020
Look.

427
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Look.

428
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,020
Look.

429
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,020
Look.

430
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,020
Look.

431
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Try it.

432
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Okay.

433
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Next time.

434
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
Look.

435
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,020
Look.

436
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Look.

437
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Look.

438
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Aunt.

439
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Slow down.

440
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,020
I was just telling her that you came to the palace today.

441
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
What did she say?

442
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
She thanked you for

443
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
treating her illness last time.

444
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Really?

445
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
It's just a wind blowing through the trees.

446
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,020
Why can't I hear anything?

447
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
I'm going to the palace.

448
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm going.

449
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
I'm going.

450
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,020
I'm going.

451
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
I'm going.

452
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,020
I'm going.

453
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
I'm going.

454
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:16,840
to achieve mistery for 50 cent.

455
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,340
It damaged your image.

456
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,500
Let me have a look at the reflection in your image.

457
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,980
Let me use the power that instability of dark spheres

458
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,300
holds to protect your image.

459
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,660
I...

460
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,940
My dark spheres

461
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,780
are made of light...

462
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,780
Monster, monster!

463
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,940
AC120

464
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,600
Is it you?

465
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,640
settle down

466
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

467
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
No!

468
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Dad!

469
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Dad!

470
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
Dad!

471
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Dad!

472
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Dad!

473
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Dad!

474
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Dad!

475
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Dad!

476
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Dad!

477
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
Dad!

478
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Little Princess.

479
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Dad!

480
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
What's wrong with you?

481
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Thank you, Little Princess.

482
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,640
You gave me a name.

483
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,640
My name is Yuan Zhen. What about you?

484
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,640
I don't have a name.

485
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,640
How come? Everyone in this world should have their own name.

486
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
But I'm not.

487
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Chahua.

488
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Hua.

489
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Your name is Hua, okay?

490
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Hua.

491
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
I was a lonely tree.

492
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,640
I didn't have a flower until I met you.

493
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Hua.

494
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Hua.

495
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,640
Hua.

496
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Hua.

497
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Hua.

498
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,640
What's wrong with me?

499
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,640
The twinkling of the eyes is like the end of the year.

500
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:33,640
How can I see you again?

501
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,640
The End

502
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
The devils are all over the city.

503
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,640
I have to get them out of Chang'an first.

504
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,640
The devils are coming.

505
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
The devils are coming.

506
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
The devils are coming.

507
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
The devils are coming.

508
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
The End

509
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Long Jun.

510
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
No.

511
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
The tomb is going to be broken.

512
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
How is that possible?

513
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,640
If the Palace of Heaven and Earth knows that what she asked me to do is a trap...

514
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Long Jun.

515
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,640
What's wrong with that ring?

516
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Boss.

517
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
There are more devils in the city today.

518
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
Did you meet them during the day?

519
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
I did.

520
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
But don't worry.

521
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
I'll ask you to go to the west room to investigate.

522
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Do you have any clues?

523
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,640
I think I know where the devils came from.

524
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
The End

525
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
Xiao Si.

526
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Xiao Si.

527
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Xiao Si.

528
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
The End

529
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Why are you here?

530
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
I came to see you.

531
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
I came to see you.

532
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
I heard you beat Xiao Si.

533
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
He was conscious before.

534
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
I just woke him up.

535
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Cure?

536
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
What was he conscious of?

537
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
The Holy Tree of the Seventh.

538
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
The Holy Tree of the Seventh?

539
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
What are you two doing?

540
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Why are you here?

541
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Where did you go?

542
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I went to listen to my father.

543
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
He said I didn't study well.

544
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
I was distracted by the books.

545
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
That's why I got hurt.

546
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,640
How did you know that Xiao Si was hurt?

547
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
I came to see you.

548
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
That's why I found something wrong.

549
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,640
By the way, are you still using the ink?

550
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
I'll go take a look.

551
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I think it's done.

552
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,640
If you're okay, I'll leave.

553
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Take care.

554
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,640
What's wrong?

555
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Can you come with me?

556
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Xiao Si, I'm leaving too.

557
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Okay, see you later.

558
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
I'm leaving.

559
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
The End

560
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
The End
