1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Episode 11

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How did you know about the Yasheng tree?

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In the case file of the Xuanjian Temple,

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
there are records of such evil things

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
in the case files sixty years ago.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You can even remember that?

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You have such a good memory.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's strange that you were killed for no reason today.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I wonder if the Fifth Lady is doing well today.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm fine.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How is the Minister of the Revenue?

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Everything is fine.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I wonder how long the Minister of the Revenue will stay in the Mansion of the Duke.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My wife said

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that even if there were ten more,

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
she could afford it.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's one thing to be able to afford it.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Whether you want to raise it or not is another thing.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
After all, the Minister of the Revenue said he was leaving before.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now he's not leaving.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's hard for people to think about it.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You also said that you didn't care about other people's thoughts.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What if I want to care?

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
After all, my father always asks

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
who I choose between you and my cousin.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I always have to find some excuses for you.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So that my father doesn't misunderstand it anymore.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right, cousin?

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I saw my cousin not returning yet.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm a little worried.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I came out to see.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm afraid you forgot.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I love to sing every night.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I came home at night.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's normal.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What's there to worry about?

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm afraid you forgot.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I love to sing every night.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So I came home at night.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's normal.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What's there to worry about?

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Your cousin is still interesting.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But why is Mr. Mei here?

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Did you go to the dance with your cousin?

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I happened to meet.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Mr. Mei and cousin are really fated.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I have a date with the fifth wife.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's late.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go back.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Cousin, be careful.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Mr. Pei,

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you have to see it clearly when you walk in the future.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Only cousin is here.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Of course, I won't bother you.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Chang'an is not so beautiful.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not as lively as Kunzhou.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What's so lively?

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
People are living in peace.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If you don't believe it,

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
why don't you go back with me?

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Kunzhou is now a beautiful place.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
People are happy.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I will definitely make you happy.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll think about it.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sleepy.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll go to bed first.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sleepy. I'll go to bed first.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mr. Mei, guess

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
will cousin agree to me?

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
she will.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
After all,

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
others won't be like me

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and keep her in mind.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's been more than ten years.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
She is like a treasure

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and unique.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
By the way,

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mr. Mei congratulated me and cousin.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't think

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
they will disagree.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I mean,

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
if we treat each other sincerely,

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
it will be ungrateful.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I wonder if Mr. Mei and the fifth wife

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
will be sincere to each other.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This lamp is for Mr. Mei.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In the future,

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you should see clearly.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't be angry.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He is definitely

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
inferior to you.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He is really a man of love.

116
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,540
OK.

117
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,660
I also believed that

118
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,660
after the war began before the war's aut..]

119
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,860
If someone is called

120
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,420
by still her,

121
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,500
he and her money

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
and no one else

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,980
이제

124
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,000
the late King of Qin

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
will also remain.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,360
Then she will be the

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,760
fifth wife and the last wife.

128
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,260
I thought

129
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,260
The Demon's World

130
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,260
I'll seal it in the Demon's World, in case it's in trouble again.

131
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Xiao Zhen, are you staying in the Demon's World tonight?

132
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
I've had enough of the trouble today.

133
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,260
It's not easy to bring it back. I have to go home and rest.

134
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
All right.

135
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,260
The Demon's World

136
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,260
A'Shu, since you're going to the Demon's World,

137
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,260
why don't you help me pick up something?

138
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Lord Shu!

139
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Lord Shu, are you going to the Demon's World?

140
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Yes.

141
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Do you need me to accompany you? I'm fine with the left and right.

142
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
You're free today.

143
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
After fighting with Nambiru,

144
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,260
I asked Lord Snake to give me a few days off.

145
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,260
I'm not free at all.

146
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,260
I went around.

147
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
I heard there was some trouble in the mortal world.

148
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
Is the work going well?

149
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
Someone put a evil spell in this ink.

150
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Fortunately, the evil spell was brought back.

151
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,260
The cat did not get hurt.

152
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,260
How could such a thing make the tea case so complicated?

153
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Are you a dog demon?

154
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
This smell...

155
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
Something's wrong.

156
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
What's wrong?

157
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
It's a strange glue.

158
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Strange glue?

159
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,260
No wonder this ink is so complicated with the evil spell.

160
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,260
I'm afraid there's something wrong with this.

161
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

162
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

163
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

164
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

165
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

166
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

167
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

168
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

169
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

170
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

171
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

172
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

173
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

174
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,260
I'm going to the Demon's World.

175
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,260
Your Excellency!

176
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
I knew you wouldn't.

177
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Lord Shu, you came again to learn about the Demon weapon.

178
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
This demon weapon is the best of the best.

179
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,900
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,020
Well,

181
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,620
you can go around by yourself.

182
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,980
I'll go do my work.

183
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,980
Elder,

184
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,660
I thought you

185
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,860
were quite busy with the monster prison.

186
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,340
I didn't expect you to be here.

187
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,580
You've misunderstood me, Mr. Shu.

188
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,420
I'm very busy with my work.

189
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,140
I'm telling you...

190
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,060
How many floors

191
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,860
is Xuan Hui locked in?

192
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,180
He's on the third floor.

193
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,860
It's a long way.

194
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,940
Let's go.

195
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,340
Let's go.

196
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,300
The monster prison is locked on three floors.

197
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
The deeper the prison,

198
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,700
the lower the floor is locked.

199
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
Xuan Hui was locked on the first floor at first.

200
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,180
After he escaped three times,

201
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,700
he came to the second floor.

202
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,460
After six times,

203
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,980
he came to the third floor.

204
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,380
If he gets caught again,

205
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,220
he can't be allowed to stay here.

206
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,340
This is where he's locked.

207
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,860
Mr. Shu,

208
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,980
why did you take Xuan Hui to Zhao Mingjing?

209
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,700
Zhao Mingjing

210
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,900
recorded the crimes of the past.

211
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,180
You took her to catch Xuan Hui back

212
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,780
as you wanted to.

213
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,820
You don't have to ask.

214
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,180
You're right.

215
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,660
Anyway, it's none of my business.

216
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,700
I don't want to know.

217
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,440
The

218
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,780
prison is...

219
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,820
It's empty.

220
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,820
This is the most secretive prison

221
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,340
in the monster prison.

222
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,460
It can hold the monster's power.

223
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,340
Eighteen years ago,

224
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,100
the evil ghost attacked Chang'an.

225
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,420
I wanted to catch her and lock her up here.

226
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,660
But she was killed by the previous cat master.

227
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,060
It's been empty until now.

228
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,100
Then,

229
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,420
is there any good or bad thing?

230
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,820
Who knows?

231
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,940
The master is dead.

232
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,220
Even if there's any monster left,

233
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,740
it should be destroyed.

234
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,140
I see.

235
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,740
Jefferson,

236
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,620
I am by your side.

237
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,540
I will steal you.

238
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,020
I'll...

239
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,500
...ll limit your destructive force

240
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
to Heaven.

241
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,820
k

242
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,780
obligation

243
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,780
I'm going to kill you.

244
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
The evil is killing the ghosts.

245
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,780
What about the gods?

246
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,780
What about me?

247
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
In this world,

248
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,780
he is more precious

249
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,780
than you and me.

250
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
What?

251
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
A footstep?

252
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
What a coincidence.

253
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,780
At the Human World's Du Xiang Hui,

254
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,780
we just lost a footstep.

255
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
So fast,

256
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,780
we lost another one.

257
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
It seems that Chang'an is still very rich.

258
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
Ling Xiao,

259
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,780
have you ever thought

260
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,780
that the two of them

261
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,780
are just a footstep away?

262
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,780
They are just a footstep away.

263
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,780
It makes sense.

264
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,780
No wonder after the Du Xiang Hui,

265
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,780
the one that the royal family

266
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,780
can't find lost.

267
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,780
So the reason is here.

268
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
Qi Jiao Jiao is a monster.

269
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Let's find another one to look for him.

270
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,780
Don't let Jin Wu Bei investigate again.

271
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Jin Chi Niao.

272
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Coming.

273
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,780
Lord Wuju,

274
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
what can I do for you?

275
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
Go to the monster room and look for him.

276
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,780
I need a new one.

277
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
Okay.

278
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
Today,

279
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,780
Jin Chi Niao is very hard to talk to.

280
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,780
She doesn't give me a discount.

281
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Why is she so good today?

282
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
Because

283
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,780
I'm the owner of this restaurant.

284
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
You're the owner of this restaurant?

285
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
When?

286
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
When I don't give you a discount.

287
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
No.

288
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
I guess I...

289
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,780
Lord Wuju,

290
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
I finally found this

291
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,780
in the grocery store.

292
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,780
The whole monster room is just a piece of gold.

293
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
Just a piece of gold.

294
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,780
It must be very valuable.

295
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
It doesn't matter.

296
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
It doesn't matter?

297
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Because this grocery store

298
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
is mine.

299
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
The grocery store is yours?

300
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
What else is yours?

301
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
What else is I don't know?

302
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
You want to see Liu Tai Zhen?

303
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Yes, Zhen.

304
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,780
Where did my wife go to recuperate?

305
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
The Liu family said she left home for a few days.

306
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,780
She kept silent.

307
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,780
Now there are rumors about monsters in Chang'an.

308
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
I'm worried something bad will happen to my wife.

309
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,780
The rumors about monsters have been put to rest.

310
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
The rumors have been put to rest.

311
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,780
But it doesn't mean there are no monsters.

312
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,780
Although my wife likes the rumors about monsters,

313
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
it's like a love story.

314
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
If she really meets them,

315
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,780
she has to be careful.

316
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
Don't worry.

317
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
She'll be fine.

318
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,780
Zhen,

319
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,780
according to you,

320
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,780
she should have come back.

321
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,780
I think so.

322
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,780
No.

323
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,780
I have to find her.

324
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
Don't be blind.

325
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,780
Zhen, tell me.

326
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,780
Where did she go?

327
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,780
To the south of Chang'an.

328
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
Lu Weishan.

329
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Thank you, Boss Shu.

330
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,780
We should have sent someone to find her

331
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,780
before she came back.

332
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,780
But we shouldn't have let Xiaosi go.

333
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,780
There are so many monsters in the mountain.

334
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,780
It's not safe for her.

335
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,780
Zhen,

336
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,780
you only care about other people's safety.

337
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,780
You don't know that

338
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,780
love is the most important thing in life.

339
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,780
It's more important than living alone.

340
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

341
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

342
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

343
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

344
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

345
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

346
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

347
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

348
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

349
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

350
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

351
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

352
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

353
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

354
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

355
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

356
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

357
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

358
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
I'm just trying to be a good person.

359
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,540
Come on.

360
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Come on.

361
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Let's go.

362
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,540
You really are a good girl.

363
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Okay.

364
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Goodbye.

365
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,540
Bye.

366
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
Bye.

367
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,540
Bye.

368
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,540
Bye.

369
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Bye.

370
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
Bye.

371
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,540
Bye.

372
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Bye.

373
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,540
Bye.

374
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,140
Come on, come on, come on.

375
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,220
Little man of the Mei family,

376
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,780
why is there something wrong with the food?

377
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,180
No.

378
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,020
It's just that I never thought

379
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,940
that the breakfast today would be so rich.

380
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,220
You may not know

381
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,220
how light you usually eat.

382
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,700
My uncle is a duke.

383
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,580
So this breakfast is really ordinary.

384
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,380
Exercise to replenish water.

385
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,300
Quickly replenish the energy.

386
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,180
You will be wonderful if you replenish the water.

387
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,580
Zhen,

388
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,260
hurry up.

389
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,820
Hurry up and use the breakfast.

390
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,820
What are you talking about?

391
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,220
The breakfast that Mr. Mei surprised at the Mansion of the Duke is so rich.

392
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,100
I'm going to talk to my uncle about a food expert.

393
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,620
He is quite good at food.

394
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,940
I will ask him to study the food.

395
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,100
I will invite him to the mansion

396
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,300
to take care of my cousin.

397
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,300
You don't have to bother.

398
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,300
What?

399
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,940
My cousin thinks that the mansion is not well-groomed?

400
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,980
Of course not.

401
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,540
Since I am going to marry my cousin,

402
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,540
I will think about it for you.

403
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
I hope my cousin can live better.

404
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,220
Well, Mr. Pei,

405
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,980
a few days ago,

406
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,540
you said you wanted to marry my Zhen.

407
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,700
Are you sincere?

408
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,460
Of course.

409
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,900
My mother has been in poor health recently.

410
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,900
She doesn't want to take care of her family.

411
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,660
So when my cousin comes in,

412
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,980
she is the head of the Pei family.

413
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,100
I, Pei Ji Ya, swear

414
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,500
that I will never give up on this matter.

415
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,020
Good.

416
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,300
It's good not to give up.

417
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,020
It seems that you are fully committed to Zhen.

418
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,940
Then, Mr. Mei,

419
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,380
do you have anything to say?

420
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,580
No.

421
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,060
Do you still want to marry her?

422
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,660
You misunderstood me.

423
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,100
I just didn't want to marry her.

424
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,860
What do you think of my marriage

425
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,700
with my cousin?

426
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,260
I think it depends on your own opinion.

427
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,100
Your Highness.

428
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,340
Your Highness.

429
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,300
Your Highness.

430
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,460
Your Highness.

431
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,180
Eunuch Hong, why are you here?

432
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,540
His Majesty and Her Majesty

433
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,580
asked you to come to the palace.

434
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,220
Is it something that I can't do?

435
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,620
Did they find out about it?

436
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,540
Your Highness, don't worry.

437
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,300
It's not about you.

438
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,980
It's about the princess.

439
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,060
Yuan Zhen.

440
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
The white tea tree in the imperial garden

441
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,860
is most liked by the princess.

442
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,580
But I don't know why she suddenly cried.

443
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,100
His Majesty and Her Majesty

444
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,820
were tired of her.

445
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,500
The princess was so depressed

446
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,380
that she cried until now.

447
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,220
Let's go.

448
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,460
Slow down.

449
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,420
Come on.

450
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,940
Let's go.

451
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,220
Let's go.

452
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,940
My Lord,

453
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,860
it's time to take the medicine.

454
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,860
I'm going to kill you!

455
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
I'm going to kill you!

456
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
I'm going to kill you!

457
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,860
I'm going to kill you!

458
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,860
I'm going to kill you!

459
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,860
I'm going to kill you!

460
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm going to kill you!

461
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
I'm going to kill you!

462
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
I'm going to kill you!

463
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,860
I'm going to kill you!

464
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
I'm going to kill you!

465
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
I'm going to kill you!

466
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
I'm going to kill you!

467
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
I'm going to kill you!

468
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
I'm going to kill you!

469
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
I'm going to kill you!

470
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
I'm going to kill you!

471
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
I'm going to kill you!

472
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
I'm going to kill you!

473
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
I'm going to kill you!

474
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,860
I'm going to kill you!

475
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,860
I'm going to kill you!

476
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
I'm going to kill you!

477
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
I'm going to kill you!

478
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
I'm going to kill you!

479
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,860
I'm going to kill you!

480
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
I'm going to kill you!

481
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,860
I'm going to kill you!

482
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,860
I'm going to kill you!

483
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,860
I'm going to kill you!

484
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm going to kill you!

485
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
I'm going to kill you!

486
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,860
I'm going to kill you!

487
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,860
I'm going to kill you!

488
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,860
I'm going to kill you!

489
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,860
I'm going to kill you!

490
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,860
I'm going to kill you!

491
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
I'm going to kill you!

492
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,860
I'm going to kill you!

493
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,860
I'm going to kill you!

494
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,860
I'm going to kill you!

495
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,860
I'm going to kill you!

496
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,860
I'm going to kill you!

497
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,860
I didn't think

498
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,860
If I don't walk once,

499
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,860
how can I see the buld by Mister Pei?

500
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,860
This is what I said.

501
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,860
I don't know where I've offended Mister Pei.

502
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
Why did you make such a big trouble for me?

503
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,860
You made a demon

504
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,860
and made trouble for Chang'an.

505
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,860
How could you make trouble for me?

506
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,860
The demon has been saying that

507
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
since ancient times.

508
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
I don't know why,

509
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,860
but Chang'an people have been talking about it.

510
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
It's just some rumors.

511
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,860
Why did you ask me

512
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,860
so strange?

513
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,860
I think you know it well.

514
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Mr. Mei,

515
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
why don't you come in and check it?

516
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
I want to remind Mr. Pei that

517
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
the person who is in the dark night

518
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
will be swallowed by the dark night.

519
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Mr. Mei,

520
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,860
do you know

521
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
what's going on?

522
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
It doesn't matter.

523
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
The person whose surname is Mei

524
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
can't be kept anyway.

525
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,860
All right, all right.

526
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
Don't cry.

527
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Listen to me, Yuan Zhen.

528
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,860
The tea tree is strange.

529
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
It blooms on all sides

530
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
and falls on all sides.

531
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
It's so ominous.

532
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
Yes.

533
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
I don't want to touch it.

534
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
I don't want you to touch it.

535
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Even if we don't punish it,

536
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,860
it won't live

537
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,860
if we do it like it does.

538
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,860
It won't live

539
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,860
if we do it like it does, right?

540
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
No.

541
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
It will get better.

542
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,860
It will bloom again.

543
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
It will stay with me

544
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
forever.

545
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
All right, all right.

546
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,860
It's just a tea tree.

547
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
If you like it so much,

548
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
I'll plant more trees

549
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,860
in the imperial hospital.

550
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
Yes.

551
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
It's different.

552
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,860
It's different.

553
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,860
Other trees are different.

554
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
What's the difference?

555
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,860
Yuan Zhen, don't cry.

556
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Let's see what my grandfather

557
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
brings you.

558
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,860
Look.

559
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Is it fun?

560
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,860
It's fun.

561
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
It's fun.

562
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,860
It's not fun.

563
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,860
Why is it not fun?

564
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,860
It's fun.

565
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,860
It's fun.

566
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,860
Yuan Zhen,

567
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,860
it's fun.

568
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
Where is it?

569
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,860
It's fun.

570
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
Where is it?

571
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
It's here.

572
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
It's here.

573
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
It's here.

574
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,860
You're close to the girl.

575
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,860
Let's urge her to leave.

576
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
The state affairs are of great importance,

577
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
sister and brother-in-law,

578
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
you go ahead

579
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
and leave the rest to me.

580
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
I'll leave it to you.

581
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,860
All right, all right, come here.

582
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Yanzhen, you can understand me, right?

583
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
I understand.

584
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Yanzhen, I remember that white tea tree was brought back by you and your parents when you were in the South.

585
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,860
Can you tell me what happened when you were in the South?

586
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,860
Why did you like the white tea tree so much?

587
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,860
Mother!

588
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,860
Fugua!

589
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,860
Mother!

590
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
Fugua!

591
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,860
Yanzhen, I'm sorry.

592
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,860
That was Lin Shanjian. He was the one who put the beast down and protected me.

593
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
Your Highness!

594
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,860
Your Highness!

595
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,860
Your Highness!

596
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,860
Your Highness, you're finally here!

597
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,860
Hurry up!

598
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,860
His Majesty and Her Highness are worried sick.

599
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Your Highness, are you hurt?

600
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,860
Why are you here? Let's go back.

601
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Hurry up!

602
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,860
We can't leave yet. He saved me.

603
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,860
He seems to be sick. We have to save him.

604
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
He saved you?

605
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,860
But we don't have a flower.

606
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
Your Highness, let's go.

607
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,860
Take him back to the palace. I want to find the best flower.

608
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Okay, let him live.

609
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Let's go back.

610
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
I knew it.

611
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,860
Now drink the heartless poison and we forget you to be alive.

612
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,860
I know.

613
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,860
The best gardeners in this kingdom all said we didn't live long.

614
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,860
This time...

615
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,860
What is this?

616
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,860
This is...

617
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
It's her.

618
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,860
How to save the Little Princess

619
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,860
You risked your life for Hu Yuan Zhen.

620
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,860
Now the fated fates are about to end.

621
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Do you regret it?

622
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,860
To save the Little Princess,

623
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
I don't regret.

624
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,260
The amusement the life is all about color

625
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,100
Of course

626
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,680
I give my memories from my sister

627
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,100
For gift from Yuanyuan

628
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,880
Let's be together longer

629
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,600
Ent хотя mases are stored like smoke

630
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,180
Ch sensuality newcom, you're not worth it

631
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,760
Thank you for your help

632
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,360
Blank memory

633
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,420
I hug you

634
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,620
I want to turn to jelly

635
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,340
I'm miserable

636
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,340
But it has become a moment

637
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,340
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life

638
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:23,340
But I can't save you

639
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,340
See the sky and the flowers fall

640
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:34,340
What's wrong with falling in love?

641
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,340
The moonlight shines on the two sides of the lake

642
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:46,340
I hold you tight but you remain silent

643
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,340
But the petals are falling

644
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,340
What's wrong with falling in love?

645
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:03,340
The eyes shine on the end of memories

646
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:09,340
How to say goodbye?

647
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
I'll put it on for you

648
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,340
I've been waiting for a long time

649
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:39,340
I miss Xiao Yuanzhen

650
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,340
If the queen can give Xiao Yuanzhen another brother

651
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,340
That's a lot of fun

652
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,340
If Zhen'er marries

653
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
I'll be happy

654
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,340
I'm not afraid of you

655
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,340
I'm not afraid of you

656
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
I'm not afraid of you

657
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
I'm not afraid of you

658
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
If Zhen'er marries

659
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
It will be more lively

660
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,340
I heard that Mr. Pei and Mr. Mei

661
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Are all living in the Prime Minister's mansion

662
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,340
Father, do you have any ideas?

663
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,340
I have a good idea

664
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:20,340
But this is not easy to choose

665
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
But after his father and I

666
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,340
I think

667
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
It's better to be with the Pei family

668
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,340
The key is that he doesn't marry

669
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:40,340
So Mr. Mei wants to marry

670
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,340
That's not it

671
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
He just doesn't want to marry

672
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
Why?

673
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
No father, no mother

674
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
No family, no food

675
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,340
You can't afford to get married

676
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,340
I've seen Mr. Mei

677
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
He's quite good

678
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,340
Father, don't be reckless

679
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
Zhen'er chooses a husband

680
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,340
He must choose one he likes

681
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,340
And you can be with him for the rest of your life

682
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,340
You can tell me

683
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Is the Pei family's cousin good?

684
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,340
It's good to have someone to accompany

685
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Look, look

686
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Zhen'er thinks the Pei family is good

687
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,340
But the Pei family is not

688
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,340
It's not good

689
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,340
It's not good

690
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
Look, look

691
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Zhen'er thinks the Pei family is good

692
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,340
Why is he so easy to talk?

693
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,340
You don't understand

694
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,340
Zhen'er, you've grown up

695
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,340
You've grown up

696
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,340
Father, I have another favor to ask

697
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,340
You've grown up

698
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,340
You've waited for a long time

699
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
Uncle

700
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,340
Come, pour the wine

701
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Please forgive me, I never drink

702
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,340
I know, I know

703
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,340
I know you don't drink

704
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,340
But it's not wine

705
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,340
It's called the royal family

706
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,340
It's a national drink

707
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,340
You taste it first

708
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,340
I say, you can't say you can't drink

709
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,340
My Zhen'er is very good at drinking

710
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Come, come

711
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Cheers

712
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,340
My husband doesn't drink

713
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,340
What's the matter with you?

714
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
Come

715
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,340
Taste it, taste it

716
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Give me a face

717
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,340
How is it?

718
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,340
Is it the mouth of the wine?

719
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,340
The mouth is fast-moisturizing

720
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
The wine is just like this

721
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,340
How is it?

722
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
How is it?

723
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,340
The wine is sweet and sour

724
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
It's really good

725
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Since you are a good man

726
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Let's drink

727
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Wine, cheers

728
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,340
Uncle

729
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,340
What about your cousin?

730
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,340
She's still drunk

731
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,340
Drink, the royal family

732
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
What are they doing?

733
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,340
The Duke said

734
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,340
Tonight, the two of them will be drunk

735
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,340
If the second lady comes back

736
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,340
Tell her

737
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,340
They are all drunk

738
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Which one should they take care of?

739
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,340
The second lady

740
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
The second lady

741
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
The second lady

742
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,340
The second lady

743
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
The second lady

744
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,340
The second lady

745
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,340
They are all drunk

746
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
Which one should they take care of?

747
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
The second lady, please look at it

748
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
Dad wants to test me

749
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
This trick is very difficult

750
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
He didn't think of it, right?

751
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,340
I'm so dizzy

752
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,340
The Duke is drunk

753
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,340
Ah Jie thought of it

754
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,340
I'm so dizzy

755
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,340
The Duke is drunk too

756
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Youcheng, you're back

757
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,340
You two little guys are drunk

758
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,340
Take care of them

759
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,340
You

760
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,340
You

761
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
You, come with me

762
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
I'm so dizzy

763
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
I'm so dizzy

764
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
Cousin, I'll take you back to your room

765
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Miss Min Zhuang, don't worry about me

766
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
You go back to your work

767
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,340
What did I say?

768
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,340
It seems that Zhen'er

769
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,340
Still care more about his cousin

770
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,340
Cousin

771
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,340
Do you know

772
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,340
My heart

773
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,340
Of course I know what cousin is thinking

774
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
Have a good rest

775
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,340
We'll go out tomorrow

776
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
I'm so dizzy

777
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
I'm so dizzy

778
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
I'm so dizzy

779
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
I'm so dizzy

780
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
I'm so dizzy

781
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
I'm so dizzy

782
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
I'm so dizzy

783
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
I'm so dizzy

784
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
I'm so dizzy

785
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
I'm so dizzy

786
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
I'm so dizzy

787
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
I'm so dizzy

788
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
I'm so dizzy

789
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
I'm so dizzy

790
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Don't you drink?

791
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
The alcohol is not bad

792
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
But it's really bad

793
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
You have to drink slowly

794
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
To taste the taste

795
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
And the alcohol is strong

796
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
You drink like this

797
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,340
I'm afraid it's too much

798
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,340
Didn't you send your cousin?

799
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
Why do you care about me?

800
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,340
I'm so dizzy

801
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,340
I'm so dizzy

802
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,340
I'm so dizzy

803
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,340
I'm so dizzy

804
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
I'm so dizzy

805
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,340
I'm so dizzy

806
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,340
I'm so dizzy

807
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
I'm so dizzy

808
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm so dizzy

809
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I'm so dizzy

810
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
I'm so dizzy

811
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
I'm so dizzy

812
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
I'm so dizzy

813
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,340
I'm so dizzy

814
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
The heart is full of lies

815
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
A moment is all colorless

816
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,340
Leave memories

817
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
The bitter color of the city

818
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,340
The promise of being full of love

819
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,340
Like a wind

820
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,340
How do you deserve to be replaced?

821
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,340
The past is sad

822
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,340
The past is sad

823
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
The most painful

824
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,340
But it has changed

825
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,340
A moment

826
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,340
The rest of my life is just to be with you

827
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,340
Like a ink

828
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
But

829
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,340
Can't be saved

830
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
Look at the petals

831
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
All fall

832
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,340
Can you fall in love?

833
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,340
What's wrong?

834
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,340
The sun is bright and the wind is cool

835
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,340
I hug you and you are silent

836
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
But the petals are all falling

837
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,340
Can you fall in love?

838
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
What's wrong?

839
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,340
The eyes are shining

840
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,340
The end of memories

841
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,340
What's wrong?

842
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,340
Goodbye

843
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,340
You look back

844
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,340
From this long time

845
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,340
I'm so dizzy

846
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
I'm so dizzy

847
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,340
I'm so dizzy

848
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,340
I'm so dizzy

849
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,340
I'm so dizzy

850
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,340
I'm so dizzy
