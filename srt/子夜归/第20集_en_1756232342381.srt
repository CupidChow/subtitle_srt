little bit of a

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,560
little bit of a

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
little bit of a

8
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
little bit of a

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
little bit of a

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
little bit of a

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
little bit of a

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
little bit of a

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,840
little bit re

Little bit ~~

15
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,440
How to make little bird with uwu

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,800
A little slice of tuna

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,280
Oh, the

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,280
shrimp

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,720
HidingExcuse me

20
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:11,360
licensed

21
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,880
You

22
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
What have you done?

23
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,560
In order to kill Mei,

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,720
I will leave half of the land.

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,600
This town

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,960
is wonderful.

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,840
Unless they find the eye of the town.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
But even if they find the eye of the town,

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
there is one person who will die.

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,800
Why must I die?

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,240
The action of blood

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,440
is to use blood to kill.

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,320
Diandal

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,720
It's hot.

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,240
When did you get it?

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,000
The fragrance you Yi sold here,

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,000
you haven't been hit yet.

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,280
The incense that my cousin left in the carriage

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,280
was always for you

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
You came to Lin Yanqiang

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,280
for me

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
I don't know how it is outside

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
What's going on?

44
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
The scrolls of the Xuanjian Temple

45
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
are recorded

46
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,280
The blood is hot and the blood is cold

47
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
I'll go find the coffin

48
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Where is the coffin?

49
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Do you remember

50
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,280
the story of the man who stole the goddess's clothes?

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
I once said

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
that we were different

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
not because of the gender

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
but

55
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
I can't give you the coffin

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,280
so I didn't dare to tell you

57
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,280
I regret

58
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,280
that time at the West Coast

59
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I was so worried

60
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
but I didn't feel sorry for you

61
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Yan

Mei Zhu Yu

65
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Mei Zhu Yu

66
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Mei Zhu Yu

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Mei Zhu Yu

68
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Mei Zhu Yu

69
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Mei Zhu Yu

70
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Mei Zhu Yu

71
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Mei Zhu Yu

72
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Mei Zhu Yu

73
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Mei Zhu Yu

74
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Mei Zhu Yu

75
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Mei Zhu Yu

76
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Mei Zhu Yu

77
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Mei Zhu Yu

78
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Mei Zhu Yu

79
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Mei Zhu Yu

80
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm sure this is the real thing.

81
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

82
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

83
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Only by killing the real one can I really avenge Wu Yu.

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

85
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

86
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm... dead.

87
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

88
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

89
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

90
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

91
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

92
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

93
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Thank you.

94
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

95
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

96
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Mei Zhu Yu!

97
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Cousin, this is...

98
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,280
If you break the formation, he will be rebelled.

99
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Cousin, you look fine.

100
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
I feel relieved.

101
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
The book on the boat...

102
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Cousin, did you remember wrong?

103
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
We didn't bring it on board.

104
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
But I saw...

105
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Cousin shouldn't have broken the Yasheng book.

106
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Look, it's all blood on the boat.

107
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,280
So, the formation really came from cousin.

108
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Cousin, can I have a word with you?

109
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Go ahead.

110
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,280
I just happened to learn this formation by chance.

111
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Just for fun.

112
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Fun?

113
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,280
We almost lost our lives in the formation.

114
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
You can't control it.

115
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Cousin, you misunderstood.

116
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
I didn't know you would break the formation.

117
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
I won't hurt you.

118
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
You won't hurt me?

119
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
You want to hurt others?

120
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Cousin is so kind.

121
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
When he knew he had doubts about you,

122
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,280
he brought him to Lin'an.

123
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,280
And he let Mi Xiang go in my carriage.

124
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Mi Xiang?

125
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Anyway, I asked cousin to come today

126
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
to get rid of my suspicion.

127
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
I have no hatred for anyone.

128
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
If he hadn't messed up everywhere,

129
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
he would have taken you away.

130
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Right. Cousin is so talented.

131
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,280
We almost lost our lives in the formation.

132
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm afraid it's not that easy to go back to Chang'an.

133
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,280
How much credit do you have for the Demon-divine Chaos?

134
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Cousin, I...

135
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
The Demon-divine value of the formation is so high.

136
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Why did you let Xiaosi buy it?

137
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
He should thank you.

138
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Cousin, when did you start to doubt me?

139
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,280
When you went back to Chang'an.

140
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I rarely burn incense.

141
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
In Ruyi Pavilion,

142
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
everyone knows my hobby.

143
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
But on the day you came,

144
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
the man went to light incense.

145
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
It was a very bad thing.

146
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Once the incense was lit,

147
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
I looked at you.

148
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
You are the one.

149
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Cousin, I'm so sorry.

150
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Please forgive me.

151
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
I didn't mean to hurt you.

152
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
You are the one.

155
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Cousin, you were right.

156
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
You are the one.

157
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
I thought you knew my sincerity.

161
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
If it's just a little trick like the incense,

162
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
why do you have to practice evil?

163
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
For you,

164
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
to ask for your love.

165
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
What do you mean?

166
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
I know.

167
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
You don't like me.

168
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
You are healthy,

169
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
and have good martial arts.

170
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
But I...

171
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
I don't like you.

172
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
I don't like you.

173
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm weak,

174
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
and sick.

175
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
When I was young,

176
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I swore that

177
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
I would get stronger one day.

178
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Then,

179
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I found out that

180
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
there is a way to suppress the gods.

181
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
So,

182
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
I made a right choice.

183
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
I thought

184
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
as long as I got this power,

185
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
I would be no different from ordinary people.

186
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
I would be even stronger

187
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
and deserve to hurt you.

188
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Now I'm successful.

189
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I can

190
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
rely on you

191
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
and worship you.

192
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Cousin,

193
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
we are more compatible, right?

194
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Rely on you?

195
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Rely on you?

196
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Cousin, you really like me.

197
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Of course I like you.

198
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Cousin,

199
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
you are my only true love.

200
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
When I fall into the formation,

201
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
do you have the thought of saving me?

202
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
It's easy to say,

203
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
but it's hard to do.

204
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
You are right.

205
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Yes.

206
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I hesitated.

207
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
But this is a human nature.

208
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
If I had no idea,

209
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
he would do the same.

210
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
If he falls into my trap,

211
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
he would hesitate.

212
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
He would think about himself first.

213
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Cousin,

214
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
do you think he will love you and care about you?

215
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Will he give up his life to save you?

216
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
He won't.

217
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
I don't need you.

218
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Pei Qingyao,

219
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
if you don't want to be with me,

220
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
just cooperate with me.

221
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
What are you doing?

222
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Help her.

223
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
It's good to feel pain,

224
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
but I'm afraid your evil eyes

225
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
won't be cured.

226
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Now you have to take good care of yourself.

227
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
If you keep being obsessed with it,

228
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
no one can save you.

229
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Fortunately, the mountain of Kunzhou is clear,

230
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
and there is a human world.

231
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
It's the best place to rest.

232
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
Kunzhou?

233
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Cousin, you have to go back to Kunzhou.

234
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
I'm afraid I can't go back.

235
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
I'm afraid I can't go back.

236
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
You have to go back to Kunzhou.

237
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
You have to go back to Kunzhou.

238
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Cousin.

239
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
You use your right eye to practice blood.

240
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Now you become like this,

241
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
you are doing it yourself.

242
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Do you want His Majesty to know about this?

243
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Cousin,

244
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
you are so heartless.

245
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
I've been heartless since I was a child.

246
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
You should know.

247
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Let's go.

248
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Let's go.

249
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Cousin,

250
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
you are so heartless.

251
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
I've been heartless since I was a child.

252
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Cousin,

253
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
you are so heartless.

254
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
I've been heartless since I was a child.

255
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Cousin,

256
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
you are so heartless.

257
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
I've been heartless since I was a child.

258
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Cousin,

259
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
you are so heartless.

260
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Cousin,

261
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
you are so heartless.

262
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Cousin,

263
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
you are such a cruel girl.

264
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
You should come to him —

265
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Cousin.

266
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Cousin,

267
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
I've been so heartless since I was a child.

268
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Nianxian.

269
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Let's go to class.

270
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Go.

271
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Go.

272
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
home!

273
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
You should go.

274
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Yeah.

275
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Ууау

276
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,480
It's also right.

277
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,120
Mei Silang.

278
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
I advise you not to think about me.

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,840
I will definitely not be your wife.

280
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,080
And,

281
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
don't forget what you promised me.

282
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,800
I swear,

283
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,680
I will never tell anyone.

284
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm leaving.

285
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,080
Perhaps,

286
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,000
you are a monster,

287
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,920
and you don't want to accept me.

288
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,920
But I believe,

289
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,080
one day,

290
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,240
you will be my wife.

291
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,920
Mei Silang.

292
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,840
My dear,

293
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,240
forget it.

294
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,800
Why are you so obsessed with a fifth wife?

295
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,960
I remember,

296
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,080
when I was a kid,

297
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I kissed her secretly,

298
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
and she cried.

299
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,120
At that time, I knew

300
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
she was the one I wanted.

301
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,080
Because she is the strongest

302
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,240
and most powerful woman

303
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
I have ever seen.

304
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,280
You are right.

305
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
But this lady

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
is too powerful.

307
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,880
She doesn't look like a lady.

308
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,000
You don't understand.

309
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,920
Flowers have their own meaning.

310
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
If all of them are small and small,

311
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800
and are well-behaved,

312
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,320
how boring it would be.

313
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,080
Probably,

314
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,480
you think she is stronger

315
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,240
or the woman who is extremely powerful

316
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
is even more骯ılicamente opしい.

317
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,200
It's just...

318
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,680
What?

319
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,000
It's just,

320
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,400
even though she is powerful,

321
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,920
but not as marvelous as you.

322
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,880
Yes.

323
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,320
I can get more than I want.

324
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,320
But I didn't expect it to be so simple.

325
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
All these years,

326
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
how much money did you spend on that man?

327
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
In the end, it's just a game.

328
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
In my opinion,

329
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,320
it's not worth to settle the score with that man.

330
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Yes.

331
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
It's worth to settle.

332
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
The

333
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Why did you come down?

334
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
The Lord told me a news.

335
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Meizhu Yu is indeed the angel of Changxi Palace.

336
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
So what?

337
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Meizhu Yu's hidden identity is of special use.

338
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm afraid he can't get along with his cousin.

339
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,320
The last one who can't get away is still the Shus.

340
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
I'll just wait and see.

341
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Look.

342
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Grandpa,

343
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
you said you wanted to take a bath when I came back.

344
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
I've been squatting for a long time.

345
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Why don't you go down the water?

346
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
What do you know?

347
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
It's important to take a bath.

348
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
But before going down the water,

349
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,320
I need to gather the power of the music

350
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
to recover my spirit.

351
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
You should have said earlier.

352
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
I can find a tank of water in the mansion.

353
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
I'll move a chair next to it.

354
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I can play music with you all night.

355
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
The city is our birthplace.

356
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
How can it be the same?

357
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
So,

358
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
you're still like a loach.

359
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
What do you know?

360
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
It's almost done.

361
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
Okay.

362
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
I'll go down the water.

363
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Grandpa,

364
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
do you know how to swim?

365
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Don't be carried away by the water.

366
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Grandpa.

367
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Grandpa.

368
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Grandpa.

369
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Grandpa.

370
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Grandpa.

371
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Little mortal,

372
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
don't you recognize me?

373
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Grandpa.

374
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
You...

375
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
You're so big.

376
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
So?

377
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Am I still pretty fierce?

378
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
You're fierce.

379
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Yes, you're fierce.

380
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
But...

381
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
But you scared me.

382
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Little...

383
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Grandpa.

384
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,320
You're like this.

385
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Go away.

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Little brat.

387
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,320
If you do this again, I'll bite you to death.

This is the surprise I told you.

397
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
I said I'd take her to play with you.

398

Wait.

You can get along with mortals.

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
You didn't fight me that day.

I didn't expect that

408
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320

What do you mean?

412
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
It's a way to delay the army.

413
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Delay the army?

414
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320

Kill the demons.

422
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
You're guilty.

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,780
He has a cat's bow?

581
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,980
What's going on?

582
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
Xiao Mao.

583
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,780
What are you doing?

584
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Xiao Si.

585
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,980
We shouldn't have

586
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,580
exposed our demon tricks to mortals.

587
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,380
But you've been with Xuan Hui for a long time.

588
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,780
You've seen the little snake retreat.

589
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
I think

590
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,780
we can't hide it from you.

591
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
I see.

592
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,780
So

593
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,380
you've known about it.

594
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,780
Xiao Si, I'm leaving too.

595
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Okay, Zhenjie.

596
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
This is

597
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,580
to pay you back for colluding with Hui Sect

598
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,380
and setting fire to my car.

599
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
This is

600
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,580
for the sake of the Demon-slaying Trouble.

601
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,780
The Demon-slaying Trouble

602
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,980
is a dog's business.

603
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,380
If you insist on taking me back to the Demon Realm,

604
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,980
why don't you kill me now?

605
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,980
It's not up to you.

606
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:47,980
Wait.

607
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
Do you know

608
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,780
the reason he committed the crime?

609
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,180
A criminal of the Demon-slaying Trouble.

610
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,180
I don't care about the reason.

611
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
I took his life-saving mirror

612
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,780
and found his past.

613
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,180
You can have a look.

614
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
Give it back to me.

615
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,380
Give it back to me.

616
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,380
Don't move.

617
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,780
Get up.

618
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,380
Ying Long.

619
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,980
We meet again.

620
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
Don't move.

621
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
How could this be?

622
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Lady Liu.

623
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,980
These little demons are so arrogant

624
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,380
that they are humiliated.

625
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,780
Have you

626
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,180
ever punished those little demons?

627
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,180
Ying Long's clan is very powerful.

628
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,580
Especially Xuan Sheng.

629
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,180
He was easily hurt when he was young.

630
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,780
I saw the scars on his body.

631
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,180
I thought it was just a joke between the little demons.

632
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,980
I didn't expect it.

633
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
You call these wounds

634
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,380
a joke between the little demons?

635
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,180
You're making fun of yourself.

636
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,780
You told me that.

637
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,180
I did what you told me.

638
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,780
Why did you punish me?

639
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,180
I didn't do it.

640
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
I didn't do it.

641
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,980
I didn't do it.

642
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,580
Master.

643
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,980
You were the one

644
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,180
who dealt with his case.

645
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,380
Now you know more about the Long Qu Man.

646
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,380
How to punish him?

647
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
It's up to you.

648
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
The Xuan Hui

649
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,980
killed the tree demon.

650
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,980
He deserved it.

651
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,380
But it's a game of chess.

652
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,180
The previous punishment

653
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,780
was indeed too heavy.

654
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,180
The rest of the 20 years of the demon's life,

655
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,980
I'll let you go

656
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,580
with the snake's power.

657
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,980
But even so,

658
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,980
I won't go back to the demon's world.

659
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,380
I want to be Ying Long.

660
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,380
If you don't go back, you won't.

661
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,780
He made a mistake,

662
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,380
but he's willing to.

663
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,580
I think

664
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,980
I can trust him once.

665
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,980
Since you're about to be born,

666
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,380
then stay in the mortal world

667
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,780
for a while.

668
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,380
Xiaosi.

669
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,780
Sister Zhen.

670
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,980
I swear

671
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,380
I won't tell anyone about this.

672
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,780
Then after you return to Chang'an,

673
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
you must keep an eye on him.

674
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,780
Sister Zhen.

675
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,780
I'm a mortal.

676
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,980
I can see a demon.

677
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,980
Are you sure?

678
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,980
Aren't you friends?

679
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,580
I'm afraid I can't keep an eye on my grandpa.

680
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,980
You call him grandpa?

681
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,980
He asked me to call him that.

682
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,580
In the demon world,

683
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,580
the Xuan Hui

684
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,180
calls Liu Niangzi sister.

685
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,180
Then what should you call Liu Niangzi?

686
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,180
Grandpa's sister?

687
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,780
Then I have to call Liu Niangzi...

688
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,380
Aunt.

689
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,380
Come on. Hold me.

690
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,580
Grandpa.

691
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,380
Liu Niangzi is so famous in the demon world.

692
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,780
So many people.

693
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,380
Why are you here?

694
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,980
I'm waiting for you.

695
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,180
I have something to tell you.

696
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,780
I've lived here for a long time.

697
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,380
I've seen a lot of people.

698
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,380
Now,

699
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,380
Mr. Pei's business is done.

700
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,780
I'll go back today.

701
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,180
I don't care what others think of me.

702
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,180
But I care what others think of you.

703
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,180
The fireworks in the human world

704
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,380
The flowers are falling

705
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,580
The old days are so warm

706
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,380
But I can't forget them

707
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,980
The candle and the silver are scattered

708
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,180
I'm lost

709
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,980
The night rain falls

710
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,780
The tears are silent

711
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,380
I look back

712
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,580
at the time

713
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,580
The old days are gone

714
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,580
Does it hurt?

715
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,980
If love can be reborn

716
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,180
Nothing can be changed

717
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:55,980
I'm sorry.

718
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,580
It's my fault.

719
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
From now on,

720
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,980
I will not allow myself

721
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,380
and others to hurt you.

722
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,580
What if I hurt you?

723
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,980
Why do you hurt me?

724
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,980
That's a bad thing.

725
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,180
Who made me have a bad temper and bad character?

726
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,380
As long as you want to do anything.

727
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Loving you

728
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,380
The flowers change color

729
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,880
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life

730
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,380
But I can't

731
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,380
Look at the petals falling

732
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:10,380
What's wrong with falling in love?

733
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,380
The moonlight is dry and the breath is cold

734
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:21,380
I hold you tight but you are silent

735
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:27,380
Look at the petals falling

736
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,380
What's wrong with falling in love?

737
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,380
The moonlight is dry and the breath is cold

738
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:44,380
How to say goodbye?

739
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:54,380
You look back at the old days

740
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:20,380
Thank you for watching
