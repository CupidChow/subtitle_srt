00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of a

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
little bit of a

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of a

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
little bit of a

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
little bit of a

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit of a

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
little bit of a

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
little bit of a

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
little bit of a

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
little bit of a

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
little bit of a

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
little bit of a

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
little bit of a

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
little bit of a

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
little bit of a

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
little bit of a

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
little bit of a

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
little bit of a

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
little bit of a

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
little bit of a

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
little bit of a

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
little bit of a

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
little bit of a

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
little bit of a

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
little bit of a

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
little bit of a

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
little bit

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
of a

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can escape from the hell by yourself.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I underestimated you.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But what if you come out?

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What can you change?

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Lord Gui Ying will be reborn tonight.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You have Lord Gui Ying's yuan pellet in your body.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll spare your life for now.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But it's hard to say about the young man beside you.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Since he wants to die soon,

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll be the one to blame.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll be the one to blame.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Take the formation.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll be the one to blame.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You want to be reborn tonight.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why is your yuan pellet not working?

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If we can't stop the evil spirits from destroying Chang'an,

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
we can't stop them.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Think of a way!

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Tell me.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What did you do to Lord Gui Ying?

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Tell me!

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I only know that the cat knows the mouse.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The heaven knows the hell.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you really think that you can stop everything?

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No!

91
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,900
Ya Chong?

92
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,280
Ya Chong?

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is my magic.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why did you change my fate?

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I didn't change your fate.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I am taking back what's mine.

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Watch out for the slide.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Thank you.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Madam! Madam!

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
My family is coming for me again. I'll go first.

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You have to be careful too.

102
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wait!

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Your light is broken. I'll give it to you.

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you.

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Thank you.

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That lamp was given to me by my father.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There's a cat's bow inside.

108
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Eighteen years ago, I chose you not because you passed by by accident.

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's because that lamp...

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
made him think of you as me.

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Eighteen years ago, your fate changed because of me.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Fortunately,

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
everything was in time.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No!

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you want to stop this,

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
kill me.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No.

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
No!

120
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No!

121
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yi Huan.

122
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't want to.

123
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't hesitate.

124
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't want to!

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No!

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Blood Slaughter Guiyin.

127
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Resist.

128
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Resist.

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Master!

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's useless.

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't believe it.

132
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't stop him.

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I can't.

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Except me, you're the only one who can take the bloodslaughter.

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hurry!

136
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you know what you should do?

137
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hurry!

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Eighteen years ago,

139
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I finally came back.

140
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Blood Slaughter Guiyin.

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I can't do it.

142
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
As long as the world is not destroyed,

143
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I won't die.

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I won't die.

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This time,

146
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can rebuild my demon world.

147
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll show the important demons of the queen

148
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
that the new world I created

149
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
for thousands of years

150
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
is the new path of the human and demon I gave.

151
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll show you the way.

152
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Madam.

153
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Are you really going to kill me?

154
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't bear to let her go.

155
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We can be together forever.

156
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We can be together forever.

157
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The Tao and the demon

158
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
are connected from the root.

159
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
They can't be merged.

160
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If you learn it,

161
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you'll be the first person in the world.

162
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
My wife just recovered.

163
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
She needs to be hospitalized.

164
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This long-term heart-saving omen

165
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
is the most important thing.

166
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Maybe it can help you.

167
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The Tao and the Demon

168
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You face the most difficult situation.

169
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You face the choice you have to make.

170
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
At that moment,

171
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
you'll understand.

172
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The Tao and the Demon

173
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The Tao and the Demon

174
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The Tao and the Demon

175
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The Tao and the Demon

176
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The Tao and the Demon

177
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The Tao and the Demon

178
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What's your name?

179
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
My name is Mei Zhu Yu.

180
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You are so strong.

181
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You are so strong.

182
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm so cool.

183
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm so cool.

184
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm so cool.

185
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We are so different.

186
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Aren't we born to be together?

187
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You made me greedy.

188
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You made me crazy.

189
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Even if you lose your mood,

190
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
you'll be tired,

191
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
tired,

192
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and bored.

193
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You can't leave me.

194
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll never leave you.

195
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Really?

196
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I won't let go.

197
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Puzhen.

198
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
From now on,

199
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I will never allow myself

200
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
or anyone to hurt you.

201
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Mei Zhu Yu.

202
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Mei Zhu Yu.

203
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We are different.

204
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I can't put you in a dilemma.

205
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm so ashamed.

206
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You took out the life of a mortal

207
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and were with me.

208
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And I...

209
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And I...

210
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I feel like I've only taken a part of my life

211
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and I'm with you.

212
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm so sorry.

213
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm so sorry.

214
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You are Mao Gu.

215
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm just sorry.

216
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm really...

217
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
lonely.

218
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm so sorry.

219
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm really sorry.

220
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm really sorry.

221
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm really sorry.

222
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm really sorry.

223
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm really sorry.

224
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm really sorry.

225
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Wang Jun.

226
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Wang Jun.

227
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Wang Jun, look at me.

228
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Look at me.

229
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Look at me.

230
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Look at me.

231
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Look at me.

232
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Listen to me.

233
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Look at me.

234
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Look at me.

235
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Look at me.

236
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Look at me.

237
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Look at me.

238
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Look at me.

239
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Look at me.

240
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Look at me.

241
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Look at me.

242
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Look at me.

243
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Look at me.

244
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Look at me.

245
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Look.

246
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I bought it while passing by.

247
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Shuang Jiang, the owner said

248
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
this is the first one in Chang'an.

249
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Let me have a try.

250
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's not bad.

251
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This lady Hu Zhu

252
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
is really good at business.

253
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Unlike us,

254
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
who can't even eat

255
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
in Changxi Palace.

256
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Everyone has his own...

257
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Everyone has his own ambition.

258
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Don't try to slander yourself.

259
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Besides, we're going down the mountain to pick up the goods.

260
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I've collected some demons recently.

261
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I think I can hold on for a while.

262
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Otherwise...

263
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Shuang Jiang.

264
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Shuang Jiang.

265
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Take the fourth brother back first.

266
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We can go to the next demon.

267
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You've been working hard these days.

268
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
No need.

269
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's just some little demons.

270
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
They're not under the painting.

271
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
They're not under the painting.

272
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
They're on my leg.

273
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Steamed cake!

274
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Steamed cake!

275
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Steamed cake!

276
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Steamed cake!

277
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Delicious steamed cake!

278
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
One of a kind steamed cake!

279
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Two steamed cakes.

280
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You're right.

281
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
My steamed cake has just been made.

282
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Master.

283
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Please have a try.

284
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
One steamed cake is one yuan.

285
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Two yuan.

286
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Thank you.

287
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Take care.

288
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Take care.

289
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Take care.

290
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That one was really good.

291
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yes.

292
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's much more popular than the previous Xie Wu Lang's poem.

293
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That's not Xie Wu Lang's poem either.

294
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But I've read the new version of Demon Slayer.

295
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Although there are some more demon paintings in it,

296
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
it doesn't seem to be scary at all.

297
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That demon is a bit... how do you say it?

298
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's blood and flesh. It's heartwarming.

299
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's right.

300
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Everyone, you've gone too far.

301
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Da Qing, you've all seen it.

302
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I didn't buy it.

303
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Brother, I have a new one here.

304
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
If you don't mind, I'll give it to you.

305
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Really? Thank you, Brother.

306
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
We'll be going now.

307
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Goodbye.

308
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Dishes are here.

309
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Please.

310
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Enjoy.

311
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I was in a hurry. Did I break anything?

313
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Fortunately, it's not your fault.

314
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
This is someone else's stuff. I have to return it to her.

315
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The Demon Slayer

317
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Where did you get this?

318
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
What do you think?

319
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Not bad.

320
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
No, do you all like to steal stuff?

321
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Is this a family tradition?

322
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I won't talk anymore.

323
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What did you come to buy?

324
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I saw the Demon Slayer before.

325
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Doesn't it have some herbs?

326
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
My father is not feeling well. I came to get him some medicine.

327
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What's wrong with your father?

328
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
He's very angry.

329
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
His temper is getting worse.

330
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Then, taking medicine is useless.

331
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Are you sure you came to get medicine?

332
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Where are you going?

333
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't have any more. Do you want more?

334
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Wait.

335
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't have any more. If you want more, follow me.

336
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Don't go. Don't run.

337
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I told you many times not to run.

338
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You forgot it so quickly.

339
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I told you many times I'm not a dog.

340
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm a snake.

341
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Can you not drag my clothes every time?

342
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yes, yes, yes.

343
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The only snake in the Demon Slayer.

344
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's so strong.

345
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

346
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
We are a family of dragons.

347
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
We don't care about you.

348
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Thank you.

349
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Let me introduce you to a friend.

350
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I don't want to know.

351
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
No.

352
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Let's go.

353
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Stand still.

354
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Little snake, no one is bullying you here.

355
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Last time, a pig demon threw a stone at me.

356
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But the hand-made sister has already told her father.

357
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Father has already hit his ass.

358
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
No other little demons dare to bully me.

359
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's good.

360
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Who are you?

361
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Are you a dragon like me?

362
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm not.

363
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But I have a good friend who is just like you.

364
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
He is a very powerful dragon.

365
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You do look a little bit old.

366
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Your good friend may be my grandfather.

367
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Slow down.

368
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Slow down.

369
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Lord Yagong.

370
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I have to fold this line.

372
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
This is the key.

373
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You are wrong.

374
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You have to fold it in half.

375
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Fold it in half.

376
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Princess, be careful.

377
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Be careful of your hands.

378
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Or I will do it.

379
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What do you want?

380
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You do it yourself.

381
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Come on.

382
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Let me show you.

383
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Look.

384
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You have to fold it along the edge.

385
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Along the edge.

386
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Be steady.

387
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
How is it?

388
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Is it good?

389
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's good.

390
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Is it good?

391
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's good.

392
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You are so good.

393
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's good.

394
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You are so bad.

395
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You are so good.

396
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You are so good.

397
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
My job.

398
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Anyway I got you a good heart.

399
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Finally I have you.

400
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
fading away

401
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You can't help화

402
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,200
It's been three months.

403
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,680
I haven't cleaned up the mess of the night.

404
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,520
Chang'an is peaceful now.

405
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,800
But you don't know

406
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,960
how many demons are making trouble outside.

407
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,400
Maybe I'll have to leave Chang'an in a while.

408
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,360
Are you up?

409
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,440
Yes, I am.

410
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,680
Mei Zhuyu, you've been sleeping for three months.

411
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,760
Even if you have a long life,

412
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,560
you can't survive the mess.

413
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,920
If you don't wake up,

414
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,880
I'll really be mad at you.

415
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,400
Fairy, come and have breakfast with me.

416
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,160
Coming.

417
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,400
Wen Hua, what do you want to eat this morning?

418
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,480
That guy...

419
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,840
He has already fallen in love with a girl whose ship I'm sailing right across the act of having a crush on.

420
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,960
Everyone has fallen for his affair now.

421
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:45,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,720

Oh

425
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080

00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,960
This is cherry peach filling sour sweet baked fruit ah salty baked there is also milk

427
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,000
The plate next to it is fried in a crisp oil with sesame seeds. Oh, it's so delicious

428
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Oh

429
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,800
Sir, what kind of thing do you want to buy?

430
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,960
Wolfman wolfman you've been standing here for a long time. Which one do you want

431
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,920
Or

432
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah

434
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:26,520
I heard that there are autumn pear on the street. Mrs. Cui's wife is pregnant and loves to eat

435
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,680
Oh

436
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,680
Oh, so you're the secretary of the Xuanjian Temple

437
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,040
We've seen that

438
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,660
No

439
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,520
I said I'd let you get some face

440
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,840
Recently, Chang'an is on the wind

441
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:01,120
Said as long as in the hall of the Guangdong under the touch of his wife pregnant food love food will touch the Xuanjian Temple every time suddenly appear

442
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,000
Not so exaggerated

443
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,920
Hey, I'm serious. Although ordinary women have a happy time, their tastes will change a little more

444
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But with your phoenix, you don't have to buy so much

445
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:23,720
I just want to be careful not to buy a little bit. Are you sure just a little bit

446
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

447
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,500

You're finally back. I'm so bored

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200

453
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,760
