1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,620
你不算 инicky ?

2
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,220
是不算的 ?

3
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,660
我还不算

4
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,780
无天下皇室

5
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,240
后面有人在

6
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,020
Who's this

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,220
We forgot

8
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,400
Even you

9
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,160
知道aan Katherine

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,600
I use Taobao to buy, ordering take-out is more advantageous

11
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Of course he won'tOK

12
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,060
Cringley

13
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Hahahahahaha

14
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,060
I think he...

15
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,060
Won't take the chance

16
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,060
Of buying together

17
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,060
Bat within his power

18
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,000
There 내 a Goddess

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Please be your contents

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
only when you get his belly

21
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,640
At that

22
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
The more you get he more beautiful

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
My boss actor

24
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,840
沒有.

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,660
Don't think

26
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,660
What's going on?

27
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,660
Where is it?

28
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
My Lady?

29
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,660
What happened here?

30
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
Nothing.

31
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,660
Just now, a servant came to report that he saw something ominous.

32
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,660
Ominous?

33
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
Why didn't I see it?

34
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Then the servant must have seen it wrong.

35
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,660
Nothing.

36
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,660
Nothing.

37
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,660
Nothing.

38
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
Continue the banquet.

39
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Where is the lamp?

40
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,660
Where did it go?

41
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,660
I'll go out and have a look.

42
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,660
The servant went out and saw something.

43
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,660
But he met the shadow demon again.

44
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,660
He ran away again.

45
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,660
Yes.

46
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
He was still there before the banquet.

47
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
He has legs.

48
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
He can't catch it.

49
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
Then we can only take the shadow demon away first.

50
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,660
Wait.

51
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
There is something that you have to do.

52
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,660
Little boy.

53
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Why are you here?

54
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,660
I just saw something.

55
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,660
What?

56
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
A lonely man and a widow are together in the dark.

57
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
It's really...

58
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,660
The fifth lady is really like the legendary one.

59
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,660
She is very rich and rich.

60
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,660
She wants to marry a man.

61
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,660
Mr. Mei is so lucky.

62
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,660
So lucky.

63
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,660
Whether she is a nun or a widow,

64
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
the girl's family is not like a man.

65
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
It's better to focus on fame.

66
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
It makes sense.

67
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Show yourself.

68
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
The kitten entrusted you to me.

69
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Today I will help you.

70
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,660
Mr. Mei.

71
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
Don't worry.

72
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,660
I'll take her to see you right now.

73
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Mr. Mei.

74
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,660
It's my honor to meet you here.

75
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
I feel honored too.

76
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,660
I really like the poems you sent me.

77
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
The words are so clear.

78
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
The music is so beautiful.

79
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,660
You are exaggerating.

80
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,660
It's just that

81
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
I heard that you are a very good singer.

82
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
I'm not a good singer.

83
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
It's just that

84
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,660
I heard that she is not from your hand.

85
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
You are really good at joking.

86
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
Who said such a rumor?

87
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660
It's me.

88
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Just now...

89
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Gu Wei.

90
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,660
Gu Wei.

91
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,660
Look at her.

92
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
I know her.

93
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,660
Mr. Mei.

94
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
You are...

95
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
What are you doing?

96
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,660
What are you playing?

97
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
Mr. Xie.

98
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
You sent Yunyi here.

99
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
I sent her here.

102
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
What Yunyi?

103
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
I don't know her.

104
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
About three or four years ago,

105
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
Yunyi was in Chang'an.

106
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Known for her talent.

107
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
You are her guest.

108
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
This lily lamp

109
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,660
is Yunyi's favorite.

110
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
The person on this lamp

111
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
is Yunyi's daughter.

112
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
You just took this lamp away.

113
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
You kept it for yourself.

114
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
And you sent it to me.

115
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
What does Mrs. Liu mean?

116
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
I don't understand.

117
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
Mr. Mei.

118
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
Mr. Mei.

119
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Don't come over.

120
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
Mr. Mei.

121
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,660
Tang Jun.

122
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,660
Let me ask you.

123
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,660
How did you get the name of the Crown Prince?

124
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
Let me go.

125
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
I don't know you.

126
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
I was in the Jiguang.

127
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
You were in the Golden Palace.

128
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,660
The horse was riding on the bridge.

129
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
The whole building was red.

130
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
I thought I was finally a good person.

131
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
You never forget

132
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
how you taught me how to give my heart.

133
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,660
The seven bones of the mountain are the dreams of the west.

134
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,660
The horse is riding on the bridge.

135
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
The horse is riding on the bridge.

136
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
I'm a good person.

137
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
I'm a good person.

138
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,660
I used to work hard.

139
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
I was afraid of being left alone in the fire.

140
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
I never went out.

141
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
And there was very little human.

142
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
I didn't want to see my master

143
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
as a tool of recruiting guests.

144
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,540
Yin Xue,

145
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,140
after I met you,

146
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,540
I gave you the silver and the stone.

147
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,820
Please help me.

148
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,260
After I gave you the stone,

149
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,140
I had no more silver.

150
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,740
Every time I asked you,

151
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,220
you said that the stone was simple and simple.

152
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,100
No one liked it.

153
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,220
Until one day,

154
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,860
I saw a dead end.

155
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,300
Help!

156
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,740
Help! Help!

157
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,100
Day after day,

158
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,300
my work was gathered in it.

159
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,140
But it was your name.

160
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,980
You made my work a treasure.

161
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,780
When you were not called a talent,

162
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,220
did you have any money?

163
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,700
Help! Help!

164
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,740
Yun Yi's hard work

165
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,460
ended up making you a wedding dress.

166
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,780
At that time, you were so shameless.

167
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,740
Now you are afraid.

168
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,580
Mr. Yubo,

169
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,340
you must give me an explanation.

170
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,500
What explanation?

171
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,300
What do you think you are?

172
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,660
You are just a girl

173
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,100
who doesn't know fame.

174
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,220
What?

175
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,420
You were so easy to get the stone.

176
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,660
If it were in your name,

177
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,060
there would be no chance for father and son.

178
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,660
But the stone

179
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,780
was from my hand.

180
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,580
From your hand?

181
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,580
But they didn't like your poem.

182
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,660
But things that can be written,

183
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,060
you can play with.

184
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,980
You sent meAAAAA

185
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,500
to get it read.

186
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,540
It was all due to my hired master.

187
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,300
The poem wasn't so important to me.

188
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,980
Well, you should just thank me.

189
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,740
It is an unboxing of gift.

190
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,460
I hope our relationship is over.

191
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,940
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,980
You heard about Yunyi.

193
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,980
You didn't blame yourself.

194
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,500
Instead, you pretended to force her to marry you.

195
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,220
You were so angry

196
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,100
that you couldn't do as you wished.

197
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,700
I didn't.

198
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,140
You're a liar!

199
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,900
Mr. Xie,

200
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,140
you still refuse to admit it?

201
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,020
I didn't expect

202
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,340
you'd give Yunyi's thing

203
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,260
to me.

204
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,020
But you don't know that

205
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,980
Yunyi

206
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,300
is not an ordinary person.

207
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,140
She's a painting of Baning Lantern.

208
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,220
I mean,

209
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,700
she's not a Devil

210
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,960
but she dare not make evil decisions.

211
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,260
You mean

212
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,740
that she was a Demon once?

213
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,060
Light of Amber

214
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,780
turns into her own.

215
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,100
A πουng,

216
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,100
until you use the light of the lamp.

217
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Wolf King, I'm still holding my breath

218
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
just to see

219
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,100
what will happen to you

220
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,100
who has been in the dark for so long.

221
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
Help! Help!

222
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
I'm done! I'm done!

223
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Help! Help!

224
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
I'm done! I'm done!

225
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
I'm done!

226
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Help!

227
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Enough, Yunyi.

228
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Let's stop here.

229
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
I know that you haven't finished your wish

230
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,100
before you can use the light of the lamp.

231
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
But it's not the best thing to take his life.

232
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Yunyi, someone asked me to tell you something.

233
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,100
What?

234
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Instead of taking his life,

235
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,100
why don't we let his evil deeds be revealed to the world?

236
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,100
He was defeated by the world

237
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
and let him see his own life

238
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
and fall into the abyss.

239
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
It's better than letting him die.

240
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
It's more appropriate.

241
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,100
That's good too.

242
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,100
You're not going to change your mind.

243
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,100
I'm afraid you're running out of breath.

244
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,100
I used to want to steal the true feelings of the world.

245
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
But I didn't expect people to be so cruel

246
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
and cruel.

247
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
The wish I made

248
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,100
has gone with the wind.

249
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,100
It's hard to keep your heart.

250
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,100
It's really boring.

251
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,100
It's enough to accompany the world

252
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,100
through this experience.

253
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Yun Mommy, you're here.

254
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Your CONSIDERATION

255
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,100
You will die at last.

256
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Noah...

257
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Yun!

258
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
It seems you've lost your life.

259
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
He only wanted

260
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,900
to clear the로 Байох 없 Uno Gatitua,

261
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Now that I've left,

262
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
I must be in Wuhan.

263
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
My lord!

264
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
My lord!

265
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Let me go!

266
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Xie Luobai

267
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
and Yunyi Niangzi

268
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
are close relatives.

269
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
They even used her trust

270
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
to take the woman's poem

271
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
and write it as a memento

272
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
and steal her poems.

273
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
This woman

274
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
is innocent

275
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
and loyal.

276
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Last night at the banquet,

277
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
she was guilty of being a thief

278
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
and had a bad heart.

279
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
But she got scared

280
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
and went crazy.

281
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
This is really bad.

282
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
How old is Yunyi Niangzi's poem?

283
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
How small is Xie's name?

284
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
If so,

285
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Xie Luobai

286
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
should have been

287
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
living in Yunyi's shadow.

288
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
This officer,

289
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
you're right.

290
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
This is called

291
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
good oil and good sand.

292
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
Good oil and good sand.

293
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
Niangzi.

294
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Niangzi.

295
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
You're here so soon.

296
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Niangzi,

297
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
please be careful.

298
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
You'd better

299
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
go back to your home.

300
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Stay away from Niangzi

301
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
so that she won't

302
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
ruin you again.

303
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
What do you want from me?

304
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
Your marriage.

305
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
I knew it.

306
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
These days,

307
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
I've read

308
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
your paper

309
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
several times.

310
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Mei Zhuyu

311
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
is indeed a talent.

312
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Her heart and style

313
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,900
are different from those of the rich.

314
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,900
Those young men

315
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
only look at Chang'an's prosperity.

316
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
They are both

317
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
good at hiding things from the world

318
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
and good at hiding things from the world.

319
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
They never thought

320
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
the hidden danger

321
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
behind this flower bed.

322
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
What does that mean?

323
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,900
What does that mean?

324
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
I mean

325
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Mei Zhuyu

326
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
is quite talented.

327
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
You're interested in her.

328
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
You're interested in her.

329
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
You're not destined to be together with her.

330
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
You should get along with her.

331
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Why did you give up so soon?

332
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
Didn't you tell me

333
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
to tell you that

334
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
I'm not suitable for her?

335
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
Why are you talking back now?

336
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
What about you?

337
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I...

338
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Did I say that?

339
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
Yes.

340
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
Or not?

341
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
Chen and I

342
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
have been together for twenty years.

343
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
We've always been

344
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
secretly hiding and hiding.

345
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Why are you so obedient this time?

346
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
It's my fault

347
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
that I'm obedient.

348
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Her Majesty is so hard to serve.

349
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Hard to serve?

350
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Who's hard to serve?

351
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Your Majesty.

352
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
Yes.

353
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Your Majesty, look at her.

354
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
What did you spoil her?

355
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
It has nothing to do with me.

356
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
It's you.

357
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
You've been giving her

358
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
all kinds of new things.

359
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Look at her.

360
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
What did you spoil her?

361
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
She's so evil,

362
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
so evil,

363
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,900
so evil,

364
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
so evil, so evil.

365
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Don't be angry, Mei.

366
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,900
It's my fault

367
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,900
that she's so mean.

368
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
She's so picky.

369
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,900
She's not good enough for anyone.

370
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Let's go to the heaven to find an immortal.

371
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,900
Your Majesty,

372
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
where are you going?

373
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Consort Mei.

374
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
Come on.

375
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
You're all knelt down.

376
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
Zhen Er.

377
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
Thank you.

378
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
Brother-in-law.

379
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Thank you, too.

380
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
To be honest,

381
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I support your father.

382
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
After all,

383
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
marriage is not fun.

384
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
I'm just an example.

385
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Really?

386
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Look at them.

387
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
Look at them.

388
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
They're all good.

389
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
They're all good at everything.

390
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
But I...

391
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
I don't have anyone to eat with.

392
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
I'd rather be alone and free.

393
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Sometimes I think,

394
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
what's the point of marrying them?

395
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
It's interesting.

396
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
precision

397
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:11,480
Legends of Stone Forest

398
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,160
That's it, I show you what I've got.

399
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
The flower lantern has been put out.

400
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Where will the flowerless flower be?

401
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
When I arrived at the study that day,

402
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
the flowerless flower was no longer on the lantern.

403
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
What should I do now that the flowerless flower is gone?

404
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,900
Xiao Zhen, think carefully.

405
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Who will take the flowerless flower away?

406
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Could it be Meizhuo Yu?

407
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
What is he doing with the flowerless flower?

408
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
He is trying to take away the flowerless flower.

409
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
What is he doing with the flowerless flower?

410
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Could it be that the Xuanjian Bureau

411
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
used it as a witness for the case of the ghost?

412
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
This matter cannot be known by the private school.

413
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Otherwise, those old ghosts

414
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
will come to trouble us.

415
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
It's too late.

416
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
The elders have already known.

417
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
How could they know?

418
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,900
When I was taking a bath in Tang,

419
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
I happened to meet the little demon in the ghost house.

420
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
We were having a chat while we were making the soup.

421
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
We chatted for a while.

422
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Then we accidentally said...

423
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
You can just talk nonsense.

424
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
How dare you talk nonsense?

425
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
The little demons

426
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
are just chatting for a while.

427
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Why are you so angry?

428
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
The shadow demon matter

429
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,900
is over.

430
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,900
But the problem of the flowerless flower

431
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
has never been mentioned

432
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
by the little demons.

433
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
What?

434
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
You don't care about the supervision of the four schools?

435
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Elder Hui,

436
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
I don't think the little demons will do that.

437
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Maybe it's because

438
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
they are busy with work.

439
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
Yes, Elder Hui.

440
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
You are really considerate.

441
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
I didn't tell the four schools about this.

442
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
I was thinking

443
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
I should go back to the flowerless flower.

444
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Then I will tell everyone.

445
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
The flowerless flower is not something strange.

446
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,900
There are many living things in the world.

447
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,900
Sometimes there are flowerless flowers.

448
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
There is nothing

449
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
to be surprised about.

450
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Since the two elders

451
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
have made the flowerless flower matter so easy,

452
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
I think it's easy

453
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,900
to bring the flowerless flower back to the demon world.

454
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
I have already

455
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
gone to find it.

456
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
It's not easy.

457
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
I can't do it.

458
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
How about we make an appointment with the cat master

459
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
for another ten lines?

460
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
If the cat master can't bring the flowerless flower back,

461
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
then the previous account

462
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
will be counted together.

463
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Elder Hui.

464
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
Okay.

465
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
I promise you.

466
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,900
In five days,

467
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
I will bring

468
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,900
the flowerless flower

469
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,900
back to the demon world.

470
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
It's a deal.

471
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Lord Shu.

472
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Lord Shu.

473
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Lord Shu.

474
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
What's wrong?

475
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
You are angry.

476
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
I am also

477
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
a bit helpless.

478
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
It's my duty.

479
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Otherwise...

480
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,900
I told you.

481
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,900
I hate people who are against him.

482
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
Lord Shu, you are joking.

483
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,900
I don't like jokes.

484
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
You know it.

485
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
Actually,

486
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
how did you handle that?

487
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
It's my fault.

488
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
There are many things

489
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,900
to do in the demon world.

490
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
I don't know if the cat master can come.

491
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
How about I help him?

492
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
No need.

493
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
He has me.

494
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
I have to go now.

495
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
I will go.

496
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Bye.

497
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
I will go.

498
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Bye.

499
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
Bye.

500
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
They have already found the flowerless flower.

501
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
They even searched the Xuanjian Temple

502
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
and the Meisi Temple.

503
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
There is no trace of the flowerless flower.

504
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Then Mei Zhu is left.

505
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,260
Put it on your finger

506
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,820
What is it 5th miss?

507
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,260
I'm coming to see you

508
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,380
Do you think I have come here brokenhearted?

509
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,740
Why are you looking at me

510
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,900
I can't help it if I get something I like.

511
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,900
I knew you were going to build a tomb today, so I came to play with you.

512
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,900
I never thought that the road to your house is so rough.

513
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,900
My feet and shoes are dirty.

514
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
What should I do?

515
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Which foot is dirty?

516
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Huh?

517
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,900
The bones are fine.

518
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
You know how to treat them?

519
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
I do.

520
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,900
You're not only handsome, but also talented.

521
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Since you're fine, then I'll go in and rest.

522
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Wait!

523
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Can you cook?

524
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,900
What do you want to eat?

525
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Whatever.

526
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Which way?

527
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,900
The house doesn't look big.

528
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
Where is it?

529
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
I'll go in and rest.

530
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,900
Mr. Long, I think this county magistrate is serious about you.

531
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
Don't talk nonsense.

532
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,900
She probably wrote a letter of apology.

533
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
She wouldn't come every day.

534
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Ha ha ha ha!

535
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Why is it you again?

536
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,900
I'm passing by. I'll get you a meal.

537
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
What? What are you doing?

538
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Wuniangzi,

539
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,900
you came to my house without permission.

540
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Something is wrong.

541
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
If others see you, it will affect your reputation.

542
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Don't worry, young man.

543
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,900
You're so ordinary. No one saw you.

544
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
My reputation is bad.

545
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
It won't be worse.

546
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Eat.

547
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Young man.

548
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
I heard you're good at chess.

549
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
I'm here to ask for advice.

550
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Wenhua, prepare the dishes.

551
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Here's your gift.

552
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
The new wine from Ruyi House.

553
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Why are you so late?

554
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
I've been waiting for you. Give it to me.

555
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Here.

556
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
How did you get in?

557
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Through the wall.

558
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,900
I've been looking for you for days.

559
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
I didn't see the shadow of the Buhua Valley.

560
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
Could it be on you?

561
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Oh!

562
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
It's not on me!

563
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,900
What?

564
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,900
You're so old.

565
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
You're so old.

566
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
You're so old.

567
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,900
I've been waiting for you.

568
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
Don't be so rude.

569
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
I've been waiting for you.

570
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
I'm so sorry.

572
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
I don't know what to do.

573
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm so sorry.

574
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,900
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,900
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,900
What are you doing?

577
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
What is my wife doing?

578
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
Little boy's waist is so soft.

579
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
Zhenjian,

580
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,900
you really go to Xiao Zhu's house to cook every day?

581
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,900
I'm afraid you're drunk and don't want to drink.

582
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I just go there for people

583
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
and cook by the way.

584
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
I don't know where your little Zhu Yu

585
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
got the little bamboo shoots from.

586
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
The cooking is not bad.

587
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,900
Outside Chang'an.

588
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,900
On the way back to Chang'an,

589
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
I accidentally went out of the city.

590
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
Culture is in it.

591
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Although he lost his family,

592
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
he still has a good life.

593
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm afraid he's not going to be able to live in Chang'an.

594
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Although he lost his family,

595
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,900
he grew up in Chang'an and didn't want to leave.

596
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,900
I bought him and brought him back.

597
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,900
It's also a good thing that we have each other.

598
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,900
He took good care of you.

599
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,900
Spring is full of face,

600
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
and white rice is red.

601
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Spring is full of face, white rice is red.

602
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
I'm afraid it has nothing to do with culture.

603
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
It's okay.

604
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Culture is going to close the car.

605
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,900
I'll go to get some tea.

606
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
But why did you invite us to dinner today?

607
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
Sister Zhen,

608
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
I haven't seen you for days.

609
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
Besides,

610
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
what's going on with you?

611
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,900
You not only go to his house to eat,

612
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
but also ask dad to take care of him.

613
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,900
You really like Xiao Zhuyu, don't you?

614
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
He looks good.

615
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,900
Why can't I really like him?

616
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
You two are not compatible.

617
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
What do you mean?

618
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Look,

619
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
according to the status of the Empress and the five states,

620
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,900
it must be to let you find a royal family or a noble family.

621
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,900
I'm a little brother.

622
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,900
One has no money, two has no power, three is not good at hidden hearts.

623
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
Naturally not suitable.

624
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,900
What about royal family and noble family?

625
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
What about the brothers and sisters?

626
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,900
The world is not all about one's heart.

627
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,900
The people, all living things,

628
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
have their own way of survival.

629
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
For example, Mr. Mei,

630
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,900
everyone thinks he has no power, no power, no power.

631
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
But I admire him.

632
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,900
Never in front of the whole world,

633
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
father did not agree.

634
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,900
Also not in front of the superior,

635
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
false and ungrateful.

636
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,900
He never went to a camp because of my identity.

637
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,900
He never went to a camp because of my identity.

638
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
He is not interested in love between men and women.

639
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
He is not interested in wealth and power.

640
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,900
It seems to be true.

641
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
When I look at him,

642
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,900
I always feel that he is a little beast with no fate.

643
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
In the world that does not belong to him,

644
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
he is constantly adhering to his own beliefs.

645
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
His beliefs?

646
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
Xiaosi,

647
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
with our identities,

648
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,900
we have seen the world full of ups and downs.

649
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
But he is so pure and real.

650
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
Do you know what he said?

651
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
To get revenge and to get back what you have lost.

652
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
To get back what you have lost.

653
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
To get back what you have lost.

654
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
It's the same wherever you do it.

655
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,900
As long as you do your own thing, you will get it.

656
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
He only wants to do his own thing.

657
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Such a handsome young man

658
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
is naturally attractive.

659
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,900
But his life is too cold.

660
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
I asked you to take care of him.

661
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
I just want him to warm up.

662
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
I really did not expect

663
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
that Sister Zhen is like me.

664
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,900
She is a little beast.

665
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Is he handsome?

666
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
Yes.

667
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
I'm sorry, everyone.

668
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
I'm late.

669
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
I did not expect that the demons of Liu's mansion are so powerful.

670
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
Tell Lady Liu for me.

671
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
Do not worry.

672
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I am here to save her today.

673
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
What demon?

674
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
Our mansion is very stable.

675
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,900
But the young master is always coming to the door and entangling my wife.

676
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
It's really not good.

677
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
You do not hide from me.

678
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
I have seen it all.

679
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,900
Mei Si.

680
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Why are you so angry this morning?

681
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
My mansion is very peaceful.

682
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
I am healthy.

683
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
You see it yourself.

684
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Please go back.

685
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
No. I do not believe it.

686
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,900
If there is no strange phenomenon,

687
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
why would you talk to me so far away?

688
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
There must be a trick.

689
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,900
I will not leave easily.

690
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
I bought these things from the temple.

691
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,900
I will give you blood.

692
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
No.

693
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
Let the dog go.

694
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,900
Boss.

695
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
The time to make an appointment with the four gates is coming.

696
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Did you find the Buhua Valley?

697
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,900
Drink some water first.

698
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,900
I found it.

699
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
It is dark.

700
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
We have been looking for the Buhua Valley for a few days.

701
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
I did not expect it to be on her.

702
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Just put it on her?

703
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
That man Mei is a mortal.

704
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,900
He was not caught by the Buhua Valley.

705
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,900
I do not know.

706
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,900
Anyway,

707
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
I have to get the Buhua Valley back quickly.

708
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Just do not do it.

709
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,900
I will just knock her out.

710
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
No.

711
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,900
She is from the Xuanjian Temple.

712
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
She is very cautious.

713
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,900
You have to be more careful.

714
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,900
Do not worry about the four gates.

715
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
Even if you can not find it back,

716
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
they are in trouble.

717
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,900
I will help you to hold the sky.

718
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
What are you doing?

719
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Last time, when Lingxiao talked about Tang Quan,

720
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
I was thinking,

721
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,900
if the medicine is right,

722
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,900
will it be the wrong way to take the medicine?

723
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,900
You do not want me to throw the medicine, do you?

724
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
The one who knows me is Xiao Zhen.

725
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Master Zhen,

726
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,900
I plan to study a medicine to eat.

727
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
I seem to have a way.

728
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Knock her out.

729
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,900
A personal item.

730
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,900
It seems that the medicine can be obtained when necessary.

731
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
The medicine is not here.

732
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
I will go to the temple.

733
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,900
I will go to the temple.

734
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
I will go to the temple.

735
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,900
I will go to the temple.

736
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
I will go to the temple.

737
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
I will go to the temple.

738
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,900
I will go to the temple.

739
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
I will go to the temple.

740
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,900
I will go to the temple.

741
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
I will go to the temple.

742
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
I will go to the temple.

743
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
I will go to the temple.

744
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
I will go to the temple.

745
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
I will go to the temple.

746
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
I will go to the temple.

747
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Who?

748
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
The flower of the heart is burnt for a lifetime

749
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
The flower of the heart is burnt for a lifetime

750
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Leave memories

751
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
Leave memories

752
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
Leave memories

753
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
Leave memories

754
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,900
Leave memories

755
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,900
Leave memories

756

775
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,980
Kunlun

776
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
Kunlun

777
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,980
See if he is here

778
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,440
Let me do the usual

779
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,900
Kunlun

780
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,900
What are you looking at?

781
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,900
The flower of pulley

782
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
Kunlun

783
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900

785
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Let me chance

786
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Let me chance

787
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,900
You didn't recognize me

788
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
You didn't recognize me

789
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,900
Okay

790
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,900
What did I do wrong?

791
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Determined

792
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,860
Determined

793
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:49,900
The moonlight shines on the bright and bright

794
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:55,900
I hug you, but you are silent

795
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,900
But the petals are falling

796
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:06,900
But what's wrong with falling in love

797
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,900
The eyes are shining at the end of the memory

798
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,900
How to say goodbye

799
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:28,900
You look back, once in a long time
