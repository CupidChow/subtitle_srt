00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,420
Let me know

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,420
Episode 2

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,420
It's the incense.

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,420
Little monster! Little monster! Little monster!

26
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,420
Little monster, I'm not not taking you out to play.

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,420
You can't play with us.

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Half breath, no strength.

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
You can't get up after one fall.

30
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Half breath, no strength.

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
You can't get up after one fall.

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Half breath, no strength.

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
You can't get up after one fall.

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Half breath...

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,640
Who is it?

36
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,440
He can't play with you.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
I can.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
It's you!

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Run!

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Run!

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Run!

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
I heard you are my cousin.

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Let's go to the countryside together.

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
I want a rose.

45
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
I want a rose.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,440
So many?

47
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Yes.

48
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,440
I want some.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I want some.

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
I want some.

51
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
You came all the way here.

52
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
You came all the way here.

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Why do you have so many spices?

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Why do you have so many spices?

55
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Why do you have so many spices?

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
I only have this incense for myself.

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,440
I only have this incense for myself.

58
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Do you like it?

59
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
I like it.

60
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
I like it.

61
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
You are a young man.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,440
You are a young man.

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,440
You are a young man.

64
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
You have been preparing for the Dousiang meeting for so long.

65
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
You came all the way here.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
You came all the way here.

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,440
It's not worth it.

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
I heard that some people

69
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
are doing things for the world.

70
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Some people are doing things for others.

71
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
I don't care about the world.

72
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
I only care about

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,440
the people.

74
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
There is another

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
incense from the Kuang family.

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,440
It's from the hand of

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Master An Bi Luo.

78
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
It's made by the Dousiang meeting.

79
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
It's made by the Dousiang meeting.

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Master An.

81
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Master An's incense.

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Master An.

83
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
He has been preparing for this for so long.

84
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
He really doesn't need to do this.

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
He really doesn't need to do this.

86
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,440
This is the Four-legged Dice.

87
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
This is the Four-legged Dice.

88
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
This is the Four-legged Dice.

89
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,940
The

90
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,200
yin

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,300
is

92
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,140
the

93
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,200
eye

94
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,660
is the Th Rail

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,660
complete

96
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,740
hype

97
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,440
It's really rare.

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
This incense stove is found in all corners of the world.

99
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
It's rare.

100
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,440
But in terms of value, it's not more fragrant than the incense.

101
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Then what is the name of this incense?

102
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Qilin incense

103
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Qilin incense?

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
So this is Qilin incense.

105
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,440
I heard that this incense is the new work of Master An.

106
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
It's made of the spirit of the world.

107
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,440
But only the nine incense sticks can be used.

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,440
If you burn it, it will make you young and old.

109
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
You will not be tired.

110
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,200
The

111
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,440
next episode

112
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
What is the house made of?

113
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Use phoenix feather as the main material.

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Then grind the dragon forest into powder.

115
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Use the incense of Suhe, Anxi, Longxian, etc.

116
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,440
The fire cloud will last for a thousand days.

117
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Phoenix feather dragon forest.

118
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
The ancient work of Xuan Xu.

119
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Will there really be something in this world?

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Don't say that, Master An.

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
He must have his own purpose.

122
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Take it carefully

123
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Beast

124
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Flame

125
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Also half water

126
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,040
Cheng'an is the most suis Lagut.

127
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,700
As for Produce Pandemic,

128
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,440
they want to pass by Chang'an arena.

129
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,380
China unbelievable.

130
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,880
Does provided really?

131
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,620
How's that, The story?

132
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Don't say that.

133
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,620
How can you say that?

134
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,620
What you know is like

135
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,620
nothing.

136
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,620
It's just that we have not enough layers.

137
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,620
We can't enjoy it.

138
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
It's too ugly.

139
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,620
Thank you.

140
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
How is my fragrance?

141
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
This...

142
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
It's too ugly.

143
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
This fragrance is really good.

144
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,620
It seems that

145
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,620
it's a little...

146
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,620
It's a little...

147
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
It's a little...

148
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,620
It's a little...

149
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
It's a little...

150
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
It's a little...

151
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
It's the scent of a discipline.

152
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
It's just like

153
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
the snow of the Chinese knot in several spirits.

154
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
Everything started off.

155
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
A perfect estabaise.

156
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,620
We haven't been back to Chang'an for years.

157
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,620
It was so special to taste it today.

158
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,620
The call-in of beauty and beauty!

159
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,620
What is your rank?

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,620
You are the one who made this incense.

161
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,620
How can we say that?

162
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,620
What is your rank?

163
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,620
Of course, of course it is the same.

164
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,620
Same.

165
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Who are you?

166
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,620
Wife.

167
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,620
You choose.

168
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,620
I think

169
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,620
Although the incense before is different

170
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,620
But at least it is fragrant.

171
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,620
Master An's incense

172
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,620
What does it smell like?

173
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,620
There is a smell of a candle.

174
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,620
The smell of a candle.

175
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,620
Isn't it?

176
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,620
It is still the same as when I was a child.

177
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,620
Not giving people any dignity.

178
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
What do you think?

179
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,620
It is indeed the smell of a piece of soil.

180
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Yes, it is indeed the smell of soil.

181
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
It is indeed a good thing.

182
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,620
Look, not only me, how do you think?

183
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,620
You guys who are not trained

184
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,620
You don't understand anything.

185
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,620
This Qi Ling Xia

186
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,620
This Qi Ling Xia

187
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,620
How much strength did I use?

188
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Xiangzhong Long Lin is the power of spirit.

189
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,620
The so-called phoenix is the language of the white river.

190
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Although it is normal, the way of the language is very particular.

191
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,620
The language is the right and left of the golden phoenix.

192
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,620
The rain under the sea is the fragrance of the rich and the rich.

193
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,620
The black sand is in shambles.

194
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,620
The evil demon is everywhere.

195
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,620
Break

196
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,620
Break

197
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,620
Break

198
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,620
Break

199
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,620
Break

200
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,620
Break

201
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,620
Break

202
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,040
Tsutomu?

203
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,700
Where's Tsutomu?

204
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,620
I know your pain

205
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,620
While Anbi Luo has created too many unselfish murderers

206
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
You are not only stupid, but also not a revenge

207
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,620
I can understand you control him

208
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
But this body is his after all

209
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Even if you use this to solve the hatred

210
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,620
It's just a temporary achievement

211
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,620
You are

212
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,620
How do you know?

213
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
I am the cat of the demon clan of Chang'an

214
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
The human world is complicated

215
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,620
How about

216
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,620
You go back to the demon world with me

217
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,620
I will find a leather bag for you at the shop

218
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
Help you cultivate

219
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,620
To punish the bad guys for you

220
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,620
Give you justice

221
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,620
The demon clan

222
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,620
The cat of the demon clan

223
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,620
Demon clan

224
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,620
Cat of the demon clan

225
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
Sir

226
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
Since this is expected

227
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
We will go back to the demon clan immediately

228
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
Or explain to those people first

229
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,620
Lin Xia

230
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,620
You are still going to help me to kill those people

231
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Report

232
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
The east side has not found anyone

233
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Report

234
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,620
The west side has not found anyone

235
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Report

236
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
The north side has not found anyone

237
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Stop reporting

238
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
The person who finds it will report

239
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,620
What cat of the demon clan

240
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
No power at all

241
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
Clearly a liar

242
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
Over there

243
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
A human body

244
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,620
No, how did they get there?

245
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Can't you fly over?

246
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
It's impossible

247
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
I will see you in the ghost world

248
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
Before I deal with them

249
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
I will first see you, liar

250
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
There is a ghost in the back

251
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Are you ok?

252
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
Cousin

253
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
Cousin

254
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,620
Cousin

255
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,620
Cousin

256
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,620
Cousin

257
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,620
Are you ok?

258
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,620
Little pig

259
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Little pig

260
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
You are so good

261
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,620
Why didn't you tell me?

262
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Minister Mei

263
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,620
That sword you just now was so handsome

264
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,620
I saw it

265
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,620
Minister Mei

266
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Oh no

267
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
I will be the worst one in the Mei family

268
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Minister Mei

269
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,620
Have you considered bringing us to the imperial guards?

270
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,620
Minister Mei

271
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,620
Have you considered bringing us to the imperial guards?

272
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,620
Minister Mei

273
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,620
Have you considered bringing us to the imperial guards?

274
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
Minister Mei

275
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
Have you considered bringing us to the imperial guards?

276
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,620
Minister Mei

277
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
Little pig

278
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,620
I will go first

279
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,620
Little pig

280
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
I really can't believe it

281
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
How did you do that just now?

282
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
Have you considered bringing us here?

283
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
Have you considered bringing us here?

284
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
You come here

285
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,620
Why didn't you tell me to come here?

286
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Cousin

287
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,620
I got the foot-wrestling glue

288
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,620
Hurry up

289
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
Help

290
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,620
Help

291
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
Help

292
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,620
I advise you to not interfere with other people's business

293
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Go

294
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,620
Brother, if you save my life

295
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
I will be buried with you

296
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,620
I will be buried with you

297
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
Go

298
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,620
Go

299
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
Go

300
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,620
Blood is the only thing that can stop the evil

301
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:46,340
It was a man who gained Sage

302
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

303
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

304
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

305
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

306
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

307
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

308
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

309
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

310
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

311
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

312
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

313
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

314
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

315
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

316
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,000
Eunuch's

317
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,940
Demon girl

318
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,080
She deserves to be angle-cut.

319
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,500
But I don't kill you.

320
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,900
I know Doudou Conference

321
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,300
You're not gonna hurt innocent people

322
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,340
Choosing Lane

323
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,700
is to denim everyone

324
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,620
So they don't have to fight for 273

325
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,620
and kill the living.

326
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
He committed many crimes.

327
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620
The law will punish him.

328
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,620
Fear will be with him every night.

329
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,620
But you...

330
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
Your hatred is unceasing.

331
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,620
Do you really want to use your hatred as a stone to live?

332
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,620
The sun rises and sets.

333
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,620
The stars fall.

334
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,620
The stars fall.

335
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,620
The stars fall.

336
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,620
The stars fall.

337
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,620
The Long Ballad

338
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
It's you.

339
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,620
The Long Ballad

340
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,620
Did... Did Anbi Luo do all of this?

341
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,620
Yes.

342
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,620
So many lives were lost in the sea of life.

343
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
It's really...

344
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
Why are you here?

345
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,620
I thought Anbi Luo was talking about something serious.

346
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,620
So I came to find the clues.

347
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
This is where she lived two months ago.

348
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
I'm involved in the bean paste meeting.

349
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Come and see.

350
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,620
Me too.

351
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,620
It's a pity that

352
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,620
there are only these remains.

353
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,620
Wrong.

354
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,620
The Long Ballad

355
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,620
The Empress heard that the bean paste meeting was very angry.

356
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,620
She was going to order the bean paste meeting to be stopped.

357
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,620
But Meifei and Princess Yuan Zhen were half-satisfied.

358
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
So the Empress changed her mind.

359
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,620
The bean paste meeting is a grand event.

360
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,620
It's not like Anbi Luo would reject it.

361
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,620
So the Empress ordered

362
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,620
that the bean paste meeting

363
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:16,240
should not be a

364
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,620
It's good that

365
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
the young master

366
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,620
is willing to sacrifice his life

367
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
for the sake of the fragrance.

368
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
It's good that

369
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,620
the young master

370
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,620
is willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of the fragrance.

371
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,620
The Empress said that

372
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
she was worried about the young master

373
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
and asked him to come to the palace.

374
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
I see.

375
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
What's good about calling you?

376
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
A goose?

377
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
Goose, goose, goose

378
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,620
Goose, goose, goose

379
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,620
Goose, goose, goose

380
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
Red palm, green palm

381
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
Miss Zhen

382
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Your knowledge is fast.

383
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
How about I send you a book of three characters?

384
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Mind your own business.

385
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
When did you come?

386
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
When you were pregnant.

387
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
You're giving the goose a name?

388
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Giving the goose a name?

389
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
Do you have to give it a cup

390
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
when you're making soup?

391
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
Watch your words.

392
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
You scared my goose.

393
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,620
Your son?

394
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,620
My son.

395
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,620
His name.

396
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
From now on, you're my son.

397
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,620
Your son?

398
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,620
Your son?

399
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,620
Guess who I am?

400
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,620
You can't see me, right?

401
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
You can't see me, right?

402
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,620
This time, Yun You

403
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
received a new gift.

404
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
A calligrapher

405
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,620
specially sold me a clothes.

406
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,620
I really think

407
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,620
it has something to do with magic.

408
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,620
Let's not talk about this.

409
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
You...

410
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
I just went out

411
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,620
for three months

412
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,620
and became a grandfather.

413
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,620
That's too fast.

414
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
You...

415
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,620
You...

416
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620
You...

417
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
Who's that?

418
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,620
Uncle.

419
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,620
Duke Wu.

420
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,620
I'm Mei Zhu Yu.

421
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,620
Nice to meet you.

422
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,620
Good.

423
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,620
I've seen you often.

424
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
And I haven't seen you for a long time.

425
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,620
And I've seen you for the first time.

426
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
Good.

427
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,620
If you don't come back,

428
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
I thought I had no father.

429
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
I'm not sure.

430
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
I just heard that

431
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,620
two men lived in our house.

432
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,620
In Chang'an,

433
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
it's a big deal.

434
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Everyone is gambling.

435
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,620
I'm just

436
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,620
concerned about them.

437
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,620
So you're going home to have fun.

438
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,620
No, I'm just worried

439
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
about my daughter.

440
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,620
So...

441
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Which one of them

442
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
is my son-in-law?

443
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,620
The one who's your father's son-in-law?

444
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
I...

445
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620
It's hard to choose.

446
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,620
Hard to choose?

447
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,620
Then,

448
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
you should hold your grandson first.

449
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,620
Sister Zhen.

450
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,620
Mr. Mei.

451
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
I wonder if you

452
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
are...

453
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
Uncle.

454
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
Mr. Mei came to our house

455
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
because of me.

456
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,620
And I came to Chang'an

457
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,620
to marry my cousin.

458
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Please allow me.

459
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,620
Sister Zhen.

460
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
You want to ask Liu Tai Zhen?

461
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
What's wrong with her?

462
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
Why did you go to the bean-scent meeting?

463
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
I thought I could see her

464
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
that day.

465
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,620
Why are you in such a hurry?

466
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,620
I'm doing some magic tricks.

467
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
I want to draw it

468
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
and show it to her.

469
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
I went to the bean-scent meeting

470
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,620
with the invitation of the head of Ying Leng Xiao.

471
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,620
As for Liu Tai Zhen,

472
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
he...

473
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,620
He's sick.

474
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,620
Sick?

475
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,620
What? Is he sick? Is he sick? Is he sick?

476
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Is he sick? Is he sick? Is he sick? Is he sick? Is he sick?

477
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,620
Calm down. He's fine.

478
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
But he's not in Chang'an.

479
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,620
He'll be back

480
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
in three days.

481
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Three days...

482
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,620
Three days...

483
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Three days...

484
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
You're so good at it.

485
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
You used the evil spell

486
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,620
to draw the demon.

487
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
It seems that I'm going to be

488
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,620
sent to the door again.

489
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,620
I'm going to kill you.

490
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,620
I'm going to kill you.

491
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,620
I'm going to kill you.

492
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,620
I'm going to kill you.

493
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm going to kill you.

494
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,620
I'm going to kill you.

495
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,620
I'm going to kill you.

496
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,620
I'm going to kill you.

497
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
I'm going to kill you.

498
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,620
I'm going to kill you.

499
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,620
I'm going to kill you.

500
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,620
I'm going to kill you.

501
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
I'm going to kill you.

502
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,620
I'm going to kill you.

503
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,620
Don't worry about the idle things.

504
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,620
I'm just asking someone

505
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,620
who's not patient enough.

506
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,620
What should we do now?

507
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Forget it.

508
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
After all, the benefactor can teach me magic

509
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,620
and help me become stronger.

510
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Since he's anxious,

511
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
let's do his thing first.

512
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Doudou.

513
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,620
How could it be?

514
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
It doesn't make sense.

515
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,620
He doesn't seem to be in a lot of trouble.

516
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
What are you talking about?

517
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,620
You keep saying that

518
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,620
and I'm confused.

519
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Why didn't my wife go to the sweet-scented bean meeting?

520
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,620
So what?

521
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
He looks pretty good.

522
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,620
Why is he sick all of a sudden?

523
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,620
You ordinary people

524
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
are short-lived,

525
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,820
is normal.

526
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,740
I mean,

527
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
do you monsters

528
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,460
live in other people's house?

529
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,180
We have monsters, too.

530
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,020
Why do you bother to come to other people's house?

531
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,860
You're at my house.

532
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,220
I'm here to heal

533
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,620
and to have special conditions.

534
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,140
Okay.

535
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,620
So,

536
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,900
if there's any special condition,

537
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,260
you'll still live in other people's house?

538
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,860
Of course.

539
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,500
Listen,

540
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,380
I saw a big snake

541
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,020
in Mrs. Liu's house.

542
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,300
A snake?

543
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,620
It was as thick as a bucket

544
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,220
and as tall as three or four columns.

545
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,100
Such a big snake

546
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,700
must be a monster.

547
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,060
Do you think

548
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,980
Mrs. Liu

549
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,500
is sick because of that snake?

550
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,020
Well,

551
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,700
we can only know it

552
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,860
when we see it.

553
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,660
Candied Fish

554
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,300
You mean

555
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,340
only the Spirit ofcc sakura

556
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,540
and the Little Demons of Rubber Box

557
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,420
stealing things from people?

558
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Some Sepjuolo

559
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,980
threw a fun party at your home.

560
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,900
I have no time for such research.

561
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,420
I want us to consult

562
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,780
on something,

563
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,260
I need your help.

564
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,740
There's still the thing you can't handle?

565
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,140
And I also think

566
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,980
you're intelligent

567
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,620
and accountability-還是不任何

568
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,620
Wait a minute.

569
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,620
How come I feel that this incident

570
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
was mentioned by Hu Zhu?

571
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,620
It seems to have happened a long time ago.

572
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,620
Maybe

573
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,620
they had another fight.

574
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,620
This is the account of Tang Quan and the Tui Na Hall.

575
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,620
Come with me to see it.

576
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Let's see what the problem is.

577
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,620
I don't want to see the account book.

578
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,620
I feel headache when I see the account book.

579
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
It's been an hour.

580
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
Still not back.

581
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,620
You...

583
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Grandpa, what are you doing?

584
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,620
Since this person can't come back

585
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
for a while,

586
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
I won't let you in the house.

587
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,620
Then what are you waiting for?

588
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,620
Why don't you take me to the bar?

589
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
I've been at your house for so long.

590
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,620
Where do you want to go?

591
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,620
I want to eat.

592
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,620
You?

593
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,620
You don't have a big pot, what do you want to eat?

594
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Grandpa, I'll take you to eat.

595
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,620
I'll take you to eat.

596
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Delicious.

597
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,620
Grandpa, in Chang'an,

598
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,620
there are not only many local delicacies,

599
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
but also the delicacies of the southwestern southern Jiang.

600
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
In front of that, there are

601
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
water basin lamb and Tonghua beef intestines.

602
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Of course, there is my favorite thousand-layer crisp.

603
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
This chicken is also good.

604
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,620
It's really good.

605
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
Grandpa, you...

606
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
Grandpa, you...

607
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,620
Where did the mud go?

608
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Boss,

609
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,620
I want this one.

610
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,620
I saw a mud go up.

611
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
I'll change it for you.

612
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
I want this one.

613
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,620
Okay.

614
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
Here, take it.

615
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
Thank you.

616
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
Grandpa, are you okay?

617
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
He hit my head.

618
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
He hit my head with a curse.

619
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
Are you satisfied? Didn't you see that he had a knife in his hand?

620
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
What kind of shop is this? Why is it so dark?

621
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,620
This is a mill.

622
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
A place to sell the mill.

623
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
This doesn't suit my taste.

624
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,620
This is not for eating.

625
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
This is for painting.

626
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,620
Painting?

627
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,620
I understand.

628
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
This black one is specifically for painting me, right?

629
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,620
They can't paint my face.

630
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,620
My family's reserve ink is used up.

631
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,620
I'm here to buy some good ones.

632
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,620
Boss, I'm coming.

633
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,620
You're here.

634
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,620
Long time no see.

635
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
I want some high-quality ink.

636
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,620
What a coincidence.

637
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,620
A good customer came two days ago.

638
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,620
He bought all the good ink.

639
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,620
He bought all of them?

640
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
Yes.

641
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,620
Usually, they can't sell one or two.

642
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,620
But this time, they all were bought.

643
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,620
I just hate that I haven't bought more.

644
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,620
But I need ink.

645
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,620
Wait.

646
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,620
If you're interested, try this.

647
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,620
This is a gift from someone.

648
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,620
Look.

649
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,620
The wind blows the ink.

650
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,620
This is definitely a good product.

651
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,620
A good product?

652
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,620
Of course.

653
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,620
This is better than the ink.

654
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,620
Okay.

655
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
Boss Xie, see you.

656
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,620
I'm sorry.

657
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,620
I'm sorry.

658
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,620
I'm sorry.

659
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,620
I'm sorry.

660
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,620
I'm sorry.

661
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,620
I'm sorry.

662
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,620
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,620
I'm sorry.

664
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,620
I'm sorry.

665
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,620
I'm sorry.

666
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,620
I'm sorry.

667
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
I'm sorry.

668
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
I'm sorry.

669
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
I'm sorry.

670
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,620
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,620
Gotta go.

672
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,620
If Boss Xie has bought it,

673
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,620
I'll takebuilding.

674
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,620
Hmm.

675
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
I'm sorry.

676
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,620
You can use this.

677
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,620
Right.

678
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Say, who's this?

679
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,620
Big Boss Yang has bought it.

680
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,620
Big Boss Yang?

681
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,620
I'm going to kill you.

682
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,620
I'm going to kill you.

683
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,620
I'm going to kill you.

684
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,620
I'm going to kill you.

685
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,620
I'm going to kill you.

686
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
I'm going to kill you.

687
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,620
I'm going to kill you.

688
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,620
I'm going to kill you.

689
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,620
I'm going to kill you.

690
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,620
I'm going to kill you.

691
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,620
I'm going to kill you.

692
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,620
I'm going to kill you.

693
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,620
I'm going to kill you.

694
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
I'm going to kill you.

695
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,620
I will kill you.

696
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,620
I will kill you.

697
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,620
I won't do it again.

698
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,620
I can understand how you feel.

699
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
I don't know what happened.

700
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
Thank you.

701
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
I beg you.

702
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,620
To love you.

703
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,620
I can't lose you.

704
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,620
I told you I'm gone.

705
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,620
Where are you going?

706
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,620
There you go.

707
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,620
There you go.

708
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,620
My only friend.

709
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,620
I'm sorry.

710
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,620
I'm sorry.

711
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,620
I'm sorry.

712
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,620
I'm sorry.

713
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,620

717
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,620
I'm sorry.

718
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,620
I'm sorry.

719
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,620
I'm sorry.

720
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,620
I'm sorry.

721
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,620
I'm sorry.

722
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
I'm sorry.

723
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,620
I'm sorry.

724
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,620
I'm sorry.

725
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,620
I'm sorry.

726
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
I'm sorry.

727
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,620
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,620
I'm sorry.

729
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,620
I'm sorry.

730
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620
I'm sorry.

731
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,620
I'm sorry.

732
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
I'm sorry.

733
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,620
I'm sorry.

734
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,620
I'm sorry.

735
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
I'm sorry.

736
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,620
I'm sorry.

737
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,620
I'm sorry.

738
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,620
I'm sorry.

739
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,620
I'm sorry.

740
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,620
I'm sorry.

741
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,620
I'm sorry.

742
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,620
I'm sorry.

743
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,620
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,620
I'm sorry.

745
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
I'm sorry.

746
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620

747
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,620
I'm sorry.

748
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,620
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,620
I'm sorry.

750
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,620
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,620
I'm sorry.

752
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,620
I'm sorry.

753
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,620
I'm sorry.

754
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,620

755
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,620
I'm sorry.

756
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,620

757
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
