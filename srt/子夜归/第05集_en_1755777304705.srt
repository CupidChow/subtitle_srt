A recording has been dropped.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,920
Now, we will go to...

21
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,960
the last part

22
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,380
or we could combine them everything

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
let us do this

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,320
Today,

25
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,540
24 years starts

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,600
pressure

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,880
Can you deliver it in time?

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm Xu Kai.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,560
I use Taobao to buy food.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
Delivery is more advantageous.

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:54,800
It's designed fit for these long distance

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:03,120
So

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,560
But he still female

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,640
who

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,520
do you

36
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,280
what's wrong

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
do you have instructions

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,320
No

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Missata I heard wrong

40
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
I'll wait for you outside.

41
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,120
The city of Chang'an is full of evil and evil.

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
But every time I approach the whole city,

43
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,120
all the traces are invisible.

44
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
It's hard to touch.

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,120
What is behind this?

46
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,120
What is behind this?

47
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Why isn't Boss back yet?

48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
Did he find it?

49
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Boss, how is it?

50
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Can you stop being so stubborn?

51
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Sit down.

52
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,120
How can I sit down?

53
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,120
That old monkey sent a little monkey to ask us how we are doing.

54
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,120
These demons can't wait any longer.

55
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
They are waiting for you to make mistakes.

56
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
If we don't find the Buhua Valley quickly,

57
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,120
I'm afraid we'll be in trouble.

58
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm afraid we'll be in trouble.

59
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Who is it?

60
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Boss, what's wrong?

61
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Uncle.

62
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
What's wrong?

63
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
The demon is a law.

64
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
The Buhua Valley is being destroyed.

65
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
We have to destroy it quickly.

66
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
And give Si Men an explanation.

67
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Si Men.

68
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
If we don't stop the second attack,

69
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
we'll be out of demons.

70
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Four Elders, should I help you?

71
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
This is...

72
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
This is not resentment.

73
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
It's murder.

74
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
That's right.

75
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
This is not an ordinary Buhua Valley.

76
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
It's his.

77
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Whose?

78
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
It's him.

79
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Eighteen years ago,

80
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
he killed the Ghost Eagle.

81
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Old man,

84
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
it's great to see you.

85
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
This mountain house is too big.

86
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
I'm lost.

87
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Do you know which way is the way down the mountain?

88
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
You don't recognize me anymore?

89
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I know.

90
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Have we met before?

91
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Mother?

92
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Mother?

93
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Why are you here?

94
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
We haven't seen each other for three years.

95
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Son,

96
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
I miss you every day.

97
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Good boy.

98
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
I miss you too.

99
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Mother.

100
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
I miss you every day.

101
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I miss you every day.

102
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I miss you, mother.

103
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
I miss you so much, mother.

104
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Mother.

105
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
This mortal

106
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
is so easy to fool.

107
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
It's a pity

108
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
that there are fewer people here.

109
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
If I can enter Chang'an City,

110
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
I can practice

111
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
and have fun.

112
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I think

113
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
it will be fun.

114
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Ha ha ha.

115
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Ha ha ha.

116
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Ha ha ha.

117
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Wow,

118
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
it's a safe house.

119
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
It's so clean.

120
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Why did you

121
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
separate the old books and write new ones?

122
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I'm sorry

123
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
for not being able to do so.

124
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
The latest files.

125
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
These are also important.

126
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,920
What case?

127
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
It's said that a villager from the West Coast

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,240
climbed up the mountain to chop firewood.

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,560
He got lost.

130
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,480
Although his family finally found him,

131
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,960
he was not normal.

132
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,240
Not normal?

133
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
In short,

134
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,360
he was staring at something,

135
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,720
but he lost consciousness.

136
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
He lost consciousness,

137
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,960
but he was smiling.

138
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,200
He kept saying,

139
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,960
Mom, mom.

140
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
But his mother died of illness.

141
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,200
Where did the villagers get lost?

142
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,840
West Coast.

143
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,880
What's wrong?

144
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,160
West Coast.

145
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,280
Just a month ago,

146
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,640
the Sword-Picking Bureau has received six files.

147
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,800
The villagers climbed up the mountain to get lost.

148
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
They are all from the West Coast.

149
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,400
I'll go and investigate as soon as possible.

150
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,880
No need.

151
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,800
Minister Xu has sent Fuli and others to investigate.

152
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,520
There will be news soon.

153
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,080
The mountain road is hard to walk.

154
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,960
It will take a while.

155
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,560
My feet are painful.

156
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,000
It's harder than going to the office.

157
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,560
How about going back?

158
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,600
Yes.

159
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,240
Minister Xu didn't take it seriously.

160
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,200
He sent us here

161
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,200
just to have a look around.

162
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,760
I don't have to be so serious.

163
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,520
All right, all right.

164
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,920
We're here.

165
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
At least we can see it clearly.

166
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
If there's nothing to see,

167
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,400
we'll go back and report it.

168
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,600
In my opinion,

169
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,960
the villagers are just lost.

170
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,760
If we don't take it seriously,

171
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,120
they might have eaten something poisonous

172
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,600
and had hallucinations.

173
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,360
I think so, too.

174
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
And if they are not easily lost,

175
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,840
we'll be more likely to be lost.

176
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
There's another stupid thing.

177
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Look.

178
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,440
Who told you that it's cloudy these days?

179
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,560
How come there is so much fog here?

180
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Don't walk.

181
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,520
There's no way to go there.

182
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,960
Where are we going?

183
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,800
Zhao Hualiu.

184
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

185
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We are from the Xuanjian Bureau.

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We came to investigate this case.

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We are very confused.

188
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
May I ask...

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I can't believe it.

190
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This is not right.

191
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This...

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is...

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Could this be the body of the deceased

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
who died a few days ago?

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't know.

196
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know.

197
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Could this be the body of the deceased

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
who died a few days ago?

199
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They seem to be strange.

200
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Are they really human?

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

202
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Who can tell?

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They are innocent.

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What the hell?

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
How about...

206
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's go and have a look.

207
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Let's go and have a look.

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Are you lost here?

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you lost here?

210
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Can you hear me?

211
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hurry up!

212
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hurry up!

213
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Hurry up!

214
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What?

215
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You said you would help me?

216
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You are so big now.

217
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Are you afraid that the demon will not notice you?

218
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I will take you away.

219
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Then you will be safe.

220
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You are a member of the demon clan?

221
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You are in the West suburb.

222
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You are in Chang'an.

223
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The demon clan will know soon.

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The demon clan will attack.

225
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You can't escape.

226
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I came to report

227
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
to help you.

228
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Help me?

229
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why do you need to help me?

230
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I help you

231
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
because you can help me.

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Why does it seem that

233
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the book of Heaven and Fire

234
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
is missing from the 18 years of

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the book of Heaven and Fire?

236
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
40.

237
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I am sorry.

238
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I am sorry.

239
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I am sorry.

240
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I am sorry.

241
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I am sorry.

242
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
40.

243
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What is it?

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I have sorted the files

245
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
in the dark library.

246
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Please have a look.

247
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No need.

248
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I am relieved.

249
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But I have something to tell you.

250
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Go ahead.

251
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There is something missing from the files.

252
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It is about the 18 years of the book of Heaven and Fire.

253
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Really?

254
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Then what?

255
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
There are many old files

256
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that have not been solved.

257
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Maybe we can get some clues

258
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
from the files.

259
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It is not necessary to find out

260
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
how old you were 18 years ago.

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There are some cases

262
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that have been solved for too long.

263
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No need to bother about them.

264
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The officials should solve the problems

265
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
for the people and the people.

266
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There is a dark library in the palace.

267
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
People often send people to search for the files.

268
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Maybe the file you mentioned

269
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
was borrowed by the palace.

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What should we do?

271
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You can't do anything.

272
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You want to get something from the palace?

273
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You are not qualified to be a secretary.

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Even if I am the secretary of the Xuanjian Bureau,

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I can only go to the palace

276
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
once a month

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
to get the files.

278
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What are you thinking?

279
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Secretary?

280
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What is it?

281
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Secretary!

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Something bad happened!

283
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, sir.

284
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,000
No Equipment

285
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
新海非斯基底驱蟹洗发水控油水扬酸。

286
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
配方深入基底。海非斯邀您精彩继续。

287
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
这是发生了何事?

288
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
唉,就是那西郊的案子。

289
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
徐司使不是派人去查了吗?

290
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
是去过了,可他听完情况就说不管了。

291
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
但是今天,有西郊的村民进入长安, 下跪求求。

292
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
这案子到底是由哪里进行的?

293
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
还没有定论,就惊动了柳尚书。

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
总之,就按阿叔说的,交代给朱营便好。

295
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
猫公用起我的副手来,倒也顺手。

296
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
开门!

297
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
让我们在这里开门!

298
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
让我们在这里开门!

299
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
让我们在这里开门!

300
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
让我们在这里开门!

301
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
让我们在这里开门!

302
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
让我们在这里开门!

303
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
让我们在这里开门!

304
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
让我们在这里开门!

305
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
让我们在这里开门!

306
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
让我们在这里开门!

307
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
徐兰,参见柳尚书。

308
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
徐司使,本官今日唤你前来,所谓何事?

309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
想必你也清楚了吧?

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
唉,下官愚钝。

311
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
除了西郊案,还能是何事?

312
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
西郊案?那不应该归衙门查吗?

313
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
半月之内,足有六名村民于山中迷路失踪。

314
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
之后虽被找到,却睁眼无名,神志不清。

315
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
此事诡异,不合常理。

316
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
目归你玄剑司,归谁呀?

317
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
那这六人现在情况如何?可有性命之忧啊?

318
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
所有人如今都已苏醒。

319
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
六尚书,玄剑司所查的都是毫无头绪之案。

320
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
这六人现已苏醒,你便多了六个证人,应赶快缉拿真凶。

321
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
什么长按追凶啊?你的意思让我缉拿那误气归案吗?

322
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
山中多余,有些误气是正常的。

323
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
倒是你们身为父母官,理应为百姓做一些路标,路牌指路啊。

324
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
那几人的祖辈皆是西郊之人,山中如同他们家后院。

325
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
敢问徐司使,你会在自己府中迷路吗?

326
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
也不是没有这个可能。

327
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
胡说八道,你听我。

328
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
宣成,以你的意思,衙门是查不了这个案子是吧?

329
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
左一个查不了,右一个接不了。

330
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
你等都这般推尾怕事,挑挑拣拣。

331
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
难不成要本尚书亲自去查吗?

332
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
尚书息怒。

333
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
那现如今,你们准备怎么办?

334
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
你。

335
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
柳尚书。

336
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
是你那小郎君。

337
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
梅家郎君。

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
柳尚书。

339
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
免礼。

340
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
梅家郎君,你有何事便说吧。

341
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
回柳尚书,西郊福员辽阔,宣建司人手不足,调查此事有心无理。

342
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
此事若再有旁案,怕是难以两全。

343
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
但这件事确实难以以常理存夺。

344
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
若交衙门处理,一时也是无从下手。

345
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
那这。

346
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
因此,下官有以两全之计,或可破此难题。

347
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
是何计策?

348
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
属下任宣建司暗读库主事一职。

349
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
此事卷宗整理妥善,正是闲事。

350
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
不妨让下官前往西郊,探查此事。

351
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
住口!

352
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
尚书,我。

353
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
此事凶险万分,你千万不可正讲,听我的话,快走。

354
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
多谢徐司使关心,属下心意已决,司使不必再劝。

355
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
柳尚书意下如何?

356
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
柳尚书,梅主事。

357
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
现在宣建司上下已忙得不可开交,抽调不出人手协助你了。

358
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
这事就算了。

359
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
属下一人前去即可。

360
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
梅家郎君,你可想清楚,不后悔了?

361
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
绝不后悔。

362
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
你这小郎君倒是不忌讳,和其他人不同啊。

363
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
他是胆子大一些。

364
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
孝臣,别发愁了。

365
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
怎么能不愁?

366
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
谁知道当年的邪煞还残留了一块骨头在外头。

367
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
虽说我不记得十八年前是何情况,

368
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
可也曾听说那邪煞鬼影甚是厉害。

369
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
只身浅了,却不知何时才出现。

370
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
这些都是我所知的。

371
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
这些都是我所知的。

372
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
这些都是我所知的。

373
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
这些都是我所知的。

374
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
这些都是我所知的。

375
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
只身浅来长安,造成人间大崩,

376
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
又差点颠覆了妖师。

377
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
若不是前任猫公一命相搏,只怕妖师也。

378
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
他回来了。

379
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
猫公大人。蛇公大人。

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
小猪营,好久不见。

381
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
可是有雷金木的消息了。

382
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
他猜得对。

383
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
在何处?

384
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
西郊。

385
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
再具体点。

386
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
山洞。

387
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
二叔,你再仔细讲讲雷金木。

388
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
雷金木天生地长,

389
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
为吸取天雷所生之灵物,

390
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
亦能驱除不化骨的杀气。

391
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
但是,寻常妖怪,根本无法接近。

392
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
如此说来,这活儿倒是为我量身打造的。

393
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
只要我在白日人参时接近,便能取得那雷金木。

394
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
可你白日里并无法力。

395
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
只身前五西郊太过冒险。

396
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
要不我们……

397
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
进一趟山而已,没什么大不了的。

398
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
小真。

399
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
我明日便去,取那雷金木。

400
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
郎君真的要去啊?

401
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
要去哪里?

402
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
可人家都说那西郊山里不干净。

403
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
放心吧,没事的。

404
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
你们这玄剑寺也太不够意思了。

405
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
人人都下成那样,一个陪你去的都没有。

406
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
是我一意孤行,怪不得他人。

407
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
家里还有多少银钱?

408
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
总的大体三十块。

409
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
好。

410
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
郎君这是有心凑聘礼,向清禾县主提亲了?

411
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
你那么高兴,从前不是不喜五娘子吗?

412
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
可是这些日子我也算看明白了。

413
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
这清禾县主虽说有顽固之名,却也不怎么发脾气。

414
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
还懂得欣赏我做的吃食,挺好自豪的。

415
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
最重要的就是,郎君穷,可是他有钱啊。

416
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
你们两人在一起,很是相配。

417
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
我来的路上听闻,你家门口是条破路。

418
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
又长又窄又泥溺,马车都进不去。

419
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
这陛下赐的车也真是的,需要两匹马才能拉。

420
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
知道你今日休没,便过来找你玩。

421
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
没曾想,你家门口这路是这么烂。

422
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
我这一路走来,脚也崴了,鞋也脏了。

423
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
你说怎么办吧?

424
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
这条路一宁不平,捉是不便。

425
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
我从玄建司预制了一些月风。

426
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
这两日,你找人修一修吧。

427
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
原来郎君最近一直存钱,是为了修路啊。

428
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
还有,把这棚也拆了吧。

429
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
棚子?驴棚怎么办?

430
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
这,这要拆了的话,咱家富贵住哪儿啊?

431
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
给他换个地方,这路太窄,无法驾车而入。

432
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
可,可也不至于将驴棚拆了吧。

433
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
咱们驴车小,使劲挤挤,也能进来。

434
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
就拆了吧,毕竟有的马车,不似那般精致可爱。

435
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
这。

436
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
别吃了,走。

437
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
阿姐让你们来的吧?

438
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
阿姐,你怎么来了?

439
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
华阳林渊。

440
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
到。

441
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
见过县主。

442
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
又是明庄跟宫里告的状吧?

443
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
我去城外玩一两天也不是头回了。

444
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
阿姐派你们过来干嘛呀?

445
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
回县主,今日城外不太平。

446
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
皇后娘娘是县主性的绝将,怕是不会改变形成。

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
她特拜属下二人下来保护,还望县主见谅,莫让属下难做。

448
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
您俩让我难做了。

449
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
县主说什么?

450
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
我说,当着我坐骑了。

451
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
到家了,到家了,快醒醒啊,到家了。

452
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
醒醒啊,醒醒啊。

453
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
公主,快救救我们吧。

454
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
那何三身子还没好呢,今早又晕了两个。

455
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
还是咱们村最强壮的。

456
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
是啊。

457
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
这位官人,上面到底是什么意思呀?

458
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
我们这一村子的人全都是靠着砍柴打猎为生的。

459
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
这下,个个都不敢进山了。

460
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
我和我们的日子可怎么过呀?

461
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
是呀,没过呀。

462
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
待我进山探个究竟,必会给大家一个答复。

463
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
你别开玩笑了你。

464
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
能救你这小身马?

465
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
一个人进山?

466
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
他也是被关了来。不知道人多危险,还绷在狗里呢。

467
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
怕是都出不来了。

468
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
是啊。

469
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
是啊,这官家公主都不想管我们了。

470
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
谁说官府只派了他一个人?

471
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
你是谁呀?

472
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
五国公府清河县主武珍。

473
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
特来助梅主事破西郊悬案。

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
清河县主?好像是皇后的妹妹。

475
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
是啊。

476
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
那可是皇亲国戚呀。

477
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
是啊。

478
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
就算是派一个县主,又有何用啊?

479
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
除了名头大,不还是一个小娘子吗?

480
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
你看。

481
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
小娘子又如何?

482
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
论品级,她也不像皇后的妹妹。

483
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
她是皇后的妹妹。

484
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
她是二品质,她比很多人的儿子更高位。

485
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
她非常厉害。

486
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
她是中康中的徐三郎,她是上庭中的张将军。

487
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
她是临冲的郭郎军。

488
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
她是金吾卫的王祖磊。

489
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
她是谁呀?

490
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
她是我的敗将。

491
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
她是什么人呀?

492
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
那是她。

493
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
她听着很名头大。

494
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
那是她的强大力量。

495
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Really?

496
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It should be quite impressive.

497
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Right.

498
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
There are two more Jin Wuwei here.

499
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
His Majesty and Her Highness personally arranged them.

500
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
In a while, they will help you get a famous doctor.

501
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
If you don't believe me, you can check the cards.

502
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then how about I go and check?

503
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'll go and check.

504
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Let's go.

505
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Is it true?

506
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's true.

507
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's true.

508
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's really Jin Wuwei.

509
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's really Jin Wuwei.

510
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's really Jin Wuwei.

511
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's really Jin Wuwei.

512
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's really Jin Wuwei.

513
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

514
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

515
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

516
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

517
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We three are just here to help.

518
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
We are far from being compared to the Mei Zhu Shi beside you.

519
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This...

520
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But this gentleman is so gentle and gentle.

521
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So what?

522
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
This...

523
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We have martial arts skills, but we can't cut the case.

524
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Mei Zhu Shi is different.

525
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Mei Zhu Shi is a civil official.

526
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
He has a wide range of knowledge and knowledge.

527
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
He is talented and has a lot of experience.

528
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
This time, we will definitely find out the case.

529
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
If that's the case,

530
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
that would be great.

531
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I heard that Mei Zhu Shi found out the case.

532
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
He is weak and delicate.

533
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He needs to speed up his progress.

534
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
He just wants to see the merchant city soon.

535
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We are very impressed.

536
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Sir, this is Jin Shan.

537
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You must be careful when you enter the mountain.

538
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yes, you must be careful.

539
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Thank you.

540
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If my sister asks,

541
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
tell her that the Mei Zhu Shi is weak.

542
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm worried that he will enter the mountain alone.

543
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Mei Zhu Shi, don't cross the bridge.

544
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The Mei Zhu Shi is a civil official.

545
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Thank you, Mei Zhu Shi, for your help.

546
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I should thank you for helping me.

547
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Please remember to show your kindness to me.

548
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Why did you go to the west?

549
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You said it.

550
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
For your safety,

551
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm weak.

552
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm afraid I'll be dead in an hour.

553
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And I was still alive at that time.

554
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I must save you.

555
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I thought you would drive me away.

556
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's true.

557
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But I can't find any other reason

558
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
to become your lover.

559
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Luckily, I helped you in time.

560
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That's why I blocked your mouth.

561
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,400
You said they were your

562
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
defeated champions.

563
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Is it true?

564
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Of course.

565
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
They all beat me.

566
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
No one beat me.

567
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Why?

568
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
They offended you?

569
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
No. They went on a blind date with me.

570
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
No one can make me look good.

571
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I see.

572
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
But why didn't you care about me?

573
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
You won by winning several times.

574
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,680
You can win with a chain.

575
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,800
Don't compare yourself to them.

576
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,640
Thank you.

577
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,920
Don't worry.

578
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,960
I'll be with you.

579
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,920
Everything will be fine.

580
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,560
Mr. Shu,

581
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,160
I haven't seen the Seven Devils for days.

582
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,200
I've been searching for them

583
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,920
but I didn't see the shadow of the Shuyao.

584
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,240
Why don't you ask the owner of the house

585
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,960
or go to the inner gate of your house

586
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,040
and see if there are any other clues?

587
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,240
Mr. Shu,

588
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,800
are you sure you've searched everywhere?

589
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,960
Mr. Hui,

590
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,520
if you divide the four doors into eight rooms,

591
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,720
the owner of the house will be in charge of the rooms.

592
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
The one who can't decide

593
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,960
will be handled by the owner of the four doors.

594
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,040
The one who can't decide

595
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
will have to make a decision.

596
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,280
I'm helping you

597
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,000
because we're close.

598
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
I'm here to ask for your responsibility.

599
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You're here to force me.

600
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm afraid it's against the rules.

601
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,160
No.

602
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,120
How dare I offend you?

603
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,120
There are demons who disappear for no reason.

604
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,520
I can't afford to take the responsibility.

605
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,320
It seems that we should find the cat master

606
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,960
and let him make the decision.

607
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,760
Mr. Hui,

608
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,280
are you saying I'm not worthy of it?

609
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,640
Mr. Shu,

610
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,520
why do you say that?

611
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,000
We have no idea about this matter.

612
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
According to the rules,

613
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,320
we shouldn't report to the second master.

614
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,000
The cat master has been busy recently.

615
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,800
Don't bother him with such a small matter.

616
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,120
I'll walk around the demon's room

617
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,560
and help you find the cat master.

618
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,400
Thank you, Mr. Shu.

619
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,840
Mr. Shu has been friends with the cat master for many years.

620
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,520
He grew up with him.

621
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,280
He taught him the practice of the demon's method

622
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,040
and helped him manage the demon's world.

623
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,960
They have different relationships.

624
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,280
But I also want to advise you

625
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,960
that the demon's world is the demon's after all.

626
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,760
The cat master is a half-demon.

627
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,680
You're always smart.

628
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,840
Don't let your loyalty delay your future.

629
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,360
Thank you for your reminder.

630
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,160
Goodbye.

631
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,800
Goodbye.

632
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,760
I thought

633
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,720
I'd get to know you after you're old enough.

634
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,320
I also want you to enjoy your life here.

635
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
But you've grown up.

636
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,200
You're not young anymore.

637
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,880
I'm not the one to blame.

638
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
You shouldn't have

639
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,360
gone to Lin Xiao's stupid place.

640
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,320
It's a big trouble for Xiao Zhen.

641
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,960
But I'll give you a good ending.

642
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,480
The demon's elixir has been hit by the cat master.

643
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,840
You're dead.

644
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,960
Don't kill me.

645
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,320
Don't kill me.

646
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,280
Don't kill me.

647
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,320
Don't kill me.

648
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
The Demon's World

649
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,680
I didn't expect

650
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,200
we'd be back to life

651
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,760
in this wilderness.

652
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,760
We're here at the right time.

653
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,120
Young Master.

654
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
The Demon's World

655
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,160
Is it pretty?

656
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,160
Yes.

657
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,720
Make yourself at home.

658
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,240
Good night.

659
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,480
Well,

660
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
I wonder

661
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,440
if there's more than two flows with you each day seen.

662
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,760
Of course.

663
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,200
I've seen something like this before.

664
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,840
You're really a smart man.

665
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,760
This is a mysterious object.

666
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,040
It's a human crystal.

667
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,920
It's a shampoos.

668
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,600
When facing this kind of thing,

669
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,360
most people don't care.

670
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,680
But once it's infected,

671
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,040
it will get sick.

672
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,760
It seems...

673
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,160
It seems this is what the Xuanjian Temple is looking for.

674
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,760
I heard from someone in Quzhou

675
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,920
that they want to remove this kind of thing

676
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,360
and find the root.

677
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,560
Just remove it.

678
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,280
You've learned a lot in Quzhou.

679
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,600
Wuniangzi,

680
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,800
there's a danger ahead.

681
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,360
You...

682
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,640
You're still here.

683
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,040
Since you're not in good shape,

684
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,600
just keep your eyes closed.

685
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,200
Dr. Wang

686
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,840
Other side.

687
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,360
The mountain is overgrown with the mountains, but fortunately it's scattered.

688
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,360
But I don't know why you didn't ask me how to get here.

689
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
You're too fast. I can't ask you.

690
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,360
So why didn't you ask me?

691
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,360
I've already left. Why would I ask you again?

692
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
I can't leave you alone.

693
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,360
And this road might be too narrow for you.

694
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
I'll go with you.

695
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
I'll be here.

696
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Thank you.

697
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,360
I think we're heading to the base of the tent.

698
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,360
I just think the view is nice.

699
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
I didn't expect you to be so good.

700
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
It's hard to walk. Be careful.

701
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,360
Are you okay?

702
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,360
You're so stubborn.

703
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,360
Come up.

704
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,360
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,360
I'm sorry.

707
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
I'm sorry.

708
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,360
I'm sorry.

709
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,360
I'm sorry.

713
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,360
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,360
I'm sorry.

715
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,360
I'm sorry.

716
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,360
I'm sorry.

717
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,360
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,360
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,360
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,360
I'm sorry.

723
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,360
I'm sorry.

724
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,360
I'm sorry.

725
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,360
I'm sorry.

726
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,360
I'm sorry.

727
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,360
I'm sorry.

728
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,360
I'm sorry.

729
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,360
I'm sorry.

730
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,360
I'm sorry.

731
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,360
I'm sorry.

732
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,360
I'm sorry.

734
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,360
I'm sorry.

735
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,360
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,360
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,360
I'm sorry.

741
