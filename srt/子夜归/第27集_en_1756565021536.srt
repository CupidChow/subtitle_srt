1
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,580
Only now,

2
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,080
can I meet him.

3
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,880
Time's up already.

4
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,580
Wake up.

5
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,380
What was that?

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:59,620
alright sir.

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The shadow is full of people and the eyes are full of flowers.

8
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Isn't it because there are many more monsters hiding?

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There are few evil sisters in Chang'an.

10
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It can be seen your appearance.

11
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But you are very calm about these.

12
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why are you here?

13
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was going to come back to the Sword-Picking Temple early in the morning.

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But I heard that the injured person's condition is not good.

15
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just got the news.

16
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I came to see the situation under the order of the emperor.

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So that's it.

18
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then why is the Fifth Lady here?

19
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You didn't come to the temple.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm very free.

21
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come back to see the fun.

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The corpse is so delicate.

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
In my opinion,

24
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
there must be something in it.

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Even my father and I can't see it.

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
These years,

27
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I often see him coming back at night.

28
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He is very worried.

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Sometimes he even wears a handkerchief.

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know why.

31
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I just want to see him.

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to see him.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But he didn't say anything

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
about the injury.

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Can you come to see me tomorrow?

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's not four o'clock.

43
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's time to go to work.

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You go back first.

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I still have some documents to be done.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Everyone is here.

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's start.

48
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Master,

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Shuang Jiang and Zhu Yu are not here yet.

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We don't wait anymore.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He didn't say anything.

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We can't do this.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We have to wait for him.

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When did I mean that?

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He usually deals with the work of Xuanjie Temple.

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now he has a family.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's normal that he can't escape.

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We won't make it difficult for him.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
As for Shuang Jiang...

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you take him with you,

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you won't be able to help.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You have to help him.

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Enough.

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Tell me.

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've checked this place.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No one has passed.

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's convenient for us to start.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Four formation eyes can be used to

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
tear open the broken temple barrier.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I named this formation

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
with a loud name.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's called Four-Faced Wind Formation.

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Four formation eyes.

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a good chance that

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we four can work together.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Get ready.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We'll start at night.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Langjun.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you done?

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm here to pick you up.

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't come over.

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's wrong?

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm fine.

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What's wrong?

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If you can let someone stand under the formation,

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
it's meaningless if you're a mortal.

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you're a monster,

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you can see your true form in this scene.

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm fine.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's go home.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's okay.

97
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The Xuanjian Temple is too bad.

98
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll ask someone to repair it again.

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's go home.

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's go.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's go.

104
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's go.

105
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sir, is that enough?

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's enough.

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Tomorrow, I'll give you a day to repair the tomb.

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Next,

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
we'll see Zhuying and Lingxiao's.

111
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's strange.

112
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The smell is here.

113
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What's going on?

114
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's not here.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not here.

116
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What's going on?

117
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm afraid our actions have already been exposed.

118
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We've been set up.

119
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If Shuangjiang hadn't come to the carriage,

120
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
it would have been too much of a surprise

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to see the smell on our bodies.

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Shuangjiang,

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you've done a great job this time.

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's not me.

125
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's going on?

126
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Brother Shi told me to wait for you in the carriage.

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
By the way,

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
this is Brother Shi's

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
secret evil talisman.

130
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He said it was to thank Brother Shi for repairing the Xuanjian Temple.

131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He's worried that the demon will investigate the whereabouts.

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can wear it

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
to avoid the demon from losing power.

134
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It can also

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
suppress the smell.

136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I have to say

137
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
that it's a pity that Zhu Yu left Changxi Palace.

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Pity?

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't think it's a pity.

140
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So what if he gives us a talisman?

141
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He's hiding.

142
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We're here to take the blame.

143
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He's leaving Changxi Palace.

144
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
How can he...

145
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Enough.

146
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's not talk about him leaving Changxi Palace.

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Master once said

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
that Mei Zhu Yu

149
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
is a member of the Chen family.

150
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He's a commoner.

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He shouldn't be too particular.

152
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What is it?

153
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Brother Shi gave us the address.

154
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There's a three-mile house in the east and south of the city.

155
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
When I think of these angels being despised by humans,

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I feel refreshed.

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They even dare to break into the demon's room.

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They should be on the streets

159
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and see where they hide.

160
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Don't be too happy.

161
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I just told Zhu Ying and Ling Xiao

162
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
to search the entire Chang'an.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There's no trace of angels.

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No? How could it be?

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I thought

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
the barrier was full of Ah Xiang's ashes.

167
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It was easy to be found

168
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
after being stuck.

169
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I didn't expect the angel to be so difficult to find.

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have to think of another way.

171
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't worry about this.

172
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll handle the rest.

173
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why?

174
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You have the time.

175
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why don't you think of a way to transform into a demon?

176
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I heard that the shop has found a new skin for you.

177
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can use it after you leave the temple.

178
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you have it these days?

179
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What?

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You don't know about this?

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I heard that

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
your skin is not strong enough

183
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to transform into a demon.

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you want to transform into a demon,

185
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
you have to give up.

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I got it.

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Mao Guang?

188
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can go out.

189
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yes.

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How did you know that I would come today?

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I didn't know I would come today.

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I have been preparing this soup for you for 12 hours every day.

193
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Such a detail.

194
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Then did you go to the clothing store to prepare a leather bag for me?

195
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I will prepare what I should prepare for you.

196
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Then why didn't you tell me that if I wanted to become a boxing demon, I would have to be locked up for 100 years?

197
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you want to become a boxing demon, you have to be a demon again.

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't you know that?

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You didn't tell me.

200
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There is nothing worth missing in the world.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
For the past 18 years, our common wish is to become a boxing demon.

202
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And your body is already like this.

203
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I am telling you, what can you do?

204
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Are you going to sacrifice your life for these insignificant things?

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You have to know that you are a demon.

206
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
People are old and sick.

207
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They are miserable.

208
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They can't bear anything and can't stop them.

209
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Who can you protect?

210
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Your father?

211
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Ah Jie?

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Or Mei Zhuyu?

213
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
18 years ago, you were already a student.

214
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This fate has already been decided.

215
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Sooner or later, is there a difference?

216
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
As a demon, you shouldn't have left so many useless people in your heart.

217
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You should have left so many people.

218
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You should have left so many people.

219
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You should have left so many people.

220
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You should have left so many people.

221
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You should have left so many people.

222
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You should have left so many people.

223
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You should have left so many people.

224
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You should have left so many people.

225
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You should have left so many people.

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You should have left so many people.

227
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You should have left so many people.

228
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You should have left so many people.

229
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You should have left so many people.

230
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You should have left so many people.

231
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You should have left so many people.

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,600
You should have

233
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Have fun.

234
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yin?

235
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
All right.

236
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You've lost.

237
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,680
Since there's nothing else, then leave.

238
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,360
I don't like others staying at my door.

239
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,920
Now that the leader of Changming has left the house,

240
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,280
what is your plan for the future?

241
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,680
Since he wants to enter the demon world,

242
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,680
I'll help him.

243
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:12,160
It shouldn't be that difficult for you to let someone enter the demon world.

244
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,280
No, I don't like the answer in my mind.

245
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,560
What I want is for both sides to be together,

246
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,720
to fight against each other.

247
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,320
That is a death that is unimaginable.

248
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:37,880
I wonder if you're doing this for yourself or for our great cause.

249
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,200
For me, it's for you, for our great cause.

250
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:23,320
What are you doing?

251
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
I'm back.

252
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Sit down.

253
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,560
You can eat the meat right away.

254
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:42,680
Don't worry, it's not original.

255
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Why do you suddenly think about grilling meat?

256
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
I suddenly remember that on the day of the childbirth,

257
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:57,680
my family would grill meat in the courtyard.

258
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,360
It's so nice to be able to grill meat for a family.

259
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,280
Then every winter, we will grill meat together.

260
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,080
I can also ask your father to try my cooking.

261
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:22,080
How is it?

262
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,680
Tang Jun.

263
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:33,480
What's wrong?

264
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,680
It will be done soon.

265
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,280
The meat is so delicious.

266
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:32,880
Don't worry, the house is in a remote place.

267
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,280
I also put the curse of the snake on the four places.

268
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,680
The monster can't find us here for a while.

269
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,880
It's the same everywhere.

270
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,880
The person who cultivates the knife doesn't care about these things.

271
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,480
It's just the smell.

272
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,080
It's just a pity that my four sides are not in good shape.

273
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,280
I'm in danger and I'm dying.

274
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,080
I don't know why, but we were attacked by this bad breath.

275
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,680
This kind of smell, it takes at least two or three days to all disappear.

276
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,480
Why?

277
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
It must be the evil demons in the demon world who are taking revenge.

278
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,080
It shows that our method is right.

279
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,680
This can open the demon world's barrier.

280
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,280
We should just act and kill the demon world.

281
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,080
Brother 10 said that if Brother 3 can act and enter the demon world,

282
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,480
he won't have a chance to meet us.

283
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,680
He came out of the mountain by himself and started over and over again.

284
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm afraid he's already colluding with the monster.

285
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,080
How is that possible?

286
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,680
Whoever colludes with the monster is Brother 10.

287
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,080
He's bearing the grudge of his parents.

288
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,680
I'm afraid that someone is holding you in his arms and making a fool of you.

289
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,280
Brother 4 can't do that.

290
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,080
Why don't you kill yourself and save your life?

291
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,280
Wait!

292
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,480
Enough.

293
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,880
I think that Brother 4 is also a demon-slayer.

294
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,080
Don't hurt the feelings between us because of these things.

295
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Anyway, I only know that if it weren't for Brother 10,

296
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,280
we wouldn't be here right now.

297
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,280
So he knows that we will definitely fail.

298
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Brother 10 said that he knew that we wouldn't succeed.

299
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,480
He told me to tell the other brothers to enter the city and change their ways.

300
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,880
You guys think about it.

301
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,880
Where are you going?

302
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,280
You're not staying?

303
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,480
Brother 10 has already arranged a place for me.

304
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,280
Moreover, I can't stand the smell.

305
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,880
He wants us to follow him.

306
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,280
He wants us to listen to his advice.

307
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,280
He's really scheming.

308
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,680
I can't run faster than Fugui! I can't run faster than you!

309
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,280
Stop right there!

310
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,880
Stop right there!

311
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,480
Stop right there!

312
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Stop right there!

313
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
I told you to run!

314
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,480
If you run again, I'll make you a real goose!

315
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,680
You're a big man. You always bully the weak.

316
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm bullying him?

317
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,080
He's the son of my second wife.

318
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,280
Son?

319
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,680
Him?

320
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Second wife's son?

321
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,880
Second wife's son? That's too much!

322
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,080
Hey!

323
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,680
Hey, where are you going?

324
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,680
I'm going to wake up my wife and husband.

325
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,280
What time is it? It's not like you.

326
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,480
This...

327
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,680
Hey, wait!

328
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,480
They went out to play all day.

329
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
They only slept in the middle of the night.

330
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,280
If we disturb their dreams,

331
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,280
they'll get angry and get angry.

332
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,280
You're right.

333
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,880
Then... you go and wake them up.

334
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,080
Why? I'm not going.

335
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,280
You go.

336
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,080
No, I'm not going.

337
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,880
Go, go, go.

338
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm not going.

339
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,680
Help! Help!

340
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,280
I'm not going. I'm not going.

341
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,080
Stop fighting. Be quiet.

342
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Ah...

343
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,280
Your aunt's family went back to Chang'an.

344
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,880
They're going to set up a camp at the Wu Palace today.

345
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,680
I know.

346
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,880
I'm not in a hurry.

347
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:32,680
Ah...

348
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Ah...

349
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Ah...

350
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Ah...

351
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Ah...

352
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Ah...

353
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Miss! Miss!

354
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,280
You're here.

355
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,480
Why are you here?

356
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,680
You said that?

357
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,880
My brother came to see you as soon as I got off work.

358
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,080
I heard recently

359
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,480
that you did something that made people happy.

360
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
I didn't expect that

361
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,480
you rejected the marriage proposal with that Liu.

362
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,880
You're really my brother.

363
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,080
This marriage proposal is good.

364
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,880
It's very romantic.

365
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,280
Xiao Si, we're not afraid.

366
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,280
We're just women.

367
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,480
Now that I'm married,

368
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,080
I don't need to introduce him to eight girls every year.

369
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,680
I've decided to do it for you.

370
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,280
At the worst, we'll meet each other every year.

371
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,880
I'll find you.

372
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Are you satisfied?

373
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,080
No need to thank me.

374
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,680
I've selected these for you these days.

375
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,280
Different looks, different styles.

376
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,880
They should have experience.

377
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,280
The sister of the head of the family.

378
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,480
Her temperament is cool, her personality is aggressive, and her passion is fiery.

379
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,880
Are you satisfied?

380
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,280
Yes, I'm passionate.

381
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,280
I've been lucky to meet her once. I can't even put in the secret.

382
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,480
I think...

383
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,880
I still like the reserved and cold.

384
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
Yes, the niece of the Crown Prince's young master.

385
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,880
The famous Golden-Horned Lady.

386
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,480
She was dumb when she was sick.

387
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,880
Is she cold?

388
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,080
She's too cold.

389
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,880
I...

390
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,480
I really understand.

391
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,880
Her body is thin and her temperament is cold.

392
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,480
She's talkative and she's very polite.

393
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,280
In reality, she's quite sharp.

394
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,280
I think I know this person.

395
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Where is she?

396
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Isn't she the one you're talking about?

397
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Last time, this was a bit of a party.

398
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,280
It was the time for Zhen to get married.

399
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Yes.

400
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,280
It's a pity. I wasn't feeling well a while ago.

401
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
The departure was a bit late.

402
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,280
I couldn't catch up with Zhen's wedding.

403
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,280
It's okay. Your health is still important.

404
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Yes, yes, yes.

405
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
It's a good day for you to come back.

406
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,280
It's the good time for Chang'an.

407
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Yes.

408
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Let's drink together.

409
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Xianxu,

410
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,280
let's drink to your aunt.

411
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Auntie,

412
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
I'll give you a toast.

413
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Xianxu, don't worry. I understand you.

414
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,280
You're already drunk.

415
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Auntie,

416
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,280
I'll give you a toast.

417
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Not bad. Look at this child. He's very sensible.

418
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Yes, he's very sensible.

419
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Ling Xiao and the others are still looking for those angels.

420
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,280
If they just disappear like this, that's fine.

421
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,280
But if they cause more trouble,

422
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,280
it's really going to be a life or death situation.

423
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Don't worry. I won't give them a chance.

424
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,280
I heard that you and your husband have been very close lately.

425
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,280
You don't even avoid him in front of people.

426
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,280
What? You're leaving?

427
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
You can't bear to part with him?

428
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,280
I heard that after Xiao Si got married,

429
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Minister Liu wanted to help you.

430
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Don't mention it.

431
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
In Chang'an,

432
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
we weren't married.

433
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
We were just partners.

434
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
Now that you're married,

435
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
it's a life that everyone knows.

436
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Old Liu can't help asking me.

437
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Ask you what?

438
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
He asked me if I liked the man

439
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,280
who didn't want a husband.

440
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,280
He's worried that in Chang'an,

441
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,280
he won't be able to find another beautiful woman.

442
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Minister Liu has played it before.

443
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
How do you answer?

444
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
I don't like it.

445
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Did he ask you which kind of woman you like?

446
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Yes.

447
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,280
I said that if Wuzhen is a man,

448
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,280
I like someone like that.

449
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,280
He really looks up to me.

450
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Your cousin is very successful.

451
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
He's been in the border for a long time.

452
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
If it weren't for him,

453
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,280
he wouldn't be here today.

454
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Cousin, I'll give you a toast.

455
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Cousin, please.

456
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Sister Zhen,

457
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
my back hurts.

458
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
What's wrong?

459
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
You can't even drink?

460
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
No, Sister Zhen.

461
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
I'm just worried about you.

462
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Why don't you find a man to take a look at?

463
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Children, eat more.

464
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Don't fall.

465
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Be careful.

466
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
It seems that this handsome man is very attentive in the daytime.

467
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,280
But at night, he's also very reckless.

468
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Who said that only at night?

469
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,280
I'm not that kind of person.

470
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
I'm not that kind of person.

471
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,280
I'm not that kind of person.

472
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Who said that only at night?

473
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Then why are you still here?

474
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Where's your little husband?

475
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Go find him.

476
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,280
He thinks that the women and children in the yard are too noisy.

477
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
The backyard is quiet.

478
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
I'm not playing with you.

479
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
I'm not playing with you either.

480
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
What's wrong?

481
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
It's very noisy.

482
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,280
There are too many people here. Don't cry.

483
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,280
I don't want to cry.

484
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
Don't cry.

485
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Don't cry anymore.

486
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Don't cry.

487
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
Don't cry.

488
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Oh my.

489
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,280
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Our son loves to bully people.

491
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
He's born to be a little king.

492
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
I'm sorry to trouble you.

493
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
I'll go find him now.

494
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
I want to go home.

495
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I want to go home.

496
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,280
I want to go home.

497
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,280
I want to go home.

498
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
You're my cousin's son?

499
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,280
I want to go home.

500
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,280
I want to go home.

501
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,280
I want to go home.

502
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
Is this my son?

503
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Yes.

504
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Really?

505
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,280
This Mr. Mei is good at teaching children.

506
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
He's really rare.

507
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
How did he do it?

508
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I don't know.

509
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
This is too amazing.

510
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
That's right.

511
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
I can't believe

512
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,280
such a young young man

513
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
can teach children.

514
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
It seems that this Mr. Mei

515
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
will be a good father.

516
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
I'll go get it now.

517
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Okay.

518
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
I'll go get it now.

519
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Slowly.

520
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Slowly.

521
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Slowly.

522
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Slowly.

523
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Slowly.

524
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
I don't know.

525
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
He's so young.

526
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
He's so young.

527
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
He's so young.

528
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
I've been through this morning and it's enough.

529
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
I didn't expect that

530
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
I was too greedy.

531
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Xiaosheng,

532
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
I regret it.

533
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
I haven't eaten for 3 days

534
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
and I don't have enough energy.

535
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
From memory to memory?

536
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,280
That was from him?

537
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
During the first days that he had spent thinking

538
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
he decided to get rid of this matter first.

539
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
When 위�sch question time for글

540
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
and I were there to multi-task

541
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
He has been working hard for 18 years.

542
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
But now he wants to take a long-term plan.

543
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
It's not completely unreasonable for him to do so.

544
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,280
He still hasn't figured out why his body is in a state of emergency.

545
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,280
He can't possibly take his own life to gamble.

546
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
This is ridiculous.

547
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
I'll go find him.

548
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Uncle Wu.

549
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Uncle Wu, I don't care what you think.

550
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,280
But as Wu Zhen, he still has dozens of years to live.

551
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
He still has his own life.

552
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,280
This is very important to him.

553
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,280
I hope you can respect him.

554
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
The Star Fire has been growing.

555
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Sometimes, it will eventually fall into the water.

556
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
But it's not the end.

557
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
It's the beginning.

558
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,280
The end.

559
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
The end.

560
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
The end.

561
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
The end.

562
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
The end.

563
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
The end.

564
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
The end.

565
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
The end.

566
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,280
The end.

567
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
The end.

568
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
The end.

569
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
What about Chang Ming?

570
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Is there anything you can do?

571
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,280
If we can find the traces of those people,

572
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,280
it's all thanks to Elder Chang Ming.

573
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
What do you mean?

574
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
The End

575
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
The End

576
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
The End

577
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,280
The End

578
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,280
The End
