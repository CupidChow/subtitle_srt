Episode 15

2
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,440
You don't drink, do you?

3
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,440
You seem to be quite good at drinking.

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,440
But drinking like this is really a waste of time.

5
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
You have to drink slowly

6
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
to get the right taste.

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
And the alcohol is strong.

8
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
You are drinking too much.

9
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm afraid you are overdoing it.

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Didn't you go to see your cousin off?

11
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Why are you still here to bother me?

12
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
You really drank too much.

13
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,880
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
What's wrong?

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
Do you not recognize who I am?

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
You...

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,320
It's a fruit.

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,320
What fruit?

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,320
You are a fruit that fell from my tree.

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,320
This is my tree.

49
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Let's go. I'll take you back to your room.

50
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,320
You have to stay away from that Pei Langjun.

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
He is not good.

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Okay.

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Our Pei Langjun is the best. Let's go.

54
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Then...

55
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Like you, my eyes are following promise of fate.

56
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,260
You always keep asking me questions.

57
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,600
I say that I think I should speak to him.

58
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,100
You always play tricks.

59
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,120
That disturbance is always unsuspecting by me.

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,660
Things come and go depending on my iteration.

61
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,660
I can't do this anymore.

62
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Come on, smile.

63
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,660
I wonder what you're thinking.

64
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
The End

65
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,660
Anyone there?

66
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
Anyone there?

67
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Anyone there?

68
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
Why did you come at this time?

69
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Mrs Liu!

70
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
Mrs Liu!

71
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Mrs Liu!

72
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
I finally found you.

73
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
Mrs Liu!

74
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
The End

75
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,660
Mrs Liu, if you have any difficulties, just tell me.

76
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,660
Go away.

77
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Monster, don't bother Mrs Liu!

78
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
The End

79
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
The End

80
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,660
It's all her doing.

81
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,660
She's trying to harm me, this monster who's trying to harm people.

82
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,660
She's a monster!

83
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Mrs Liu!

84
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Mrs Liu!

85
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,660
Mrs Liu, are you okay?

86
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Why did you come back?

87
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,660
The Demon's Trap said that when the snake monster is skinned, it needs drinking water, but not food.

88
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,660
But I also remember that when the snake monster is weak, it needs to eat the ashes, the yellow sun and the mulberry tree.

89
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
So I picked some fresh mulberry leaves.

90
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,660
I don't know which mulberry leaf is the best, so I prepared some.

91
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
The End

92
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
The End

93
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
How did I come back?

94
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Cousin, I'll take you to eat some pancakes in the west of the city.

95
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,660
These days, the County Master and the Pei family have been going out together.

96
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:40,660
The people are all walking around, and they're all talking about how they're going to get married.

97
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
Is this true?

98
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,660
I don't know.

99
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Brother Mei, are you really going to marry the County Master?

100
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Where's the thing I want?

101
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,660
I brought it. This is what Brother Mei wanted.

102
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Minister Liu said that it's all the records about the snake monster in the Dark Road Pavilion.

103
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,660
Please thank Minister Liu for me.

104
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,660
But Brother Mei, it's not a big deal to guard the County Master all day.

105
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,660
If you really care about him, why don't you take the initiative?

106
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
I'm not afraid that he has something on his mind.

107
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,660
I'm just afraid that he'll fall in love with someone bad.

108
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,660
What's wrong?

109
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Cousin, what's wrong?

110
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,660
When we go out to play, there's always someone who's so stubborn.

111
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,660
It's so annoying.

112
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
Cousin is famous in Chang'an.

113
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,660
It's inevitable. Don't be angry.

114
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
He's a bad name.

115
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,660
What kind of rouge is that? I'm not going.

116
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,660
Okay, if you don't go, then don't go.

117
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,660
Let's go out to play a few days later.

118
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,660
It won't be as noisy as the city.

119
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Cousin, how about we go to Lin'an River?

120
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Lin'an River?

121
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
The largest river in Chang'an.

122
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
There's an island across the river.

123
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,660
I heard that the scenery there is very beautiful.

124
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,660
When the time comes, we'll jump into the river.

125
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,660
We'll swim along the river, free and free.

126
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Is that okay?

127
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,660
Okay. Cousin, of course, everything is fine.

128
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Everyone is fine.

129
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,660
Do you think Cousin will come back tonight?

130
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Why not?

131
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,660
Cousin has been very busy lately.

132
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,660
He's been out and about with Mr. Pei.

133
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Everyone in Chang'an says that he and Mr. Pei are childhood friends.

134
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,660
Mr. Pei is very happy to hear that rumor.

135
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:48,660
The one who has been with Xiao Zhen for 18 years is not Pei Jingyang.

136
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Come back.

137
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
Come back to me.

138
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:09,660
We will fight together.

139
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Uncle.

140
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
Xiao Zhen.

141
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,660
Are you talking to me?

142
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
No, how could I be angry at you?

143
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
I just had a nightmare.

144
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,660
Uncle, if you have something to tell us, we can think of a way together.

145
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Don't worry.

146
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,660
I'm here alone.

147
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
What can I do?

148
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,660
Besides, if I have something to tell you,

149
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,660
it's not important to others.

150
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,660
Here you are.

151
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,660
The past events related to the Xuanhui are all in it.

152
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Tell me.

153
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,660
There is one thing that I need your help with.

154
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
What is it?

155
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
I'm afraid that I can't tell you.

156
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
I'm afraid that I can't tell you.

157
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
I need your help.

158
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
Miss Liu,

159
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,660
look, she still needs me to find something for you.

160
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,660
I hope you can recover soon and don't suffer too much.

161
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,660
Okay, I'll go find something.

162
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
You have to wait for me.

163
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,660
What a fool.

164
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
No.

165
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Snake demon.

166
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
What did you catch?

167
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Snake demon is a rare creature.

168
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,660
We caught this snake demon from the mountain.

169
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,660
It's so deep that it has turned into a human.

170
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Look, it has a scales on its face.

171
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
When it sees us,

172
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
it will make a lot of secret secrets.

173
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,660
It must be a demon.

174
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,660
It wants to confuse us with its beauty.

175
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
It's so evil.

176
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
It's because we don't know how to move,

177
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
so we can't catch it.

178
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
This snake demon has a strong power.

179
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
It's cunning.

180
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
It wants to escape many times.

181
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
We have to pull its tongue

182
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
and lock it with a chain

183
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,660
to prevent it from escaping and harming people.

184
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,660
How dare you?

185
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,660
How dare you harm people?

186
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,660
Behave yourself.

187
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,660
Stop. Stop.

188
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
What are you doing?

189
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,660
Will a demon harm people?

190
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
Even if it's a demon,

191
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
you shouldn't treat it like this.

192
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
A demon will harm people.

193
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
There are no demons who don't harm people.

194
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Listen to me. Listen to me.

195
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Listen to me.

196
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Demons are like people.

197
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
They are also good and evil.

198
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
You haven't figured out the truth yet.

199
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,660
You are so violent to it.

200
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,660
It's so inhuman.

201
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
What are you thinking?

202
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660
You think this demon won't harm people?

203
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
I'm telling you, when I caught it,

204
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
it was eating the snake's heart.

205
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,660
Why are you going around? Go away.

206
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Go away.

207
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
It ate you.

208
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Why are you so angry?

209
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
It's so annoying.

210
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
Where did it come from?

211
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
It's so annoying.

212
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,660
It's so annoying.

213
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
It's so annoying.

214
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,660
It's so annoying.

215
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,660
It's so annoying.

216
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,660
It's so annoying.

217
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
This idiot.

218
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
He came out for so long.

219
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Will something happen to him?

220
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,660
Are you okay?

221
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Don't be afraid.

222
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
I was just...

223
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
I remember you.

224
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,660
You can talk?

225
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,660
I remember you.

226
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,660
I remember you.

227
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,660
I remember you.

228
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,660
I remember you.

229
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
I remember you.

230
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
I remember you.

231
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,660
I remember you.

232
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,660
Yes.

233
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,660
You...

234
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
Have you really eaten the child's liver?

235
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
No!

236
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
They were talking nonsense.

237
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
I knew it.

238
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
Demons are not living together.

239
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
Besides, those two people

240
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
are ordinary hunters.

241
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
If you sinned

242
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
and ate the child's liver,

243
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
how could you be easily trapped here?

244
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,660
You are a little monster, right?

245
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,660
Don't you mind if I am a monster?

246
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
So what?

247
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,660
If you are not wrong, there is no reason to be trapped here and be humiliated.

248
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,660
Even if you are wrong, it is because of the person you hurt that you are seeking justice.

249
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Why are you locked up here to perform and earn money?

250
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,660
I will find a way to take you away.

251
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
You want to take me away?

252
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Don't be afraid. I will save you out of here.

253
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,660
You will be free. I am not going to use you.

254
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,660
You...

255
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,660
Don't eat this.

256
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
Eat this.

257
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,660
This...

258
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,660
This is good.

259
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
This...

260
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
What is this?

261
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Sangye.

262
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,660
It is the time for snakes to be removed from their skin.

263
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Your body is so weak.

264
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
This is good.

265
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,660
You are not a snake.

266
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I...

267
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,660
This Fu family is so smart.

268
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
They even know it.

269
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
So what if they see it?

270
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,660
The stupid people who had no brains before

271
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,660
were all because of this lady's appearance.

272
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
They were tricked.

273
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,660
No matter what, what is important is that we can catch big fish again.

274
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Fortunately, we are the snakes.

275
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
We were born as monkeys.

276
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,660
That is why we were able to catch so many big fish.

277
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,660
As long as we can do it this time,

278
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,660
we will be able to return to the town soon.

279
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Actually, there have never been any snakes.

280
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
I was accidentally lured by them.

281
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
They always know how to make trouble for me.

282
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
They even forced me.

283
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
They forced me to look like this.

284
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,380
They are just the

285
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
Why is there such a hateful person in this world?

286
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
He is too cruel.

287
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
I will teach you.

288
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Wait.

289
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
Let him go.

290
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,660
Hurry.

291
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,660
Hurry.

292
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
You really came back.

293
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
What?

294
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,660
You want to let this snake go while we are not here?

295
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,660
Miss, hurry and go.

296
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,660
I will hold him.

297
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Go.

298
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
Let go.

299
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Let go of me.

300
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Go? Where are we going?

301
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,660
We are going together.

302
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,660
This lady has been deceiving us since she cheated us.

303
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,660
She is a greedy and beautiful snake like you.

304
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,660
She pretends to be a snake demon and lures young men.

305
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,660
Then she shows her body and pretends to be pitiful.

306
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,660
It is just an old trick.

307
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,660
But you have something different from them.

308
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,660
At this time, others have already been scared.

309
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
You still have to catch us and let them go.

310
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,660
You are the most stupid person we have ever seen.

311
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
He is stupid.

312
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Stop talking nonsense with him.

313
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
Hurry and tie him up.

314
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
Take him to the mansion to ask for money.

315
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
Be honest.

316
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
Be honest.

317
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Let go of me.

318
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,660
Let go.

319
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
Let's go.

320
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
It's okay.

321
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
Xiao Mi and the others won't chase us anymore.

322
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Let's go.

323
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Mister.

324
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,660
I...

325
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,660
I did lie to you today.

326
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
But I didn't mean it.

327
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
I was only trying to cure them.

328
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
If I don't help them,

329
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,660
they will beat me up.

330
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,660
I am just trying to survive.

331
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,660
I see.

332
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
You are safe now.

333
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
Don't lie to me again.

334
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
I will take my leave.

335
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Mister.

336
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
What is it?

337
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,660
I am lucky to have what you asked for.

338
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
I am not a common person.

339
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
I have nothing to repay you.

340
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,660
If you don't give up,

341
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,660
I am willing to serve you in this life.

342
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,660
Miss.

343
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
I saved you.

344
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,660
I never thought of repaying you.

345
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
I am willing to do it.

346
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,660
Miss.

347
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
I am really sorry.

348
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,660
Are you not willing to believe me because of the money?

349
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Get up.

350
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
I know.

351
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
You are also a poor person.

352
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
Just now in the courtyard,

353
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
you helped me a lot.

354
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
But according to them,

355
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,660
more than one person was in danger because of saving you.

356
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,660
You are the only one who knows

357
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,660
if you are guilty of all of this.

358
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
I only know that

359
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,660
it is more possible to do evil than to be a demon.

360
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,660
Miss.

361
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
My fiancee is still waiting for me.

362
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
I will take my leave.

363
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
Miss.

364
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,660
Are you okay?

365
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,660
Are you okay?

366
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
You are quite bold.

367
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,660
I thought that when you saw my waist,

368
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,660
you would run away in a hurry.

369
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Run away?

370
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
How could I?

371
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,660
It was just a little sudden.

372
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
You should have told me earlier.

373
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Why should I tell you earlier?

374
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
I am not a woman.

375
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
I am a woman.

376
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
I am a woman.

377
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
I am a woman.

378
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
Why should I have told you earlier?

379
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
We are not married.

380
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
We should be honest with each other.

381
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,660
I am a demon.

382
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Yes.

383
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
I saw it.

384
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Then you still say that I am not married.

385
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
You are a demon.

386
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
Our marriage is fixed by two families.

387
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
Does this matter?

388
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,660
You want to marry this demon?

389
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
No, no.

390
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,660
I never thought that I wanted to marry you.

391
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Who would let you marry a demon?

392
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,660
If you think about it,

393
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
how can other men's wives compare to you?

394
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,660
How can they have such a beautiful snake body?

395
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
Beautiful?

396
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,660
More beautiful than the demon's spirit.

397
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

398
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,660
You are right.

399
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
It is like you have seen other snakes.

400
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,660
I wanted to give you a surprise.

401
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,660
But the little loach is too ugly.

402
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
You definitely can't see it.

403
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,660
What?

404
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,660
I mean the demon is in the trap.

405
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,660
I didn't mention that the demon is so beautiful.

406
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,660
Do you still think I am beautiful?

407
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
I am a snake demon.

408
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,660
I can't let anything happen to me.

409
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
If you dare to tell me,

410
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,660
I will swallow you like I did just now.

411
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,660
So, mind your mouth.

412
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
Lady Liu, where are you going?

413
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
Back to Chang'an.

414
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660
Okay, I will go with you.

415
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
I will go with you.

416
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
Lady Min Zhuang.

417
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
What are you doing?

418
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
Of course, it is my husband's wedding gift.

419
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Wedding gift?

420
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Did Lady Min Zhuang agree?

421
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
It is a new thing.

422
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,660
Today, my husband is going on a trip with the county magistrate.

423
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,660
They will be together on their own.

424
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,660
It is a marriage proposal.

425
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,660
On their own?

426
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,660
Where are they going?

427
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,660
Chang'an city.

428
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
Lin'an river.

429
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,660
Xiao Wu, Xiao Zhan.

430
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,660
Why did you tell this to Mr. Mei?

431
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,660
What are you talking about?

432
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,660
Mr. Mei asked you.

433
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
That is why he said so.

434
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,660
Lady Wu.

435
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,660
Lady Wu.

436
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,660
No, this is not right.

437
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,660
Mr. Mei, my husband is going on a trip with the county magistrate.

438
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,660
It is not related to him.

439
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
You must not disturb him.

440
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,660
Sorry, I still have to disturb him.

441
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,660
Mr. Mei.

442
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,660
What are you doing?

443
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,660
What is it?

444
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Recently, there are rumors in Chang'an.

445
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
They say that Chang'an has done something bad.

446
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
Have you heard about it?

447
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
It is all nonsense.

448
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,660
There is no such thing as evil sister in this world.

449
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Don't think too much.

450
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
But they are all talking nonsense.

451
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,660
It is really unbelievable.

452
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,660
Then, there are many stories about evil sister in this book.

453
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,660
There is a story that says that

454
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,660
in order to gain the power that one wants,

455
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,660
one uses one's flesh and blood to trade with the evil demon.

456
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Cousin, do you think it is interesting?

457
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
It is a bit new.

458
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,660
I have never heard of it before.

459
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Then?

460
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Then, this person became the evil demon himself.

461
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,660
If I knew that Cousin liked this kind of book,

462
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
I would have found it for Cousin.

463
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
What is this pattern on the box?

464
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
It is a jade.

465
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Cousin, do you have any questions?

466
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,660
The pattern on the box looks like a jade.

467
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,660
But from my side,

468
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,660
it looks like a hidden eye.

469
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Who are you?

470
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,660
Oh no, the pattern on the box.

471
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,660
The pattern on the box is a jade.

472
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,660
There is a story about the eye in this book.

473
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Cousin, look.

474
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
Okay.

475
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Cousin, look.

476
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,660
Cousin, you are teasing me again.

477
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
There is no word in this book.

478
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
How is that possible?

479
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Look carefully.

480
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
Cousin, look.

481
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
This book has no clear origin.

482
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,660
It is very bad.

483
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,660
Cousin, you should read it.

484
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
Okay.

485
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,660
I will read it.

486
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Cousin, look.

487
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,660
Look carefully.

488
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
This is the book.

489
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
It is a jade.

490
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Cousin, look.

491
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,660
The pattern on the box is a jade.

492
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,660
It is a hidden eye.

493
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,660
Cousin, look.

494
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
Look carefully.

495
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
Cousin, look.

496
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,660
This is the book.

497
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,660
It is a hidden eye.

498
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,660
It is very bad.

499
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,660
Cousin, look.

500
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,660
It is better to read it carefully.

501
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,660
Cousin, look.

502
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,660
It is a hidden eye.

503
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,660
It is a hidden eye.

504
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,660
Cousin, look.

505
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
It is a hidden eye.

506
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,660
It is a hidden eye.

507
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,660
Cousin, look.

508
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,660
It is a hidden eye.

509
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,660
It is a hidden eye.

510
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,660
Cousin, look.

511
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,660
It is a hidden eye.

512
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,660
It is a hidden eye.

513
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
Cousin, look.

514
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
It is a hidden eye.

515
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,660
It is a hidden eye.

516
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,660
Cousin, look.

517
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
It is a hidden eye.

518
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Cousin, look.

519
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
It is a hidden eye.

520
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,660
It is a hidden eye.

521
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
Cousin, look.

522
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,660
It is a hidden eye.

523
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,660
It is a hidden eye.

524
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,660
Cousin, look.

525
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
It is a hidden eye.

526
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,660
Cousin, look.

527
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
It is a hidden eye.

528
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:58,720
Wonderful.

529
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:27,720
2

530
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Cousin,

532
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,720
he must not die.

533
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Who are you?

534
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,220
You're wrong.

535
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
I'm not human.

536
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
You're not human.

537
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Are you okay?

538
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,720
I'm fine.

539
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
I'm fine.

540
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Go!

541
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
You're really Yasheng Shu.

542
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Yes!

543
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
This Pei's father

544
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,720
harassed my cousin every day.

545
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,720
I just wanted to give him a lesson.

546
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
What's wrong?

547
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Don't come over.

548
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
I'm a master of the world.

549
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
If you hurt me,

550
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
he won't forgive you.

551
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I know.

552
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
You're not human.

553
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
I'm human.

554
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Don't come over.

555
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm a master of the world.

556
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
If you hurt me,

557
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
he won't forgive you.

558
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Shoot!

559
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
If I give you another chance,

560
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
shoot!

561
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I can't.

562
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
