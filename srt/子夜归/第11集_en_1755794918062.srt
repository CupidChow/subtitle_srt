1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

4
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He saved me

5
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can't let him break

6
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You just finished the flowerless valley yesterday

7
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Today, use the power of the magic to cure his injury

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Be careful of your health

9
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I

10
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm very good

11
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You

12
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Please go to the doctor

13
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You

14
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I heard it was a close call

15
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Your injury recovered slowly

16
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,880
But you fell int Sith

17
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,860
From the heavens

18
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,380
If I had time to spare

19
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I would take time off to drink

20
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How about I make a prescription

21
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
With this cure

22
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think you'll be able to recover soon.

23
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
Thank you.

24
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,280
Tell the palace the news.

25
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Gu zone

26
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Thanks to you and the other ladies for everything.

27
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
I'm sorry.

28
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
It's okay.

29
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
You don't have to apologize.

30
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Yesterday, you were injured.

31
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Not only the Empress and Consort Mei.

32
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,680
My second wife was also worried.

33
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm worried that you'll die in my house.

34
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
It's not a good idea.

35
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Don't worry.

36
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I'll be careful.

37
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,680
You're leaving?

38
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
It's not a big deal.

39
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
I'd better go back.

40
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Do you dislike the carelessness of my mansion?

41
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Or you simply don't want to live in my mansion?

42
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
I don't want to live in your mansion.

43
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
If I live here,

44
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
I'll be criticized.

45
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
I'll be criticized for being rude to you.

46
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
I'll be criticized for being rude to you.

47
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,680
My fifth wife is in bad shape.

48
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Don't worry.

49
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
My fifth wife is really...

50
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
She's not a good woman.

51
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Look at the last night's news.

52
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
The sky hasn't been clear yet.

53
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
The whole Chang'an has been spread.

54
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Spread what?

55
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Last night, the skylight was broken.

56
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,680
The princess of Qinghe pulled the husband of Mei.

57
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
She was meeting at the castle.

58
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
The husband of Mei didn't obey.

59
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Guess what?

60
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
What?

61
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,680
The princess of Qinghe broke her leg.

62
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,680
At that time, the Lord of Heaven...

63
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I can't watch it anymore.

64
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
The skylight was back on.

65
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
It really caught fire.

66
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Really?

67
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Absolutely.

68
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
My sixth uncle's nephew...

69
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
is a guard of the palace.

70
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
They came from the city.

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
They were protecting the empress.

72
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
They heard it.

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
No.

74
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
My fourth aunt's cousin's daughter...

75
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
was serving the princess of Mei.

76
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
She didn't say that.

77
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
What did she say?

78
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Yes.

79
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
She said that...

80
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
the husband of Mei...

81
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
harassed the princess of Qinghe...

82
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,680
and threatened her with her life.

83
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
She insisted that the princess of Qinghe...

84
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
take her to the palace.

85
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
What you two said...

86
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
is...

87
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Yes.

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Everyone said the same thing.

89
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Mine?

90
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Now, these royal family...

91
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
are so big.

92
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I don't know if they are big.

93
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
But I know that...

94
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
the people in the palace...

95
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
are not good at hearing.

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,680
The braised eggplant that you like the most.

97
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
You...

98
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Sir, could you...

99
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Is there any news from the master?

100
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
I heard that...

101
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
last night, the master of Qinghe...

102
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
fell down from the building.

103
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
He seems to be injured.

104
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
But we don't know where he went.

105
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
He is injured.

106
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
The master is really a disaster.

107
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Who are you talking about?

108
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
You are so greedy.

109
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
You are so poor.

110
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
You are the one who...

111
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
is a disaster.

112
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Who are you talking about?

113
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
You are the one who is a disaster.

114
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
If you didn't eat so much at home...

115
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
why would you be so busy...

116
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
to earn money?

117
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
If you weren't so busy...

118
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
and so tired...

119
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
you wouldn't be so weak...

120
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,680
and wouldn't fall down from the wall.

121
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
So, you are the one who is...

122
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
so poor.

123
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
You are so mean.

124
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Sir.

125
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
I am here to deliver a letter.

126
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
The master of the family is injured.

127
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
He is staying in the palace...

128
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
for a while.

129
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
The palace?

130
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Did they really fall down?

131
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
What kind of injury is this?

132
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Is it serious?

133
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Can we still earn money?

134
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Don't worry.

135
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
It's not serious now.

136
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,680
My wife will take good care of him.

137
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
When he is back, he will be fine.

138
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
My wife.

139
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I am really not well-off staying in the palace.

140
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Not to mention Xuanjian Temple.

141
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Xuanjian Temple?

142
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
I have already told the people there.

143
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,680
There are no cases recently.

144
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,680
There is no reason for a person...

145
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
who is injured to go to the office every day.

146
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
But...

147
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Stop but.

148
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Since you saved me, you are my person.

149
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Be good.

150
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Don't worry about me.

151
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
I am a county magistrate.

152
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
It's okay to have ten children...

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
if I have a son like you.

154
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
You want to have ten children?

155
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Did you get a brain injury?

156
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,680
You have only one leg.

157
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
You only listen to half of what I say.

158
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
If I were to say...

159
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,680
I have been taking care of you for the past one night.

160
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Why are you talking like this?

161
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
I am too stupid.

162
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Thank you for taking good care of me.

163
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Don't worry.

164
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
I have already sent a letter to your house.

165
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
You can rest assured.

166
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
Thank you.

167
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Thank you.

168
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I haven't returned for the whole night.

169
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
I am afraid they will be worried.

170
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Worry is worry.

171
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
But...

172
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
I still have a lot of energy left.

173
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I wanted to ask you last night.

174
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Did our second wife...

175
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,680
fall in love with this handsome young man?

176
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Otherwise, why are you so anxious?

177
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,680
It happened so suddenly last night.

178
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
I just got up from the morning...

179
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
and my energy has not recovered.

180
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
If it wasn't for her help...

181
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
I am afraid I would be the one...

182
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
lying there.

183
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
How can a cat like you lie down so easily?

184
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Besides, she is just a mortal.

185
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
What's the point of not helping her?

186
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
Cats are not all that they can be.

187
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
I will be afraid of death too.

188
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Let's go.

189
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Where are we going?

190
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Didn't you say that Uncle is awake?

191
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Let's go see him.

192
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
I am sorry.

193
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,680
I remember that you didn't like taking medicine when you were young.

194
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
I accidentally discovered the candy in this store.

195
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,680
You didn't like it.

196
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
You only took medicine because of this candy.

197
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Then I found out that...

198
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
you didn't take medicine to keep yourself healthy.

199
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
You only took candy.

200
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Don't take too much.

201
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Otherwise, you will become fatter.

202
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,680
It was because I ate too much candy and was too fat.

203
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
I couldn't hide it at all.

204
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,680
But her candy was really delicious.

205
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,680
I remember that the candy store was far away from here.

206
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,680
It was troublesome for you to eat candy every time.

207
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
In the end, our Mr. Shu...

208
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
took the shop owner away...

209
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
and moved the shop to the side of the store.

210
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Of course.

211
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,680
I will get what you want for you.

212
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,680
I will take this candy.

213
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Okay.

214
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,680
But don't eat too much on weekdays.

215
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
What?

216
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Are you waiting for me?

217
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Yes.

218
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
I heard that you have been here.

219
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,680
I am here to talk about business with you.

220
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
How is Xuan Hui?

221
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I led her to the east of the city.

222
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,680
I wanted to take her back, but I didn't want her to run away.

223
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
You should be careful.

224
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Don't let her hurt the people of Chang'an.

225
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
She is injured now.

226
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
I don't think she can make any big trouble.

227
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Although Xuan Hui is a playboy,

228
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
she has tried to escape from the demon prison several times.

229
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,680
But she has never harmed the ordinary people.

230
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
This time she can leave the prison,

231
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
and she appeared at the lantern festival.

232
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
I'm afraid...

233
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,680
I'm afraid someone is helping her.

234
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,680
Someone used the thunder to help her break the prison.

235
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Only Elder Hui can do this.

236
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
I think so.

237
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
I think they have a deal.

238
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
How is Elder Hui doing?

239
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,680
He is in the prison, but he is still in the prison.

240
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,680
I have sent more people to check.

241
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,680
He made trouble several times.

242
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
He came to me.

243
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
This time I have to end it with him.

244
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
What are you going to do?

245
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I will talk to you after I finish my work.

246
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
What are you doing?

247
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
I'm looking for a patient.

248
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Where is the little boy going?

249
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Boss, you are really...

250
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
You are really...

251
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
You are really...

252
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
You are really...

253
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
You are really...

254
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
You are really...

255
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Boss is really...

256
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,680
He is working hard day and night.

257
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
What are you holding?

258
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
Master.

259
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,680
The man said he was sick and wanted to take a bath.

260
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,680
I want to send him some new clothes.

261
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
He takes a bath.

262
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,680
It's not appropriate for you to go there.

263
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
Who?

279
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
I'm sending you clean clothes.

280
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Why did you come here?

281
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Who do you want to eat?

282
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
I didn't mean that.

283
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Have you ever heard of the story of stealing clothes?

284
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
What story?

285
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,680
It's said that once there was a man who lived a hard life.

286
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
One day,

287
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,680
there was a miracle in the field of men's farming.

288
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
The miracle told him that

289
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
three days later,

290
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,680
there would be a goddess who would visit the mountain.

291
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
The man was so eager to go there.

292
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,680
He met a woman.

293
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
The woman was beautiful and extraordinary.

294
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
The man was so impressed.

295
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
So he heard the miracle.

296
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,680
He took the woman's clothes.

297
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,680
The woman found that the clothes were gone after she took a bath.

298
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
So she could only stay in the water.

299
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
The man appeared.

300
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
They met.

301
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Then the goddess stayed in the world.

302
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,680
She became the man's wife.

303
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,680
They were happy together.

304
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
How was it?

305
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Were you moved?

306
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Did you make the story by yourself?

307
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Of course not.

308
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
I wrote it in the book.

309
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,680
There is such a ridiculous story in the book.

310
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
What ridiculous?

311
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,680
The goddess would meet the man who stole her clothes.

312
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,680
The man was so beautiful.

313
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Maybe...

314
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Maybe the man was beautiful.

315
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,680
The man's character is not good.

316
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Because the man took the clothes?

317
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,680
The man didn't want to change his life.

318
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,680
He wanted to change his life by marrying his wife.

319
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,680
What would you do if it were you?

320
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,680
I only know that if she really loves the goddess,

321
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,680
she would settle everything and marry again.

322
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:41,680
She would not put the woman she loves in the same situation.

323
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,680
It sounds a little bit wrong.

324
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Maybe I remembered it wrong.

325
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,680
You are picking on me?

326
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
I am not.

327
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,680
You and I are different.

328
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,680
What is different?

329
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Are we sure to talk like this?

330
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
No.

331
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,680
It is really interesting to figure out the things about phantom ghosts.

332
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,840
Here.

333
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,120
일시legal

334
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,860
Right

335
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,120
Tim My

336
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,000
team

337
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,880
starring

338
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,260
what

339
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,280
design

340
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
You...

341
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Are you scared?

342
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,280
You are a little mortal, you should kneel down and bow to me.

343
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
You...

344
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
You can talk?

345
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Are you...

346
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Are you the Niche?

347
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
What Niche?

348
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I am the snake.

349
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Snake?

350
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Snake...

351
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,280
There is only Niche.

352
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Where am I?

353
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Why am I here?

354
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Lady Liu!

355
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Lady Liu!

356
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Lady Liu!

357
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Who spilled the water?

358
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Who spilled the water?

359
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Niche?

360
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Niche?

361
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
I am not going to die from this, am I?

362
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Niche?

363
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Niche?

364
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
I swear, I only met you by chance.

365
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
I don't know anything else.

366
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
Then you just met by chance?

367
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Why did you save me?

368
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
I can't just leave you alone.

369
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I can't just leave you alone.

370
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I can't just leave you alone.

371
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
I can't just leave you alone.

372
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
I can't just leave you alone.

373
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
I can't just leave you alone.

374
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Can't you see?

375
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
I...

376
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,280
I lost because of you.

377
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I lost because of you.

378
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
I lost because of you.

379
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
I lost because of you.

380
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
I lost because of you.

381
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
I lost because of you.

382
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
I lost because of you.

383
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Hey!

384
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,680
What's that look on your face?

385
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,960
You're not going to be able to fool me.

386
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,400
The monster is not only in the legend.

387
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,520
I've found a little monster today.

388
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,080
I'm not a little monster!

389
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,200
Is this your monster?

390
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,400
Isn't it cute?

391
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,960
You can show me one more time.

392
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,880
No, I'll take you to meet someone.

393
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
You show him.

394
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm a noble man.

395
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,560
You want me to perform for someone else?

396
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Ah?

397
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
No?

398
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,920
I'll kill you if I get hurt.

399
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,840
You're not hurt.

400
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,640
You're still a pretty good little monster.

401
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Of course.

402
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,920
If it weren't for the despicable little man,

403
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,200
I don't know what kind of heavy object he used to hit me.

404
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
How could I do that?

405
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,240
He's not a ghost.

406
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,080
I'll beat him up if I find out.

407
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,080
Do you know anything about mortals?

408
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
I really don't know.

409
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,080
Are you hungry?

410
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,440
I'll give you some more cabbage.

411
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
I don't want it.

412
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,760
I think you're a little dirty.

413
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,680
Let's go take a shower.

414
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,320
Don't touch me.

415
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,120
I won't touch you.

416
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,320
You wash it yourself.

417
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
I won't wash it either.

418
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
I don't know if the boy

419
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,520
is used to the food in Duke's Mansion.

420
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,920
I don't know if he's used to the food in Duke's Mansion.

421
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,840
But I can confirm one thing.

422
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,200
What?

423
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,840
The food in Duke's Mansion

424
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,520
is much better than your soup.

425
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
Nonsense!

426
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,280
You're the most particular about the food.

427
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,640
You can only rest your body by eating some tea and rice.

428
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,600
You're a real pig.

429
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,680
You can't eat anything.

430
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
Who are you talking about?

431
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,720
Who made the soup?

432
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,920
You're still going to hit me?

433
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,120
If I didn't see you,

434
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
I would have beaten you up.

435
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,080
What are you doing?

436
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,640
Are you going to hit me?

437
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
I can hit you ten times.

438
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,560
Are you fighting?

439
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,560
Go on.

440
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,920
He doesn't deserve it.

441
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,720
You don't deserve it.

442
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm here to send you the salary for this month.

443
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,480
You're so stingy in private.

444
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
You only get this much money every month?

445
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,320
No wonder it's the soup.

446
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,840
I...

447
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,360
I've told you a hundred times.

448
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,200
You like this...

449
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,600
Why did you eat it?

450
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,400
Maybe it's a little bit of a waste.

451
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,840
It's okay.

452
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,240
What do you mean it's okay?

453
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,240
And you.

454
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,440
If you can't stand my cooking,

455
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,800
go out and cook it yourself.

456
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,840
I'm sorry.

458
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
I'm sorry.

459
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm sorry.

460
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm sorry.

461
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
I'm sorry.

463
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
I'm sorry.

465
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,560
This must be

467
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,040
Brother Mei's cousin.

468
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
You're a twin, right?

469
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Yes.

470
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Come here.

471
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,160
I guess you two know

472
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,440
Brother Mei is at the Duke's mansion right now.

473
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,840
Of course we know.

474
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,460
When Brother Shi gets used to the

475
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,640
happiness of the Duke's mansion,

476
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,040
he might change his cook.

477
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,640
You're my cousin.

478
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
You can change your cousin?

479
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,440
You first.

480
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,040
You first.

481
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,840
It's you.

482
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,640
It doesn't matter who I change.

483
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,040
What matters now is

484
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,240
whether Brother Mei can come back.

485
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,840
He...

486
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,040
He will definitely come back.

487
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
Duke's mansion doesn't know anyone.

488
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,640
But the county magistrate knows.

489
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Look.

490
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Brother Mei is young and powerful.

491
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,240
But Duke's mansion is big.

492
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,240
And the Qinghe County magistrate

493
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,040
is a very domineering woman.

494
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,240
So...

495
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
before he got married,

496
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,840
Brother Mei was taken away from Duke's mansion.

497
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,640
Now the room is under his control.

498
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,240
Tell me,

499
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,440
is the Qinghe County magistrate

500
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,040
married into our family

501
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,840
or is he a private servant

502
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,440
who is in Duke's mansion?

503
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
So...

504
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,640
you mean...

505
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,840
My husband

506
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,040
is going to marry into Duke's mansion?

507
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Duke's Mansion

508
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,440
My brother is going to marry into Duke's mansion?

509
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Duke's Mansion

510
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,840
No!

511
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
I can't wait!

512
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,240
Where are you going?

513
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
You don't want to eat?

514
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Duke's Mansion

515
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,840
Brother!

516
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,640
Lord!

517
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
You are looking for Minister Mei?

518
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,240
Call Brother Mei out!

519
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,240
Go forward along that side.

520
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,240
The second yard is the right one.

521
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,840
Brother!

522
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,440
Lord!

523
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,440
Brother!

524
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,440
Lord!

525
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,240
Brother!

526
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
Why are you here?

527
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,440
Lord!

528
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,240
Brother!

529
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Are you hurt?

530
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Did you get hurt?

531
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Did you get hurt?

532
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,840
Don't talk nonsense.

533
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,640
Lord!

534
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,640
Do you remember me?

535
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,440
Is there anything strange?

536
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,240
Don't worry.

537
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
I'm fine.

538
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
I remember you.

539
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
It's good that you remember me.

540
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
It's good that you remember me.

541
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,040
I'm afraid that you'll hurt your head.

542
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
You're the one who hurt my head.

543
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,440
He hurt his leg.

544
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,040
I know that.

545
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,840
Lord, let me help you.

546
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,640
It hurts.

547
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
It doesn't hurt.

548
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,640
Don't talk nonsense.

549
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,040
I...

550
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,440
You haven't been home for a long time.

551
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,640
Are you reluctant to leave the imperial jade room?

552
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Or the food made by Xie Wenhua

553
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
is not delicious?

554
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,440
No.

555
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,440
It's not convenient to go out.

556
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Yes, Brother.

557
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
You can stay here.

558
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,640
Anyway, the food he made is too bad.

559
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,040
You eat so much even if it's bad.

560
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,440
Lord,

561
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,240
why don't you go to the yard and sunbathe?

562
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,640
I heard that sunbathes are good for you.

563
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,040
So, Brother,

564
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
what's going on?

565
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm afraid that the chaos of the Tiantengjie's tower

566
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
is not human.

567
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
Who is it?

568
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
What did you say?

569
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,240
Didn't you notice that night?

570
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
That night...

571
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,440
I...

572
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,040
I didn't notice anything.

573
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,240
If there is another reason behind this,

574
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
I'm afraid that you might be involved with the demon.

575
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,440
This time, you might have a chance

576
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,640
to find out where the demon is.

577
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,240
You're right.

578
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
I can't make any changes now.

579
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,640
I can only ask you to inquire about it.

580
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,440
Find out the clues of the other day.

581
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,440
Of course.

582
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
I'm good at running errands.

583
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,840
But...

584
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,840
But what?

585
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Now, the whole city knows that

586
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Senior Brother was beaten up

587
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,440
and he wants to enter the Mansion of Duke.

588
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,240
What nonsense is that?

589
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,040
I knew they were talking nonsense.

590
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,640
You and that county lord didn't do anything.

591
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,840
Senior Brother?

592
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,040
I and the county lord

593
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,840
didn't do anything either.

594
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,240
What do you mean?

595
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,840
You really took advantage of it?

596
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,640
It's my problem.

597
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
I think

598
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,840
I like him.

599
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,040
Like?

600
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
Like?

601
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,640
What kind of like?

602
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,840
A young man loves his parents.

603
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,840
A young man loves his wife.

604
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,040
What kind of like is there in this world?

605
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,840
I'm that kind of like.

606
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,640
Senior Brother, how could you be...

607
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,840
How could you be fooled by a fox?

608
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
He's not a fox.

609
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
He didn't fool me.

610
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,640
Senior Brother,

611
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,840
have you forgotten that

612
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,440
people in Changxi Palace are not allowed to fall in love?

613
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,440
I haven't forgotten.

614
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,840
Then you...

615
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,640
There won't be any result.

616
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,440
I didn't plan to marry him.

617
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
You like him

618
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,440
but you don't plan to marry him.

619
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,640
Why didn't I understand it?

620
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
You asked me

621
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,840
and I said what I wanted to say.

622
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
That's all.

623
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,040
I've been reading poems recently

624
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
and I always wrote

625
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,040
that peace can be found in the world.

626
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,240
The world is deep and never stops.

627
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Although I love my mother,

628
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,040
I'm afraid that I'll be lonely.

629
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
I just want to be a cause

630
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
and not a country.

631
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Senior Brother,

632
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,040
since I was a child,

633
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,440
you've always been like the moon to me.

634
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,840
It's hard to say, but...

635
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,040
Who doesn't want to fly to the sky for cultivation?

636
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,040
If there's such a person, it must be you.

637
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,640
You've been a coward since you were a child.

638
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,440
You're not interested in the world.

639
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,440
But this time, when I met you in Chang'an,

640
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,440
I found that

641
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,640
you're different from before.

642
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,440
Think about it.

643
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
You've started reading poems.

644
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,640
You never did anything useless before.

645
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,840
Senior Brother Qiao,

646
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,040
I don't understand.

647
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,840
Maybe it's because

648
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
it's too cold at night

649
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,040
that I want to have a light.

650
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Okay.

651
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,840
Slow down.

652
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,240
Mister,

653
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,240
then...

654
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,240
Let's go home first.

655
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,240
Don't fight after we go home.

656
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Don't worry.

657
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,640
Let's go.

658
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,440
Is it better to leave

659
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
when you're afraid of cats?

660
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,040
But I'm a cat now.

661
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,840
I can't be too cruel, right?

662
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,240
But I met someone, so I left.

663
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,440
It's too late to say it.

664
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,240
Little guy.

665
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,240
Impossible.

666
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,840
He can't see me.

667
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,640
Can't you get off?

668
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Senior Brother Qiao really fell in love with Fan Xian

669
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,040
when he came to the world.

670
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Should I tell them or not?

671
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,640
Tell them or not?

672
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,040
Tell them or not?

673
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Tell them or not?

674
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,040
Tell them or not?

675
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,040
Tell them or not?

676
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,440
Tell them or not?

677
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.

678
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
I'll give you another chance.

679
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,440
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.

680
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,440
Then there's no other way.

681
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,440
It seems that everything is destiny.

682
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,440
I can't let Senior Brother stay in Chang'an anymore.

683
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
But what should I do?

684
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,440
To be honest, I'm afraid that Senior Brother will be punished if he can't escape.

685
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
But if I don't tell him the truth...

686
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
I have an idea!

687
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Since Chang'an really has a demon,

688
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
and he's injured,

689
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,440
then I'll ask Senior Brother to let him go back to heal.

690
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
It's reasonable.

691
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Now that I can separate them,

692
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
I'm not lying.

693
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Two punches.

694
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
I'm really smart.

695
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
The song is better.

696
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
Why is he starting to forget about me again?

697
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,440
I'm not lying.

698
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Master.

699
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Hello, Elder Hui.

700
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,440
It's the cat palace.

701
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Everyone is here.

702
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
What?

703
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Is it because I'm running out of time?

704
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,440
So you came to welcome me out?

705
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,440
I know.

706
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,440
The demon was moving a few days ago.

707
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,780
I heard that the demon was escaped by the

708
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,440
mysterious ghost.

709
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Did the cat palace come for him?

710
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Are you asking me for help?

711
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Elder Hui, stop pretending.

712
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,440
You don't accept my position,

713
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,440
and you don't dare to fight with me.

714
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,440
You only dare to do something behind my back.

715
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
I forgot.

716
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,440
You are a real loser.

717
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
We've been together for a long time.

718
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,440
I've been thinking about how to end this.

719
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,440
These days, I finally understand.

720
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,440
I'll do as Elder Hui said.

721
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
The winner is the king,

722
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,440
and the loser is the loser.

723
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,440
What do you think?

724
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
The flowers are blooming and falling.

725
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,440
The autumn sun suddenly burns the heart.

726
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,440
The past is so bitter.

727
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
The candle is lit.

728
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
The sword is cut.

729
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,440
The four seasons flow by in a hurry.

730
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,440
The night rain falls.

731
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,440
The tears are falling.

732
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,440
I'll follow the stars and go far away.

733
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,440
When I look back, time has passed.

734
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,440
You are the old me who is lost.

735
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
If the plot can be rewritten,

736
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
and everything can be changed,

737
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,440
I'll wait for you for the rest of my life.

738
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
But fate breaks the seal.

739
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,440
Love is reincarnation. How can it be forgotten?

740
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,440
When the ten months turn into the sea,

741
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,440
and the past is gone,

742
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,440
the memories will never leave.

743
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,440
The persistence of not giving up

744
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:26,440
will make the years into love.

745
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
If the plot can be rewritten,

746
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
and everything can be changed,

747
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,440
I'll wait for you for the rest of my life.

748
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,440
But fate breaks the seal.

749
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,440
Love is reincarnation. How can it be forgotten?

750
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
When the ten months turn into the sea,

751
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
and the past is gone,

752
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,440
