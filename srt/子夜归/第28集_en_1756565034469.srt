1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit of a

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,320
little bit of a

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,720
little bit of a

6
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,560
little bit of a

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
little bit of a

8
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
little bit of a

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
little bit of a

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
little bit of a

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
little bit of a

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
little bit of a

13
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,900
little bit of a

14
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
little bit of a

15
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,900
little bit of the

16
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,900
little bit of the

17
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
little piece of the

18
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,620
He found a deserted house in the outskirts of the city.

19
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,420
He is cultivating and cultivating.

20
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,500
What about Changming?

21
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,940
Is there anything wrong?

22
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,820
If we can find the traces of those people,

23
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,900
it will be thanks to this Sect Leader Changming.

24
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,700
What do you mean?

25
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,820
I think it's because Sect Leader Changming is a little anxious.

26
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,260
When he secretly went out to cultivate the art of

27
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,340
transformation, he was in a bad mood.

28
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,420
That's why I found that deserted house.

29
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,860
That's right.

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,820
Elder Hui is really as good as ever.

31
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,220
He is smart and capable.

32
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,740
People often talk about me as a rat.

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,540
They often insult me.

34
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,820
But only rats are fearless and fearless.

35
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,380
They are everywhere.

36
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,620
Since ancient times, there have been seven dragons and phoenixes.

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,620
In the end, only we are hard to forget.

38
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,860
You are indeed a great master.

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,660
Elder Hui's words are always so deceiving.

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,260
In the past, Mr. Shu would never stand on my side.

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,740
It seems that my ability to deceive people is still not as good as a cat.

42
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,660
You can also compare with him.

43
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,460
All right.

44
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,060
Then leave.

45
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,660
Don't let anyone find out.

46
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,460
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,060
I thought about it.

48
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,260
Although the demon world has been waiting for those angels and gods,

49
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,780
there must be a book in the hundred secrets.

50
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,740
What do you mean?

51
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,860
Actually, there is another angel in the city.

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,020
The signs are suspicious.

53
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,060
And this person is your old acquaintance.

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,060
Shuang Jiang?

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,460
I'm hungry.

56
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,320
Hungry to death.

57
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,660
My prepared soul.

58
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,500
Senior, let me do the allocated food these days.

59
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Where is the Sect Leader?

60
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
I can't find him.

61
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,260
He was around here yesterday.

62
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,260
I... I... I...

63
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,260
I'll go out and look for the Sect Leader.

64
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
I'll go out and look for the Sect Leader.

65
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
I'll go out and look for the Sect Leader.

66
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
No, no, no.

67
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,260
I'll go out and look for the Sect Leader.

68
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Princess,

69
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
it's really dangerous here.

70
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,260
If the Sect Leader finds us,

71
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
something big is going to happen.

72
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,260
Especially my Senior Brother.

73
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
He will never show mercy to the demons.

74
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,260
You know I'm a demon?

75
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
I guess so.

76
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,260
When did you know?

77
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
I... I...

78
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,260
I was sure it was the time I caught the dream demon.

79
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,260
You were there that night.

80
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
That's not important.

81
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,260
Anyway, get out of here.

82
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
I've been practicing for a hundred years.

83
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,260
I was fooled by you, a half-hearted angel.

84
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
I'm not.

85
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Then tell me,

86
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,260
what are you doing in Chang'an?

87
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
Go.

88
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
Senior Brother.

89
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,260
The demon-dealing in Changxi Palace

90
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
is a matter of course.

91
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,260
Senior Brother.

92
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Shuang Jiang,

93
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,260
when did you get mixed up with these demons?

94
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,260
I...

95
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
Changxi Palace?

96
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
You really are from Changxi Palace.

97
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
I...

98
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
You're a little fool.

99
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
Sect Leader!

100
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
He's my best friend.

101
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Please forgive me.

102
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,260
How dare you!

103
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
You're a fool to be fooled by the demon.

104
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,260
Get out of the way.

105
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
Even if I die today,

106
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
I'll get rid of the demons.

107
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,260
Shuang Jiang,

108
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
you're really a bad guy.

109
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,260
But stupid things have the benefits of stupid things.

110
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,260
As long as it can help me achieve my goal.

111
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,260
The Demon King's Palace

112
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Brother Mei, what are you looking at?

113
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
The weather is bad today.

114
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,260
I heard it will rain these days.

115
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Brother Mei doesn't like thunder and rain?

116
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
There's nothing to like.

117
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
After all, thunder is useful.

118
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
I mean,

119
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
the sky was clear last night.

120
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
I'm afraid there's a demon.

121
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
A demon?

122
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Two times thunder,

123
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
once I was fooled by the demon,

124
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
once Brother Mei saw the demon blood,

125
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
this barrier must be related to thunder.

126
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Useful?

127
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
I've only heard of rain,

128
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
not thunder.

129
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
Brother Mei's preference is really unique.

130
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
If you're done with your work,

131
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
go back early.

132
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
The Demon King's Palace

133
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,260
The Demon King's Palace

134
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
The Demon King's Palace

135
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,260
The Demon King's Palace

136
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
The Demon King's Palace

137
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,260
The Demon King's Palace

138
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
The Demon King's Palace

139
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,260
The Demon King's Palace

140
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
The Demon King's Palace

141
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,260
The Demon King's Palace

142
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
The Demon King's Palace

143
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,260
The Demon King's Palace

144
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Why is it a group of souls?

145
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,260
The demon blood is so familiar.

146
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,260
It's so familiar.

147
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
The demon blood is so familiar.

148
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,260
It's so familiar.

149
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
It's so familiar.

150
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
It's so familiar.

151
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,260
It's so familiar.

152
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,260
It's so familiar.

153
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
It's so familiar.

154
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
It's so familiar.

155
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
It's so familiar.

156
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
It's so familiar.

157
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
It's so familiar.

158
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
It's so familiar.

159
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,260
It's so familiar.

160
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
It's so familiar.

161
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,260
It's so familiar.

162
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,260
It's so familiar.

163
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
It's so familiar.

164
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
It's so familiar.

165
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
It's so familiar.

166
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
let's cancel the plan

167
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
It's impossible

168
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,980
You will stay with two evils

169
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,660
If there is a coaster,

170
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,540
we can flog them

171
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,980
What are you going to do

172
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,900
Your little δend空

173
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,660
in class

174
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,740
come with me

175
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,220
You'll be safe

176
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,260
I'm fine.

177
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Lady Huzhu, don't die tonight.

178
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
I only have a gun to save you.

179
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
You...

180
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
The two generals fell off the cliff?

181
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
That's right.

182
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
Yesterday, he let go of his luggage and went out to find the door.

183
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,260
The eagle revealed its whereabouts and provoked the fox demon.

184
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
Fox demon?

185
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,260
It is said that the fox demon is very powerful and cunning.

186
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,260
The leader arrived in time and injured him.

187
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,260
The leader wanted to catch the demon, but he didn't expect the two generals to be so rebellious.

188
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,260
He even asked the leader for a demon.

189
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,260
He said that the demon was his best friend.

190
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260
But the demon didn't appreciate it at all.

191
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,260
He knew he couldn't escape, so he pulled the two generals together.

192
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Speaking of which,

193
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,260
I was the one who was careless.

194
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,260
I was too rude to the brothers.

195
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,260
I let you experience the world and couldn't stop the temptation.

196
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,260
That's why I've been so rude.

197
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,260
It was indeed the leader's negligence.

198
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,260
The leader shouldn't have left the formation before the fire was put out.

199
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,260
You're blaming me for revealing the whereabouts and provoking the fox demon?

200
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,260
I'm going to find the two generals now.

201
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,260
Please don't act rashly.

202
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,260
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,260
Lady Huzhu. Lady Huzhu.

204
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
Lady Huzhu.

205
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,260
How dare you hit me?

206
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:37,360
You're already injured like this. Why are you still so

207
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,260
I didn't think so much at the time.

208
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,260
I'm afraid you'll die.

209
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Afraid of me dying?

210
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,260
I'm a demon. You're an angel.

211
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
You won't kill me?

212
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,260
I'll just kill you.

213
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
I hurt you.

214
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,260
I'm so angry.

215
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,260
The fox demon has a liver.

216
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,260
I was in a hurry and didn't prepare.

217
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,260
I only have this fox cake.

218
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,260
Give it to you.

219
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
Don't worry. It's not poisonous.

220
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
I'm an angel after all.

221
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,260
I can't treat you like a wounded demon.

222
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,260
I'm also hungry.

223
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,260
I'm going to kill you.

224
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,260
I'm going to kill you.

225
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,260
I'm going to kill you.

226
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,260
I'm going to kill you.

227
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,260
I'm going to kill you.

228
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,260
I'm going to kill you.

229
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm going to kill you.

230
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,260
I'm going to kill you.

231
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,260
I'm going to kill you.

232
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,260
You're going to kill yourself.

233
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,260
You know I am so happy.

234
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,260
Mr. Changxi has rules about him.

235
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
Even if we have known each other a long time,

236
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,260
But this time in Chang'an,

237
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
I'll definitely publicize it.

238
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,260
I cannot break the regiment's rule.

239
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
You say so much.

240
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,260
esquad sold my body and took me back for your body and

241
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
They should also be over at fifty-액

242
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,260
You are the fox demon?

243
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,260
Then my sister-in-law...

244
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,260
Then the fifth wife...

245
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Is she also the fox demon?

246
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,260
No!

247
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,260
She is not the fox demon!

248
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Really?

249
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Then you swear?

250
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,260
I swear by my cultivation

251
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,260
She is definitely not the fox demon!

252
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
That's good!

253
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
I was scared to death!

254
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,260
Since you are from Changxi Palace

255
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,260
Then is Mr. Mei also an angel from Changxi Palace?

256
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
She...

257
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
No!

258
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,260
Cultivators don't talk nonsense!

259
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,260
Do you really mean it?

260
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
Yes! I swear!

261
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
There are ten angels from Changxi Palace

262
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
No one noticed!

263
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
Come out!

264
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
What do you want to do today?

265
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,260
Where...

266
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
Where did she go?

267
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
The second wife

268
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
If you go any further

269
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
You will reach Chang'an

270
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,260
Twins

271
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,260
While I am injured

272
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,260
I can't use my strength to fight back

273
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,260
If you want to take me

274
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,260
Now is the best time

275
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Steamed cake!

276
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,260
Delicious steamed cake!

277
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,260
One of a kind steamed cake!

278
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,260
Steamed cake?

279
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Two of you, some steamed cake?

280
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
Two steamed cakes

281
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Okay!

282
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
One, two!

283
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Two cakes, two cents

284
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
Big brother

285
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
This steamed cake

286
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Give it to us

287
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,260
We don't have money

288
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
No money?

289
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
What cake do you eat with money?

290
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Wait!

291
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
What?

292
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,260
Thank you, this beautiful little lady

293
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
Take your time

294
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,260
Eat well

295
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Lady Huzhu

296
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
You helped me

297
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,260
I don't dare to forget

298
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
But you are a demon

299
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
I am an angel

300
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
So

301
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
I have an idea

302
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
I guard ten trees

303
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,260
You can leave by yourself

304
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
But if you count

305
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
I will see you again

306
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
I have to report to the palace

307
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
You mean it?

308
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
You really let me go?

309
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,260
Yes

310
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Okay

311
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,260
Do as you say

312
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:28,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

313
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
Six

314
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,260
Seven

315
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Eight

316
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Nine

317
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,260
Oh no

318
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,260
I can't stand it anymore

319
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,260
Oh no

320
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,260
I can't stand it anymore

321
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Oh no

322
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
Lady Huzhu

323
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
It's noon

324
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,260
Don't forget what day it is

325
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
I can't

326
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
It's the 10th of October

327
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
My husband's birthday

328
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Did you prepare everything?

329
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Don't worry

330
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
I won't make any mistake

331
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
on such an important day

332
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,260
My lord

333
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
I have put the birthday gift

334
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,260
from the Duke in the kitchen

335
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
Okay

336
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
Brother Mei

337
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,260
Something happened

338
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
This way

339
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
What?

340
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
I shouldn't have disturbed you

341
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
Tell me

342
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
A wolf escaped from the city

343
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,260
It almost hurt the passersby

344
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,260
Now it is missing

345
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,260
The government is afraid it will hurt people again

346
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
So they sent a message

347
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,260
to all departments to catch the wolf

348
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Wolf?

349
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Yes

350
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
I heard that the wolf was small

351
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
but fierce

352
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,260
and had a big tail

353
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
A big tail

354
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
It looks more like

355
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
a fox

356
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Let's go

357
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Let's go and help

358
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Okay

359
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
The wolf is here

360
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Mr. Mei is here too

361
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
I know that the whole city is looking for the wolf

362
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
I came to help

363
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
That's great

364
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
We have searched eight streets

365
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
but we didn't find the wolf

366
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,260
I don't know where it went

367
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
Where is Mr. Mei going to look for it?

368
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
Liuxiang

369
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
Let's go

370
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Let's go

371
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
What happened to him?

372
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,500
The fox must have found the

373
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,260
landscape of the angels

374
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
and was hurt like this

375
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,260
It's too late to bring back the key

376
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
We can only treat it on the spot

377
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,260
Search

378
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,260
Let's go

379
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Let's go

380
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
Let's go

381
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
I'm the second

382
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,260
Why are you here?

383
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,260
I came to do something

384
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
But you

385
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,260
The people in the city

386
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,260
are going to surpass the Ruyi Tower

387
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
It's official business

388
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,260
There is a bad wolf in the city

389
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
I'm afraid it will hurt people

390
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,260
I'm searching with my family

391
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
It's a fox

392
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Ask the witness

393
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
The hair is thick and big

394
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,260
The wolf looks more like a fox

395
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I didn't see the wolf or the fox in the room

396
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Well

397
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260
I believe everything you said

398
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,260
How about we go somewhere else

399
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
and look for it

400
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
Just in case

401
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
it's better to check

402
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
You don't believe me

403
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
I really don't

404
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Are you really okay?

405
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
No

406
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
It's my birthday today

407
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
I'm waiting for you at home

408
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
The master of Qinghe County

409
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,260
is a man from Ruyi Tower

410
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Master

411
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
Go to work

412
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
Go

413
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
You play these tricks

414
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,260
Don't you feel ashamed?

415
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
I never feel ashamed

416
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,260
to like you

417
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Is Mei Zhuyu really worth it?

418
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,260
Guess

419
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Why did she come in so stubbornly?

420
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
The wolf is coming in

421
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
I'm worried

422
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Worried?

423
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,260
Have you really never been suspicious?

424
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,260
Little fox

425
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
Boss

426
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,260
Zhuangqiang

427
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,260
Zhuangqiang and they are the same

428
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,260
I went to the city wall with them

429
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
There are five of them

430
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,260
It should be covered with a formation

431
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,260
These days, there is no Zongyi

432
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
They are not ordinary people

433
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Changxi Palace

434
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
If it's really Changxi Palace when Huo Zhen is driving

435
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Then the so-called Shige

436
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,260
That Shuangqiang swear

437
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
Said they were the tenth brother

438
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
There is no Meilangjun

439
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,260
If there is a connection

440
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,260
in the plan of the boss

441
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,260
Should not be neglected

442
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,260
I'm afraid this good view

443
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
May not last long

444
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,260
I'm afraid this good view

445
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
May not last long

446
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,260
Meisishi

447
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
What's wrong with Meisishi?

448
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
I do not know

449
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Shige

450
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
What's wrong with Meisishi?

451
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
I do not know

452
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
Shige

453
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
Shuangqiang

454
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
I thought I would not see you again

455
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
What's wrong with you?

456
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Nothing

457
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Just hungry

458
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
Get up

459
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Slowly

460
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
What the hell is going on?

461
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
You escaped from the fox demon

462
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
Not

463
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,260
I was the one who escaped from it

464
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,260
So the fox demon is really a fox demon

465
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Such a fox demon

466
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
In the capital of Chang'an

467
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
But never found

468
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,260
It seems that there are a lot of demons in this demon world

469
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
The demon behind the demon

470
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Maybe it's been hiding around us

471
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Hiding around

472
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
I'm not a demon

473
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
But Shige, don't worry

474
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Your left and right are harmless

475
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
Today I asked

476
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
The fox demon woman sent a picture to say

477
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Your wife is definitely not a fox demon

478
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,260
She knew you were from Changxi Palace

479
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
But never killed you

480
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,260
How could she kill me?

481
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
She wanted my life

482
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,260
But the chief was cruel

483
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Today I am separated from the fox demon woman

484
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
I felt the chief's spirit

485
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Still in her body

486
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,260
I don't know how the fox demon woman is

487
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
Spirit

488
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
Why did it stop for so long?

489
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,260
It's a demon-hunting talisman

490
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
The chief

491
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
Chief

492
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Gu Sishuang

493
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
Is it you?

494
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Yes

495
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
It's been this time

496
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,260
The door of Ruyi House is still closed

497
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
This is the first time

498
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
You didn't hear

499
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
The fox shopkeeper of Ruyi House

500
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
I'm afraid I offended someone

501
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,260
There are a lot of gold guards here in the daytime

502
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Who told you?

503
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
All beautiful ladies

504
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Who can you offend in the daytime?

505
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,260
You don't believe it?

506
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,260
If so

507
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,260
I'll take this lady

508
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Can't be bullied

509
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
You

510
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
What's wrong with me?

511
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,260
You drink tea

512
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Take a good look at you

513
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,260
Chief

514
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
The fox demon woman

515
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
The fox demon woman

516
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
The fox demon woman

517
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,260
It's all my fault

518
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
If I had taken you earlier

519
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,260
I wouldn't have suffered this kind of pain

520
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
This book

521
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,260
Where do you think it's hidden?

522
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,260
I don't know

523
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Do you think something is wrong?

524
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
No

525
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
I'm just afraid that she's dead

526
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
There is a plan to love the chief

527
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
How?

528
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,260
I really thought I lacked you

529
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,260
We can't enter the demon room by ourselves

530
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
So did she say it?

531
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,260
No

532
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,260
It doesn't matter if you don't say it

533
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,260
The more she doesn't say

534
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,260
The more helpful it is to us

535
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
What do you mean?

536
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
The tighter the mouth

537
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
The more it can prove

538
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Her position in the demon room is very important

539
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,260
With such a good bait

540
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Are you afraid you can't catch a big fish?

541
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,260
The fox demon woman

542
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
She's here

543
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
Ready

544
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Didn't the fox demon woman tell you?

545
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
This hall

546
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
Look

547
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
The more lights you light

548
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,260
The more you can see clearly

549
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
Who are you?

550
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
What?

551
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
You came here

552
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,260
But you don't know who I am

553
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,260
There are little officials in this hall

554
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
You don't look so good

555
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
You're annoying

556
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
Tell her to come out

557
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
Don't be so arrogant

558
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
I'm looking for my own husband

559
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
What attitude do you have?

560
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
Husband?

561
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,260
My husband is not going home to celebrate his birthday today

562
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,260
Instead, he came to this Ruyi Tower to have fun

563
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I'm naturally here to catch the spy

564
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,260
Wait

565
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,260
Your husband is?

566
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,260
Mei Zhuyu

567
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
This is the woman you married

568
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Yes

569
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
You are the master of Qinghe County

570
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,260
Yes

571
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
I've heard about it before

572
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
Husband

573
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,260
Who are they?

574
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,260
I have some friends in Quzhou

575
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
Our brothers just came to Chang'an

576
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,260
No knowledge

577
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260
So we played two days in the Ruyi Tower

578
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,260
The Ruyi Tower is a place for fun

579
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,260
But it's dark and fire inside

580
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,260
You don't eat and drink

581
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
It's fresh

582
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,260
If you're done, can I take him away?

583
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,260
Master

584
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
By the way

585
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,260
I didn't know you were coming

586
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,260
If you know

587
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Today is a good day

588
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,260
I'll ask you to go home

589
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
You're welcome

590
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,260
It's a good thing

591
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,260
You are our guests

592
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,260
You should be happy

593
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,260
