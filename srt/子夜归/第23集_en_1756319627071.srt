00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of a

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
little bit of a

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of a

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
little bit of a

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
little bit of a

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit of a

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
good

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
place

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
good

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
place

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
like

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I don't want to abandon the mission and responsibility of the Heavens.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I still have the desire to kill demons and bring back the blood.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But I have someone I care about to protect me.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Shi Shi...

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Zhu Yu, don't worry.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Master said that Senior Brother is a righteous person.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think for Chang Xi Jian, you are the most suitable.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then I'll leave it to you.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Although you have left the house, you still came from Chang Xi Palace.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Before you leave, you must leave the house.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
After you leave this gate, you must not mention the lies of Chang Xi Palace.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay. I will leave.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will never reveal the truth about Chang Xi Palace.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Otherwise, you will never be able to get what you love.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Otherwise, you will never be able to get what you love.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Congratulations on your wish.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's all over.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's go.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll send him off.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No need.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Shuang Jiang, go back.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll send him off.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wei Ying, he can't beat you right now.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't worry. I just drove him out.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will kill him.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll send you off.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Go back to Chang An.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Second Brother, Su Hao is a horse except for martial arts.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How can you give me the horse you love?

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just hope that you can walk faster and never come back.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We are not familiar with each other since we were young.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I hope that you can walk faster and never come back.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We are not familiar with each other since we were young.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why did you come to Chang Xi Palace?

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know why you came to Chang Xi Palace.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I came here to practice.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How can a place of practice give birth to a life of no one?

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The wind blows through my eyes.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
My heart aches.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The wind brings tears and rain.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Xiao Shi, why are you here?

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I have something to ask you.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go ahead.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You have all written your names for the nine brothers.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Only I use the common name.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I heard from the five brothers that I am different from them.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I am not a disciple of your master.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I am not a real person of Chang Xi Palace.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
May I ask if this is true?

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This...

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It seems to be true.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why didn't you give me my name?

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Xiao Shi, don't misunderstand.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I didn't give you my name because I was too stubborn.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I know that one day you will leave Chang Xi Palace.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Master doesn't want to keep me.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's because Chang Xi Palace can't keep you.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You have a strong obsession in your heart.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You have an unfinished fate.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What master can do is to help you and help you achieve it.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You will eventually be able to achieve it.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There is no one in this world who is not greedy.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
All your brothers want is Chang Xi Palace.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But you are not here.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I am not here.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I am not here.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I am not here.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I am not here.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I am not here.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I am not here.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I am not here.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I am not here.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am not here.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I am not here.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I am not here.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I am not here.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I am not here.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I am not here.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For this moment I am in fireworks.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Looking for you.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It seems that some things, some people,

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
will finally come to their senses.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Benefactor, it's really you.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're finally willing to see me.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Benefactor, help me.

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
How can I help you?

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Teach me the magic.

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I still have my left eye, my hand, and my foot.

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Benefactor, I can still practice the art of suppressing the holy.

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can still do more for you.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You couldn't even do this little thing before,

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and you still want me to teach you.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Isn't it a waste of my time?

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I've already put Mo Yao in Chang'an,

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and completed the task you asked me to do.

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But I didn't expect to change.

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I've tried my best.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I hope you can understand.

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But what I want is to create a public opinion about the chaos in Chang'an.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can take people to Chang'an with a clear conscience.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I've already done what you asked.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If you didn't harass that damn guy outside Chang'an,

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
how could he not listen to my orders

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and still stay in Chang'an and watch you die?

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Black Chicken Rooster, you ruined my big event.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You still have the nerve to come to me?

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I...

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Stupid guy.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You don't deserve to be treated like this.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Benefactor.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Benefactor, you can't cross the bridge.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Mr. Pei, you can't blame me.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can only blame yourself.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't even understand such a small thing.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I didn't kill you to show my mercy.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Now that you've lost your eyes,

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
your evil powers have been destroyed.

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Just leave.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't come back.

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No!

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Master Changming, you promised me that you would help me become stronger.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you don't help me,

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll go find other angels in Changxi Palace.

167
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
By then, if I say something I shouldn't say,

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
your master...

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Fine.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Since you want to die,

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll pretend that I didn't save you before.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're an angel.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I gave you so many benefits.

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So what?

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Useless.

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll kill you.

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's you.

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Long time no see, Mr. Pei.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You killed Xiao Wu and Xiao Zhen?

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That kind of person is worthy of being called by his name.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I knew you would come to teach you evil.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I didn't expect that Mr. Pei would be so good at it.

183
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I didn't expect that you would come to teach me evil.

185
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I waited for you here for so many days,

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but you didn't show up.

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Not only you, but I was worried about you too.

188
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You've made up your mind.

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What do you want?

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't want anything.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Since I found the person behind it,

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
it's useless to keep you.

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll kill you.

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You...

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You'll kill me?

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Look.

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You look better in this way.

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Even if you keep acting like this,

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
has your cousin ever looked at you?

200
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No wonder you were so nervous that day.

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you're loyal to your cousin,

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
then go and kill Mei Zhu Yu.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm not your opponent.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Even if you kill me, you won't get her.

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I want to kill you not because you like her,

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
but because you dare to use your incense to trick her.

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I won't allow such a lowly person to appear before her again.

208
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What are you laughing at?

209
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I thought I was a mortal.

210
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I've tried my best and got nothing.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's funny enough.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But I didn't expect that someone else is even funnier than me.

213
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What do you mean?

214
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Even though you're powerful,

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
you still can't win her heart.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You only find excuses to use me to find out.

217
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're worse than me.

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm funny, but you're ridiculous.

219
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I laugh at myself more than you.

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
How dare you compare me to you?

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm born with no body.

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
People only laugh at me when they're alive.

223
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's boring.

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Forget it.

225
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
People say that the one who's about to die is good at talking.

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I have something to tell you.

227
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Tell me?

228
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Tell me what?

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I want to tell you not to learn from me.

230
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
People struggle for life.

231
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But if they're full of tricks and too greedy,

232
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
they'll only get what they want.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
They lose their body, conscience, and loved ones.

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
They lose themselves.

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You thought you won me.

236
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But you're worse than me.

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Nonsense.

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You're not only not loved by your cousin,

239
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but you're more tough.

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Shut up!

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If I have to live,

242
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'd rather not be involved in it.

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm a man of my own.

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not disturbed by my own mistakes.

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm a man of my own.

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm a man of my own.

247
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm a man of my own.

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm a man of my own.

249
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm a man of my own.

250
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Who do you think I am?

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Is someone here to turn a blind eye?

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Where I belong?

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How stubborn of me!

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,280
That won't do.

255
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
I'm the best at head-to-head.

256
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,960
My cousin just learned it.

257
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
I have to beat her.

258
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,240
No.

259
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,680
Cousin, you're so strong.

260
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,720
It's tiring to be so serious.

261
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,160
Why do you have to win every time?

262
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Episode 15

263
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Now that I think about it,

264
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
what my cousin said is right.

265
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,280
It's normal and simple.

266
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,000
It's good.

267
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm different from you.

268
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,760
So what if I get her?

269
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,920
What I want

270
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,400
is her eternal love.

271
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,080
Only she and I.

272
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,560
R brackets

273
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,760
uff a seller said he wanted the best goods at the store,

274
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,520
but he already is late?

275
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,480
These are the best products sold in my village.

276
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,520
You've really been late.

277
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,400
So it seems Mo

278
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,840
must arrive in the capital as soon as possible.

279
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,200
So he is Iife.

280
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
Ha ha ha.

281
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,260
Sh уж

282
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,120
Heh, Làniangzi.

283
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,020
Ha ha ha.

284
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,540
Ha ha!

285
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:33,880
The problem is that

286
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,900
I heard about the hurtHa ha ha,

287
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,380
that's why you rund away with such a man.

288
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,600
Then I thought

289
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,840
you really should have said you love me

290
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,020
I'm from the 2nd district.

291
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,020
I heard that Mr. Mei just ran from his marriage.

292
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,640
I haven't met anyone for over a month,

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,060
I am afraid to death I am with our Qinhao как่ Alrighty ha ha

294
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,940
It's not better to choose this little Marquis.

295
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,140
That's right.

296
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,940
Little Marquis.

297
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,940
Little Marquis, why don't you go to Qin Garden again?

298
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,980
Okay. The little Marquis wants to be mentioned again.

299
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,900
You... Who are you?

300
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,100
Let go of me! Let go!

301
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Let go of me!

302
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Little Marquis.

303
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
This is... This is the husband of the Mei family.

304
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
That's right.

305
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,100
He is the Minister of the Plough Department, Minister Mei.

306
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Everyone, returning to Chang'an is my fault.

307
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,100
It doesn't matter what you think of me.

308
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,100
But you can't talk about my second wife.

309
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
You dare to offend me? You're not afraid of me?

310
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
I'm not afraid.

311
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
You're not afraid of me?

312
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
I'm not afraid of you.

313
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,100
If you don't accept, you can go to the prison and tell the world.

314
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,100
I only know that there are no men in this world who can't protect their wives.

315
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Their wives?

316
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
They are getting married.

317
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,100
It seems that they have a good relationship.

318
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,100
My wife, I met some problems on the way.

319
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
I came back late.

320
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I...

321
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
I'm late.

322
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
My wife.

323
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Are you crazy?

324
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
I have something to tell you.

325
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Go.

326
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Go.

327
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Lady Le, you're back.

328
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Wen Hua, go buy something.

329
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,100
I've already bought it. We don't need anything.

330
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,100
I'll buy it. I'll buy more. I won't bother you.

331
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,100
I was in a hurry. I didn't hurt you, right?

332
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,100
I'm sorry. I came back late.

333
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Do you have a girlfriend in Quzhou?

334
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
What?

335
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,100
It won't take so many days to go back to Quzhou.

336
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,100
You may have a girlfriend in Quzhou.

337
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,100
You may have a girlfriend in Quzhou.

338
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
You need to go back and explain to her.

339
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
But she won't let you go.

340
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Are you making up stories?

341
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,100
It sounds reasonable. I've already told her.

342
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,100
I swear that there are no other women except you.

343
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Really?

344
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
Then why did you come back?

345
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,100
I was in a hurry. I was late for a few days.

346
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Come with me.

348
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
This is your parents?

349
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,100
My mother was in trouble when she was 16.

350
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Fortunately, my father saved her.

351
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,100
She loved her parents, but her family didn't recognize her.

352
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,100
They thought that my father was just a small businessman.

353
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,100
I've heard about this from Xiaosi.

354
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,100
My mother and father ran away.

355
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,100
So they had me and my family.

356
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,100
We three lived a normal life.

357
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
Until 18 years ago.

358
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,100
The world was in chaos. My parents died.

359
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,100
The Meis sent me to Quzhou.

360
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,100
I didn't want to live in the summer.

361
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,100
I didn't want to be cold in the winter.

362
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Even if I was lucky to be taken in by my master.

363
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Even if I saw the prosperity of Chang'an.

364
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:54,100
But I still had no desire for anything in this world.

365
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,100
I was afraid that I would die.

366
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Meizhu Yu.

367
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,100
I thought I would be out of the world forever.

368
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
I met you.

369
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,100
You brought me up.

370
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
You are so good.

371
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
How am I good?

372
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:39,100
You are the bravest, strongest and most different woman I've ever seen.

373
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,100
You are the bravest, strongest and most different woman I've ever seen.

374
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,100
You are even more important than many other men I've ever seen.

375
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:56,100
I think we are not a perfect match.

376
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,100
I'm cold and I'm not liked by others.

377
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,100
But now I'm lucky to meet you.

378
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Then let me be the witness.

379
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
I'm truly asking for it.

380
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,100
I'm willing to be with you forever.

381
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Wuzhen.

382
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Are you willing to?

383
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:31,100
The fireworks in the world are falling.

384
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,100
The old dream is burning.

385
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,100
You and your husband have been married.

386
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Why do you still ask?

387
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Because of the imperial decree.

388
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
It's not as important as what you want.

389
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,100
The night is silent.

390
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,100
You are so beautiful.

391
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm so cool and naughty.

392
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
We are so different.

393
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
Aren't we a perfect match?

394
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,100
From now on, I'm here.

395
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
You can continue to be a good woman.

396
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
No fear, no fear.

397
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,100
No matter what you want,

398
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
you are free.

399
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Just a little.

400
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
Maybe you want to be happy day by day.

401
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
I can't.

402
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,100
You are the one who made me hot.

403
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
You made me greedy.

404
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
You made me love Hong Chen.

405
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Wuzhen.

406
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Even if one day, you lose your interest,

407
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
you are bored,

408
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
bored, bored.

409
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
You can't leave me.

410
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Otherwise...

411
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Otherwise what?

412
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Life is short.

413
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
I won't let go.

414
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
I won't let go.

415
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
I won't let go.

416
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
I won't let go.

417
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
I won't let go.

418
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
I won't let go.

419
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
I won't let go.

420
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
I won't let go.

421
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
I won't let go.

422
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
I won't let go.

423
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
I won't let go.

424
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
I won't let go.

425
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
I won't let go.

426
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
I won't let go.

427
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,100
I won't let go.

428
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,100
I won't let go.

429
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,100
I won't let go.

430
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Tang Di and Erniangzi are getting closer.

431
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
Yes.

432
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
Such a good husband.

433
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Don't scare her away.

434
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Looking at the future,

435
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
I will be a nanny.

436
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
I will be an aunt.

437
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
An aunt?

438
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Erni, you should at least take one step.

439
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
If you have a boy,

440
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
you should be a fairy.

441
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
If you have a girl,

442
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
you should be a good girl.

443
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
But they say,

444
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
a girl should be a woman,

445
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
and a boy should be a mother.

446
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
What if...

447
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,100
I have a few little boy like Zhen?

448
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
You call us here

449
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
to talk about this?

450
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Having a son and a daughter

451
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
is a big deal.

452
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Zhen, you are getting married.

453
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
You can't be so willful.

454
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,100
I think,

455
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
we should talk about the child.

456
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Why don't we see

457
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
if we should give her a big house?

458
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Your Majesty.

459
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,100
I have a question.

460
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
What is it?

461
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,100
What is it?

462
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Your Majesty,

463
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,100
we should focus on the big picture.

464
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Our father and sister

465
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
have nothing to do.

466
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
They don't have any work.

467
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,100
They just want a house.

468
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
All right.

469
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
It's getting harder to serve them now.

470
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
But,

471
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Mr. Mei's house is indeed...

472
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
the one that is in the Prime Minister's mansion.

473
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
Do you mind, Mr. Mei?

474
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm afraid that

475
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
someone will point out that

476
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
it's a crime.

477
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
It's all right.

478
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,100
As long as she likes it,

479
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
it's fine to live anywhere.

480
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
As for what others think,

481
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
I don't care.

482
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
I care?

483
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
We are just two people.

484
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Why should we live in such a big house?

485
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
And we are being controlled by others.

486
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
I think

487
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
the house is good.

488
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,100
She is the most difficult to serve.

489
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
The second lady is so beautiful.

490
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,100
Of course, she is a little bit expensive.

491
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
Brother,

492
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
you should be more responsible.

493
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
No need to be responsible.

494
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
She is very good.

495
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I think

496
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
we should

497
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
hold a good day

498
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
and get the wedding done.

499
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
We can't let

500
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
these two lovers

501
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,100
wait for so long.

502
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Mr. Mei,

503
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
why don't you accompany me

504
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
to enjoy the view of the Imperial College?

505
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Go ahead.

506
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,100
Aren't you going with us?

507
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
I'm not going.

508
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Nothing bad will happen.

509
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Do you know

510
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
why I asked you to come out?

511
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
Because the Empress

512
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
is worried about the Fifth Lady.

513
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,100
Mr. Mei,

514
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Zhen'er and I

515
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
have been walking

516
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
from the Ghost Gate for a long time.

517
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
You mean

518
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
18 years ago?

519
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
There is a little butterfly.

520
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
There is a candy shop.

521
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
I want to eat candy.

522
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Okay.

523
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
Madam,

524
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
I want to buy a candy.

525
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Okay, please.

526
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Fire!

527
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Why is there

528
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
a fire in the winter?

529
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Madam!

530
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
Madam!

531
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
Madam!

532
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Madam!

533
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Madam!

534
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Madam!

535
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
That's right.

536
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
She has been weak and sick since she was a child.

537
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
18 years ago,

538
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
on the first day of the new year,

539
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
she was in great trouble.

540
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Fortunately, the heavens were kind to her,

541
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
and her body was able to recover.

542
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
She was healthy

543
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
with her body,

544
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
but her personality

545
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
was very different.

546
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
She was a very

547
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
arrogant and arrogant person.

548
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
In my opinion,

549
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
she had some

550
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
hidden feelings.

551
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Even my father

552
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
couldn't understand it.

553
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
Do you think

554
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,100
she has a heart problem?

555
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
I don't know.

556
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
These years,

557
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
she has been coming home from the camp

558
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
with a lot of worries.

559
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Sometimes,

560
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
she even got injured.

561
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
This is

562
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,100
why she never said anything.

563
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,100
I know that

564
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
I was strict with her.

565
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,100
In fact,

566
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
I wanted to use this method

567
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
to make her live better.

568
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Your Highness,

569
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
I am far from Wuzhen.

570
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
I believe that she is not

571
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
like what others say,

572
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
cold and cold.

573
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
She is kind,

574
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
smart and brave.

575
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,100
She is the most

576
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
lively and bright person

577
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
I have ever seen.

578
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
It is my pleasure to be with her.

579
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
That's great.

580
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,100
This marriage

581
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
is in her heart.

582
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
My father and I

583
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
are relieved.

584
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
My mother died early in the family.

585
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,100
But

586
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
my father

587
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
is still the same.

588
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
He has a deep heart.

589
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I have never changed

590
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
in my life.

591
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Mr. Mei,

592
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
I only have one sister.

593
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
From now on,

594
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
I will entrust her to you.

595
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
I hope

596
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
you can solve her problems.

597
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
After death,

598
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
only peace

599
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
and joy.

600
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
I will not give up

601
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100
no matter what.

602
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,100
It's getting late.

603
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Go and find Zhen.

604
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Yes.

605
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Father,

606
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
you can rest assured now.

607
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
An exemplary woman

608
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
sucks three times

609
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
in the middle.

610
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
No one will find her.

611
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Now

612
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
An exemplary woman

613
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:06,660
For a

614
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,420
A

615
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:40,660
Hmm.

616
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,660
It's hard for Lord Ying to remember.

617
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,660
We both have lived in the world for our whole lives.

618
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,660
If we think about it carefully, it's not good to disobey Lord Ying's good intentions.

619
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:18,660
I promised Lord Ying that I would help you find the yuan-pellet, revive your body, and rebuild your past.

620
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,660
What's wrong?

621
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,660
What's wrong?

622
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:12,660
After an hour, the demon fire will be put out and you can rebuild Chang'an.

623
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,660
The two realms of human and demon are one.

624
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
The world will be reborn.

625
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,660
You should be the master of the great god.

626
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,660
I must destroy Chang'an.

627
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,660
I don't care if you want the world.

628
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,660
I only want her.

629
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,660
The world will be reborn.

630
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
What's wrong?

631
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,660
Xiao Chen, I only want you.

632
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,660
But the people around you...

633
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,660
I don't care.

634
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,660
I only want you.

635
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,660
I only want you.

636
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,660
I only want you.

637
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,660
I only want you.

638
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,660
I only want you.

639
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,660
I only want you.

640
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:55,660
But the people around you are all useless.

641
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,660
I only want you.

642
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
So dirty.

643
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,660
How are you, Elder Hui?

644
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,660
Don't be afraid. I'm here to talk to you about cooperation.

645
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,660
The white gate has always been muddled.

646
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,660
I have no power to destroy you.

647
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,660
So what?

648
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:06,660
Do you want to get out of the ordinary difficulty of being a rat and do things for me?

649
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,660
Yes, Sir.

650
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,660
The flowers are blooming and falling.

651
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,660
The autumn sun suddenly burns the heart.

652
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,660
The past is so bitter.

653
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,660
The candle is lit. The sword is cut.

654
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,660
The four seasons flow by in a hurry.

655
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:14,660
The night rain falls. The tears are silent.

656
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,660
I follow the stars and go far away.

657
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:22,660
I turn around and time has passed.

658
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:29,660
You are the old and the new.

659
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,660
If the past can be rewritten, everything will change.

660
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,660
I will wait for you for the rest of my life.

661
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,660
Love is like a sea of flowers.

662
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,660
The past is so bitter.

663
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,660
The candle is lit. The tears are silent.

664
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,660
I follow the stars and go far away.

665
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,660
I turn around and time has passed.

666
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,660
You are the old and the new.

667
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,660
If the past can be rewritten, everything will change.

668
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,660
If the past can be rewritten, everything will change.

669
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,660
I will wait for you for the rest of my life.

670
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,660
Look at the destiny. Love is lost.

671
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,660
How can it be forgotten?

672
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,660
When time turns into a sea of flowers, the past is so bitter.

673
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,660
The past is so bitter.

674
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,660
The candle is lit. The tears are silent.

675
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,660
I will wait for you for the rest of my life.

676
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,660
I will wait for you for the rest of my life.

677
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,660
I will wait for you for the rest of my life.
