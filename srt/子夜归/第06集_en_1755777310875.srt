1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit of a

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,320
little bit of a

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
little bit of a

6
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
little bit of a

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
little bit of a

8
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
little bit of a

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
little bit of a

10
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,320
little bit of a

11
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,320
little bit of a

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
little bit of a

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
little bit of a

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
little bit of a

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
little bit of a

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
little bit of a

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
little bit of a

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
little bit of a

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
little bit of a

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
little bit of a

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
little bit of a

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,320
crush

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,320
is

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
aenza

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
these

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
two

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
do not

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
know

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
how tobal・・・・

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
it is

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
also зак

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,320
the

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,320
In less than a month, the Xuanjian Temple has been taken to level 6.

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
The villagers are on the mountain and lost.

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
And they are all happy.

36
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Episode 2

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Is there anyone?

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
The place is so dirty.

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
No one cleans it.

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Where is he?

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
The place is so dirty.

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Where is he?

43
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
The place is so dirty.

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Where is he?

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
The place is so dirty.

46
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Where is he?

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
The place is so dirty.

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Where is he?

49
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
The place is so dirty.

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Where is he?

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
The place is so dirty.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Where is he?

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
The place is so dirty.

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Where is he?

55
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
The place is so dirty.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Where is he?

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
The place is so dirty.

58
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Where is he?

59
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
The place is so dirty.

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Where is he?

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
The place is so dirty.

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Where is he?

63
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
The place is so dirty.

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Where is he?

65
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
The place is so dirty.

66
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Where is he?

67
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
The place is so dirty.

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Where is he?

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
The place is so dirty.

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Are you sure the key is from here?

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Yes.

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,320
The entrance of this barrier is the first place of the demon.

73
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
It's so mysterious.

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
There are two ways to enter the barrier.

75
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
The one who is the cause of the demon can enter it.

76
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Otherwise, the outside demon can't get in.

77
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
The one inside the barrier can't escape.

78
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
There has been no mistake in this entrance for hundreds of years.

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,320
That Elder Hui doesn't have the right to enter.

80
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
How can he let the key out?

81
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
You must have seen it wrong.

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Really?

83
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Did he not let the key out?

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
What is the spell he used in the E-Sports?

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
The E-Sports?

86
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
The Demon of the Tree?

87
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Could it be the skill of the God of Weapon?

88
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
The...

89
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Isn't that the spell of the Mirror?

90
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
No wonder that old man asked me to find the Demon of the Tree.

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
It turns out that he wanted to use the east to the west to deal with Xiao Zhen.

92
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
The Demon of the Tree is in danger.

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
The Demon of the Tree has entered the barrier.

94
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
It is about to take the Demon of the Tree.

95
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
You have arranged it properly.

96
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
This must be taken care of.

97
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Don't let him succeed.

98
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Don't worry, Elder Hui.

99
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,320
I have set up a demon formation around the Demon of the Tree.

100
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,320
The cat palace is the place of the human being.

101
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,320
If you touch it, you will die.

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,320
But how can there be a human being in his body today?

103
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Who can it be?

104
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
I heard that

105
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,320
it is the official order of the Xuanjians.

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
The name is...

107
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Me...

108
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
It doesn't matter.

109
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
It is a mortal.

110
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
It is not important.

111
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
But

112
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,320
you can't regret what you promised me.

113
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Of course.

114
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
If I succeed, I will take the power of the cat palace.

115
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Don't say that the West is full of traps.

116
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Even if you go to the city of Chang'an to make trouble,

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
I can keep you safe.

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,320
That's the best.

119
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
I'm hungry.

120
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
I'll go find something to eat.

121
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Fifth Lady.

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
You are so good.

123
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
You found food so quickly.

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
I overthink.

125
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Are you going to tell me that

126
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
we are going to eat rabbits later?

127
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Yes.

128
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
What else?

129
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
What's wrong with you?

130
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
You don't like cats, but you want to eat rabbits.

131
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Do you have a grudge with the round-haired?

132
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
They are so cute.

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Why don't you touch them?

134
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Only the round-haired animals can have this feeling.

135
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
It's gone.

136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Fifth Lady.

137
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
You have buried our lunch.

138
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Then please go find some more.

139
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Don't find too cute.

140
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
I don't want to talk about it.

141
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Don't run around.

142
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
I've been in Chang'an for many years.

143
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
I didn't know there were demons in the West suburb.

144
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
I'm really sorry.

145
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
I've been in the West suburb for many years.

146
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
I didn't know there were demons in Chang'an.

147
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
It's so quiet.

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
What about the old monkey?

149
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
It's not a big deal.

150
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
What about the old monkey?

151
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,320
I don't think he's as pretty as me.

152
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,320
So he's here.

153
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Moqi.

154
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
You're so cold.

155
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
You make me sad.

156
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Do you have a lover?

157
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Yes or no.

158
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
How does it concern you?

159
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
It seems that you really have someone in your heart.

160
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Let me guess.

161
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Is she far away?

162
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Or is she by your side?

163
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Uncle.

164
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I see.

165
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,320
The man is thinking about that woman.

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Nonsense.

167
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Uncle.

168
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Uncle.

169
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Uncle.

170
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Uncle.

171
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Uncle.

172
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Uncle.

173
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Uncle.

174
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Uncle.

175
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Uncle.

176
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
Uncle.

177
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Uncle.

178
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Uncle.

179
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Uncle.

180
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Uncle.

181
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Uncle.

182
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Uncle.

183
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Uncle.

184
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Uncle.

185
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Uncle.

186
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Uncle.

187
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Uncle.

188
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Uncle.

189
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Uncle.

190
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Uncle.

191
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Uncle.

192
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Uncle.

193
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Uncle.

194
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320

Uncle.

199
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Uncle.

200
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Uncle.

201
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Uncle.

202
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Uncle.

203
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Uncle.

204
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320

Uncle.

210
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Uncle.

211
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Uncle.

212
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Uncle.

228
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Uncle.

229
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Uncle.

230
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Uncle.

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Uncle.

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Uncle.

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Uncle.

240
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Uncle.

241
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Uncle.

242
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Uncle.

243
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Uncle.

244
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Uncle.

245
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Uncle.

246
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Uncle.

247
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Uncle.

248
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Uncle.

249
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Uncle.

250
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Uncle.

251
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
It's really a big deal.

252
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
I didn't expect that this mortal guy looks weak.

253
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
He's actually a martial artist.

254
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
If you keep being stubborn,

255
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm afraid that Wu Zishu will also escape.

256
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
This won't happen.

257
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
If I don't run away,

258
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
I will be in trouble.

259
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I'm going to run out

260
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
This is not

261
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Elder Hui can rest assured

262
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Hu Zishu has been trapped by this illusion

263
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Xiao Zhan

264
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Hu Zishu is busy with work every day

265
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
The most vicious

266
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Xiao Zhan

267
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
I didn't expect

268
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
It's a love seed

269
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
But now the one around him

270
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Still very concerned

271
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
This time

272
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Never let go again

273
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Elder Hui rest assured

274
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,320
What happened in the cave just now?

275
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
I walked there by accident

276
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I didn't know there was a crazy tree in there

277
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,320
I heard that there was a little weird between the mountains and the wild

278
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
I was worried that you would be in trouble before I could find you

279
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Fortunately, my wife is calm

280
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Calm what?

281
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
I almost thought I was going to die

282
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,240
The

283
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Peony flower

284
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
It's okay to be able to joke

285
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,320
But you never said you know martial arts

286
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
It's the fifth wife who never asked me

287
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Then I said before that you were weak

288
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
You never refuted

289
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Come

290
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
You can eat

291
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Wild chicken

292
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Don't be afraid

293
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Where did you learn martial arts?

294
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
I learned some rough martial arts from the elder

295
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
So good

296
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Five

297
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Five

298
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I'll get you some water

299
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
This time you must never move again

300
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
The first round of the competition

301
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
The first round of the competition

302
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
The first round of the competition

303
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
The first round of the competition

304
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
The first round of the competition

305
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
The first round of the competition

306
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
The first round of the competition

307
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
The first round of the competition

308
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
The first round of the competition

309
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
The first round of the competition

310
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
The first round of the competition

311
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
The first round of the competition

312
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
The first round of the competition

313
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
The first round of the competition

314
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:33,500
Who will be shot?

315
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:54,740
The

316
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:10,240
The

317
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
So many corrupt things.

318
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
No wonder there is such a strong aura

319
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
to draw out the mountain demon.

320
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Mei Zhuyu!

321
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Mei Zhuyu!

322
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Mei Zhuyu!

323
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Mei Zhuyu!

324
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Mei Zhuyu!

325
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Mei Zhuyu!

326
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Where is she?

327
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Little boy.

328
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Fifth Madam, why are you here?

329
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
The house in the mountain is too big.

330
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I was afraid you would get lost,

331
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
so I came to have a look.

332
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
I saw a flower on the cliff just now.

333
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
It bloomed very beautifully.

334
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
But I can't go up.

335
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Little boy,

336
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
can you help me pick it up?

337
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Here.

338
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
It's so beautiful.

339
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Can you help me put it on?

340
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
I'm afraid it will get dirty.

341
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I'll go and get it.

342
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
I'll go and get it.

343
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
I'll go and get it.

I'll go and get it.

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
I'll go and get it.

349
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
I'll go and get it.

350
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
I'll go and get it.

351
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
I'll go and get it.

352
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
I'll go and get it.

353
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
I'll go and get it.

354
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
I'll go and get it.

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240

I'll go and get it.

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
I'll go and get it.

360
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
I'll go and get it.

361
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
I'll go and get it.

362
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I'll go and get it.

363
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
I'll go and get it.

364
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
I'll go and get it.

365
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
I'll go and get it.

366
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
I'll go and get it.

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,740
I'll go and get it.

373
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Yaowu...

374
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Mei Zeyu.

375
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Mei Zeyu.

376
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,000
What哈哈

377
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,260
Thank you

378
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,100
Where is this person

379
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:00,000
Friends

380
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Where did he go?

381
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Mei Zhuyu!

382
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Mei Zhuyu?

383
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Little boy?

384
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
You're here.

385
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
I finally found you.

386
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
What's going on?

387
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Why is he exactly like me?

388
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Something's wrong with him.

389
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
You're a monster, and you're still fighting?

390
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
What are you afraid of?

391
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Look, he's a monster!

392
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
I'm not!

393
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Mister, do something!

394
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
Come with me!

395
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Mister, kill him! I'm the real one!

396
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
I'm the real one!

397
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Kill him!

398
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Mister!

399
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Hurry!

400
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Why...

401
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Why?

402
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Because you're the monster!

403
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,240
How dare you!

404
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
How dare you!

405
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
I'll teach you a lesson!

406
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I'll teach you a lesson!

407
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Mei Zhuyu!

408
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Mei Zhuyu!

409
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
This is not done.

410
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
What we have agreed to

411
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
is probably a waste of time.

412
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Elder Hei,

413
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,240
it's not appropriate for you to be so harsh on me.

414
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm not a hero

415
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
and I can't let you die.

416
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Don't tell me I didn't warn you.

417
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
You've been eyeing me,

418
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
and I should have taken you in.

419
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Now you've offended

420
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
the cat and the tiger.

421
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
If you still want to live,

422
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
leave here now.

423
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
You're a monster.

424
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
What a coincidence, Elder Hui.

425
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Why are you so angry?

426
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
You left without saying goodbye.

427
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
What?

428
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
You thought you were not moving,

429
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
so I couldn't find any evidence

430
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
to prove that you're good at using magic

431
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
and escaping from the monster?

432
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm embarrassed

433
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
by your words.

434
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Fine.

435
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
I'm just a mouse.

436
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Don't blame me for being rude.

437
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
You're not good at escaping.

438
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
How dare you

439
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
hurt my life

440
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
and ruin my cultivation?

441
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
You...

442
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Mei Zhuyu.

443
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
Mei Zhuyu.

444
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Mei Zhuyu.

445
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Mei Zhuyu.

446
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Mei Zhuyu.

447
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
The mortal's body

448
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
is too impure.

449
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
It seems that I can only ask.

450
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Mei Zhuyu.

451
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Mei Zhuyu.

452
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Mei Zhuyu.

453
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Mei Zhuyu.

454
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Mei Zhuyu.

455
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Mei Zhuyu.

456
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Mei Zhuyu.

457
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Mei Zhuyu.

458
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Mei Zhuyu.

459
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Mei Zhuyu.

460
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Mei Zhuyu.

461
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Mei Zhuyu.

462
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Mei Zhuyu.

463
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Mei Zhuyu.

464
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,240
Mei Zhuyu.

465
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:52,680
With

466
00:27:52,680 --> 00:28:00,720
all

467
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,760
You're a cwpo

468
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
You're quite smart.

469
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
I don't believe it.

470
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,800
I have to go in tonight

471
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,080
to ask for a revenge.

472
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,040
If I had known it,

473
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,240
I would have been more careful.

474
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,120
Mr. Mei.

475
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,920
Madam, I...

476
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,320
I've told you, Mr. Mei.

477
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,000
Everything is fine in the mansion.

478
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,840
Why are you still pestering me

479
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,000
and spreading rumors

480
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,920
that I have a evil intention?

481
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,480
How could it be a rumor?

482
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

483
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,280
There was a snake in the mansion that day.

484
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
It was crawling.

485
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,240
It had such a big body

486
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,320
and was very rare.

487
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,920
I think it must have been a monster

488
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,160
that had been here for a long time.

489
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
I actually came in.

490
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,840
So?

491
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,040
Should the monster be killed by someone else?

492
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,840
I...

493
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,040
I didn't mean that.

494
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,160
Never mind.

495
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,800
You're so determined to help me.

496
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
Maybe there's really one thing

497
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,360
I can entrust to you.

498
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,080
Please tell me, Madam.

499
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,600
I won't let you down.

500
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,000
Then please go and get something

501
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,240
for me.

502
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
No problem.

503
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,240
Where should I go?

504
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,920
Your Highness.

505
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,440
You're awake.

506
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,520
I...

507
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,600
What's wrong?

508
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,840
You fainted.

509
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,760
I...

510
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,880
I remember

511
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,920
I saw two of you.

512
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,000
There's really a monster in the mountain.

513
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,040
The steam turned into a person

514
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,640
exactly like me.

515
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,480
Luckily, you're good.

516
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
You can distinguish it

517
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
and spread the steam.

518
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,840
What happened after the steam spread?

519
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,520
You fainted after the steam spread.

520
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,480
Then I kept an eye on you

521
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
and waited for you to wake up.

522
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,160
That's all?

523
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
Why are you so weird?

524
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,080
No...

525
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,960
No.

526
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Young Master, it's dawn.

527
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,920
Your Highness.

528
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,800
Your Highness.

529
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,040
You're finally back.

530
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,320
I've prepared

531
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,760
the horse carriage and carriage for you.

532
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,760
Please go back to the city immediately.

533
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,400
Your Highness.

534
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,360
Compared to previous horses,

535
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,040
horse carriage doesn't have

536
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,640
as many stirrups as previous horses do.

537
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,680
When I left the horse carriage and carriage,

538
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,860
I Bitcoin

539
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,480
was It it are 100????

540
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,520
I'm not dead.

541
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,720
Si.

542
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,000
Why are you here?

543
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,240
What a coincidence, Zhen.

544
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,600
I'm so tired.

545
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,680
Little octopus?

546
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Why are you here?

547
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,080
Zhen,

548
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,280
can you give me some water first?

549
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,360
I'm fine.

550
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,640
Slow down.

551
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,520
You look like you're going far away.

552
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,800
Where are you going?

553
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,840
Zhen,

554
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,320
I'm entrusted by Lady Liu

555
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,560
to do something important.

556
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,760
Luotai Zhen?

557
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,720
What is it?

558
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,240
Lady Liu told me

559
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,560
that there is a monster in her mansion.

560
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,760
It's not clean.

561
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,960
Master also said

562
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,360
we should go west

563
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,800
and find a grass

564
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,680
to solve the problem of Lady Liu's mansion.

565
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,960
West?

566
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,400
What is it?

567
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Master said

568
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,960
it's a secret.

569
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,160
We should go west and west.

570
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,840
We should keep going and never look back.

571
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,120
We should find a grass

572
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,080
with a green flower and red leaves.

573
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,040
Si,

574
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
how about I help you?

575
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,960
Sure, Zhen.

576
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,840
Lin Yuehua.

577
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,920
You're so kind.

578
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,240
Take him back.

579
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,080
Yes.

580
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,000
No.

581
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,720
Let's go.

582
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,360
I'm going west.

583
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
The direction is wrong.

584
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,400
The direction is wrong.

585
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,600
It should be driven out by Liu Tai Zhen.

586
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,680
Let's go.

587
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,840
Good.

588
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,280
Thank you for the ride.

589
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,280
I don't need to take you home.

590
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,400
No need.

591
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
The direction of my home is the opposite of the direction of the Duke's mansion.

592
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,600
You should go back early.

593
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,360
Zhu Yu,

594
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
please help me.

595
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,200
Mr. Mei.

596
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,640
Is there anything else?

597
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,560
Thank you for saving me

598
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,280
from yesterday's mountain.

599
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,760
Zhu Yu,

600
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
see you another day.

601
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,560
See you another day.

602
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,840
My lady,

603
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,200
shall we go to the palace?

604
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,160
No.

605
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,120
I have something to do.

606
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
Send me to Ruyi Pavilion.

607
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,520
You can go back to the palace and report to me.

608
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,800
Tell His Majesty and Her Majesty

609
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,640
that I have Mr. Mei to protect me

610
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,720
and that I'm safe.

611
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,000
They can rest assured.

612
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,240
Besides,

613
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,680
only one official was sent to investigate the Xuanjian Bureau.

614
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,320
He hasn't returned for a day or a night.

615
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,320
But no one is worried about him.

616
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,560
It's really generous of His Majesty and Her Majesty

617
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,440
to learn from the Xuanjian Bureau.

618
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,120
He's so generous.

619
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,040
Yes.

620
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Ruyi Pavilion

621
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,280
This is the Thunderbolt Tomb.

622
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,320
You got it so easily.

623
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,800
What if I'm the boss?

624
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,120
It's easy.

625
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,840
If you're not hurt,

626
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,960
I'll take this opportunity to kill him.

627
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,080
He's living a hard life.

628
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,640
He's been jumping for too long.

629
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,200
It's time to kill him.

630
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,160
Uncle,

631
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,800
the Thunderbolt Tomb is ready.

632
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,560
When can we break the Tomb?

633
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,880
The Tomb has the power to destroy evil.

634
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,240
But the Tomb can't be destroyed.

635
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,400
We need to wait until the thunder comes.

636
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,840
We need to draw the thunder fire into the Tomb

637
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,080
and then destroy the Tomb.

638
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
But you're not fully recovered yet.

639
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,840
You need to get well before the thunder comes.

640
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,240
I'll go and get the medicine.

641
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,680
Boss,

642
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,280
where are you going?

643
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,960
I was worried about the safety of Mr. Mei Xia

644
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,240
so I didn't dare to leave.

645
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,560
I'm worried about the mountain pozo who hasn't been eliminated yet.

646
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,720
Keep it from Uncle.

647
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Don't tell him.

648
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,800
Otherwise, he'll talk about me again.

649
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,400
Then,

650
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,280
be careful.

651
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,520
Don't worry.

652
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,960
Little Star.

653
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,640
LaLa territory

654
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,440
Back at home

655
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,640
The Green Dragon Zoo Shakyemura

656
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,640
Days later

657
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:23,920
See, how a world

658
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,920
What are you doing back here?

659
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Do you miss me?

660
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
You are dead

661
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Angel?

662
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
How is this possible?

663
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
I've been a fairy for decades

664
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,920
I can't protect you

665
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
How could I let you go?

666
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
You overestimate yourself

667
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,920
When did you change your true self?

668
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
You are exactly the same as her

669
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
But you are not like her

670
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
You are a woman who is not a woman

671
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
But you are hard to sacrifice

672
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
I don't understand

673
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,920
How could you understand this monster?

674
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Do you know what kind of person she is?

675
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,920
She is always making fun of people

676
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,920
But if she wants flowers, she will pick them herself

677
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
She is not afraid of danger

678
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
She will not be afraid of others

679
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
She will not avoid the people

680
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
She will not be afraid of the people

681
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
She is a woman who is not a woman

682
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,920
What you drew is just your imagination

683
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
She is not the person

684
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
I lost

685
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,920
Angel, if you can let me go

686
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,920
I will tell you the secret of the woman you are with

687
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,920
If it's a secret, you should keep it

688
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,920
I will seal your life

689
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,920
Angel

690
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
Angel

691
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
Angel

692
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
