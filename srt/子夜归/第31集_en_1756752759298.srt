1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,720
OK.

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Hey.

3
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,500
Hi.

4
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,300
How do you read.

5
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,600
Yeah.

6
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,100
Hey.

7
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,400
Hey.

8
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
This is for me.

9
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,900
Ha ha.

10
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,400
Ha ha.

11
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,900
Hey.

12
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,400
This is for you.

13
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,900
Ha ha.

14
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,900
Hey.

15
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,400
Hey.

16
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,600
Hey.

17
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,100
Hey.

18
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Wait.

19
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
What's going on?

20
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,100
Hey.

21
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,600
Why?

22
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,600
Hey.

23
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Isn't that the lady of the Liu family?

24
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,100
Hmm.

25
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
It's true.

26
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,100
I heard that the master of Qinghe and the secretary Mei had a fight.

27
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,100
She just moved out of the house and the lady of the Liu family came to visit.

28
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,100
You think that the secretary Mei is really lucky?

29
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,600
Hey.

30
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Then the secretary Mei is really...

31
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,100
Hey.

32
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
You can only meet her once.

33
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Don't talk to her.

34
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,600
Okay.

35
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,100
Have some tea.

36
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,600
Hmm.

37
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Lady Liu.

38
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,100
Hey.

39
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Brother Si is here.

40
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Little bamboo fish.

41
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Please save me.

42
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
I really can't stand it.

43
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,100
I feel so bad.

44
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,600
Hey.

45
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,100
Hey.

46
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,600
Hey.

47
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,100
Hey.

48
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,600
Hey.

49
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,100
Hey.

50
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,600
Hey.

51
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
What the hell?

52
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
It's useless to raise it.

53
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
It can't be replaced now.

54
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
You've known me for so many years.

55
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
You must know me well.

56
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,600
Huh?

57
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Huh?

58
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
I have to enter the demon room?

59
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Don't you always want to enter the demon room?

60
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I'll help you.

61
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Hey, lady Liu.

62
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,100
Little bamboo fish.

63
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Now I not only have to act as a big family member,

64
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
but also as a demon leader.

65
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,100
Brother Si, I really can't stand this pressure.

66
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Brother Si, please get up first.

67
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
I can't.

68
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
No one can see me.

69
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,100
Please help me.

70
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
Culture?

71
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
No wonder the lady left.

72
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
It's none of my business.

73
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
What's wrong with this?

74
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
What's wrong with this?

75
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
What's wrong with this?

76
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,100
What's wrong with this?

77
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Liu Kongshen.

78
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Come down.

79
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Liu Kongshen, is the rumor true?

80
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,100
But your daughter took my son-in-law.

81
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
I just heard about this.

82
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
But my daughter is not that kind of person.

83
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Not that kind of person?

84
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,100
Jiang Zikou, your daughter's carriage is still parked there.

85
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
How dare you say that she's not that kind of person?

86
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Prime Minister, calm down.

87
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
If my daughter really loves someone else's marriage,

88
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
I will not forgive her.

89
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
But now we are here to argue,

90
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
there is no point.

91
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Why don't we go inside and have a look?

92
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Go.

93
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Go.

94
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Stop.

95
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
I can't let them prepare.

96
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
We have to attack Gui Ying and catch him.

97
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Hurry.

98
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Hurry.

99
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Hurry.

100
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Xiao Zhuyu, aren't you an angel?

101
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Can't you think of a way?

102
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
I'll try.

103
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
I'll try.

104
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Stop.

105
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
You are a sinner.

106
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Repay me.

107
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Repay me.

108
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
You...

109
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
How dare you betray my daughter?

110
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
No, no, no.

111
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
It's a misunderstanding. It's a real misunderstanding.

112
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Misunderstanding?

113
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,100
You two are in the same room.

114
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Your hands...

115
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Your hands are like this.

116
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
You still say it's a misunderstanding.

117
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
You...

118
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
It's too real. It's too real.

119
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
You...

120
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
You...

121
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Uncle Liu.

122
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
You...

123
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,100
So, since you and Zhen are not because of Mrs Liu,

124
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,100
why do you want to make a compromise?

125
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
It's my fault.

126
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
I made her unhappy.

127
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
I know Zhen's temper.

128
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Actually, it's not your fault.

129
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,100
This time, it's really my fault.

130
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
You came here this time

131
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,100
really to see the doctor Mei Si Shi.

132
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
And to persuade her.

133
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
I swear.

134
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
I and Xiao...

135
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Mei Si Shi

136
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,100
definitely have nothing else to do.

137
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
That's good. That's good.

138
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Then I'm relieved.

139
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
I also know that

140
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Mei Si Lang is not a good man.

141
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
He is far worse than Mei Si Shi.

142
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
You are not satisfied with him.

143
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
It's understandable.

144
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Wait a minute.

145
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
How is it understandable?

146
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
It's none of my business.

147
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
It's none of Mei Si Lang's business.

148
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
It's none of Mei Si Lang's business.

149
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Are you my daughter?

150
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Why are you speaking for Mei Si Lang?

151
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
You did a good job.

152
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
But one day,

153
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
I became a family member

154
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
and ruined other people's relationship.

155
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
I worked hard to get 10 years of reputation.

156
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Mei Si Lang, you did it for me in one day.

157
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,100
You are really capable.

158
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Did you ask the way back

159
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
from the Duke?

160
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
My unreliable father thought about it for a long time.

161
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
He...

162
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
My unreliable father thought about it for a long time.

163
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Finally, he thought about it.

164
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
What did the man who sold the doll say?

165
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
How?

166
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
He said that

167
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,100
this could be exchanged with the new person.

168
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
When the other person falls in love,

169
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
it can be exchanged again.

170
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Do you want to try?

171
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Are you kidding me?

172
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
I can try.

173
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
What did Duke say?

174
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
I won't exchange it.

175
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
That's it.

176
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,100
I'll make Mei Si Lang a good person.

177
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
I'll think of another way.

178
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Mei Si Lang,

179
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,100
go back to the demon's room and do the snake's work.

180
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Can I not go back?

181
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
You are too scary.

182
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
If you don't go back, I'll kick you back.

183
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Forget it.

184
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
You kick him,

185
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
don't you think you are kicking yourself?

186
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Do you need help?

187
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
No, I can walk by myself.

188
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
Sister Zhen, what method do you think it is?

189
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,100
The key to this method is in your wife Liu.

190
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
I dare not say it.

191
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,100
The cat's work is good, the snake's work is good.

192
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
You are a snake's work now.

193
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Watch your words.

194
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Come on.

195
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
I don't know how slow your Tang Quan is.

196
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
No one is willing to marry.

197
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
You look at my life.

198
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
I didn't mean to rob it.

199
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
What? You didn't mean to?

200
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
You didn't mean to?

201
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Did I deliberately argue with you?

202
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
You dare to rob my business?

203
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
You dare to open the door and let everyone see?

204
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Can you be better than my Tang Quan?

205
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Why are they robbing business?

206
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Normally, people rob business,

207
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
demons also rob business.

208
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
This demon is robbing business.

209
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
I haven't seen it for the first time.

210
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
You are a vegetable.

211
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
I am a potato.

212
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Then let's go and see.

213
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
I'm afraid I won't see it again.

214
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
It makes sense.

215
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
I'll go and see.

216
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
I tell you, business has begun.

217
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
It starts as soon as it starts.

218
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Sir Snake.

219
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Sir Snake.

220
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Sir Snake,

221
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
it is inevitable that there are customers in business.

222
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100
It is not a trouble for you to fight.

223
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Sister Jia.

224
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
What's wrong?

225
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
What's wrong?

226
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Sir Snake.

227
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
What's wrong?

228
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
What's wrong?

229
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
What's wrong?

230
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,100
If I hadn't found it today,

231
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,100
when are you going to hide it from me?

232
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
I don't plan to hide it.

233
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Normally, the demon catchers will also be injured.

234
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I can't shout every time.

235
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
When did it start?

236
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,100
After the day of Changxi Palace.

237
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
This is not good for Yangyang.

238
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
This is too unreasonable.

239
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Sir Snake.

240
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Are you from the Cat Palace?

241
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Why don't you go in?

242
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
I didn't do anything.

243
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
They are still growing.

244
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
What's wrong with me?

245
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,100
The power of the Cat Palace is beyond the range of the mortal.

246
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
It is not a problem for you to fight.

247
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,100
The power of the Cat Palace is beyond the range of the mortal.

248
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
This is not a normal situation.

249
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,100
It is the effect of the demon trap.

250
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Xiao Zhen.

251
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,100
You can't hold on to the mortal.

252
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Xiao Zhen, don't worry.

253
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,100
No matter what, I won't let anything happen to you.

254
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Xiao Zhu Yu.

255
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
The door is locked.

256
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Are you done?

257
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Father, mother.

258
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
I didn't expect to wait for more than ten years.

259
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
I thought the truth was in front of me.

260
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
But it was actually like this.

261
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,100
The enemy I wanted to kill, but he was still alive.

262
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Tell me.

263
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
What should I do now?

264
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Help me.

265
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Help me.

266
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
What's wrong?

267
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Get up.

268
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
I didn't let the Sixth Madam open the door.

269
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
She climbed up the tree by herself.

270
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
She fell down and hit me on the waist.

271
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Who knew that the branches of your house were so strong?

272
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,100
They are so easy to break.

273
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
You...

274
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,100
She wanted to break the branch, but she couldn't.

275
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Why are you here now?

276
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
I swear I'm here to talk about something important.

277
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
I'm here to tell you something.

278
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
What is it?

279
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Zhen Jie is sick.

280
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Really?

281
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,100
Yes.

282
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
That's what I heard.

283
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,100
But I don't know what exactly happened.

284
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
You...

285
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Zhen Jie.

286
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Zhen Jie.

287
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Zhen Jie.

288
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Zhen Jie.

289
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Zhen Jie.

290
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Zhen Jie.

291
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
Zhen Jie.

292
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
Zhen Jie.

293
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Zhen Jie.

294
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Zhen Jie.

295
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Zhen Jie.

296
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Zhen Jie.

297
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Zhen Jie.

298
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100
Zhen Jie.

299
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Zhen Jie.

300
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Zhen Jie.

301
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Zhen Jie.

302
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Zhen Jie.

303
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Zhen Jie.

304
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Zhen Jie.

305
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Zhen Jie.

306
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
Zhen Jie.

307
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Zhen Jie.

308
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Zhen Jie.

309
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Zhen Jie.

310
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Zhen Jie.

311
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
Zhen Jie.

312
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Zhen Jie.

313
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Zhen Jie.

314
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Zhen Jie.

315
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Zhen Jie.

316
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Zhen Jie.

317
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Zhen Jie.

318
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Zhen Jie.

319
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
Zhen Jie.

320
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Zhen Jie.

321
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Zhen Jie.

322
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Zhen Jie.

323
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Zhen Jie.

324
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Zhen Jie.

325
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Zhen Jie.

326
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Zhen Jie.

327
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Zhen Jie.

328
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Zhen Jie.

329
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Spin Tian relation.

330
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Zhen Jie.

331
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Zhen Jie.

332
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Zhen Jie.

333
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Zhen Jie.

334
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
Zhen Jie.

335
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:52,100
I suddenly feel that if the snake is as small as Si, it's pretty cute.

336
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
You seem to be enjoying my fun.

337
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Why don't you worry about yourself?

338
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Boss, what's wrong?

339
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Nothing. I'm just a little tired.

340
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
After all, I just went through a surgery.

341
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,100
I see. But your face...

342
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Don't worry. I can't eat grapes.

343
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:41,100
5 months after the cro�

344
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
I want to go to the Regolith room later.

345
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
Then I will drop you off!

346
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
What's wrong?

347
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,100
I suddenly remembered something.

348
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
You guys can leave first.

349
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
It's really you.

350
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
How did you know?

351
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,100
There are only a few people in Chang'an who can listen to me.

352
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm the only one who can do that.

353
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm the only one who can do that.

354
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
I'm the only one who can do that.

355
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,100
You're here to do what?

356
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,100
You're too bored to look for something to do, so you came to look for my last will.

357
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
You're so cold-hearted.

358
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
How's your health?

359
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
We're over.

360
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
You don't have to worry about it.

361
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
Can you not finish it?

362
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Have you thought it through?

363
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Do you want to live with your enemies?

364
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Mei Zhongyu.

365
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
From what you saw,

366
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
your enemies

367
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
are living in my body.

368
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
Wu Zhen.

369
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Boss.

370
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Let's go.

371
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Wu Zhen.

372
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Is Minister Mei going to harass the women of the Liang family on the street?

373
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Yes.

374
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Are you crazy?

375
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Let me see your wound.

376
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
I'm not going to do that.

377
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
I'm not going to do that.

378
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
I'm not going to do that.

379
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
I'm not going to do that.

380
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
I'm not going to do that.

381
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
Let me see your wound.

382
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,100
This is good.

383
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
I'm busy with the demon world.

384
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,100
I've become like this.

385
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
You still have the heart to take care of this place?

386
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Sir, I'm not doing this for myself.

387
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
I'm doing this for the Yuzhen House.

388
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
This time, I'm asking for someone's help.

389
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,100
But the Yuzhen House is not easy to receive.

390
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
How can I give it to someone so easily?

391
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
You.

392
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
From now on, you'd better stop playing with the fox and pig.

393
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
I'm afraid I'll ruin you.

394
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
Sir.

395
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,100
I'm afraid that you're not suitable to stand here.

396
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
You.

397
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
Come here.

398
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
You're good at drawing.

399
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
Come here.

400
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Give me a good one.

401
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Okay.

402
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
You're good at drawing.

403
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
You're good at drawing.

404
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
I'm looking forward to it.

405
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Mr. Mei came in with a good reason.

406
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,100
The Yuzhen House is not allowed to hang the name of Mr. Mei.

407
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
It's hanging there.

408
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
That's right.

409
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Right?

410
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,100
I remember that last time, Ya Ji was also in the Yuzhen House.

411
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Mr. Mei came in with a good reason.

412
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,100
That time, he treated us much better than today.

413
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
How about it?

414
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Since you're here, Mr. Mei should go up there and show his skills.

415
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
That's right.

416
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Give us one.

417
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
No need.

418
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Don't go.

419
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Everyone here knows that

420
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Mr. Mei is good at drawing.

421
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
He's good at drawing beautiful women.

422
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
It's a pity that

423
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
he only can draw that one beautiful woman.

424
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Isn't that Mrs. Liu?

425
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
That one beautiful woman.

426
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Go up there.

427
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
I'm sorry.

428
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
I'll treat you to tea later.

429
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
I'll treat everyone to tea later.

430
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Don't go.

431
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Don't go.

432
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
What's going on with these people?

433
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
This Yuzhen House is related to you.

434
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Mr. Mei has been pestering you for many years.

435
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,100
These scholars are most uncomfortable with this kind of behavior.

436
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
They say that they've lost their face.

437
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
So when they see you,

438
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
they'll inevitably say a few words.

439
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
Does Mr. Mei know about this?

440
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
He knows.

441
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
He's just trying.

442
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
Every time someone says a few words,

443
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
Mr. Mei will smile and listen to it.

444
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,100
He'll pass.

445
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
Except that time.

446
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Mr. Wu said that you deliberately hung up on him.

447
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
It's very unpleasant.

448
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Mr. Mei then attacked the Wu's house.

449
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
It's said that

450
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
they fought.

451
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
So that's how it is.

452
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
I didn't know about this.

453
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Maybe Mr. Mei is always very thoughtful.

454
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
I'm afraid that some man

455
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
has a crush on you.

456
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
So he's trying to make you fall in love with him.

457
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Mrs. Liu.

458
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Mrs. Liu.

459
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Mrs. Liu.

460
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
Mrs. Liu.

461
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
What a coincidence, Mrs. Liu.

462
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
It's so late.

463
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
You just came back or are you going out?

464
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
You've been here for half a night.

465
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
Tonight is the night of the moon.

466
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,100
The evil spirit of evil is the most powerful.

467
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
I'm afraid that you're not safe.

468
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
So I'm here to guard you.

469
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Mrs. Liu, be careful!

470
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Don't hurt my Mrs. Liu!

471
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Mrs. Liu.

472
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
You're quite bold.

473
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
I thought that when you saw my waist,

474
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
you would run away.

475
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
We're not married.

476
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
We should be honest with each other.

477
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
I'm afraid that

478
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
I'm not a good man.

479
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
I just know that

480
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
people are more powerful than demons.

481
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
Miss.

482
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
My fiancee is waiting for me.

483
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
I'm leaving.

484
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,100
You want to marry a demon?

485
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
I want to marry you.

486
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Who told you that Mrs. Liu is a demon?

487
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
In this case,

488
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
how can other men's wives be compared to you?

489
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
They don't have such a beautiful snake body.

490
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Beautiful?

491
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Yes.

492
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:50,240
It's more beautiful than the demon's

493
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
I like you for a day.

494
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I like you for a day.

495
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
I'm afraid that you'll be fine for a day.

496
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
After a hundred years,

497
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
I'll die.

498
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
Of course, there will be others

499
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
who will wish you well.

500
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
You don't have to worry.

501
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Is it worth it?

502
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Whether it's worth it or not,

503
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
I'll decide for myself.

504
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Mrs. Liu, what's wrong?

505
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
What happened?

506
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Did you have a fight with that man?

507
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
Yes.

508
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
What?

509
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Did he ask you something?

510
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Just because he said something

511
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
I didn't want to say.

512
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
I didn't want to say anything.

513
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,100
I didn't want to say anything.

514
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
I didn't want to say anything.

515
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
Just because he said something

516
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
you hit him?

517
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
Actually, no.

518
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
I wanted to hit him.

519
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
But he was a dancer.

520
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,100
But he was a dancer.

521
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
So I didn't hit him very well.

522
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
So I didn't hit him very well.

523
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Why?

524
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
I couldn't beat him.

525
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
Why else?

526
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
You know you can't beat him, but you still want to.

527
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Are you stupid?

528
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Why did you let him talk nonsense?

529
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
You're not dead?

530
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,100
I'm sorry.

531
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
What did you say?

532
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,100
I'm sorry for everything

533
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
in the past.

534
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
I'm sorry.

535
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
We're back.

536
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
We're back.

537
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
We're back, Mrs Liu.

538
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
Let me see you.

539
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
He said

540
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
this can be exchanged

541
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,100
with the one you like.

542
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
When they fall in love,

543
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
they can exchange it.

544
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
We're back, Mrs Liu.

545
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,100
I'm leaving.

546
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I'm leaving.

547
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
I'm leaving.

548
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Today is a good day.

549
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Not only did you solve the problem,

550
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
you also gained a lot.

551
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Very good.

552
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Who is it?

553
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Thief!

554
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
I don't know how to attack!

555
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
I'm sorry.

556
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
I didn't expect you two

557
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
to be back.

558
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
How did you get back

559
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
after 200 years?

560
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Can you stop talking about this?

561
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Master!

562
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Master is back!

563
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Look at you.

564
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
You've become so popular in a few days.

565
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
What did Mei Si do to me?

566
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Master, this is the new

567
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
spice we have.

568
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Here you go.

569
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Thank you.

570
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
You're welcome.

571
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Let's get used to it.

572
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Master, something's wrong.

573
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Someone sent this to the entrance.

574
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
Chengxi Palace just left.

575
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Someone is coming to take over.

576
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
I want to see

577
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,100
who's playing tricks.

578
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Two masters!

579
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Xiao Zhuying!

580
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
Come and save me!

581
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Save me!

582
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Save me!

583
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Save me!

584
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Why is there fire?

585
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Who are you?

586
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Why are you hiding?

587
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
It's you.

588
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
What's wrong with

589
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
all of you in Changxi Palace?

590
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Do you only know how to use this?

591
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
That's all I know.

592
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Tell me. What do you want?

593
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
I don't want anything.

594
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
I can let go of her.

595
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
As long as...

596
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
As long as what?

597
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Have a meal with me.

598
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Madam.

599
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
What if I don't agree?

600
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
What can I do?

601
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
What?

602
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Good!

603
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
Good!

604
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
With the current situation

605
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
it's getting harder to figure out.

606
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Madam.

607
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
Why don't you come up?

608
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Madam!

609
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
Xiao Zhuying!

610
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
Don't leave me alone!

611
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Madam! Xiao Zhuying!

612
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
Don't leave me alone!

613
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
Madam, is Ling Xiao really okay?

614
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
She's not the one who's in trouble.

615
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
How can we be trapped

616
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
in love when we're alive?

617
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
I'm sorry.

618
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
These are all your favorites.

619
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Try them.

620
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Why?

621
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
If you really want to

622
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
make a good mistake with me

623
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
you should go home that day.

624
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Birthday...

625
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
It's the same

626
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
right now.

627
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
You've put so much effort into it.

628
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Why?

629
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
There's no reason.

630
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
I just think that you still have things to hide.

631
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
I just want to find the truth.

632
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
This is your ball?

633
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
These are not important.

634
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Madam, eat something first.

635
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
We can talk about it later.

636
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Sir!

637
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,100
Please eat something!

638
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,100
I know what you are going to do...

640
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
I only look for the truth.

641
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
It's you.

642
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
You can't just leave me like this.

643
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
I'm afraid you've read too many books.

644
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:58,100
There's not much difference between people.

645
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,100
If that's the case, why did you see me more often?

646
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
What are you hiding from me?

647
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
I'm afraid you've read too many books.

648
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
If that's the case, why did you see me more often?

649
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
Why did you see me more often?

650
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,100
I'm afraid you've read too many books.

651
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
