I express

I'm Xu Kai. I use Taobao to buy and order take-out.

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
It's more advantageous.

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,420
Only Nonfu Mountain Fishing

OK.

You're done!

Ah!

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,840
Little girl

45
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,840
Who are you?

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
I... I am Wu Zhen

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
What are you doing here?

48
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
The street is on fire

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
It's burning everywhere

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
I... I lost my way

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
You came here at this time

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Maybe it's our chance

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Who are you?

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
You are about to die

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
And I am the one who changed your fate

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
But it's not easy to change your fate

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
You have to pay the price

58
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
What is the price?

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
The price is...

60
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
This little boy is so sweet

61
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
I am coming

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
Did Chao wake you up?

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
No, I just woke up

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Did you find any clues?

65
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
You fought with your mother the other day

66
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,840
The woman who was her wife was sent to the police

67
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,840
The woman's name is Bi Tao

68
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
She is a weapon of the suicide room

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
She is the one who killed her mother

70
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
She is the one who killed her mother

71
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Bi Tao is a weapon of the suicide room

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Suicide room?

73
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
She is also a friend of her

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
She is also a friend of her

75
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,840
She is also a friend of her

76
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
She is here

77
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
We can't let her run away

78
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Let's go to the suicide room

79
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Let's go to the suicide room

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Who is the woman talking to in the suicide room?

81
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
You

82
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Me?

83
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
I just remembered that

84
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Many weapons of the suicide room came last night

85
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Maybe someone saw something

86
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
I was just wondering

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
If anyone knows where my things are

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
I won't bother you

89
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
If so, I'll go to the suicide room

90
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
You also want to go to the suicide room

91
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Can you take more people with you?

92
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
No need, I can go with you

93
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
It's a public affair to investigate

94
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
It's inconvenient for the fifth lady to go with you

95
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
That's not good

96
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
It's a place of fireworks

97
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
What if you go to the fake temple?

98
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
After all, it's my beloved little husband

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
I have to take good care of it

100
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
You accompany the county head to

101
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Where are you going?

102
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
The fourth wife went to the car

103
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Car?

104
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
You call him a car

105
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Looks like my horse car was born

106
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
I have a good friend

107
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Young man, why don't you accompany me?

108
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
No need, my car is good

109
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Slow down, young man

110
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Young man, no, not expensive

111
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
No, no, no

112
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
The car is gone

113
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Fifth wife, this is not right

114
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
I'll go to the car

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Where did you go?

116
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Where is it?

117
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Don't leave me.

118
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
No, no.

119
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
No, no, no.

120
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
No, no, no.

121
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
It's Liu.

122
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Come in.

123
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Why didn't you go to the dance today?

124
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
We've been looking for you for a long time.

125
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
I'm a little uncomfortable.

126
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Today's guests are all waiting.

127
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Come with me.

128
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Look, isn't that the horse of the county chief?

129
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Gu Renyun, the day of the day, the camp car.

130
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
I haven't seen it yet.

131
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,840
The little boy is now in a big mood.

132
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Feel it.

133
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
It doesn't matter.

134
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
This car belongs to my second wife.

135
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Who is this man?

136
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Is it the bride of my second wife?

137
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Bride?

138
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Let me see what it looks like.

139
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
This is really...

140
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Look at the head shape of the other person.

141
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
It's really handsome.

142
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
It's a little worse than you.

143
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
The princess of the wind is on the book.

144
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
The little boy likes this.

145
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,840
There is also a small guard of the Jin State General.

146
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
The young man who is a female official in the court.

147
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Boss, you drink small sugar.

148
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Let's go.

149
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I know. Don't worry.

150
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
What's wrong?

151
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Nothing.

152
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Come on, uncle.

153
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Second lady Gu.

154
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
It's been a long time since the second lady came.

155
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,680
This is the hostess of Xuanjian Temple.

156
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,080
She has something to ask you.

157
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,480
Oh, my.

158
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,720
Little boy.

159
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,440
What a handsome little boy.

160
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,400
Why are you so cute?

161
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,440
Yeah.

162
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,560
You want to ask me?

163
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,080
She wants to ask him.

164
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,240
My Lord.

165
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,280
Wait.

166
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,760
What are you doing?

167
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,080
You are so arrogant.

168
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,360
Get out of my way.

169
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,440
My Lord.

170
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,040
My lady.

171
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,000
You...

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,520
What are you doing here?

173
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
I'm here to...

174
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
To get tea.

175
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,360
Are you looking for trouble or not?

176
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,320
I'm telling you.

177
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
Don't come here.

178
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,400
I'm telling you.

179
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,920
I don't have any feelings for you.

180
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,080
We are not in love.

181
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,800
I...

182
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Look.

183
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,640
I have a new girl now.

184
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,120
You can't regret it now.

185
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,520
I may not agree.

186
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,360
My lady.

187
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,280
Lu Zhen.

188
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm not done with you.

189
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Uncle.

190
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,480
My lady.

191
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,520
Please be quiet.

192
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,160
Don't let the wife and the boy know you.

193
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
What are you afraid of?

194
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
My lady.

195
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
My lady.

196
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,160
Wen Xin.

197
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,200
You followed the Five poisoned Herb to come here?

198
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,440
She kicked me and left.

199
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,400
What does she mean?

200
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
You...

201
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,760
What is that sound?

202
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
You...

203
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,400
You were here.

204
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
Wen Xin.

205
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,800
It's me.

206
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,120
Don't you remember me?

207
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,640
Gu was sequences of plague.

208
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Let's go.

209
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,400
I washed...

210
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,320
If you still wanna gospel,

211
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,840
then leave...

212
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,180
No.

213
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,300
I won't leave until next time.

214
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,880
Yes, Sir.

215
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,060
My 번-haut has been murdered?

216
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,020
Keys?

217
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,300
Such false

218
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,480
Oh, meet the 2001 yen

219
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,020
It is there

220
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,820
Your Grace.

222
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,660
She did make a lot of mistakes.

223
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,180
But please,

224
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,620
spare her life.

225
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,940
I didn't want to kill her.

226
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,620
Your Grace.

227
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,860
What's wrong with her?

228
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,260
After you left,

229
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,620
she was infected with something dirty.

230
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,180
She was distracted by the green stone.

231
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,700
That's why she hurt people.

232
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,740
Come back.

233
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,020
Someone put a spell on her.

234
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,700
ChenLYang construce a monitoring tree.

235
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,420
Are you all right, sir?

236
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Are you all right?

237
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,940
Did someone hurt you?

238
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,740
Someone bullied you. Tell me. I'll avenge you.

239
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,380
It's okay.

240
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,020
Who?

241
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,780
Don't worry, sir.

242
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,900
I'll drive him away.

243
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,460
Don't hit me.

244
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,740
Don't worry.

245
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,460
I'm fine now.

246
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,140
You...

247
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,020
So, you don't like cats.

248
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,460
Please take it away.

249
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,060
My husband hates cats the most.

250
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,620
It seems that

251
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,580
the cat is sad.

252
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,100
You're here, too.

253
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,340
I heard that a lot of bats flew to Pingban.

254
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,460
Are you all right?

255
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,140
I'm fine.

256
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,780
I'm fine.

257
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,060
Are you all right?

258
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,780
Fifth Lady.

259
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,140
She was scared and came back early.

260
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,220
It's getting late.

261
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,060
I'll go back to rest.

262
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
This is...

263
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,940
Mr. Shu, the friend of the fifth sister,

264
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,820
who runs the book store in Chang'an.

265
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,660
But the fifth sister is still scared.

266
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,380
Search for good things.

267
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,580
Wu Yilou,

268
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,580
the best selling book,

269
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,500
the best selling book,

270
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,460
only pick the best one.

271
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
But the price...

272
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:21,680
It depends on the

273
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,460
beauty.

274
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,780
It's cheaper.

275
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,860
I'm tired.

276
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,020
Go to the store.

277
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,700
White, white, alien.

278
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,860
Point, point, point, point.

279
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,460
Go to the store.

280
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,300
I'm tired.

281
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,180
Go to the store.

282
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,540
Listen to the alien.

283
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,500
Tired of the Chengcheng store,

284
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,740
come and taste the alien.

285
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,760
Alien's

286
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,700
water is for you to watch.

287
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Purple Night Turtle.

288
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,660
Three minutes of Han Ting's miracle protection speed.

289
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,140
Transformation of the clear silver version.

290
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,460
The repair is not greasy.

291
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,380
I want you to watch the wonderful content.

292
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,300
Xiao Zhen.

293
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Come on, eat candy.

294
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,980
Uncle,

295
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,860
when will he be able to repair it?

296
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,980
You still

297
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
look so anxious.

298
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,340
I'm not anxious.

299
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,860
He is.

300
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,300
Fu Xi.

301
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,660
Fu Xi,

302
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,460
don't be angry.

303
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,700
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,860
I didn't really want to leave you.

305
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,940
I just have been with you for hundreds of years.

306
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,540
It's a little boring.

307
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,620
I just want to go out for a while.

308
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,740
Fu Xi.

309
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,700
Fu Xi.

310
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,740
He left for only two days.

311
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,540
You've disturbed his mind.

312
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,020
Why are you so impatient?

313
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,900
The ear is in pairs.

314
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,220
The body is in pairs.

315
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
The body is in pairs.

316
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,420
Since they are in pairs,

317
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,500
they should be together all the time.

318
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,260
They are inseparable.

319
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620
They are inseparable.

320
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,500
They are inseparable.

321
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,540
There are so many things

322
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,620
that come and go in this world.

323
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,940
It's rare for you to grow up

324
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,900
and grow up.

325
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,860
How can it be meaningless

326
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,860
because you have no companion?

327
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,660
Fu,

328
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,460
we exist in this world

329
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,900
without others

330
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,540
and without destiny.

331
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,740
Even if you are just a small earring,

332
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,100
you should have your own meaning.

333
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,820
The body is in pairs.

334
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,260
The body is in pairs.

335
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,660
They are inseparable.

336
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,020
Now Fu Xi is still alive.

337
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,820
When he recovers,

338
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,500
if you have a chance to kill him,

339
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,060
you two can stay in the key room

340
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,460
and live the days you want.

341
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

342
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

343
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,300
Wait.

344
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,500
Your Highness.

345
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,020
I just got Hinterasta now

346
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,380
because I lost another thing.

347
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,980
Or,

348
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,720
there is one more thing.

349
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,780
Lies?

350
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,620
I went to Chang'an for the whip

351
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:52,940
and found this guy.

352
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,300
and found this guy.

353
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,020
and found this guy.

354
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,500
Something noticed.

355
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,860
Some shape-d 재실

356
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,620
and figures delivered toue o f �

357
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,740
and figures delivered toue o f do

358
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,460
勇

359
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,540
He saw me a little broken

360
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,540
So he sent me to a jewelry workshop in the city

361
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
Jewelry workshop

362
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,540
Yes

363
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
When I was in the jewelry workshop

364
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,540
I seem to feel a evil spirit

365
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,540
He made me not like myself

366
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,540
But how can there be evil in Chang'an?

367
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,540
I remember the source of that evil spirit is

368
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
A stone

369
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
Red stone

370
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,540
Stone

371
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
Is it the Buhua Valley?

372
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Buhua Valley

373
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
What is that?

374
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
Buhua Valley is the remains of the Han Yuan people

375
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
The place where it is often causes demon disease

376
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
Whether it's a person or a demon

377
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
It's easy to walk to the valley

378
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,540
So we have to find the Buhua Valley

379
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,540
Buhua Valley

380
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
Father

381
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
Mother

382
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
Eighteen years

383
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,540
Why doesn't father come back?

384
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Your father

385
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
He has something else to do

386
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,540
I want to sleep after he tells me the story

387
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
You sleep now

388
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,540
You can see your father when you wake up

389
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Zhuyu, I told your father

390
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,540
He is not allowed to go anywhere at this age

391
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Mother and father

392
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Go to Chang'an to play snow with you

393
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
Ok?

394
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
Ok

395
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,540
Then I will sleep now

396
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
Eighteen years

397
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,540
My son is now in the dark cave of Xuanjian Temple

398
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,540
I don't know if I can find the clues

399
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,540
To find out

400
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,540
The truth of the fire of the sky in Qing Dynasty

401
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,540
Mother

402
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Think about it

403
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
If I didn't go to Quzhou

404
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,540
I wouldn't be a student of Changxi Palace

405
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540
I should have left Hongzhen

406
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,540
But master went to tell me

407
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,540
I'm afraid your death was not a genius

408
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,540
But a devil

409
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
I go back to Chang'an now

410
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,540
Just to tell you the truth

411
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
No matter how difficult the road is

412
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,540
I will revenge for you

413
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
What?

414
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
You are so kind

415
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,540
Sister

416
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,540
This is the biggest joy in the world

417
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
So easy

418
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Why do I feel that there is a ghost in it?

419
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
The day before yesterday was the birthday party

420
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,540
The second lady was in front of everyone

421
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,540
I heard that she was talking to people in private

422
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,540
I've been together for a while

423
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
In private

424
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
This person is so capable

425
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
What's his background?

426
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
First came to Chang'an

427
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,540
His name is Mei Zhuyu

428
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
Name is Mei?

429
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,540
He is from the Mei family

430
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,540
This should be the distant cousin of the Noble Consort Mei

431
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
Zhen'er

432
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
He has been playing with fire for so long

433
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
Why?

434
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,540
He let a little boy who first came to Chang'an to take it

435
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
I don't believe

436
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,540
What's his strength?

437
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
Strength

438
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
Yes

439
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,540
What's his strength?

440
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
Strength

441
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
Come

442
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Your family has to be so good

443
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
Our family has to be so good

444
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
I said

445
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,540
Our family has a little understanding

446
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,540
How can you be so fast to take the new business?

447
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,540
It's just that he likes to play

448
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,540
It's something he can do

449
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,540
Although the county chief may only be two days late

450
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,540
But there is one thing I dare not not report

451
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
What is it?

452
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,540
This person is only a little girl

453
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
I don't know

454
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
What is it?

455
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Say it

456
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,540
This person is only a little girl

457
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
Little girl

458
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Little girl

459
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,540
Just a poor servant

460
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,540
Just rely on this half color

461
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,540
And eat women's soft food

462
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
Mei Fei sister

463
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,540
Your family is in good control

464
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Boss

465
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
Boss, don't worry

466
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,540
This flow is already fine

467
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,540
The medicine that helps calm the heart and calm the mind is fine

468
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,540
Is there any suspiciousness in the Xuanjian Temple?

469
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,540
No

470
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,540
It is said that the earlobes are all blocked by the whip

471
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Hiding on the roof of the incense room

472
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,540
The Xu Lun of the Xuanjian Temple was scared by the rumors of the couple

473
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
He said

474
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,540
The Xu Lun of the Xuanjian Temple was scared by the rumors of the couple

475
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
He said

476
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,540
The Xu Lun of the Xuanjian Temple was scared by the rumors of the couple

477
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
The Xu Lun of the Xuanjian Temple was scared by the rumors of the couple

478
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
He said

479
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
No one is hurt

480
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,540
Naturally, he was too lazy to investigate

481
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,540
By the way, boss

482
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,540
I just got this news

483
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
You heard

484
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,540
I'm afraid you won't be happy

485
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
What is it?

486
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,540
The eunuch went out of the palace and went to the Xuanjian Temple

487
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,540
The empress wants to see the Mei family's husband

488
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
What?

489
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Husband

490
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,540
Husband

491
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,540
Husband

492
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,540
Husband

493
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
The next to the Hu Bin shop is really famous

494
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,540
I got up early and just got a little in line

495
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,540
Missed

496
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Husband

497
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,540
This is for you to choose a private

498
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,540
What is that Xu?

499
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
What private?

500
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,540
Will you pay the bill?

501
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
rest assured

502
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
Just pay the bill

503
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
Otherwise, our family is poor

504
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,540
I gave you two-thirds of my salary every month

505
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Why are you still saying poor?

506
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,540
What do you mean by that?

507
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,540
I work hard every day

508
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,540
Serve you as a bull

509
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,540
Didn't you even touch the husband?

510
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
I'm not

511
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,540
Then the husband needs to deduct five months

512
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
No

513
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,540
Brother Mei

514
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,540
Bad bad

515
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,540
You hurry up and go to the Xuanjian Temple

516
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,540
what happened

517
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
Something big happened

518
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,540
Our Xuanjian Temple was smashed

519
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
What happened?

520
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
What happened?

521
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,540
Who is this?

522
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,540
Who hit him?

523
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
This is so ridiculous

524
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,540
This is so ridiculous

525
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,540
This is so ridiculous

526
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,540
This is so ridiculous

527
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
This is so ridiculous

528
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,680
First Cold

529
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,180
Fifth

530
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,540
Niagara

531
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,540
No she doesn't

532
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I almost got hurt by the whip in this place.

533
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
But you are so ungrateful.

534
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,540
You are so good to me.

535
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,540
You don't want to be my girlfriend?

536
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
I won't force you.

537
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
From now on,

538
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,540
we are no longer friends.

539
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
Don't let me see you again.

540
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
Go.

541
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
Enough.

542
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
Stop looking at it.

543
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
Go away.

544
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
Stop looking at it.

545
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
Go away.

546
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
It's all your fault.

547
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
You are not only single,

548
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,540
but also a full-fledged horse.

549
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
I am a treasure.

550
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,540
Don't force me.

551
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,540
No wonder people say that the Lord of the Galaxy is cruel.

552
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,540
He has caused so many troubles to get close to you.

553
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,540
It doesn't matter.

554
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Lady Xun is

555
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,540
always like to fool people.

556
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
In the future,

557
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,540
it's good to be careful.

558
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
I think

559
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,540
there is no need to rush.

560
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
At most, let the Queen call her.

561
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,540
I don't want to

562
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,540
get involved with that ordinary young man.

563
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
My sister is a quick-tempered person.

564
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
One day later,

565
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
I don't know how much trouble I will cause.

566
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
It's better to break it off as soon as possible.

567
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,540
But that Mr. Mei is weak,

568
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
but he is so beautiful.

569
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,540
Do you really want to?

570
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
Flowers are red all the time.

571
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,540
Just give a beautiful flower a reward.

572
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,540
There is no need to go home.

573
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
What's going on?

574
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
Lady, the road is blocked.

575
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,540
How dare someone block the way of my second wife?

576
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
She is back.

577
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,540
Long time no see, Lady Liu.

578
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
It's been a long time.

579
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,540
You missed the good intentions of my second wife.

580
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
So what?

581
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,540
I'll play it again for you.

582
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Okay.

583
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
Mr. Mei, Mr. Mei is here.

584
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,540
Brother, why are you here?

585
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,540
Your business is going crazy in Chang'an.

586
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
What?

587
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
Legend has it that

588
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,540
I was so clear to you on the birthday banquet

589
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,540
that I pretended to report the case to you.

590
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
I just wanted to come to Xuanjian Temple

591
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,540
and see you.

592
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Who knew that Mr. Mei didn't appreciate it,

593
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,540
and he would rather die than listen to it?

594
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
He didn't care about the entanglement of Lady Qinghe

595
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
and hid her in the silk room.

596
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,540
It was a mess.

597
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,540
And my second wife was entangled with Wei Guo

598
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
and was in a bad mood.

599
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
She made a scene in Xuanjian Temple

600
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,540
and said she wanted to break up with you.

601
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,540
How can a woman be so innocent?

602
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
It doesn't matter.

603
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
What innocent?

604
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
I don't care at all.

605
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,540
Yes.

606
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
I just heard that

607
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,540
Lady Qinghe and her dead opponent,

608
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,540
Lady Liu,

609
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,540
had a fight on the street for a little thing.

610
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
She was even talking nonsense.

611
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Lady Liu?

612
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,540
She went back to Chang'an?

613
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Yes.

614
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
Who is Lady Liu?

615
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,540
She is the daughter of Minister Shen of the Liu Palace.

616
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,540
My fiancee.

617
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Get back to the кстати.

618
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
Get back to discretion.

619
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
Don't scare me.

620
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
Ma rash complaining that

621
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
you would這e what my calmness,

622
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,460
What?

623
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,540
You went to the incense with Liu family

624
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,620
and got stuck in the temple?

625
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,420
You're so lively when you come back?

626
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,340
You really have nothing to do with that Mr. Mei?

627
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,260
What can I do?

628
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,140
If you really don't like that Mr. Mei,

629
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,260
why do you want to change his name

630
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,820
with your reputation?

631
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,460
I have a reputation.

632
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,100
At least we took advantage of him.

633
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,460
We should have some conscience

634
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,300
to be his demon.

635
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,300
Besides, I don't care about that.

636
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,860
I heard that yesterday

637
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,220
someone secretly lost his talisman

638
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,620
and planned to hurt his mother.

639
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,460
You heard that too?

640
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,540
The situation is too big.

641
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,380
It's really strange to

642
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,620
lure out the people who have been gone for years

643
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,700
and get rid of demons.

644
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,780
Do you need to be more careful about this?

645
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,340
There are many people

646
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,900
who still have cultivation in the world.

647
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,860
As long as it's not the bandits from Changxi Palace.

648
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,980
Changxi Palace has been gone for hundreds of years.

649
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,980
You always think about them.

650
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,420
I'll get rid of all the demons in the world.

651
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,860
This wound

652
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,340
makes me have to wake up all the time.

653
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,860
If they are still in the demon world of Changxi Palace,

654
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,300
there will be a fight between them.

655
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,540
Who is it?

656
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,820
Who is it?

657
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,180
Who is it?

658
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,780
Don't hide.

659
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,140
Stop!

660
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
Don't hide.

661
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,180
Stop!

662
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,700
Don't hide.

663
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,220
Stop!

664
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,580
Don't hide.

665
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,780
Stop!

666
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,100
Don't hide.

667
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,220
Stop!

668
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,300
Don't hide.

669
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,300
Stop!

670
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,500
Don't hide.

671
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,500
Stop!

672
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,700
Don't hide.

673
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,700
Stop!

674
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,900
Don't hide.

675
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,900
Stop!

676
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,100
Don't hide.

677
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,100
Stop!

678
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,100
Don't hide.

679
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,100
Stop!

680
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,300
Don't hide.

681
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,300
Stop!

682
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,500
Don't hide.

683
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,500
Stop!

684
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,500
Don't hide.

685
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,300
Stop!

686
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,100
Ghost!

687
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,100
The county magistrate is so cool.

688
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,900
But

689
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,300
he broke one corner of my front hall

690
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
and broke the whole Xuanjian Temple.

691
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,700
Good job.

692
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,700
Good job.

693
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,500
Welcome to come again.

694
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,300
Good job.

695
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,100
Good job.

696
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,100
Welcome to come again.

697
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,500
Governor Xu,

698
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,300
if it weren't for my bad luck,

699
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,900
I would have killed the demon last night.

700
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,100
Governor Qiu,

701
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,100
please save me.

702
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,300
What are you talking about?

703
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,900
You are not a drunkard.

704
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,500
I...

705
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,300
Who wants to hurt you?

706
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
I see.

707
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,900
You must have heard that

708
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,500
the ghost case broke recently.

709
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,700
So

710
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,500
you came up with this

711
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,300
mysterious saying.

712
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
You want to make it big

713
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,300
and then make trouble in my Xuanjian Temple.

714
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,900
The purpose is to attract guests

715
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,700
for your little show.

716
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,500
Am I right?

717
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,500
What are you talking about?

718
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,900
Enough.

719
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,500
Since I broke the bat case,

720
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
I can't do anything.

721
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,500
I see many weird people like you

722
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,100
every day.

723
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
How can I escape

724
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,300
from this?

725
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
You are

726
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,700
a bad person.

727
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
You are a smart person.

728
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
I'm a bad person.

729
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,500
But I...

730
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
What?

731
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,300
If you keep talking nonsense,

732
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,500
I'll arrest you.

733
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,900
Hey.

734
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,500
Little cat,

735
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,300
smell this.

736
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,700
The incense made from the 100-year-old Chenxiang Valley

737
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,300
is a personal use.

738
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,700
It's also made into a perfume.

739
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,300
I'm tired and exhausted

740
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
and I'm exhausted.

741
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,900
Boss.

742
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,300
It's very good for your health.

743
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,700
But it smells so good.

744
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,100
It's a good way to get rid of the smell.

745
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,300
Since it's so good for your health,

746
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,500
it's a good product

747
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,300
for the Juzi Festival.

748
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,300
Juzi Festival?

749
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
That's a good idea.

750
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,100
Since it's my master's idea,

751
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,500
shouldn't we give it to

752
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
the Ruyi House?

753
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,900
Can you get it?

754
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,500
Can you get it?

755
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Little beauty,

756
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,900
your master is so stingy.

757
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,500
He has no future.

758
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,500
Why don't you come to my house?

759
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,300
You are so kind to me.

760
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,900
I'm so...

761
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,900
moved.

762
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,900
Because I only love my master.

763
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,900
Mr. Mei is here.

764
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,900
If Ruyi House is a place to eat and drink,

765
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,500
the Yuzhen House is a good place.

766
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
All the civil servants and scholars

767
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,300
are here to taste the incense.

768
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
All the incense in my house

769
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,500
are bought here.

770
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,500
Mr. Mei.

771
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
It's a good place.

772
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,900
I'm sorry, Mr. Mei.

773
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,700
The second floor is full of incense.

774
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,700
No, I don't have a room for you.

775
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,300
Someone booked it in advance.

776
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,100
Please wait for a moment.

777
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,100
Zhu Yu.

778
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,100
Sister Zhen.

779
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,700
Liu Niangzi.

780
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,300
Is that my Liu Niangzi?

781
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,300
Sister Zhen.

782
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,100
I think I saw Liu Niangzi just now.

783
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,300
What Liu Niangzi?

784
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,700
Liu Niangzi.

785
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,700
Liu Niangzi.

786
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,700
I have a hallucination again.

787
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,100
Stop looking.

788
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
She can hide in the crack.

789
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Sister Zhen.

790
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,300
I have a hallucination.

791
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,700
I have a hallucination.

792
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
Sister Zhen.

793
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,900
By the way, sister Zhen.

794
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,300
Why did you come to the Yuzhen House?

795
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Don't you always dislike the rouge powder?

796
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,100
Besides, this is Liu Niangzi's shop.

797
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,100
You know it's my opponent's shop.

798
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,300
You even give him money every day.

799
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,300
It seems that in your heart,

800
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,100
Liu Niangzi is more important than me.

801
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,300
Sister Zhen.

802
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I'm wrong.

803
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Liu Niangzi is my...

804
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,300
Liu Niangzi.

805
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,100
Sister Zhen.

806
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
I swear every time.

807
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
I'm absolutely loyal to you.

808
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:11,900
OK.

809
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,100
Wrap it up for me.

810
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,300
Isn't this the little boy of the Mei family

811
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,100
in the Xuanjian Temple?

812
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,700
What's his name?

813
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,300
Mei Zhuyu.

814
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,300
It's a little hard to remember.

815
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,900
If you can't remember, it means you have a bad brain.

816
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,300
Don't remember it.

817
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,700
Mr. Mei.

818
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,100
I heard you were used up by Qinghe's master.

819
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,300
It's so sympathetic.

820
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,100
But it's true.

821
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,700
He is a musician.

822
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,700
But you have no experience.

823
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,500
Can you not throw yourself away?

824
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,100
What?

825
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,500
You came to the jade room today

826
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,900
to buy some incense

827
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
to make Miss Wu happy again?

828
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,500
How about I give you a trick?

829
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,900
I heard that there is also a fragrance of love in the jade room.

830
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,900
Why don't you buy some and go back?

831
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,500
Nice.

832
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:02,300
Wishing you the best happiness in your life serving the royal family

833
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,120
A good

834
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,020
Good

835
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,500
Did you appear in the video of Zhang Shoulder?

836
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,700
I heard that you like to give weirdos

837
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,400
You forgot to tell me

838
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,400
The most painful moment has come

839
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,400
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life

840
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,400
But I can't

841
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Look at the petals falling

842
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,400
What's wrong with falling in love?

843
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,400
The moonlight shines on the cold and bitter heart

844
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,400
I hug you and you are silent

845
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,400
But the petals are falling

846
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,400
What's wrong with falling in love?

847
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,400
The moonlight shines on the end of the memory

848
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,400
How to say goodbye?

849
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,400
You look back

850
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,400
I always want to have

851
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,400
You
