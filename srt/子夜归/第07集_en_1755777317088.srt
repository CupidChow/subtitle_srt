1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm Xu Kai. I use Taobao to buy. Ordering take-out is more advantageous.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Save me!

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Vici Laman, sing loudly.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Maidong, come back!

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The End

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This Shambosuo Jing is dead in such a powerful way.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Who is it?

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The End

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think I've been practicing for a long time.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can even make that kind of dream.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I'm ashamed to be here.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm ashamed to be taught by my master.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm ashamed to face the Fifth Lady.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The six jade is not born, the body is not disturbed.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The body is not disturbed, the heart is quiet.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The world is strange, the heart is not clear.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The seven stars are not clear, the body is quiet.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Master Hui is really a god.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm bored.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know what you're doing here.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you having fun in the West suburb?

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't understand what you're talking about.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're really boring.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Dare to do it or not?

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What are you?

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A half-human half-monster little monster.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What right do you have to teach me?

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If I was the one who got that power 18 years ago,

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I should be the one sitting in this position now.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How dare you disrespect the cat?

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What are you talking about?

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't be a traitor who has no evidence.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Traitor?

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Everyone, am I betraying him?

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Master Hui.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You're scheming against me.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You've already arranged for the demons to die here, but you won't tell me.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Master Hui, you haven't asked?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Master Hui, you really live such a long life.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're really not sensible.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
After all, I'm an old monster.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What's wrong with me?

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's wrong with me disrespecting the cat?

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm an elder after all.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What can you do to me?

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Master Hui, you're really old.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What you're going to do today is not disrespecting.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're using your spirit to get rid of the demon.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you have any evidence?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Lin Xiao.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Master.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Tell me.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I did see Master Hui using the magic of the spirit yesterday.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This magic will cause great harm to the person who lost his or her spirit.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
After all, Master Hui is old.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Will he really take the risk to use this skill?

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes, Master.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Is this wrong?

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes, or forget it.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Forget it.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Actually, it's easy to know if Master Hui uses the magic.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Just try it.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is also a thing?

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Does Master Hui have another way?

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No matter what, I'm afraid Master Hui can't get rid of it easily today.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Master Hui.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Master Hui.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What's going on?

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Master Hui took out the beam of light.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it because Master Hui's spirit is using the beam of light?

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Master Hui.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll make a bet with you.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If you use your spirit to get rid of the demon, you'll be punished.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If I use your spirit to get rid of the demon, I'll beat you ten times.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Master Hui.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you really going to beat me for a demon?

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is your conspiracy.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're so strong, but you can't break the seal of the world.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The power of the spirit is the skill of the spirit.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The first one, I'll beat you with the skill of the mirror.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm so happy to see you.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The second one, I'll beat you to get rid of the demon.

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm so happy to see you.

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The third one, I'll beat you to frame Shangguan for hurting innocent people.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
From today on, I'll put Master Hui in the demon prison.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You'll be punished.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This...

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This is the last one.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll beat you with the skill of the mirror.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm so happy to see you.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The third one, I'll beat you to get rid of the demon.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm so happy to see you.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The fourth one, I'll beat you to get rid of the demon.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm so happy to see you.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The fifth one, I'll beat you to get rid of the demon.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm so happy to see you.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The sixth one, I'll beat you to get rid of the demon.

145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm so happy to see you.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The seventh one, I'll beat you to get rid of the demon.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm so happy to see you.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're so good at this.

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You've been giving him more trouble.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Now you're going to do something to him.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're so brave.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm still the master of Hui Sect.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How dare you kill me?

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Of course I won't kill you.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's too easy for you.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll torture you every day.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll torture you every day.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let you remember your mistakes.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You can't go back.

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But you're old.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know when you'll be weak.

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You've been hurt for a long time.

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
In the end, you'll be in a state of illness.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't think I don't know what you did to Qishi.

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You killed the little demon under my door.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You destroyed my divine stone in Xi Jiao.

167
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're so good at this.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm not as good as you in terms of means.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have to say something.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's not important to kill the little demon in Xi Jiao.

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
My purpose is to make him lose Lei Ji Mu.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What do you mean?

173
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
As long as he can't get Lei Ji Mu,

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can keep the Puhua Valley.

175
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's the use of that sinister thing?

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Wu Zishu,

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
even if you're like a white paper,

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
you don't have any desire or heart.

179
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Maybe one day,

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
you and I will be companions.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm not a human.

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There's only one person I can be with.

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You fish here?

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I guess so.

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What do you mean?

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Fishing is a way to calm your mind.

187
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I sometimes fish here.

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's a kind of mood.

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What's the mood of the young man who bullied you?

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Sister Zhen, you can't blame Mrs Liu.

191
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So what if I bullied her?

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
She's so noisy that I can't calm you.

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Mrs Liu,

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you're still looking at your master.

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're so impolite.

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're looking for the grass all the way to the west.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Do you believe what you said?

198
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can believe it.

199
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You're a fool.

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You don't like him, so you don't have to bully him.

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's so weak that he can't be bullied.

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mrs Liu,

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the master you said before,

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the grass,

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
they all lied to me.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Mrs Liu,

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
if it's something else,

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you can tease me.

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But how can you tease me about this?

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All the way to the west.

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Who knows you're really going to go?

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What if I really go far away?

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No one will help you get rid of the evil.

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What should I do?

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You won't give him a hard time, will you?

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's okay.

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I really don't have it.

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I've seen it, Mrs Liu.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You didn't see it.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Maybe the snake demon is on the tree.

222
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
In the pond.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Maybe it's on you.

224
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Really?

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Since Mr Mei is so worried,

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
why don't you go to the pond and help me find it?

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
See if there's a snake demon.

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
For Mrs Liu,

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll go down and see.

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Liu Dazhen, don't go too far.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He wanted to help me get rid of the evil.

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I didn't force him.

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He'll do whatever you say.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's his problem.

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Stop it.

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's none of your business.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What?

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This...

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I didn't see it.

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I didn't see it.

241
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Calm down.

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Shouldn't you protect me first?

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're already four months old.

244
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Don't mind it.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't mind it.

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Get lost.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay.

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll get lost.

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What are you doing?

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Nothing.

251
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What are you doing?

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Boss,

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
something happened.

254
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What happened?

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
According to the county magistrate,

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
we've hired the best doctor in the west.

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But I'm afraid it's a bit urgent.

258
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
How many days has it been?

259
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Why hasn't my husband woken up yet?

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why?

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
When will he wake up?

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why are you here?

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I was going to call the police this morning.

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But I heard the injured man wasn't well.

265
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I just got the news.

266
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I came to see the situation under His Majesty's order.

267
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The county magistrate is here.

268
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Excuse me.

269
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The county magistrate is here.

270
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The county magistrate.

271
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Chief Mei.

272
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The county magistrate.

273
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't be so polite.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What's going on with them?

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I saw the three of them just now.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Although they were not in danger,

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
they were quite weak.

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm afraid they're not well-versed in medicine.

279
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Under the real condition of the medicine,

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
they still can't wake up.

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Doctor, what should we do?

282
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Please save my husband.

283
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Boss,

284
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
there's still steam flowing in their bodies.

285
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If the steam doesn't come out,

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm afraid they'll get sick when they wake up.

287
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Doctor.

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I never thought that

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
the doctors in Chang'an

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
have no way to deal with this steam.

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Someone help!

292
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
There's a ghost!

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There's a ghost!

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There's a ghost!

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What happened?

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There's a ghost.

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It was so loud.

298
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Suddenly it came in through the window.

299
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It was so scary.

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It was so scary.

301
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I didn't even see my body.

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
How can I save him?

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're too bold.

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You're so cruel.

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It was so scary.

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It was so scary.

307
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You're too bold.

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're so cruel.

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Beat him!

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Beat him!

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Beat him!

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Wait!

313
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I misunderstood.

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm not a thief.

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm not a thief.

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm the angel of Changxi Palace.

317
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What did you say?

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Changxi Palace?

319
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Changxi Palace?

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Changxi Palace?

321
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I've never heard of it.

322
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's said that Changxi Palace

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
disappeared from Chang'an a hundred years ago.

324
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
After that,

325
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
there are often people who claim to be from Changxi Palace.

326
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
In fact,

327
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
they are all rumors.

328
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You've seen too many lies.

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You said nothing

330
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and came from Changxi Palace.

331
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I thought you could kill yourself

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and enter the house.

333
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're trying to play a trick.

334
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's an accident.

335
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're a thief!

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So you mean

337
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
you were going to Chang'an to find someone,

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
but you got lost.

339
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You even lost your bag and entered the house.

340
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You wanted to eat something

341
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
but you got caught.

342
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's hard to explain.

343
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's true.

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're right.

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Your story

346
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
is full of coincidences.

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes.

348
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's a lie.

350
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's a lie.

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's a lie.

352
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're so stupid.

353
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you're really from Changxi Palace,

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
how stupid will you be?

355
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm a man of my life.

356
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Warrior,

357
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
if you're really a disciple of Changxi Palace,

358
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
why don't you prove it to us?

359
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
How?

360
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's said that the Xuanmen's way of doing things is perfect.

361
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The disciples of Changxi Palace

362
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
are very good at curing and eliminating evil.

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Now,

364
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
we're in trouble.

365
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes.

366
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
A while ago,

367
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
the doctor said that He San and others

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
were possessed.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
If you can wake them up,

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
we believe that you're not a fraud.

371
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Otherwise,

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
you're a big money thief.

373
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes.

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I can't accept it.

376
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Good.

377
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What's this?

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What's this?

379
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Why is it all medicine?

380
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What's this?

381
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why is it all medicine?

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This is a seven-step evil array.

383
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
He's so talented.

384
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This is a seven-step evil array.

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll suck out all the evil energy

386
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
from the three injured people.

387
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Everyone,

388
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
please stand back a little bit

389
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
in case you get hurt.

390
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes.

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:36,820
It's a little bit of a

392
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
bad omen.

393
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
This is such a big thing.

394
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
The mortal is doing things in a lot of ways.

395
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,820
I can understand.

396
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
Wu Xiaodou and Xianglu have got the wrong positions.

397
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
I'm afraid it's harder to get the right number of poems.

398
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
The weather is good.

399
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
The ground is cold.

400
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
The hair is long.

401
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
The body is thin.

402
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
The body is thin.

403
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
The body is thin.

404
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
The body is thin.

405
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
The body is thin.

406
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
The body is thin.

407
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
The body is thin.

408
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
The body is thick.

409
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
The waist is high.

410
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
The head is 6 foot 5 Nanjing.

411
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,380
The head is 6 foot 5 Nanjing.

412
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,380
Your waist is high.

413
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
The head was prize-winning.

414
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
The poor woman in the garden.

415
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
How can you call yourself a winner,

416
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
being 2 foot 4 Nanjing?

417
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,380
What is she doing here?

418
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,380
If you want to see it with your literalSimpleMind hurts

419
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:11,120
even for 0.6 inch of

420

pole plate to the line of death

421
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,080
but I am now

422
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,560
youroohof этот

423
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,580
You can say that you are an idiot.

424
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,380
We all Play counted.

425
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,480
I just chop down that

426
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
If I want students to take500 books.

427
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,160
Youaman

428
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,520

429

435
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,300
It's okay, its okay

436
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,720
It's what I did

437
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,000
Ji Ra

438
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,520
The name of my Shuang Dutch

439
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
better told to more people

440
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,440
he is really clever

441
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,120
you're too polite

442
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,520
Boss

443
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,080
if this guy

444
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,140
really is related to Changxi Palace

445
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,040
I'm afraid of trouble

446
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,080
youbaby

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,120
Where is the Young Master Miao

448
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
I don't know.

449
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
I didn't see him just now.

450
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Since the twin generals have arrived here,

451
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
since Oulu is showing up,

452
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
his identity will definitely be kept secret.

453
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
I have to find a place to avoid him.

454
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Thank you, Twin Generals, for your help.

455
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
You let us see a trick.

456
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
You are really open-minded.

457
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
You are also very open-minded.

458
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
I have only seen one person who can defeat me.

459
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
I didn't expect

460
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
you could fight me.

461
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
It's so embarrassing to tell others about this.

462
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
No.

463
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
We have to fight again

464
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
and have a winner-win situation.

465
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
You are tall and strong.

466
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
You are fighting with a girl.

467
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Don't you feel ashamed?

468
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
What's wrong with a girl?

469
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
We are both martial artists.

470
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
Why should we have a gender?

471
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
That's right.

472
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
It's our fate to be able to

473
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
interact with the twin generals.

474
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
I heard that you are going back to Chang'an.

475
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Why don't we go together

476
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
and have a chat on the way?

477
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Okay.

478
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Then let's go.

479
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Let's go.

480
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Let's go together.

481
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Get in the car,

482
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Tian Shi.

483
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
It's so fresh.

484
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
I said I haven't seen you for half a day.

485
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
What do you mean?

486
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
The car is waiting for me.

487
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
No.

488
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
He is waiting for me.

489
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
I finally found you.

490
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
You are...

491
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Shi Yi.

492
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,120
You don't have to see me off.

493
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
It's not the first time you are in my car.

494
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
You were so polite

495
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
when we spent the night in the mountain.

496
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Shi Yi.

497
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
What's your relationship with him?

498
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
It's a misunderstanding.

499
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Eat, Tian Shi.

500
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
You didn't pay attention.

501
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Thank you, Fifth Madam.

502
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
You are welcome.

503
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
After we left the mountain,

504
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,120
you were so polite.

505
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
It seems that the two generals

506
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
went to Chang'an to find someone.

507
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
It's you, Mr. Mei Xiang.

508
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,120
When did you two meet?

509
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
I and the two generals are from the same county.

510
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
We both like the art of learning the door.

511
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
We both like the art of learning the door.

512
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
I sent a letter to the two generals

513
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
when I arrived in Chang'an.

514
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I think he came to see me.

515
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
It's my good fortune

516
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
to meet you here today.

517
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
I've never heard that

518
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Mr. Mei Xiang has such a good sense of humor.

519
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
He is really a man of great talent.

520
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Indeed.

521
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
If it wasn't for the dark library,

522
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
I wouldn't have known

523
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
that the father of the Fifth Madam

524
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
and the two generals are of the same family.

525
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,120
What do you call each other?

526
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Brother Shi?

527
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
Brother Shi Yi?

528
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
There are so many people there.

529
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Yes.

530
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
It's very lively in Quzhou.

531
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
But as a brother,

532
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
how can you see that

533
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
he is older than you?

534
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
I'm the same age as Brother Shi.

535
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
I'm just a little older than him.

536
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Moreover,

537
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
they are ranked by age.

538
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
We are ranked by generation.

539
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
What do you mean?

540
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
We are brothers.

541
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
We are 11 brothers.

542
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
The first 10 people are ranked by age.

543
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
I'm the last one

544
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
to know the two generals.

545
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I wanted to compete with them.

546
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
But I fought with Brother Shi.

547
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
I didn't win.

548
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I can only be ranked by the end.

549
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
It seems that the young man is really good at martial arts.

550
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
I'm not that bad.

551
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
This is...

552
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
This?

553
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
This is a hunting product.

554
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
I made it for my sword.

555
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
It's a very good match for the seven-color fox tail.

556
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
It's really...

557
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
I heard your glorious fighting skills.

558
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I scared him.

559
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
So the young lady didn't hear it.

560
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Go.

561
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Go.

562
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Thank you for the five-woman escort.

563
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
We'll go now.

564
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Boss, you're talking weird today.

565
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
It's that young man who's weird.

566
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Is it weird?

567
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
This young man usually has a clear sky.

568
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
But today,

569
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
he looks a little guilty.

570
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,120
It seems that there is something like that.

571
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
They are old friends.

572
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
If the two generals really fight,

573
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
they will be in trouble.

574
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
If the two generals really have a relationship with Changxi Palace,

575
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
this young man can't be out of it.

576
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
So the boss is suspicious of Mr. Mei.

577
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
You'd better not doubt it.

578
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Keep an eye on Mei Chai.

579
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
And that young man.

580
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Okay.

581
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Then I'll ask one more question.

582
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,120
If Mr. Mei really can't be out of Changxi Palace,

583
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
what will you do?

584
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Go.

585
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Now the head of the club is in prison.

586
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
All the other three doors are in a state of shock.

587
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
I heard that there have been a lot of rumors recently

588
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,120
that the boss is impulsive.

589
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
I know what to do with you.

590
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Xiao...

591
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Brother, this is your home.

592
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Why do you suddenly come to Chang'an to find me?

593
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
There is no fresh stuff on the mountain.

594
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Since you left Changxi Palace,

595
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
I am more bored every day.

596
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
You also know that the senior brother is strict and serious.

597
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Especially now that the boss has been introduced,

598
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Mei Chai is still testing us.

599
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I can be punished nine times in three days.

600
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Don't tell me that you are not willing to be punished,

601
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
so you sneaked out of the mountain.

602
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
That's not it.

603
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
It's the senior brother who said that I'm not good at books anyway.

604
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Instead of being ready to die for the nine senior brothers every day,

605
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
I'd rather go down the mountain to see you.

606
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
To relieve physical fatigue.

607
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Maybe it will be more meaningful.

608
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Besides...

609
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Besides what?

610
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Besides, they say that I practice swordsman on the mountain every day.

611
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
I almost lost my interest in flowers and herbs.

612
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
It's not impossible for you to stay in Chang'an.

613
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
But you must make three agreements with me.

614
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Three agreements?

615
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
OK. Tell me.

616
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
First, we will be brothers in Chang'an.

617
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Second, don't mention my relationship with Changxi Palace.

618
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Third...

619
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Wait.

620
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Why?

621
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Do you know why I went down the mountain?

622
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
No.

623
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,120
I went to Chang'an to find out the truth of my parents' death.

624
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
I always feel that there is another hidden meaning behind this.

625
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Maybe it's about the monster.

626
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Monster?

627
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
You mean the monster caused the fire?

628
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
I'm not sure yet.

629
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,120
So before I find out the truth,

630
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
I need to hide my identity.

631
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
In case of being exposed.

632
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
I see.

633
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Third...

634
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Do they know about this?

635
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
I don't think so.

636
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Third...

637
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Does Master know?

638
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Yes.

639
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
Third...

640
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Please go on.

641
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Please go on.

642
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
You need to be low-key.

643
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Don't say too much.

644
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
Don't ask too much.

645
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Then...

646
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Can I ask you one more question?

647
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Just one.

648
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Do you have food?

649
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Didn't you eat all the way?

650
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
There is food in the kitchen.

651
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
I'm sorry.

652
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
I'm sorry.

653
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
I'm sorry.

654
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
I'm sorry.

655
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
I'm sorry.

656
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm sorry.

657
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
I'm sorry.

658
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
I'm sorry.

659
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm sorry.

660
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
I'm sorry.

661
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
I'm sorry.

662
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm sorry.

663
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
I'm sorry.

664
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
I'm sorry.

665
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
I'm sorry.

666
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Sorry.

667
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
I'm sorry.

668
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Sorry.

669
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
I'm sorry.

670
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Sorry.

671
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
I'm not sorry.

672
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Sorry.

673
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
Just sorry.

674
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
I'm sorry.

675
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
I'm sorry.

676
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
I'm sorry.

677
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
I'm sorry.

678
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Fighting.

679
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Fighting.

680
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
I'm the second person in the house,

681
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
who is the personal servant of my husband,

682
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
and the housekeeper of the house.

683
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
I'm the second person in the house,

684
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
who is the personal servant of my husband,

685
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,120
and the housekeeper of the house.

686
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
But there are only two people here.

687
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
And the wealth?

688
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,720
Mister Li,

689
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
these earth people are nice.

690
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Keep them at school.

691
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,180
I don't know if we can possibly return to Changsha

692
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,420
without burning these Puncheng.

693
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,260
I-I'm worried

694
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,260
if Mister Li 되iable

695
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,800
world-famous

696
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,720
dish is genuine

697
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,420
you gave us site on this test.

698
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,000
Our prize for this shall be

699
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,240
a broke dish.

700
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:41,100
I don't think it

701
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,800
Please

702
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,680
Thank you.

703
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,100
Master the Mango

704
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,380
is too light.

705
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,540
It's really

706
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,580
hard to say.

707
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,580
You're not working,

708
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,220
eating,

709
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,980
and so many other things.

710
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,020
Say it again.

711
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,460
I...

712
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,020
Stop it.

713
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,340
I'm not.

714
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,140
I'm just kidding.

715
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:57,940
Yes,

716
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,660
Master.

717
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,860
We're just kidding.

718
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,620
There's no meat in the dishes.

719
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,140
There's no money in the house.

720
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,620
Master.

721
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,420
Where are you going?

722
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,060
I'm going to buy meat.

723
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,540
You...

724
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,660
I'm...

725
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:51,940
I'm...

726
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,460
I'm...

727
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,020
Greetings, Minister.

728
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,340
The case of Xijiao,

729
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,300
it seems that the Xuanjian Bureau

730
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,940
still has no clue, right?

731
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,860
The Xijiao case is too urgent.

732
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,540
Then why don't you send more people

733
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,340
to get familiar with it?

734
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,620
Send more people?

735
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
You

736
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,020
seem to be in the mood

737
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,260
to soak your feet and sunbathe.

738
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,260
You haven't returned for two or three days,

739
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,980
and you don't send people to look for you.

740
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,340
So you

741
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,620
are broad-minded and thin.

742
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,020
You're not worried about anything

743
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,060
going on with your subordinates, right?

744
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,220
Something...

745
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,740
You mean...

746
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,100
Nothing happened.

747
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,740
Really.

748
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,380
Something happened.

749
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,380
No clue.

750
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,220
You don't listen to me.

751
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,420
Minister Xu.

752
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,500
Brother Mei, you're back.

753
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,620
Are you all right?

754
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,900
Minister Liu.

755
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,580
The Xijiao case is indeed urgent.

756
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,780
The Xuanjian Bureau has been investigating for three days.

757
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,740
We just found out the truth.

758
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,620
Please forgive us.

759
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,220
Minister Mei.

760
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
The Xijiao case

761
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,140
is well-known to His Majesty and Her Majesty.

762
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,460
Minister Mei saved the Qinghe County Magistrate.

763
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,460
Thank you very much.

764
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,660
What's going on?

765
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,140
The Xijiao case is really broken?

766
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,540
I dare not speak rashly.

767
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,540
The Xijiao case is indeed broken.

768
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,500
The Xijiao case

769
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,220
is caused by the steam in the mountains.

770
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,500
I have cleared the steam temporarily.

771
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,060
The villagers who are in a coma

772
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,380
are being saved by the doctor.

773
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,460
Minister Liu, can you send someone to check it?

774
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,540
The mountains are dense and the steam is all over the Xijiao.

775
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,340
I think we should add more guards.

776
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,700
We should set a date and time

777
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,140
to gather in the mountains

778
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,620
to train the plants and birds.

779
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,020
In this way, we can prevent this from happening again.

780
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,340
Okay.

781
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,940
You are young and powerful.

782
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,260
You know what you are doing.

783
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,660
Minister Xu.

784
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,980
Minister Xu.

785
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,020
If you have this in mind,

786
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,300
the Xuanjian Bureau

787
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,020
will not be the common food

788
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,140
of the imperial guards that the people have been cursing for years.

789
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,860
Minister Mei.

790
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,460
Since you have made this contribution,

791
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,820
I will reward you.

792
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,460
You don't have to refuse.

793
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,540
It's right to reward you.

794
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,780
We should also let the Xuanjian Bureau

795
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,180
see that

796
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,100
this is not a place for the idle.

797
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,180
As long as we really do our duty as citizens,

798
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,300
the court will not treat us badly.

799
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,940
Minister Liu.

800
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,860
I don't want to refuse.

801
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,500
Then tell me.

802
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,260
What reward do you want?

803
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,340
I want to pull out the trigger.

804
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,740
That's the right thing to do.

805
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,940
Then Zhuo Sheng, you go...

806
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,660
I still want to be in the Xuanjian Bureau.

807
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Xuanjian Bureau?

808
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,980
Then the Xuanjian Bureau

809
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,100
only has one guard.

810
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,380
It's useful for you.

811
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,140
Yes.

812
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,540
That's enough.

813
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,500
Minister Liu.

814
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,140
Now I'm sorry.

815
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,740
Please come.

816
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,500
By my heart,

817
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,660
I didn't expect

818
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,420
this mysterious lady

819
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,300
to have such courage!

820
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:07,940
I think it's not a big deal, it's a big deal.

821
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
That's right.

822
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,940
In front of Minister Xu,

823
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,940
saying to replace him,

824
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,940
it's simply unlawful.

825
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Minister Liu left,

826
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,940
Minister Xu didn't scold anyone.

827
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,940
Oh, it's hard to believe.

828
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,940
You're almost on his head.

829
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,940
He didn't scold you.

830
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,580
What did you say afterwards?

831
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
Go, go, go.

832
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,580
That...

833
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,580
Brother Mei,

834
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
I'm just a rumor.

835
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
This Qinghe County Master

836
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,580
asked you to come to the Ruyi House at 5 o'clock.

837
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,580
A little bit of wine.

838
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,580
Let's talk.

839
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,580
I'm here.

840
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
Didn't you say you'd meet that Mr. Mei for dinner?

841
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
People say work is busy,

842
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
not good at drinking, so they made an appointment.

843
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
This whole Chang'an

844
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
dared to marry the fifth lady.

845
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,580
I'm afraid he's the first person.

846
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
He's the first person to enter the history book.

847
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
You say,

848
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
is this fox getting more and more annoying?

849
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
As long as I can't get Lei Ji Mu,

850
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I can keep that Puhua Valley.

851
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,580
What's the use of that sinister creature?

852
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,580
Wu Zishu,

853
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,580
even if you

854
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,580
come to this world

855
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,580
like a white paper,

856
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,580
you really don't have any selfish desires?

857
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,220
You're so ambitious!

858
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,220
Uncle?

859
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,220
What?

860
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,220
What's wrong with you?

861
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,220
You've been in a daze these two days.

862
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,220
Nothing.

863
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,220
It's just that the fox house is busy lately.

864
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,220
I'm a little tired.

865
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,220
By the way,

866
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,220
speaking of Mr. Mei,

867
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,220
his cousin is selling on the street.

868
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,860
He's really a weirdo.

869
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Very suspicious.

870
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,860
But,

871
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,860
do you think the people of the Changxi Palace

872
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,860
are really that stupid?

873
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,860
For hundreds of years,

874
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,860
the demon family has been in conflict with the Changxi Palace.

875
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,860
They have been fighting with each other.

876
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,860
If the Changxi Palace really comes back,

877
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,860
the trouble of the demon family will be great.

878
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,860
What skill does he have?

879
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,860
Maybe we'll know if we try it.

880
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,860
Try?

881
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,860
Boss,

882
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,700
Boss,

883
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,700
what are you going to do?

884
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
Let's see what kind of east wind

885
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
can be seen in Chang'an today.

886
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,700
The fireworks in the mortal world

887
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,700
The flowers are falling

888
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,700
The old days are burning in my heart

889
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,700
The past is not regretted

890
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,700
The spring is full of sorrow

891
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,700
The four seasons are passing by

892
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,700
The night rain is falling

893
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,540
The old days are passing by

894
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,540
The spring is full of sorrow

895
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,540
The four seasons are passing by

896
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,540
The night rain is falling

897
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,540
The spring is full of sorrow

898
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,540
The four seasons are passing by

899
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,540
The four seasons are passing by

900
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,540
The four seasons are passing by

901
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,540
The four seasons are passing by

902
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,540
Love is gone, it can be forgotten

903
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,540
The past is turned into a sea of grass

904
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,540
Passed by the present

905
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,540
Memories are like the past that have never left

906
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,540
The persistence of not retreating

907
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:43,540
The fire of the past is love

908
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
If the past can come back

909
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,540
Everything will change

910
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,540
Now I wait for you for the rest of my life

911
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,540
See destiny break through the fog

912
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:07,540
Love is gone, it can be forgotten

913
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,540
The past is turned into a sea of grass

914
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,540
Passed by the present

915
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,540
Memories are like the past that have never left

916
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,540
The persistence of not retreating

917
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,540
The fire of the past is love

918
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,540
If the past can come back

919
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,540
Everything will change
