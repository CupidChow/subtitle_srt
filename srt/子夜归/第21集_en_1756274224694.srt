00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 15

2
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,300
I didn't expect that Ruyi House has been set up.

3
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,100
Master, I was wrong.

4
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,200
I don't dare to do it again.

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,400
Mr. Pei has already left Chang'an.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,500
Since you've already been discovered,

7
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,600
I think he won't look for you again.

8
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,800
Ruyi House won't use you anymore.

9
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,200
Master, please give me another chance.

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
You shouldn't have thought of anything else

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
by using my money to do your work.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,600
A person who is good at both ends will only get one credit.

13
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Go to the account book and pay the money.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
1 hour earlier

15
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,200
What did Master Mei do today?

16
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,200
He has been walking for more than ten times in just half a day.

17
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,600
He's still smiling.

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,000
Is he going to have a baby again?

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You haven't done anything this morning.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,200
You're just counting how many times you've walked in your life.

21
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
How many times have you smiled?

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,800
Isn't this too fresh? I've never seen him like this before.

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,400
But it's indeed a bit fresh.

24
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
But it's not right to say it like that.

25
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Everyone in Chang'an is saying that it's Minister Mei

26
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,400
and that Pei family's husband who are fighting for the throne in the Prime Minister's mansion.

27
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,400
They've caused the King of Qinghe to be upset and they've driven them both out.

28
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,000
I thought that he would be so embarrassed to be on duty today.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,200
Who are you talking about being embarrassed?

30
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Of course, it's Mei.

31
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
It's not 40.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's not 40. We're not talking about you.

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then who are you talking about?

34
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,600
We're talking about the King of the Golden Wood.

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,800
Why is he crying?

36
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,200
The King of the Golden Wood just threw another case.

37
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,800
He said that the King of the Golden Wood was busy introducing the King of Qinghe to the Prime Minister.

38
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,800
He didn't have time to handle it, so he pushed it to our side again.

39
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Today, the Empress called you to discuss the matter with Ji Ya.

40
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Cousin left suddenly, so there's a reason.

41
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,400
Good thing you rejected a lot of men.

42
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,600
They left in sadness and it went smoothly.

43
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Gu'er, which man did you reject again?

44
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
Today is the day to build the tomb.

45
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
You're not busy today?

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,800
Look who I brought you.

47
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
This is my brother Song Yao. He just came back from the border of Yi State.

48
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,600
He's very good at riding and shooting. He won't lose to you.

49
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,000
Song Yao, greetings to the King of Qinghe.

50
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
What's going on?

51
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,400
Didn't you just drive away two young lords?

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Huang Zuo Ling insisted on finding you a man.

53
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
I thought it would be better to meet him.

54
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Besides, this young man is not bad.

55
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
Maybe he's from Liang Yuan.

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,600
Gu'er, sit.

57
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
I introduced you to eight men a year.

58
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
None of them were of your interest.

59
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,800
This time, I finally found a man who suits you.

60
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,000
I won't disappoint you.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I know that you like this kind of man who's always good.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,600
I've been observing you for a long time.

63
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm just joking.

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,400
Actually, I've heard of your name for a long time.

65
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
I've admired you for a long time.

66
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Admired me for what?

67
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Admired me for what?

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
I need to be nervous.

69
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm joking. You don't need to answer.

70
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,400
Minister Mei, why are you here?

71
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Today, the Jinwu Guards have filed a case against Xuanjian Bureau.

72
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
I've looked at it carefully.

73
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,800
I've found that the case should be within the jurisdiction of the Jinwu Guards.

74
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,400
I have a new friend today.

75
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,200
Those workers are thinking of bothering Xuanjian Bureau and Minister Mei.

76
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
They want to help.

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I heard that Huang Zuo Ling has a friend from Yi Zhou.

78
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,400
I think it's this man.

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm Song Yao.

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Xuanjian Bureau has no main fish.

81
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Minister Mei, although Song is in the Yi Zhou army,

82
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
he has been greatly appreciated by the Yi Zhou governor.

83
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
He has a bright future.

84
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I think he and Wu Er are a good match.

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I see.

86
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
You're indeed a good match.

87
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Thank you, Minister Mei.

88
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Since you've been in Yi Zhou for many years,

89
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
and you're respected,

90
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I think you know very well about Yi Zhou.

91
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Of course.

92
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
I know about Yi Zhou very well.

93
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
If you want to go to Yi Zhou for a trip,

94
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
you can ask me if you have any questions.

95
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
No need.

96
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,200
I just have something to ask you.

97
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I heard that there are many days of drought in the north of Yi Zhou.

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I wonder if there are any solutions now.

99
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Maybe there are.

100
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
The drought in the Yi Zhou mountain has been rampant for many years.

101
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I think it's been solved.

102
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I think so.

103
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
The Yi Zhou county has frequent benefits.

104
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Have you found the source?

105
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
I think so.

106
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
What about the river?

107
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Actually,

108
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I don't know.

109
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm not sure.

110
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm being rude.

111
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
These are the cases of the Imperial Guards of Jingwu

113
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
since I took office.

114
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I've re-released them.

115
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Although they've been dealt with,

116
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I hope that the Imperial Guards can review them

117
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
and find a way to correct them.

118
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I think Huang Suoling won't refuse them.

119
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes.

120
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
If you're wrong,

121
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
you're like shooting a wrong target.

122
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,200
I heard that you're a master of archery.

123
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't think you'll make the same mistake.

124
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Right?

125
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
You heard it all?

127
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I heard a little.

128
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Eight in a year.

129
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,200
It's not my fault.

131
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I know.

132
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
He won't introduce you to him again.

133
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Jingwu will be busy tomorrow.

134
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Didn't you say that they were separated?

136
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
It's a rumour.

137
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
So, that Secretary Mei was...

138
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Why are you asking about her?

139
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
You don't even know the truth.

140
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
You're cold-hearted.

141
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
You look like a knife.

142
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
You're so uncomfortable.

143
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
And you look like...

144
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
like I stole his woman.

145
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
You'll be so rude to me.

146
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
You should be careful.

147
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,200
If he really hits you,

148
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I don't think she'll help you.

149
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
They say brothers are like brothers.

150
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Women are like women.

151
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
My son has a family.

152
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
And he treats his brother like that?

153
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Here's a warning.

154
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
When you tell my son to find a husband,

155
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,200
remember to check if he's scared.

156
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
They're really together.

158
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
You've been talking for a long time.

159
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Can you be quiet?

160
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,200
But I really can't take it anymore.

161
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
If you can't take it, then bear with it.

162
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,200
They're here.

163
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Brother-in-law.

164
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Brother, I remember I'm your cousin.

165
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Yes, I remember that too.

166
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Come here, Zhu Yu.

167
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
It's boring.

168
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
It's just a night market.

169
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
They sell ordinary things.

170
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,200
They say it's a place for lovers to date.

171
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,200
I heard you and your cousin were kicked out of the palace.

172
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I wanted to comfort you.

173
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
But I was wrong.

174
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Zhu Yu, you're really a big help to the Mei family.

175
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Don't make a fuss, Brother. I really like men.

176
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I can see that.

177
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
I thought you would object.

178
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I've experienced it.

179
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I know how happy it is to have a relationship with men and women.

180
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
But I have to remind you.

181
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
There are many men and women who fall in love.

182
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,200
But there are very few couples who can be together until old age.

183
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Xiaomeng, I just hope you don't end up like me.

184
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
You end up in a happy state.

185
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I thought you and Zhen didn't match.

186
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,200
But now I really hope you two can be together.

187
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Why?

188
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Because...

189
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Because we're in the same situation.

190
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm willing to do anything.

191
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,200
But I'm your cousin after all.

192
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I can go far faster than you.

193
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I like him now.

194
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,200
I don't want to worry about the future.

195
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Even if we see each other for a few nights, I can still take it.

196
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
It's a long time.

197
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
And it's not just for a husband.

198
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
You know everything.

199
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,200
I don't have to stop you.

200
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,200
As you said, being a demon is a long life.

201
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
But that's the only way to be a human.

202
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,200
You can leave whenever you want.

203
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Do whatever you want.

204
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Thank you.

205
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,200
But if you get hurt because of love, don't come to me to cry.

206
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
I know.

207
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Look.

208
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Amazing.

209
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
He said he had a incense.

210
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
When he breathed, the incense was burnt.

211
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
It was a burning flame. It wasn't a dead body.

212
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,200
It's good to study hard.

213
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,200
But sometimes, you don't have to study hard.

214
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
It's snowing.

216
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Why is it snowing today?

217
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I don't like snow.

218
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
It never snow in Quzhou.

219
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,200
It's cold this morning. It's also early.

220
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
What's wrong?

221
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
What's wrong?

222
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I remember when I was young,

223
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
every time it snowed,

224
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,200
my mother would cook three eggs.

225
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
One for each person.

226
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,200
She said that this would make her happy and peaceful.

227
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
It's a lie.

228
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
It's been so many years.

229
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Boss, check please.

230
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Zhou Yu, guess what I'm holding in my hand.

231
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Eggs.

232
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Why are you so smart?

233
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Mom said that she would cook eggs for me every year.

234
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Which one do you want?

235
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
This one.

236
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I'll bring it to dad.

237
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Go ahead.

238
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
You're so good.

239
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Dad!

240
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Eggs.

241
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Eggs.

242
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I'll go buy something.

243
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
I'll go find Xiaomeng.

244
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
I'll wait for you, Mrs Liu.

245
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Zhou Yu, did Zhen say when she would be back?

246
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Dad!

247
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Uncle, why are you here?

248
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
What's the matter?

249
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
I have something to say.

250
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:31,620
music

251
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,480
music

252
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,740
music

253
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,420
sound of footsteps

254
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,740
music

255
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,060
So it was me again

256
00:19:52,060 --> 00:20:16,160
Dpm

257
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
You're awake.

258
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
You took the wrong medicine.

259
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Why are you torturing me?

260
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
You like the plum blossom fish.

261
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
You must be lying.

262
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
It's true.

263
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
I do like it.

264
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Xiao Chen, have you forgotten

265
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
that you're a monster?

266
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
So what?

267
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I'm a monster, but I'm also a human.

268
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
I have friends.

269
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Friends and family.

270
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Of course, you should have a lover.

271
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Then you need so many people.

272
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
You have me.

273
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
We're not enough.

274
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Uncle, we will be together for a long time.

275
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
But I have only been with them for decades.

276
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I just lived in vain.

277
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,160
I also want to experience a mortal life.

278
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
You're really different.

279
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
No wonder an elder is defeated by you.

280
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
You're capable.

281
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
You have your own ideas.

282
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,160
You're no longer the little cat

283
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
who is like a moth.

284
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Yes, I'm grown up.

285
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
So you can rest assured.

286
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
When did you like him?

287
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Is it because of the twin-lifes?

288
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
He's willing to die for you and you like him?

289
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,160
It's different.

290
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
I like him.

291
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
It's different.

292
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,160
I like him

293
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
earlier than this.

294
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Maybe it's when he said

295
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
the women are not in love.

296
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Or maybe

297
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
I'm so desperate

298
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
that he can understand me

299
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
and tolerate me and play with me.

300
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
But he

301
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,160
is just an ordinary mortal.

302
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
What's going on?

303
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
What's going on?

304
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Why is the fire burning?

305
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
I didn't see anyone save the fire.

306
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
What happened, Xiao Zhu Yu?

307
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Are you okay?

308
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Where are Zhen and Liu?

309
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Let's go.

310
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
He's not an ordinary mortal.

311
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
In my heart,

312
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
he's different from others.

313
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
He's good.

314
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Good?

315
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
A Shu,

316
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
in the demon world,

317
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
I'm a monster with a half-demon body.

318
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
In the human world,

319
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
I'm a playboy who's out of the box.

320
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
For the past eight years,

321
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
I've been watching over both sides.

322
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
But I've been guided by others.

323
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Only in his eyes,

324
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
I'm Wu Zhen.

325
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
I don't need to explain

326
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
or change.

327
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
In his eyes,

328
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
I feel at ease.

329
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
So,

330
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
you mean

331
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I've never made you feel at ease?

332
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
We've done so much for each other

333
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
because we're companions and friends.

334
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
But he's different.

335
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
He really acknowledges me

336
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
and likes me.

337
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
But I like you too.

338
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
What did you say?

339
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
I said I was more than interested in you.

340
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Eighteen years ago, I was completely forgotten.

341
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
I didn't have a way out.

342
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
For the past eight years,

343
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
I've lived only for you.

344
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Xiao Zhen,

345
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
you said I'm yours.

346
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Can you

347
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
not have anyone else?

348
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
I don't know.

349
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Then you know it now.

350
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
You know why I've been helping you

351
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
and why I did everything for you.

352
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
You know why you're the only one

353
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
who can come into my life.

354
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
You know why your wish will become my belief.

355
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
You know it now.

356
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Do you still want to choose him?

357
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Xiao Zhen,

358
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
we've been together for eighteen years.

359
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
We've only been friends for a few months.

360
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Do you still want to choose him?

361
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
I've always thought you're my best friend.

362
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Friend?

363
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
You should go.

364
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
A'Shuo.

365
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Go!

366
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Go!

367
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Are you okay?

368
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
During the days of Hui Men,

369
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
I haven't been able to choose a new elder.

370
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
I have no honor or honor to be in the family.

371
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Let Wu Zi Shu take the chance for now.

372
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Let him calm down.

373
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
Okay.

374
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
I'll go.

375
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Okay.

376
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Xiao Zhu Yu,

377
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
don't be too anxious.

378
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Zhen sister will be fine.

379
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
She can't be fine.

380
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Xiao Zhu Yu, you need not worry.

381
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Mei Zhu Yu.

382
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
What are you looking for?

383
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Miss Liu, where are you?

384
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Where did you go?

385
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
What's wrong?

386
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
That night 18 years ago...

387
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
I was thinking about it too.

388
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
I thought...

389
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
I thought you wouldn't want to either.

390
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
It's my fault.

391
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,160
I shouldn't have left.

392
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
It's not your fault.

393
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
It's also good.

394
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm happy.

395
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
I'm happy.

396
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
I love you.

397
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I'm happy.

398
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
I'm happy.

399
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Have you heard?

400
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
That day I heard that they had an argument.

401
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
They changed so fast.

402
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
The world is changing so fast.

403
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
It's like a cloud.

404
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
I think the rumors shouldn't be too detailed.

405
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
It makes people feel suspicious.

406
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Are you alright?

407
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
You two are being careless.

408
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Are you here to handle the case?

409
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm looking for someone.

410
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Looking for me?

411
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
When you're not dead,

412
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
there's a request in the palace.

413
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

414
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Your Highness.

415
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
You don't have to kneel.

416
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
A-Jie, you...

417
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
You're too biased.

418
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Alright, alright. Get up.

419
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Get up.

420
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
You don't have to blame A-Jie.

421
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I think she's happy for you.

422
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I heard that you two are getting married.

423
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
I heard that you two are in love.

424
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Is that true?

425
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Ming Zhuang sent you a message again?

426
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
There are so many rumors.

427
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I still need to be talented.

428
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Let Ming Zhuang say it.

429
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Your Highness,

430
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
this is not a rumor.

431
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
It seems that you two are different.

432
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
It's probably because

433
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
I understood something

434
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
after I met the Fifth Mistress.

435
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Look.

436
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
They're so close.

437
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
How about this?

438
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I'll issue an order

439
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
to grant you two a marriage.

440
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
A marriage?

441
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
What?

442
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
You two are married?

443
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Married?

444
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
You told me before

445
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
that you didn't want to get married.

446
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Do you still think that way?

447
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
How can you two

448
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
force a marriage?

449
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

450
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
now I want to marry her.

451
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
When will the Fifth Mistress

452
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
marry me?

453
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
When will I marry her?

454
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
You've thought it through?

455
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
I've thought it through.

456
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
That's great.

457
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
That's great.

458
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Fifth Mistress.

459
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
What is it?

460
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I grew up in Xuzhou.

461
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
I was raised by my master.

462
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Although he's dead,

463
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
I still want to go back

464
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
and talk to him.

465
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
You want to go back to Xuzhou?

466
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Yes.

467
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
It's a long way.

468
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
I want to leave today.

469
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Today?

470
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
You're in such a hurry.

471
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
I'll come back earlier.

472
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Give me ten days.

473
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
I'll be back in ten days.

474
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Fifth Mistress.

475
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
I'll keep my word.

476
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
I'll keep my word.

477
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,160
I...

478
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
I...

479
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
I...

480
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
I just...

481
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
don't want this.

482
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
You...

483
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
You...

484
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
I'm sorry.

485
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
I'm sorry.

486
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
I'm sorry.

487
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I will be back in ten days.

488
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:46,160
The more I climb the window, the more I can't leave.

489
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,160
The more I look into your eyes, the more I remember.

490
00:34:52,160 --> 00:35:00,160
The more ruthless, the more I'm afraid of you.

491
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,160
The more I look into your eyes, the more I remember.

492
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,160
The more ruthless, the more I'm afraid of you.

493
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,160
The more I look into your eyes, the more I remember.

494
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Then the wind blows, then the moon falls, then I can't leave.

495
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:31,160
The long night slowly falls into my dreams.

496
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Then the heartbeats, then the laughter, then the scenery.

497
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:46,160
I look for you in the fire of death.

498
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Then the wind blows, then the moon falls, then I can't leave.

499
00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:00,160
The long night slowly falls into my dreams.

500
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Then the heartbeats, then the laughter, then the scenery.

501
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:14,160
I look for you in the fire of death.

502
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:26,160
I look for you in the fire of death.

503
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
Wu Senior!

504
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,160
I thought that when Junior Shi was in Chang'an,

505
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,160
he was in his prison, and he couldn't bear to come back.

506
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Wu Senior!

507
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,160
I thought that when Junior Shi was in Chang'an,

508
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,160
he was in his prison, and he couldn't bear to come back.

509
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Wu Senior!

510
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
I'm just kidding.

511
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Wu Senior, are you waiting for me here?

512
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
No.

513
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,160
I'm just fattened.

514
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Wu Senior!

515
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
I'm just fattened.

516
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
I'm just fattened.

517
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
I just finished my formation.

518
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
Wu Senior!

519
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
You should have stopped him!

520
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,160
I didn't stop him.

521
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm sorry, Third Senior.

522
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I thought that it was just the original peach forest and bamboo forest,

523
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
but it turned into pond water.

524
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
I didn't expect the formation to be here.

525
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
It's all because of the guy who was a twin.

526
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,160
He was a peasant, and he was a peasant.

527
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
All my fruits were dark.

528
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
He ate them all.

529
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
He was very powerful in formation.

530
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,160
I thought that I could dig a pond.

531
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,160
But he came back and caught fish in my pond.

532
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,160
He even grilled fish in front of me.

533
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,160
I didn't do this to protect the outsiders.

534
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,160
I did it to protect him.

535
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Chihua.

536
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Stop talking nonsense.

537
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Go inside.

538
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
I'm sorry.

539
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Go inside.

540
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Second Senior.

541
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Wu Senior.

542
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Wu Senior.

543
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Greetings, Senior.

544
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
I'm sorry.

545
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
I'm sorry.

546
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
I'm sorry.

547
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm sorry.

548
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
I'm sorry.

549
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
I'm sorry.

550
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
I'm sorry.

551
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,160
I'm sorry.

552
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
I'm sorry.

553
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
I'm sorry.

554
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
I'm sorry.

555
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
