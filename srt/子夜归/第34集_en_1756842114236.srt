00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000

little bit of a

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,220
уют

33
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,800

elbow

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What can I do?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's early in the morning.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The doctor is not here.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Is there someone inside?

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No one.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Really no one.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We grew up together.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't know you.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are the only one who knows.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Tell me, who is inside?

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No one. I told you there is no one.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now you rejected the marriage of Mrs Liu.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Which woman can you go with?

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is it...

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is it...

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is it...

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Is it...

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't talk nonsense.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't want to be embarrassed.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Fine, I talk nonsense.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now your sister is going to the south of Meisi to play in the water.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now your sister is going to the south of Meisi to play in the water.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Your business is on me.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
After all, your sister is not here.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't let you go wrong.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't let you go wrong.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let me see who is inside.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Huang Dazhuang.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There is no one inside.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Really no one?

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What is Chang'an doing now?

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Catch the thief.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What if you meet a suspicious car?

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Check it.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let me see.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Stop looking. I said there is no one.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There is no one.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why is there no one?

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Sir.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Really no one?

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I said there is no one.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Come on, show him the bigger face.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Who wants to see?

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Go.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where is he?

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He is tired. Have you seen him?

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Who are you?

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you here for the music?

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What is wrong with you?

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Show me.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Who is he?

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You run too east.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What?

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why should I let you die in the heat?

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's the big deal?

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why do you still want to reject her?

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You don't want to show your feelings.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Nonsense.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who told you that I like her?

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Tell me. Who told you?

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ling Xiao.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll teach him a lesson.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You became the guest of Mei Si and the leader.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ying Long became the red bride.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I became a fool and have so many grandparents.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's normal to care about her before she left.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Leave?

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Where are you going?

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't want to tell you so soon.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going to fly in the sky soon.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm going to fly in the sky soon.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm going to fly in the sky soon.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Congratulations.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't care about my grandfather.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Except for Mei Si,

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I hope he's perfect.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What does it have to do with me?

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Come with me.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll show you something.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mei Si is not here.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Come in.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Come in.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes, you can leave.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're really a useless person.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What is he doing?

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That fool has been messing around.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know where he got this idea.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He said that as long as he ate this raw chicken heart,

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
he could be cured in 49 days.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He can eat it in a few days.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm almost sick of it.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What's in the cup?

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Guess.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He said that as long as you smell it,

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you'll be familiar with the taste of raw chicken blood.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You won't be sick of it the next time.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And the day before yesterday,

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
on the night of the full moon,

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
he insisted on letting me bite his neck.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That way, he could turn into a demon.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, your demon-like trick is just that obvious.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't let him buy any magic tricks on the carpet.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Did you bite him?

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Of course not. Is it dirty?

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then he said he would bite me instead.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He only needed to take a drop of my blood.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He chased me for a whole night.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You let him bite you?

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I beat him.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you should stop him.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He may not look smart,

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but he can't be this stupid.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
will be gone soon.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There's something

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I want to ask you.

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Prove it to the demon.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's not important.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I want to ask you

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
if the demon is not busy,

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
you can come back and see him more.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
To see him more

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is to give him more joy.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The life of a little man is too short.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I think

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it's not easy

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to have a little joy in life.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're thinking about him

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and you're not a guest.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm just

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
a friend.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll leave it to you.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay, I'll leave it.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll go first.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well,

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll go.

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll go.

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll go.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll go.

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Who touched my painting?

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
My painting?

193
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You touched my blood.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I know you're worried about my brother.

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But you're right.

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He's always

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
trying his best.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sure he'll be fine.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I didn't know

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
what you think of my brother.

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're so stubborn.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you had told me earlier,

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I could have said something good for you.

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I didn't mean to overpower you.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Go back.

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This book is really

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
a close friend.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're not a good fighter.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I have to go.

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's become a habit

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
for you to come to my place.

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But I remember

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the rule of this library is

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to not enter.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's too hard for me.

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You must be tired of me.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The demons in the demon world think that I am dead.

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If I wander outside all day long,

219
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
what if someone finds me?

220
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It won't be of any use to you.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If not,

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
please send me away from the demon world first.

223
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So that I can help you outside the demon world.

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I was trapped in the demon world,

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but I let out the old man who has many tricks like you.

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you want to do something to Xiao Zhen,

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm afraid no one can stop you.

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Lord Shu, you are right.

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You brought me back.

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
How could I act without permission and plan it?

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Is that so?

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The Demon Lord

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Then what do you want this demon pill for?

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Who do you want to harm?

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Wu Zi Shu.

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You are the confidant of the evil spirit.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You are not as ambitious as your master.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's always because of a half demon.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You are so arrogant.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If the Demon Lord knows that you are so useless,

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm afraid you will be in trouble.

242
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Lord Hui, you are so rude.

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But where were you 18 years ago?

244
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you were in the demon world,

245
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
you would have succeeded.

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It seems that you have been with the Demon Lord for many years.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You are not as good as I know you.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You are not invading the demon world, but you are a repeat.

249
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The founder of the demon world in Chang'an

250
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
is the evil spirit.

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What?

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You really don't know?

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I have been living here for a thousand years.

254
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
At that time, Chang'an was not called Chang'an.

255
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I am the Shujing in the mountains.

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The demons and I are not happy to live and work in the mountains.

257
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But those damn mortals

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
are making a mess here for their own selfish desires.

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
They are making a mess here.

260
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
My mountain is empty.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
If it weren't for those damn mortals,

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
why would we hide here?

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We are so poor.

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We are just protecting ourselves.

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
These stupid demons

266
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
have built the demon world

267
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and rebuilt the evil spirit.

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They have subverted the mortal world.

269
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But the second king

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
is despicable and shameless.

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He took control of the demon world

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and left Chang'an.

273
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He is just like the king of mortals.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He just wants to inherit the power of the demon world.

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No wonder he is not good at cat and snake.

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The source is here.

277
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's right.

278
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What do they mean to me?

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I have waited for a thousand years.

280
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I have been waiting and hoping.

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I have been thinking about it.

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Until 18 years ago,

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the king finally came back.

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You are right.

285
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If I could leave the demon world that day,

286
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I would not be defeated by the cat and snake.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You are useless.

288
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I tell you,

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I dare not be under the control of the mortals.

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
My master is worthy of my follow-up.

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
For the sake of the mortals,

292
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,540
he made us

293
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,000
to be self-sufficient and self-conceited.

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He made us to be unsteady.

295
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
How can he lead the demon world?

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This place belongs to us.

297
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
No matter what he does,

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I must find a way to revive the blood and kill the ghost.

299
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I must build a new Chang'an for him.

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I will respect the mortals.

301
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I will not be a nobody.

302
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Brother Wu.

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This is my wife, Wu Zhen.

304
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is my Fifth Senior Brother Lu Yang

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
who is in Changxi Palace.

306
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He is the most famous physician.

307
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
How do you do, Fifth Senior Brother?

308
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Brother,

309
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
幸会 弟妹

310
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm glad to meet you, my brother.

311
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
五师兄没有在瀑布守着

312
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Fifth Brother is not guarding the waterfall.

313
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
看来双将最近没有偷鱼吃

314
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It seems that the two generals have not been stealing fish for food recently.

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
是

316
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes.

317
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
这倒不像他的性子

318
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This is not like his temperament.

319
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
他最近在忙什么

320
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What is he busy with recently?

321
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
三师兄

322
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:25,020
I'm busy with the

323
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
知道了

324
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
Let's go.

325
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
他忙

326
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
He's busy.

327
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,020
你就没有什么正经的愿望吗

328
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Don't you have any serious wishes?

329
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
正经的愿望

330
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
If you have any serious wishes,

331
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,020
我就要去找你

332
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
I'm going to go to find you.

333
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,020
走

334
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
走

335
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
Go

336
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
走

337
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
走

338
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
走

339
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,020
走

340
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,020
走

341
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,020
走

342
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,020
走

343
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,020
走

344
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
走

345
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
走

346
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
走

347
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,020
走

348
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,020
走

349
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,020
走

350
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
走

351
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,020
走

352
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,020
正经

353
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
发财

354
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,020
查个账而已

355
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,020
发什么愣啊

356
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
三师兄你来干什么

357
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
竹宇回来了

358
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
师哥回来了

359
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
你要吓死我呀

360
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
师哥

361
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
这便是竹宇的娘子

362
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
何止呢

363
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,020
还是妖室的猫公

364
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
准确地说

365
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
是失了记忆的妖室猫公

366
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
这个妖怪进长夕宫

367
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020
是不是哪里怪怪的

368
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
行了

369
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,020
咱们自己的前掌门

370
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
刚刚出了那么大的事

371
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
就别忙着挑别人的理了

372
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,020
嗯

373
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
这次我们就要找个人

374
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
找个人

375
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
找个人

376
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
找个人

377
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,020
找个人

378
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
找个人

379
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
找个人

380
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
找个人

381
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,020
找个人

382
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
找个人

383
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
找个人

384
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
找个人

385
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
找个人

386
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,020
找个人

387
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,020
找个人

388
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
找个人

389
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,020
来者是客

390
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
岩甫

391
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
嗯

392
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
躲这么远做什么

393
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
我

394
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
我

395
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
我没躲

396
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
没躲

397
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,020
没躲你站八丈远

398
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
过来

399
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,020
过来

400
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
过来

401
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,020
四师兄

402
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
你这是做什么

403
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
不对

404
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,020
是四师兄害怕什么呢

405
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,020
四师兄莫非怕弟妹

406
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
弟妹生得不错

407
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
有什么可紧张可怕的

408
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
我觉得

409
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,020
你们对他了解还是太少了

410
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020
没事

411
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
他眼下对自己的了解也不多

412
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,020
既如此

413
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
便留在宫中

414
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
休整几日吧

415
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
长西宫藏书众多

416
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
或许能找到解法

417
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,020
多谢师兄

418
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
那个

419
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
竹玉好歹是从长西宫出去的

420
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,020
咱们断没有见死不救的道理

421
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
不是

422
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
五娘子虽说是妖

423
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,020
可妖怪也分善恶

424
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
此次下山你还没明白吗

425
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
我知道

426
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
但是

427
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
五娘子是好人

428
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
便是恢复记忆

429
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
也不会对我等不利

430
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
我只想说一句

431
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:33,020
他俩是住一间房还是两间房

432
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
既然弟妹暂住在你原先的屋子

433
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
那你就去同庄将挤挤

434
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,020
明白了

435
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,020
左右两间房一墙之隔

436
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
若有什么事倒也方便

437
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,020
麻烦了

438
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
不必这么客气

439
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
都是一家人

440
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
只是房间难免粗陋

441
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
待会儿多取些日用

442
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
尽量让弟妹住得舒适些

443
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,020
你们谁去取

444
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,020
我

445
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
我去

446
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,020
莲府是不是变了很多

447
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
是

448
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,020
回来后就这样了

449
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,020
比以前情快多了

450
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,020
大概怕过往与长明走得太近

451
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
我们会同他算账

452
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
你们不会的

453
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
是啊

454
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,020
他要自己付心虚

455
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
我们还真未曾想到此处

456
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,020
罢了

457
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
如今掌门这位空选

458
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
掌门的很多事务都被分摊下来

459
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,020
有他帮手我们倒也算轻松

460
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
双将回来后都开始管账了

461
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,020
嗯

462
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
所以说

463
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
郎君是长西宫天师

464
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
而我是长安妖室的猫公

465
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,020
太有意思了

466
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
可惜我什么也不记得

467
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
那我会有妖法吗

468
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,020
你试试

469
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
嗯

470
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
嗯

471
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
嗯

472
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
嗯

473
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,020
嗯

474
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,020
嗯

475
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
嗯

476
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
嗯

477
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,020
嗯

478
00:24:52,020 --> 00:25:18,700
Okay.

479
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
That's awesome.

480
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,200
You have nothing.

481
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,720
Violet.

482
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
What's this?

483
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
What?

484
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Give it back to you.

485
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
How...

486
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
How could he...

487
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,020
What are you doing?

488
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
I'm calling you.

489
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,020
I didn't expect that you would come.

490
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
It's so late.

491
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
Why aren't you sleeping?

492
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
The bed is too hard.

493
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,020
I'll get something for you to sleep on.

494
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,020
I'm not going to sleep.

495
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
I'm going to sleep.

496
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
I'm going to sleep.

497
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
I'm going to sleep.

498
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Hey!

499
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,020
I just want to talk to you.

500
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
You used to sleep here?

501
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Yes.

502
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
The ugly thing over there is also yours.

503
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,020
The ugly doll that stares at me.

504
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
Once I won against Senior Brother in martial arts,

505
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,020
Master pinched this ugly doll for me.

506
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
It was considered as a reward.

507
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
It's quite cute if you look closely.

508
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
I was just thinking,

509
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
what kind of look do you have when you're young?

510
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,020
What do you usually do?

511
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
When I was young...

512
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,020
I practiced martial arts, studied, and slept.

513
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
It's so pitiful.

514
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
It's so boring.

515
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
Is it boring?

516
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Actually, being boring is not pitiful.

517
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
I feel that

518
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
my heart has its wishes

519
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
but I can't get them.

520
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
That's the most pitiful thing.

521
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
I'm going to sleep.

522
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,020
The Three Realms of the Three Realms

523
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,020
The three realms were created by the Heaven and Earth.

524
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
The three realms were created by the Heaven and Earth.

525
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
But now, the master of the world

526
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
should be replaced.

527
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,020
The Three Realms of the Three Realms

528
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,020
What did Lord Guiyin write on me back then?

529
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,020
I think everyone is up at this hour.

530
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
Zhu Yu got up first when he was young.

531
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,020
After Shuang Jiang came back from Chang'an,

532
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
he also started to rest in the morning.

533
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
I think he should be awake now.

534
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
Good morning.

535
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Yesterday, I arranged for you to live in...

536
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
this room?

537
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
Is it hot?

538
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
No.

539
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
Good morning.

540
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Good morning.

541
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
This morning, Lu Yang picked up a lot of wild fruits

542
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
from the mountains and put them in the front yard.

543
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
You can try them.

544
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
I think it suits your taste.

545
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
Good morning.

546
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
Good morning.

547
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,020
I didn't enjoy the Changxi Palace yesterday.

548
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
There is no taste in the Changxi Palace.

549
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
There is no fun.

550
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,020
But the environment is clean and quiet.

551
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
Maybe there is a different view.

552
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,020
The Fifth Lady can walk around.

553
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,020
Zhu Yu and the younger sister

554
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,020
are really inseparable.

555
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
Don't talk about useless things.

556
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,020
I have discussed with Chi Hua.

557
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,020
Lu Yang is good at medical.

558
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
He will think of a way.

559
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
There are many things in the second-level warehouse.

560
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,020
You can also go and see if you can find a way.

561
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,020
Brother, you got up so early.

562
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
I didn't notice.

563
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
You...

564
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
You...

565
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,020
Brother Na Er is right.

566
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,020
The days in Changxi Palace are really boring.

567
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,020
There is no fun.

568
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,020
Three ministers of the Sword and Yin, please come to the front yard.

569
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,020
Three ministers of the Sword and Yin, please come to the front yard.

570
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
But there is no view.

571
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,020
I didn't expect that after the cat and the demon lost their memories,

572
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,020
it would be like this.

573
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,020
Even if it's a memory loss,

574
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,020
it's still him.

575
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,020
But if there is no memory loss,

576
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,020
after the internal battle in Chang'an,

577
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,020
I'm afraid it won't stay with you.

578
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,020
But now,

579
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,020
I just hope that he can live well.

580
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,020
Zhu Yu, I always feel regretful.

581
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,020
Now the leader is not set.

582
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,020
And you are clearly the most suitable candidate.

583
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,020
No, I'm not.

584
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,020
In this world,

585
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,020
there are always obstacles.

586
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,020
How can you be so easy to overcome and start over?

587
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Since the day I chose to leave,

588
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,020
I can't go back to Changxi Palace.

589
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
I'm leaving.

590
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Now the store is my responsibility.

591
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,020
You can keep the key.

592
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,020
These days, you can come to the store and keep the key.

593
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,020
If it doesn't work,

594
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,020
you can open the secret room. We'll just ignore it.

595
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Thank you.

596
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
I still don't understand.

597
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,020
With your talent,

598
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,020
it's really worth it to sacrifice for a woman like this?

599
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020
It's worth it.

600
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
I'm sorry.

601
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,020
Well,

602
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
do you want to think about it again?

603
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,020
I don't.

604
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
Sir.

605
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,020
Do I look good?

606
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,020
Yes.

607
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,020
Not really.

608
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
My husband doesn't say that.

609
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,020
I think they...

610
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Xiao Mu is here.

611
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,020
He shouldn't be here.

612
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,020
No, no.

613
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
He doesn't need to prove it.

614
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,020
Come back.

615
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,020
What a coincidence.

616
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,020
I'm passing by.

617
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,020
Do you believe me?

618
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Grandpa, what did you do?

619
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
I...

620
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
I didn't do anything.

621
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
Then,

622
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,020
did you think that my magic was too stupid

623
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,020
and didn't like me?

624
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,020
No. You did a lot of stupid things.

625
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,020
He was very stupid.

626
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
You did a lot of stupid things.

627
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
He doesn't like you.

628
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,020
If you don't know the reason,

629
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,020
you can ask him.

630
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,020
Of course I want to find him.

631
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,020
But he's not in the demon's room. I can't go in.

632
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,020
So I'm here to tell you the news.

633
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Your wife Liu left the demon's room

634
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,020
and went to the jade room an hour ago.

635
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,020
I don't need to thank you this time.

636
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,020
But the most important thing today is to tell you.

637
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
To tell you...

638
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
Tonight,

639
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,020
I'm going to be a dragon.

640
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,020
This batch of goods is new materials from An'an.

641
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,020
It's a little different from the previous ones.

642
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,020
How does it taste this time?

643
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,020
How is it?

644
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
It's good.

645
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,020
Okay, I'll go back to the demon's room.

646
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,020
I'm going to see you off.

647
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,020
Boss, I heard that Mei Siliang's carriage came this way.

648
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,020
He's quite well informed.

649
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Let's go back.

650
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Mei Siliang, aren't you at the main gate?

651
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,020
My carriage is at the main gate.

652
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,020
I've known Mrs. Liu for so many years.

653
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,020
What do you want from me?

654
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,020
Mrs. Liu, I came to ask you what happened.

655
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,020
We had a great time at the pool that day.

656
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,020
Nothing.

657
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,020
Mrs. Liu, I like to make trouble.

658
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,020
I'm not good at it, but I'm not stupid.

659
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,020
You're not a person who's been told to change and repeated.

660
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
Something must have happened.

661
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,020
But no matter what it is, you should let me know.

662
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,020
Come in and talk.

663
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:17,020
The flowers of the heart are all in the color of the night.

664
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,020
The memories are bitter.

665
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,020
The promise of being together is like a wind.

666
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:35,020
How can you be worth it?

667
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,020
The past is sad and the past is dreamy.

668
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:46,020
The most painful thing is that it has become a moment.

669
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,020
I only want to be with you in my life.

670
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:57,020
But I can't.

671
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Look at the petals falling.

672
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:09,020
What's wrong with falling in love?

673
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:14,020
The moonlight is cool and the breath is cool.

674
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:20,020
I hold you tight, but you are silent.

675
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:26,020
But the petals are falling.

676
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:32,020
What's wrong with falling in love?

677
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,020
The eyes are shining and the memories are clear.

678
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:47,020
How do I see you again?

679
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:53,020
I've always wanted to have you.
