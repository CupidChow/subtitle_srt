1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit of a

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,320
little bit of a

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
little bit of a

6
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
little bit of a

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
little bit of a

8
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
little bit of a

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
little bit of a

10
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,320
little bit of a

11
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,320
little bit of a

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
little bit of a

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
little bit of a

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
little bit of a

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
little bit of a

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
little bit of a

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
little bit of a

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
little bit of a

19
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
little bit of a

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
little bit of a

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
little bit of

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
a little bit

23
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
of a

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
little bit of

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
a little bit of

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
little bit of a

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Little

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Why do you see me more often?

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,720
What are you hiding?

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
What's wrong with you?

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,120
I don't want to hide it from you.

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,920
But these things

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,320
have nothing to do with you.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,520
You still don't want to tell me?

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,520
I don't want to.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,520
You heard it.

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,720
Your wife doesn't want to tell you.

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,320
The one who killed you is not me.

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
It's the cat.

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,120
I didn't mean to bully you.

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,720
As long as you tell me the truth,

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,720
I can let her go right away.

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,120
I'm scared.

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
I'm scared.

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,520
I'm going to get hurt.

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,920
Okay.

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,720
Then I'll tell you everything.

48
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
I once said

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,920
we are both disciples.

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,120
Although I am a demon,

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,920
I can only be a half demon

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,920
because I am a demon.

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
A half demon?

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,320
Yes.

55
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,120
I am a half demon.

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,920
I am a human in the daytime,

57
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,120
and a demon in the night.

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,120
Mister, are you done?

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm here to pick you up.

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,720
Don't come over.

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Okay.

62
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,520
No wonder.

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,520
For the past 18 years,

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
I've been bewitched by the demon's world.

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,120
Now,

66
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,720
I want to give up this half-human half-demon body

67
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,720
And it takes a hundred years to get there.

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I have to stay in seclusion for a hundred years.

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,720
When you are in seclusion,

70
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,720
I think we are separated by the sun.

71
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Yes.

72
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,720
It's because I let you down.

73
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,720
So you have to punish me like this.

74
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I have eaten this meal.

75
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
The answer is also given.

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Can you stop bothering me?

77
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I have to go.

78
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
I have to go.

79
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
I have to go.

80
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
I have to go.

81
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
I have to go.

82
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
I have to go.

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
I have to go.

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
I have to go.

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
I have to go.

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I have to go.

87
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
I have to go.

88
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I have to go.

89
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
I have to go.

90
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I have to go.

91
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
I have to go.

92
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
I have to go.

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
I have to go.

94
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
I have to go.

95
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
I have to go.

96
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I have to go.

97
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:15,720
I have found you in the fireworks.

98
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Take me to the pharmacy.

99
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Why are there so many medicines in the pharmacy?

100
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
The three of you go first.

101
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:44,920
3

102
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,320
Something just broke

103
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,760
Seems like this thing is also broken

104
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,780
4你的身体被花生束所伤

105
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:19,580
Senior Angel Launch Jizem

106
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,120
How did this happen?

107
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,000
Xiao Zhen You were hurt by the tree,

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
And you are still prone to it

109
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,760
afraid that only the purpose of experiences

110
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,240
could help your life

111
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,560
Xiao Zhen

112
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,520
¡° quality ¡°

113
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,720
No matter what happens in the future,

114
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,920
no matter what happens in the world,

115
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,880
I will always be by your side.

116
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,160
Uncle.

117
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,440
Stop it.

118
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,520
Stop it.

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,040
Uncle.

120
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,960
You felt silly, right?

121
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,960
Are you ready for the fight?

122
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,240
There are eyes.

123
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,360
Look.

124
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,920
Sehr 본.

125
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,840
Wrong.

126
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
I'll kill you if you don't.

127
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,200
Oh, my.

128
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,080
What does it have to do with me?

129
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,240
You two are in a bad relationship.

130
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
She scared me to death.

131
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,560
Oh, my.

132
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,000
What are you doing?

133
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,640
Again?

134
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,480
No.

135
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,760
What's going on?

136
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,040
Why is there a murderous aura?

137
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,520
No.

138
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,440
A'Shu.

139
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,480
A'Shu.

140
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
A'Shu, stop.

141
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Let me out.

142
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,920
A'Shu.

143
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,880
A'Shu, stop.

144
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,280
Let me out.

145
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,600
Let me out.

146
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,040
Oh, my.

147
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,680
What's going on?

148
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,240
No.

149
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,840
No.

150
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,400
No.

151
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,000
No.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
No.

153
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,240
No.

154
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,080
What's going on?

155
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,120
Why is Mr. Mei here?

156
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,760
Your Excellency.

157
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,440
Yes.

158
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
He's the one who threatened me.

159
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,960
He...

160
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,160
He threatened me twice a day.

161
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,080
What happened?

162
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
Wu Si said he would cure my boss.

163
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Now,

164
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,240
something seems to have happened.

165
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,840
No.

166
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,840
Xiao Meng.

167
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,680
Stop.

168
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,920
Wu Si Shu, stop.

169
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,240
You'll kill him.

170
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,760
Wu Zhen.

171
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,320
Xiao Meng.

172
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,120
Wu Zhen.

173
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,720
No.

174
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,440
Wu Zhen.

175
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,160
No.

176
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,600
No.

177
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,080
Wu Zhen, wake up.

178
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,000
No, Your Highness.

179
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,720
Wu Zhen.

180
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,400
Xiao Zhen.

181
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,360
Xiao Zhen.

182
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,120
Wu Zhen.

183
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,720
No.

184
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,720
Wu Zhen.

185
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,880
No.

186
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,520
Because of you,

187
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,440
I almost killed him.

188
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,840
I wanted to save him.

189
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,920
You gave the demon power to the evil spirit pellet.

190
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
Are you saving him

191
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
or hurting him?

192
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,720
If you do this,

193
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,800
you won't let him recover at all.

194
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
You'll also increase the evil spirit pellet's power.

195
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,720
That's impossible.

196
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,960
No wonder.

197
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,080
When we were trying to remove the evil spirit pellet,

198
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,880
we failed.

199
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,720
The more we used the evil spirit pellet to attack him,

200
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,520
the more we helped him.

201
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,520
So what Mr. Mei said

202
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,160
is true.

203
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,920
For the past 18 years,

204
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,680
I've tried my best for Xiao Zhen.

205
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,960
What have you done?

206
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,160
Even if I'm the one to blame,

207
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,160
why are you blaming me?

208
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,880
Ruo Fang killed him.

209
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,120
He not only killed him,

210
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,600
but also destroyed

211
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,760
the whole demon world.

212
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,040
Mei Zhuyu.

213
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,360
You're really a member of Changxi Palace.

214
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
You're so righteous

215
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,840
in front of life and death.

216
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,400
But you don't know that

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,760
if I don't try to kill him,

218
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,120
I'll die one day.

219
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,440
That's right.

220
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,760
Xiao Mao's body is already in the oil and oil mill.

221
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,840
He's been forced to be a demon for a hundred years.

222
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,040
It's also an inevitable thing.

223
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,680
He's not your close relative.

224
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,600
Mei Zhuyu.

225
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
This is the right path.

226
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,960
You and Xiao Zhi

227
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,680
are not on the same path.

228
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Chief.

229
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,920
Chief.

230
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,720
Xiao Mao.

231
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,720
Is he

232
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,320
back to the human world?

233
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,160
The blood and sand were almost mixed up.

234
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,040
I think he was stimulated.

235
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,960
I'll go find him.

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,480
Lost Serpent.

237
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,840
Dr unknown's resting place.

238
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,360
He worked until he was perfectly hair-laising.

239
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,840
We must stab them with a spear.

240
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,600
говорить sais le merde.

241
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,640
Let's go back as soon as possible.

242
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,960
But I won't die.

243
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,640
She doesn't have a golden hairpin.

244
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,560
Let's go.

245
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
like tonight.

246
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,520
Or the kitten was shot,

247
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,120
or the evil spirit was killed.

248
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,800
So,

249
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,320
if you want your enemy

250
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,760
to be completely disbanded,

251
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,280
there is only one way.

252
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,280
Kill him.

253
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,920
That's right.

254
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,440
While the evil spirit is still in his body,

255
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
his body

256
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,800
is the old man of the evil spirit.

257
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,320
If you want to take revenge,

258
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
it's the best time now.

259
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,080
It's almost dawn.

260
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,040
I'm going to find my wife.

261
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,080
Young Master,

262
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,520
why did you mention this to Mr. Mei?

263
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,440
Aren't you afraid

264
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,840
that he will really hurt Boss?

265
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,320
No.

266
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,880
He won't hurt Xiaomao.

267
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,720
Boss.

268
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,760
Thief!

269
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
What are you doing?

270
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Looking for a cat.

271
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
Wrong.

272
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Let's go.

273
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
What is Meisi City looking for?

274
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Such a big battle.

275
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
I don't know.

276
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Meisi City is a place where cats live.

277
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
I don't know.

278
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Meisi City is a person who has his own reason for doing things.

279
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Madam.

280
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Madam.

281
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Wuzhen.

282
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Don't be angry.

283
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,680
I thought you were angry with me and didn't want to see me.

284
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
That's why you turned into a dog.

285
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
I think I was blind.

286
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
I didn't care about your difficulties.

287
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Why are you here again?

288
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
There are times when you are looking for me.

289
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
I'm really angry if you look for me again.

290
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm not here to catch you.

291
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
I'm here to find him.

292
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Is this a cat?

293
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
No.

294
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
But it looks a bit like it.

295
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
It's a male.

296
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Male?

297
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Please take it away.

298
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
My husband hates cats the most.

299
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,680
It seems that the cat is sad.

300
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Can't you get off?

301
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
It's always you.

302
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Wait for me to go home.

303
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Madam.

304
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
No matter what happens,

305
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
I will face it with you.

306
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Trust me.

307
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
I will be with you.

308
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Madam.

309
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Can you stop being angry?

310
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Madam.

311
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Drink some water.

312
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
This water can absorb the murderous aura.

313
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Come on.

314
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Drink slowly.

315
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Drink slowly.

316
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Xiao Lun.

318
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Why don't you change your clothes when you change?

319
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
I'll help you.

320
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Please take me home.

321
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Madam.

322
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Where is this?

323
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Is this our home?

324
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Shiyi.

325
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Although the yuan pellet and the demon window in her body are suppressed,

326
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
they still hurt the root.

327
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
I think Shiyi

328
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
is one of the symptoms.

329
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
What are you planning to do now?

330
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
The world's spiritual pellets are wonderful.

331
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
The mysterious door is open.

332
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
The door to the world is open.

333
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
You can take it out.

334
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Here.

335
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Take it out.

336
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Take it out.

337
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
I won't let anything happen to her

338
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
no matter how many times she tries.

339
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
It seems that you have an idea.

340
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Sister Zhen.

341
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Xiao Mao.

342
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Who are they?

343
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Friends.

344
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Sir, the peaches are delicious.

345
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
Try it.

346
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
Sister Zhen has lost her memory.

347
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
She still goes to the room to pick up the bowls.

348
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Who is this?

349
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
You stole my peaches.

350
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
The peaches were stolen.

351
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
It must be Sister Zhen.

352
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Since they are friends,

353
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
let's eat the peaches.

354
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I'm sorry.

355
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Madam.

356
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Can you stop climbing the wall?

357
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
And don't go around

358
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
to climb the tree to catch the chicken.

359
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
This morning,

360
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
you ruined all the houses in our neighborhood.

361
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
My little warehouse is almost gone.

362
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
What?

363
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Call me Madam.

364
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Xiao Zhu Yu.

365
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
You said it was magical.

366
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Sister Zhen didn't remember anything.

367
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
But she remembers you.

368
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
You are not reasonable.

369
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
The dress is dirty.

370
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Go to wash it.

371
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Look at my Uncle Tao.

372
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
What has he become?

373
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Why hasn't anyone come?

374
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Madam Li.

375
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Do you think

377
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
you have made up with

378
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Sister Zhen?

379
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Yes.

380
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
My father-in-law knows she is coming back.

381
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
I feel happy.

382
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
I like it.

383
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
But Sister Zhen,

384
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
when can she get better?

385
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
I'm sorry.

386
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
I'm sorry.

387
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm sorry.

388
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
I'm sorry.

389
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
I'm sorry.

390
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
I'm sorry.

391
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm sorry.

392
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
I'm sorry.

393
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
I'm sorry.

395
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm sorry.

396
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
I'm sorry.

397
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm sorry.

399
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
I'm sorry.

400
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
My dear,

402
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
your heart is beating so fast.

403
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Look,

404
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
my heart is beating fast too.

405
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Tonight,

406
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
I'll sleep in the study.

407
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Why?

408
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Shouldn't you sleep with Madam Li?

409
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Why don't you sleep with me?

410
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
I have something to do.

411
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Have a good rest.

412
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Zhen,

413
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
let's go home.

414
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Zhen.

415
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Let's go home.

416
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

417
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

418
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

419
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

420
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

421
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

422
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

423
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

424
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

425
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

426
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

427
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

428
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

429
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

430
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

431
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

432
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

433
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

434
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

435
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

436
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

437
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

438
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

439
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

440
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

441
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

442
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

443
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

444
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Mei Zhuyu,

445
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
she's already left you.

446
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
How can you hide her

447
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
while she's unconscious?

448
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
Don't you feel ashamed?

449
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
So what if I'm ashamed?

450
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Since you can't help her,

451
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,680
I can't give her to you.

452
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,680
After all, you almost killed her.

453
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
I killed her?

454
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
It was just an accident.

455
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
You're an angel.

456
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,680
You're also thinking about killing the evil spirit.

457
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Between you and me,

458
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
who is more dangerous?

459
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
If she regains her memory,

460
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,680
what do you think she will do to you?

461
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Who do you think she will choose?

462
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
If she regains her memory,

463
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
maybe she will blame me.

464
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,680
But she will never choose you.

465
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,680
You know this very well.

466
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Nonsense.

467
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Maokai...

468
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,680
What are you doing?

469
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
I'm here for you.

470
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Sir, who is she?

471
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Mei Zhuyu,

472
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
you're lying to me!

473
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Mengpeng wrote it Jakob serenade,

474
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
all the same,

475
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
J wenn you remember me,

476
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Do you still remember me?

477
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
I don't know you.

478
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,040
Xiaozhen,

479
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,680
I've been with you for 18 years.

480
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,560
You really don't remember me at all.

481
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,240
I really don't know you.

482
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,640
Xiaozhen,

483
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
look carefully.

484
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm the one

485
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,880
who won't hurt you the most.

486
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,760
You must have mistaken me.

487
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,040
I want to rest.

488
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,600
You should go now.

489
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,560
Xiaozhen,

490
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,520
Xiaozhen.

491
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
You trust me so much.

492
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,360
Are you sure I'm lying to you?

493
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm not.

494
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,520
Why?

495
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,320
You're pretty.

496
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,120
I'll take you out of Chang'an tomorrow.

497
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,200
Let's go out and play.

498
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,920
Okay?

499
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,800
Okay.

500
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,520
I'm sorry.

501
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,400
I didn't mean to go to Quzhou

502
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,600
to find medicine and cure my illness.

503
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,000
But I have to ask you

504
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,280
to do me a favor.

505
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,360
You should know

506
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,640
the principle of being in a difficult situation.

507
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,120
When he recovers,

508
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,560
I hope you

509
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,440
don't drag him into this.

510
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,040
Let him have more time to think about the world.

511
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,600
After all,

512
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,200
his life

513
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,920
will be in danger.

514
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,680
I hope he can live well.

515
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,280
As long as he's alive,

516
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,440
even if we don't see each other again,

517
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I can bear it.

518
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,400
He's so sincere with you.

519
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,760
This human experience is worth it.

520
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,480
I hope you

521
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,440
succeed in everything.

522
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Qingyuan Academy

523
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,160
Well died

524
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Tired me in Guogong mansion and mister Wubo

525
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,560
Send half a praise

526
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Probably a man of talent

527
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,120
After all, there are�� fucking talent

528
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,360
No one is better than you

529
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,080
Are you done?

530
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
Don't move, Mrs Liu.

531
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,480
Right here.

532
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,480
There's not enough air space.

533
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,480
The more aggressive the painting, the more air space it has.

534
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,680
It's not bad.

535
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,080
Do you have to appear so hastily?

536
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,280
I can't get in the room if you lock the door.

537
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,680
What is it?

538
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Sir, you should go back to the demon room.

539
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,480
That person is making trouble again.

540
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Let's go.

541
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Mrs Liu, where are you going?

542
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,080
Back to the demon room.

543
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,480
When will you come back?

544
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Next time.

545
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,480
What?

546
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,480
What happened to the demon room?

547
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,080
Why do you care?

548
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,680
Sir, why don't you go help them?

549
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
No.

550
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,080
I have a grudge against the demon room.

551
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,880
I want to help them.

552
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,680
You're not helping the demon room.

553
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,880
You're helping your future wife who saved your life.

554
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,480
You're really putting gold on your face.

555
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
You should just pick me up.

556
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,080
If you don't pick me up, I won't die.

557
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,680
I want to destroy Grandpa.

558
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,280
Maybe you're better off than now.

559
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,880
It's no use calling Grandpa Zeng if you don't go.

560
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:46,680
Nicki

561
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,080
My rascal.

562
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
to stop you.

563
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,880
Yes.

564
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,280
Wu Zishu!

565
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,080
Wu Zishu!

566
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,280
How dare you!

567
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,680
Master.

568
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,480
Master.

569
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,280
You still recognize me?

570
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,280
You think you're not wise enough

571
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,880
to even listen to me, the Serpent Lord?

572
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
Serpent Lord, you're joking.

573
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
I don't understand

574
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,680
the reason why

575
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,680
you've been

576
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,880
keeping me trapped in this demon world.

577
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,880
What's so hard to understand?

578
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,480
You're obsessed with it.

579
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,880
It's a crucial matter for you.

580
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
I believed Mei Zhuyu could save him,

581
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
so I have to believe it.

582
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,280
So you have to avoid it.

583
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,080
You believe her?

584
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
What can she do to save him?

585
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,680
What can you do to save him?

586
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,280
All right.

587
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
In that case,

588
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,480
Master,

589
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,480
you'd better stay in the demon world.

590
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,480
Yes.

591
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,880
Master.

592
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,480
Master.

593
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,680
Master.

594
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,280
Master.

595
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Master.

596
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,080
Master.

597
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,680
Master.

598
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,080
Master.

599
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,480
Master.

600
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,280
Master.

601
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,080
Master.

602
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Master.

603
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,280
No wonder that book was so disturbing.

604
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,280
It was about to break my family history.

605
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,480
You're so generous.

606
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,080
You let Mei take the cat to the Fairy Land

607
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,880
without knowing it existed.

608
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
There's a record of the Fairy Land.

609
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
It's said that it can cure all diseases.

610
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
How can it not exist?

611
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
It's true even if it's a myth.

612
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
They're the same kind.

613
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,480
I've never heard of it.

614
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,480
Maybe you're just a fool.

615
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:03,880
You...

616
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,280
Besides,

617
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,080
I heard that Changxi Palace is crowded

618
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,880
with people from the Xuanmen Sect in Quzhou.

619
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,080
There must be a way.

620
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,080
Whatever.

621
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
It's good to have hope,

622
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,280
whether it's real or not.

623
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
No matter what,

624
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,680
there must be some expectations.

625
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
Madam.

626
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,880
Come.

627
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,680
There's no inn or house nearby.

628
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,680
How about staying here for the night?

629
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
It's okay.

630
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,680
I'll stay wherever you are.

631
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
The Fairy Land

632
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
It's too wet here.

633
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,480
Spread some dry grass

634
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,680
to avoid cold.

635
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
It's strange.

636
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,880
Why is the broom on the wooden table?

637
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,280
Come.

638
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:28,080
identity een twee

639
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,000
the

640
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,480
missing

641
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,700
who

642
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,420
People keep taking risks....

643
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,480
Sherry confession

644
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,000
...........

645
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,420
Can it be?

646
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,940
Love never shows anymore

647
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,440
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life

648
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,940
But I can't

649
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,940
Look at the petals, they all fall

650
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:03,940
What's wrong with falling in love?

651
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:09,440
The moonlight is so bright, my breath is so cool

652
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,940
I hold you tight, but you are silent

653
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,940
Look at the petals, they all fall

654
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,440
What's wrong with falling in love?

655
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,940
The moonlight is so bright, my breath is so cool

656
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,440
How do I say goodbye?

657
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:47,440
You look back, it's been a long time

658
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,940
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life
