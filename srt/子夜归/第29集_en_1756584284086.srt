1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of a

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
little bit of a

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of a

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
little bit of a

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
of a

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
little bit

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
of a

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
little bit

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
of a

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't know you were coming.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If I had known, I would have invited you two home to have a seat.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're too kind.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's only right.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You are important guests.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You should celebrate and wait for her.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's go.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Shi Shidi entered Baiye Town and said he had something else in mind.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But he did it for this girl.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He's really a cunning man.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Who knows?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why don't you follow him?

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What do you mean?

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nothing. Just in case.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What do you mean?

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I thought there would be a demon to save you.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But in reality, the demon doesn't care about your death.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's the point of you being here to help them?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If you tell me how to enter the demon's room now,

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I won't have to suffer anymore.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not going to let you go.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm not going to let you go.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I won't have to suffer anymore.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Otherwise, I can kill you anytime.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I didn't expect you to come.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I didn't expect you to be here.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
With your personality, you won't go to Ruyi House.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You won't believe them.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You know that.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because you won't go to Ruyi House.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You won't think you can fool me.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Wuzhen, don't help Zhou Wei Nu.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't move. Hurry up.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What kind of 100-year-old emperor is he?

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He's just a common person who is good at seducing people.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was thinking of giving you a surprise today.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I didn't expect that what you gave me

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
was even more unexpected.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's here.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What you said is the same as what we know.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But no matter what method we use,

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we still can't enter.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The entrance is here.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's restricted.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
People and demons who don't have access

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
can't enter.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Wuzhen, let's talk.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's talk later.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mei Zhu Yu.

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
When I come back, I will definitely give you an answer.

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wuzhou Niangzi, lead the way.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay.

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yin Yao?

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How did you know such a strange name?

101
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I grew up in the countryside.

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm used to the name of the demon.

103
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Moreover, my wife is from Chang'an.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
She should know why Xuan Jian Ci was born.

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not sure.

106
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm not sure.

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm not sure.

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not sure.

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not sure.

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You should know why Xuan Jian Ci was born.

111
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's a familiar name.

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's so strange?

113
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It seems that this is what Xuan Jian Ci is looking for.

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In Quzhou, I heard that

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
to get rid of this bad luck,

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
you need to find the root and clear it out.

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You've learned a lot in Quzhou.

118
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But you never said you know martial arts.

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Sheng Wu Niangzi never asked me.

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Where did you learn martial arts?

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I learned from you when I was a kid.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're really good at it.

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Boss, if he really has something to do with Changxi Palace,

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm afraid it'll be a problem.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Where's Mr. Mei?

126
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I didn't see him just now.

127
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I finally found you.

128
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
11th Brother.

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
11th Brother?

130
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There are so many people there.

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, Quzhou is very lively.

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There are 11 brothers in the far away.

133
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The first 10 are all old.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I met the two of them at the latest.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I ordered a drink for you.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Didn't you say you were busy?

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I heard my cousin was called to the table.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm worried about him.

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll take a look.

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
How did Mr. Mei know about this?

141
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
In the case file of the Black Poisoning Department,

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
there are records of this kind of murder.

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can remember this?

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're so good at it.

145
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I grew up in Quzhou.

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I was taught by my master.

147
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Although he's dead now,

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I still want to talk to him.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You want to go back to Quzhou?

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Quzhou is far away.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to leave today.

152
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is the lady you married?

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're the master of Qin He County?

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes.

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Who are they?

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm Quzhou's old friend.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm here to save you.

159
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm here to save you.

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm here to save you.

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm here to save you.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm here to save you.

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm here to save you.

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm here to save you.

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm here to save you.

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm here to save you.

167
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm here to save you.

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm here to save you.

169
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm here to save you.

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
County Governor General,

171
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Aren't you going to the capital now?

172
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,880
Yes, and I want to see this city office.

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You want to see that?

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes, and I want to see that?

175
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes.

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:07,840
oh

177
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You are the most important person in this world.

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Have you ever thought about what we should do after this?

180
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I didn't mean to lie to you.

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I give you one last choice.

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If you stop here, we still have a chance to turn back.

183
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If you insist to enter the key...

184
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If I really enter the key, what will happen?

185
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What will happen?

186
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is the end of our relationship.

187
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You choose them or me?

188
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't know.

189
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know.

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't know.

191
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't know.

192
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't know.

193
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know.

194
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know.

195
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know.

196
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know.

197
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know.

198
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't know.

199
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know.

200
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know.

201
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know.

202
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know.

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't know.

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't know.

205
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't know.

206
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know.

207
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know.

208
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't know.

209
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know.

210
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know.

211
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't know.

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know.

214
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't know.

215
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't know.

216
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't know.

217
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know.

218
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't know.

219
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know.

220
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know.

221
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't know.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know.

223
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't know.

224
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't know.

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't know.

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't know.

228
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't know.

229
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't know.

230
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't know.

231
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't know.

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't know.

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know.

234
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know.

235
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't know.

236
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't know.

237
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't know.

238
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't know.

239
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't know.

240
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't know.

241
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Xiao Mao!

242
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
Show him your paparazzi.

243
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think it's our duty.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I've seen many of you who are full of good will and morality.

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're all much better than you look.

246
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I thought you were a smart man.

247
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't expect you to be so stupid.

248
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You're no different.

249
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Who are you calling stupid?

250
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You're such a liar.

251
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You don't believe me when I say you're stupid?

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I didn't know you were coming.

253
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I didn't know you would be so kind to me.

254
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You're welcome.

255
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You're all guests.

256
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You should be happy to welcome me.

257
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're evil.

258
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're so evil.

259
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm sure you're hungry.

260
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How can you judge me by my appearance?

261
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm a man of great character.

262
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm afraid Changming is very chaotic.

263
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No wonder he's so sinister.

264
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Changming was taken by the demon clan.

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
How can the demon and human be one?

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What about human and demon?

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Demon knows the demon clan.

268
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Demon knows the demon clan.

269
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They live and work in peace.

270
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
They eat and sleep.

271
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're a man of great character.

272
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
How can you think you're superior?

273
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There's a saying in the book, demons are evil.

274
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There's a saying in the book?

275
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If what's written in the book is right,

276
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Shuangjiang has been pulled by the fox and the pig.

277
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You idiots shouldn't be alive.

278
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's the demon clan.

279
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Look at it with your own eyes.

280
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Is that where you hide the demons?

281
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's good.

282
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's good.

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Here's your noodles.

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you.

285
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Good.

286
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That candy shop looks good.

287
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
These little things have never left the demon clan in hundreds of years.

288
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What did they do wrong?

289
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And you,

290
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you're in this place,

291
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
what do you want to do to them?

292
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Demons are demons.

293
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
If you don't get rid of them,

294
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
there will be a big trouble.

295
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Mei Zhuyu,

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
even if you forget your responsibility,

297
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
have you forgotten your parents' death?

298
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You came to Chang'an to find the demon clan

299
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
just to avenge them.

300
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Eighteen years ago,

301
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the demon clan killed countless people.

302
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Have you forgotten?

303
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If you did it 18 years ago,

304
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
you must have found the wrong place.

305
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you say it has nothing to do with the demon clan,

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
it's just a lie.

307
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's evidence.

308
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll take you there.

309
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll take you there.

310
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What is this place?

311
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's the same as the mortal world.

312
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The demon clan also has laws.

313
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The evidence is here.

314
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What kind of evidence?

315
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm afraid it's all planned out in the morning.

316
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You tricked us here to kill you.

317
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't think too much.

318
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I think it's dirty to let you into the prison.

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We're here.

320
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
His cell.

321
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Who?

322
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
18 years ago,

323
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
the demon clan killed countless people.

324
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If you say it has nothing to do with the demon clan,

325
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
it's just a lie.

326
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If you say it has nothing to do with the demon clan,

327
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
it's just a lie.

328
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Who?

329
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You.

330
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Who?

331
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:10,800
White Spirit!

332
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,800
You have been a hero for the three realms.

333
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Now it's time to change the world.

334
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Wei Ying, stop it.

335
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,800
How can you let the demon world and the human world remain in balance?

336
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,800
How can these weak and useless people step on the head of the demon?

337
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
How unfair!

338
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:56,800
They usually look down on demons, but now they can only beg.

339
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Master, this is what Chang'an should look like.

340
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,800
We should be the ones to rule the world.

341
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,800
I will destroy you today.

342
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,800
You want to kill me?

343
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,800
When the evil spirits came to Chang'an, they killed and made trouble everywhere.

344
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,800
The demon world paid a terrible price to kill him.

345
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,800
The previous cat palace died because of this.

346
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,800
But you mortals are always obsessed with it.

347
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
You think demons are all the same.

348
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,800
You don't believe you will be saved by the demon world.

349
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,800
This is just one side of your demon world.

350
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Who knows what you demons used to create the world?

351
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,800
That is the light mirror that the cat palace brought back. How can it be fake?

352
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Master, this mirror is made by a special jade master.

353
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
It's very important to the people.

354
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
There are many other mirrors on it.

355
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
The mirror should not be changed.

356
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
It's indeed the light mirror.

357
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,800
So the mirrors are real?

358
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Yes. Since the light mirror has a record, it can't be wrong.

359
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Mei Zhuyu, what do you think? You believe them?

360
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,800
I believe the light mirror.

361
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,800
So we made such a big effort, but the culprit is dead?

362
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
No.

363
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Although the chaos of the sky and fire has nothing to do with the demon world, the culprit is still in the world.

364
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,800
That's impossible.

365
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,800
The light mirror.

366
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
The evil spirit? That's impossible.

367
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Since the spirit is still here, it means the evil spirit hasn't been returned.

368
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
The spirit is here. The soul is still alive.

369
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,800
The previous cat palace must have brought the light mirror with the words.

370
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,800
If the demon world is in the right place, the ghost should be dead.

371
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,800
I'm afraid it's just a dream.

372
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,800
No matter what, the evil spirit is still here.

373
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,800
The demon world will investigate it.

374
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,800
I think we should investigate it.

375
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,800
The light mirror.

376
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,800
What are you doing, Leader Changming?

377
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,800
The demon world is here to catch the demon.

378
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,800
How? What did Leader do?

379
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,800
He used the magic to trap Lady Hu Zhu. He also has the same evil spirit.

380
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
The demon world is here.

381
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
The demon world is here.

382
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,800
The demon world is here.

383
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
The demon world is here.

384
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,800
The demon world is here.

385
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,800
The demon world is here.

386
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
The demon world is here.

387
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,800
The demon world is here.

388
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,800
The demon world is here.

389
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
The demon world is here.

390
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,800
The demon world is here.

391
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
The demon world is here.

392
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,800
The demon world is here.

393
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,800
There are so many demon powers. How can I let them go so easily?

394
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
The evil power of the demon.

395
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
The voice-calling spell.

396
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
How dare he?

397
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,800
We're practicing the evil power.

398
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Senior, stop!

399
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Don't make the same mistake again!

400
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Mistake?

401
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
What mistake?

402
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm practicing the voice-calling spell.

403
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I can also fight against the demon.

404
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
The evil power of the demon.

405
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
So it's with you.

406
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
But I've lost the soul-suppressing pill.

407
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
It's also a way to get rid of the evil power.

408
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
The evil power of the demon.

409
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Let me go!

410
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
The evil power of the demon.

411
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
The voice-calling spell.

412
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
The secret of the cloud.

413
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,800
It seems that I was really blind.

414
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
I hid the ghost shadow.

415
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Get up.

416
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
The evil power of the demon.

417
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
No wonder he gave all the power of the cat palace to me.

418
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
How could it be?

419
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Junior, you've seen it.

420
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
But I've lost the soul-suppressing pill.

421
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
I'll take it as revenge for your parents.

422
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
I'm helping you.

423
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,800
I didn't expect that the ghost shadow was really hidden in this little piece of flesh.

424
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,800
I don't know if this is good or bad.

425
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
Whether it's good or bad, I have to...

426
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Why is it in his hands?

427
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
The secret of the soul-suppressing pill.

428
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Chang Xijian has been waiting for it.

429
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Chang Xijian, get down!

430
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Chang Xijian, get down!

431
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Be careful.

432
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Master.

433
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Mei Zhuyu.

434
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
You're the leader of Changxi Palace.

435
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
How dare you kill me with Chang Xijian?

436
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Senior, you're practicing evil.

437
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,800
It's not for killing demons or killing demons.

438
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
It's for yourself.

439
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,800
How can a smart and virtuous person like you understand my pain?

440
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
I just chose what I wanted.

441
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
What did I do wrong?

442
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
How...how could it be?

443
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Could it be...

444
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Master?

445
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Changming!

446
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Changming!

447
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
The magic of the voice.

448
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
How did you know about this evil trick?

449
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,800
I found it in the secret room when I was reading the book.

450
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,800
You should know how to judge the person who practices evil tricks in Changxi.

451
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Master.

452
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
I'm sorry for my mistake.

453
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Please forgive me this time.

454
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Master.

455
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Master.

456
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I swear.

457
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
If I practice this evil trick,

458
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
I will be destroyed.

459
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I will die.

460
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Forget it.

461
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
The cliff is steep.

462
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
I haven't finished yet.

463
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
Changming, remember.

464
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
The path of practice is like climbing a mountain.

465
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
There will be a scene on the other side of the cliff.

466
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
It looks scary.

467
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
But once you step in,

468
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
you may fall off the cliff at any time.

469
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
You may fall to the ground.

470
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Before you enter Changxi Palace,

471
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
I was the one who was chosen by the master.

472
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Now that you are here,

473
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
I have a new idea.

474
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
I lost again.

475
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I know you can't do it.

476
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
You don't know me.

477
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
I took advantage of it.

478
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
You don't have to be modest.

479
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm older than you.

480
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
It's not right to lose to you.

481
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Master.

482
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Today is my turn to clean up the school.

483
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
I have to go now.

484
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Go ahead.

485
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Don't be sad.

486
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Although Xiao Shi is younger than you,

487
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
he is a good student.

488
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
But he is indeed the most talented brother

489
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
in Changxi Palace for a hundred years.

490
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
He is also determined.

491
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
It's a pity.

492
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
If he hadn't been a commoner,

493
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,800
I would have kept him as the headmaster.

494
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Master.

495
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,800
The headmaster's position is passed on to the big brother.

496
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
I know.

497
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
But I just want to say that

498
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Changming is far worse than Xiao Shi.

499
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,800
I'm not as good as you in nature.

500
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I'm not as good as you.

501
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I'm looking for you in the fire of death.

502
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:27,800
I'm looking for you in the fire of death.

503
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
It's only one step away.

504
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Lord Gui Ying will be reborn.

505
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Little bastard.

506
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
You are so lucky.

507
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Zhu Ying is still guarding at the entrance of the barrier.

508
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Ling Xiao.

509
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
You go help him.

510
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
See if you can repair it.

511
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Yes.

512
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
It's our fault.

513
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Even if there is a master's delusion,

514
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
we easily believe that

515
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
it is also because of the past prejudice

516
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
that the demon is evil.

517
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
And I'm not wrong.

518
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
I went down the mountain with all the brothers

519
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
and went to Chang'an.

520
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
I met Hu Zhu and Wu Niangzi.

521
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
They never harmed me.

522
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
They even took care of me.

523
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
But even so,

524
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
I didn't believe what I saw and felt.

525
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I still listened to the master's order

526
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
and apologized to them.

527
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
I'm really sorry.

528
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
In the past, we only heard that the demon was evil.

529
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
But just now we saw

530
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
that there was a solid charcoal on the stone

531
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
and a sheet of cloth.

532
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
If we hadn't broken in smartly,

533
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,800
they would still be living a normal life.

534
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
If you think that Changming's death

535
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
is not enough to make up for what happened before Changxi Palace,

536
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I am willing to stay and let you handle it.

537
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,800
But can others let them make a decision?

538
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
Since you say so,

539
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
we demon masters are reasonable.

540
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
We don't want to be unreasonable.

541
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Otherwise, if it gets out,

542
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
it will be like us

543
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
bullying you mortals.

544
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
It's okay to leave.

545
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
From now on,

546
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
you are not allowed to target the demon masters for no reason.

547
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
One wife and two brothers,

548
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
they will not live together.

549
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
From now on,

550
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Changxi Palace is not allowed to return to the city.

551
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I will see you off.

552
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Everyone,

553
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
please leave with me.

554
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
How are you?

555
