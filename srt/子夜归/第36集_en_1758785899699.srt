00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,220
little child

139
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
little baby

140
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,220
little baby

141
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,800
Buff...

142
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,060
Anyway

143
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,660
Annie

144
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,060
Mom

145
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,060
I hold you tight but you remain silent

146
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
Mother

147
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,060
What's wrong with my mother?

148
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
It's okay, Zhuyu

149
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,060
It will pass

150
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
Mother

151
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Mother

152
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,060
Mother

153
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,060
Mother

154
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,060
Who are you?

155
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,060
Mother

156
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,060
Father

157
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
Father

158
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,060
I didn't expect father to be a cat

159
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,060
I didn't expect the truth 18 years ago to be like this

160
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Mother

161
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
Mother

162
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
Mother

163
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Boss

164
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Mother

165
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,060
Mother

166
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
You're awake

167
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,060
Where is she?

168
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,060
It seems that you have recovered

169
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,060
You are here to wait for me

170
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,060
I

171
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Fifth Madam, please let her see you

172
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060
Fifth Madam

173
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
Fifth Madam is finally fine

174
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,060
It seems that Changxi Palace is indeed in poor condition

175
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,060
Even the waist wound can be cured

176
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,060
I should be grateful

177
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
It's not the credit of Changxi Palace

178
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,060
It's because you are blessed

179
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
I asked you to come here earlier

180
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,060
But I didn't expect you to sleep for three days

181
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,060
She helped me so much

182
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
I have to thank her in person

183
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,060
Brother, he knows that you will recover

184
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,060
He is afraid that you will see him again when you wake up

185
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,060
He said that he knew his name and left

186
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,060
Fifth Madam

187
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Fifth Madam, please wait a moment

188
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,060
Fifth Madam

189
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,060
I heard that you came to the shop when you were unconscious

190
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:58,060
You said that you wanted to practice the evil

191
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,060
This Changxi Heart-saving Pillar is the most important thing

192
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,060
I think that you won't have any conflict with the evil

193
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,060
Fifth Madam has just recovered

194
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060
She still needs to be adjusted to the inner power

195
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Maybe she can pay attention to you

196
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
Thank you

197
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
Take your time

198
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
Take your time

199
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
Take your time

200
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:26,060
The more you use this pen, the more you look for your name

201
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Then the wind blows, then the moon falls, then you are gone

202
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:40,060
The long night is slowly falling into my dream

203
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Then the heart moves, then the wind blows, then the wind rises

204
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,060
I am in the wild fire of the four seasons

205
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,060
The ugly thing over there is also yours

206
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Once I won the second brother in a contest

207
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,060
The master gave me this clay doll

208
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,060
It's a reinforcement

209
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,060
It's pretty cute if you look closely

210
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,060
The real one is smart, the master is steady

211
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,060
The moment he moves, he is in front of the mirror

212
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,060
Your Majesty, our royal baby will be full of talent

213
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,060
Jinling Pavilion's real one, thin and crispy milk powder

214
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,060
This is prepared by the empress

215
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,060
90 kinds of full nutrition, super-rich in source, HMO

216
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,060
Full-fledged baby needs full nutrition

217
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Jinling Pavilion milk powder, Chinese exclusive formula, baby super-rich in protection

218
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Since the wife of Hu Zhu came to Changxi Palace

219
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,060
She hasn't been able to take a good look at us

220
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,060
Now that the boss is awake, I am happy

221
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,060
I just feel that Changxi Palace is not worse than the demon's room

222
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Have you been well recently?

223
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,060
It's just that the boss is not here

224
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,060
The demon's room is busy

225
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,060
It is inevitable to neglect the business of Ruyi Pavilion

226
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,060
In the past half a month, a lot of profit has been lost

227
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Ruyi Pavilion's business is so good

228
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
It's not bad at all

229
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
Why not?

230
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,060
I am going to be the first wife of Chang'an

231
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,060
I will feel bad if I am not as good as you

232
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,060
Yes, yes, what you said is right

233
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,060
If you earn money, you should be the first wife of Hu Zhu

234
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,060
You have a great ambition

235
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,060
You will definitely achieve your dream

236
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,060
When I became the first wife of Chang'an

237
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Did you become a hero?

238
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,060
I will try my best

239
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,060
You are so confident

240
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Actually, I also know that

241
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,060
In Changxi Palace, I entered the house first

242
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
And I have a good reputation

243
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,060
To be a hero

244
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,060
In the eyes of others, it is more like a daydream

245
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
But I always think about it secretly

246
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
There will be such a day

247
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,060
Be a cool and self-willed hero

248
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
The hero who will take over the world

249
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,060
The hero who will take over the world

250
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,060
The cultivator cultivates first

251
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,060
Since you have this intention

252
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,060
Then you should do it with your own thought

253
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
Don't care about other people's opinions

254
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
Why should you worry?

255
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
Thank you for your advice

256
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,060
Since it is so, I will give you a gift

257
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
What?

258
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,060
This is gold?

259
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,060
It looks like the gold of the previous dynasty

260
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
Good eyesight

261
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
But, can you take a closer look?

262
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
It is gold

263
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
It is war

264
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
The rich and the poor avoid disaster

265
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
The rich and the poor bury the gold in the mountains

266
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Sometimes they forget where they bury

267
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,060
When time goes by, they turn into gold monsters

268
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,060
I found it when I was checking the accounts two days ago

269
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,060
This little guy knows how to hide

270
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,060
Get up

271
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
Get up

272
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
Get up

273
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,060
Don't bully him

274
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Don't bully him

275
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,060
My gold

276
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Here

277
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
Get up

278
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Get up

279
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
Get up

280
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,060
Get up

281
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,060
Why am I...

282
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
It was the fifth lady who invited me

283
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
This guy is acting again

284
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
Boss, this is not gold

285
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,060
This is gold crystal

286
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,060
The two generals brought it back to the demon world

287
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
Lady Hu Zhun

288
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,060
When the demon is back

289
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,060
Remember to clean it up

290
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,060
I know

291
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,060
Boss, did you clean up your luggage?

292
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,060
We should go

293
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,060
I will go

294
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,060
I have been bothering you

295
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,060
You are welcome

296
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Let's go

297
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
Let's go

298
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Boss, why don't we wait for Mr. Mei?

299
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,060
I think we have more important things to do

300
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
Let's go

301
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,060
The Demon in the City

302
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
The demon in the city

303
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Be careful

304
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
The demon in the city

305
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Be careful

306
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
The demon in the city

307
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
Be careful of the snakes!

308
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
There are snakes in the city!

309
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,060
Be careful of the snakes!

310
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
There are snakes in the city!

311
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
Be careful of the snakes!

312
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
In this winter, where did the snakes come from?

313
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
Brother, you don't know

314
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
I have been following this snake

315
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
to come here

316
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
But last night

317
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
I lost my big fish

318
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
I lost it

319
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Are you serious?

320
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Yes

321
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
What if it crawls into my house?

322
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Yes

323
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
We are rich

324
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Don't panic

325
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
I brought some firewood

326
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
You can burn it

327
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
near my house

328
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
to get rid of the snakes

329
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Do you need money?

330
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
No, just to make it easier

331
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
for you to get rid of the snakes

332
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
Don't fight

333
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
Come with me

334
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
I have a big house

335
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Come on, don't fight

336
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Don't fight

337
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
You must burn it

338
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
near my house

339
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
Where are you going?

340
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Go away

341
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Do you understand what I said?

342
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
I don't understand

343
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Don't fight

344
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,060
I won't

345
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Don't fight

346
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,060
Don't fight

347
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
I don't understand

348
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Don't fight

349
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
Don't fight

350
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
Don't fight

351
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,060
What's going on?

352
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
It's not a ghost. It's a snake.

353
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,060
What?

354
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
A snake.

355
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,060
They say that when snakes are introduced to Chang'an,

356
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
they all look for snakes to buy the sulfur.

357
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,060
From the east to the west,

358
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
they've been making trouble all morning.

359
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
It's winter now.

360
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,060
Snakes should be in the front.

361
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,060
But it's not wrong to buy more sulfur.

362
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
After all, they're going to break their hearts.

363
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
It's a bit of a shame.

364
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Right?

365
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Please, please.

366
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Come on.

367
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Don't snakes like to sleep in winter?

368
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,060
Emperor Liu?

369
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
Go!

370
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
Go!

371
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
It's very cold outside.

372
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,060
Are you okay?

373
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
My dear!

374
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
My dear!

375
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
My dear!

376
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Stop the carriage!

377
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
I'm not stopping the carriage.

378
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,060
Go back to the mansion immediately.

379
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,060
Yes.

380
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Let's go.

381
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,060
Go!

382
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,060
Go!

383
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,060
My dear!

384
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
My dear!

385
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
The carriage is broken.

386
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
There's a snake!

387
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
There's a snake!

388
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
What's wrong?

389
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
There's a snake in the carriage.

390
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
In the carriage!

391
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Go and save the person!

392
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
It's in the carriage!

393
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,060
My dear, did the snake bite you?

394
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
Go and see!

395
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Go and see!

396
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,060
I'm not afraid of snakes!

397
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
What's going on?

398
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
My dear!

399
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,060
Are you okay?

400
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,060
My dear!

401
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
My dear!

402
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,060
My dear!

403
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Are you okay?

404
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
My dear!

405
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Are you okay?

406
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,060
My dear!

407
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
My dear!

408
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,060
My dear!

409
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,060
My dear!

410
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Are you okay?

411
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
I'm not dead.

412
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,060
I'm not dead.

413
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,060
My dear!

414
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,060
My dear!

415
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,060
The dead king and the six ladies...

416
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
What's going on?

417
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
The dead king saved the beauty!

418
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,060
The dead king saved the beauty!

419
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
My dear!

420
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,060
My dear!

421
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
Stop!

422
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
You're not allowed to go to the palace.

423
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
But there's a snake!

424
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
What's the problem with snakes?

425
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
I'm happy to!

426
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
Take it away.

427
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Take it away.

428
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
Grandpa, move aside!

429
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
What's going on?

430
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
Grandpa.

431
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
Take care of her.

432
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
I'll go get some water.

433
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
No, thanks.

434
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,060
What's going on with the four of us?

435
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
After all, we've been engaged for more than ten years.

436
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Maybe we're about to get married.

437
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,060
Grandpa.

438
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
I'm sorry.

439
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,060
Are you done?

440
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,060
Thanks.

441
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,060
I didn't expect that the famous snake palace was so crowded by the six ladies.

442
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
You're fine.

443
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,060
I was lucky to not go out.

444
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
But...

445
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:14,060
You two are lucky to have met each other.

446
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,060
You should just make up.

447
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,060
You're not well.

448
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,060
Have a good rest.

449
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,060
I'm afraid there's something more important.

450
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,060
What is it?

451
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,060
Find out who's hurting me.

452
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Someone's hurting you?

453
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
You mean...

454
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,060
someone designed the whole city to be haunted?

455
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,060
But even if someone did,

456
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,060
what's the use of the snake forest?

457
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,060
I don't know.

458
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,060
But the snake palace can't be left out.

459
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:18,060
I think we can find clues from the snake hunter.

460
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,060
It's only been an hour.

461
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,060
It's not hard to find the snake hunter.

462
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
Say it.

463
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,060
I saw the snake hunter's stuff before I entered the city.

464
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
Give me the money.

465
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
I saw his six statues before I got a cup of tea.

466
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
I know it too!

467
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,060
I saw it in the temple!

468
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
Don't rush.

469
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,060
Don't rush.

470
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,060
Don't rush.

471
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,060
One by one.

472
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,060
Don't rush.

473
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,060
Please spare my life!

474
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,060
I heard you followed a big snake to the city.

475
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
What happened?

476
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
Where's the snake?

477
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,060
Snake...

478
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,060
The snake was in a low position.

479
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,060
It didn't catch the snake.

480
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,060
You look so timid.

481
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,060
You don't have many tools with you.

482
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,060
I don't think you usually see big snakes.

483
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,060
But you catch things like yellow gauze and mud.

484
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,060
But yesterday you claimed that you met a big snake.

485
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,060
You followed it to this place.

486
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
And you brought so many emeralds.

487
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,060
You lied.

488
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,060
Did you get an order from someone?

489
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

490
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,060
Yes.

491
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,060
I made the snake up.

492
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
Why did you make it up?

493
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
It's like this.

494
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,060
You saw it.

495
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,060
I'm not good at catching snakes.

496
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
I can't catch them.

497
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,060
I'm so scared.

498
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,060
So I had to scare the people.

499
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,060
After I'm done, I'll send the snake to the emperor.

500
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,060
And make some money.

501
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
Tell me the truth.

502
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,060
I'm telling the truth.

503
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,060
I don't have any money.

504
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,060
Is he a mortal?

505
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,060
What's behind him?

506
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
It's you.

507
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,060
You scared me.

508
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,060
Sir, you told me to send the emeralds.

509
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,060
I've done it.

510
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,060
Is there anything else?

511
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,060
Nothing.

512
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,060
You can go.

513
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,060
Okay.

514
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,060
I'll leave you alone.

515
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
I'm not drunk.

516
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
I'm not drunk.

517
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
This way.

518
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Slow down.

519
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Your Highness.

520
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,060
Sir, my friends...

521
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
They left.

522
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,060
They left?

523
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,060
Where?

524
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
I didn't see the four-eyes.

525
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,060
But the young man was in a hurry.

526
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,060
I think something happened.

527
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,060
By the way,

528
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
I'm sorry.

529
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,060
I didn't see you.

530
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,060
I'm sorry.

531
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,060
I'm sorry.

532
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,060
I'm sorry.

533
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,060
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,060
I'm sorry.

535
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,060
By the way,

536
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,060
Lady Liu Jiang,

537
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,060
someone asked me to give you this.

538
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,060
The Demon Tree.

539
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,060
The Demon Tree.

540
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,060
Where am I?

541
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
Who tied me up?

542
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,060
Who are you?

543
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Did you tie me up?

544
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,060
Say something!

545
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,060
You're not a hero.

546
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,060
Your Highness.

547
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,060
Your Highness.

548
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Tianhui,

549
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,060
why are you here?

550
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,060
Elder Hui,

551
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,060
I should have asked you.

552
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,060
You're still alive.

553
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,060
Grandpa.

554
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060
I asked Xuanhui

555
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,060
to be your friend.

556
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,060
Grandpa, I want to play with someone.

557
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,060
When did you come to talk?

558
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,060
But you pretend to be a ghost.

559
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,060
What are you doing?

560
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,060
I'm just making trouble for the demon.

561
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Xuanhui,

562
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
have you forgotten

563
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,060
how you were so confident in the Demon Tree?

564
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,060
How I helped you escape from the Demon Tree?

565
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
And now,

566
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,060
you're facing an incompetent mortal.

567
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,060
You're so cruel and despicable.

568
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Elder Hui,

569
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,060
it's my business whether I have any grudges.

570
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,060
It's not your turn to point out the bad things.

571
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
I promised you

572
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,060
to scare the cat in the Demon Tree.

573
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
I did it.

574
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,060
But I didn't promise you

575
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
that it would work.

576
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
As for him,

577
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
he's not an incompetent mortal.

578
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,060
He's my friend.

579
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,060
Grandpa.

580
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,060
Grandpa.

581
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
Stop.

582
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,060
Stop.

583
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,060
Grandpa.

584
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
Grandpa.

585
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
Grandpa.

586
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,060
Grandpa.

587
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,060
You're finally here, Lord Shen Gong.

588
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,060
Elder Hui?

589
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,060
You came back from your death

590
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,060
and must have spent a lot of effort.

591
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,060
Not only to bully an ordinary person

592
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,060
but also a demon who's only a hundred years old.

593
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,060
Me?

594
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,060
Of course it's because of you.

595
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,060
Lady Liu.

596
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,060
Lady Liu.

597
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,060
What are you going to do?

598
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:30,060
I'm going to make a deal with Lord Snake.

599
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,060
I'm going to make a deal with Lord Snake.

600
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,060
Just say it.

601
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,060
I want to use a snake scales on you

602
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,060
to exchange your lives.

603
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,060
How about it?

604
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,060
I'll do it.

605
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:35,060
The flowers of my heart are all withered.

606
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:40,060
The bitter memories are left.

607
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,060
The promise I made to you is like a wind.

608
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:53,060
How can I repay you?

609
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:58,060
The past is like a dream.

610
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:04,060
The most painful moment has changed.

611
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,060
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life.

612
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:15,060
But I can't.

613
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:21,060
The petals of the flower petals are falling.

614
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:27,060
What's wrong with falling in love?

615
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,060
The moonlight shines on the cold and cold.

616
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:38,060
I hold you tight, but you're silent.

617
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:44,060
But the petals of the flower petals are falling.

618
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:50,060
What's wrong with falling in love?

619
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,060
The eyes shine on the end of the memories.

620
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,060
How about it?

621
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,060
Goodbye.

622
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:11,060
Your look is like a wish.

623
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:30,060
Thank you for watching.
