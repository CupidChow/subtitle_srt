1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
little bit of a

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of a

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
little bit of a

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
little bit of a

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
little bit of a

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
little bit of a

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,860
What was that?

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,680
There was only one person

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,960
that laid my hand on Dunhuang.

40
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,080
Just now...

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,320
How wonderful it must be...

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,100
that you overcame those dangers.

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,820
Alas, properly?

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,140
But somebody really was trying to harm studious children

45
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,140
and fought those who their lives lied to them.

46
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,340
You two were so close to me.

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,180
I was so angry.

48
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,020
I couldn't...

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,580
I couldn't... I couldn't help myself.

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,500
I was wondering why I felt strange.

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,940
It turns out...

52
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,420
You're a sweeper.

53
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,340
You're quite a bad guy.

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,500
Please spare me, Your Excellency.

55
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,540
I didn't mean to offend you.

56
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,780
I... I...

57
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,540
I'm just a little sweeper.

58
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,340
Don't say that.

59
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,300
Don't say that.

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,020
I won't take you if you don't do evil.

61
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,980
Get up.

62
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,180
Yes, yes, yes.

63
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,220
Have you been here all these years?

64
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,820
Yes, I have.

65
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,140
I have something to ask you.

66
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,620
Go ahead.

67
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,140
Have you heard of the herb of the fish?

68
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,820
The...

69
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,060
The...

70
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,580
The...

71
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,220
All right, I got it.

72
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,340
I'll go now.

73
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,180
I'll feed you two.

74
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,180
I'll go now.

75
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,620
What herb?

76
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,820
What's it for?

77
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,180
It's a kind of medicine.

78
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,540
It's used to cure and save people.

79
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,940
Cure and save people?

80
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,500
Are you sick?

81
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,540
Are you sick?

82
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,580
Come on.

83
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,580
Slow down.

84
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,580
Are you okay, old lady?

85
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,580
I'm fine.

86
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,580
I fell down.

87
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,580
I'm just a little dizzy.

88
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Thank you, lady.

89
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,580
Old lady, are you going to the mountain to pick herbs?

90
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
Yes.

91
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,580
My family lives in this mountain.

92
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
We pick herbs.

93
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,580
Have you heard of the herb?

94
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,580
Herb?

95
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,580
I think I've heard of it somewhere.

96
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,580
Do you know where the herb is?

97
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,580
Yes.

98
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,580
There's a doctor named Gu in this mountain.

99
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,580
He grows all kinds of herbs and herbs.

100
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,580
Maybe there's something you want.

101
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,580
Let's go and have a look.

102
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Okay.

103
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,580
Thank you, old lady.

104
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,580
Thank you.

105
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,580
Let's go.

106
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Wait.

107
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,580
Let's go to the old lady's.

108
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
Okay.

109
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Are you here to pick herbs?

110
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
Please follow me.

111
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Okay.

112
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,580
It seems that there are many people who come here to see the doctor.

113
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,580
Gu Mingyi is so powerful.

114
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,580
I heard that he has become a half-god.

115
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,580
I think the mortal world is now in his hands.

116
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,580
He is the half-god.

117
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,580
There are many people who come here to see the doctor.

118
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,580
He is so powerful.

119
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
He is the half-god.

120
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,580
The mortal world is in his hands.

121
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,580
I don't know if he is a half-god.

122
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,580
But I heard that he has a divine thing.

123
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,580
It's called the herb.

124
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,580
You all come here for the herb.

125
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,580
Who else comes here for the herb?

126
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,580
Thank you for coming all the way here.

127
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,580
My master is inside.

128
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,580
I and my wife are not welcome.

129
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Please forgive us for disturbing you.

130
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,580
It's okay.

131
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,580
The new one will get what he wants.

132
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,580
It's the voice of the old lady.

133
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
Please be careful.

134
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,580
You should understand that everything in the world has its price.

135
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,580
The disease is also very serious.

136
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,580
I will talk to you according to this.

137
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Please take a rest outside when you are waiting for the incense.

138
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,580
Thank you.

139
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,580
This gentleman is very generous.

140
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,580
I think he doesn't lack anything.

141
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
I don't know why he is looking for medicine.

142
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,580
I have been a rich man since I was a child.

143
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,580
I don't have any requirements.

144
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,580
I am a man of good character.

145
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,580
Although I have a lot of wives,

146
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,580
I have only a few daughters.

147
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,580
I have not had a son.

148
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,580
No one can inherit my family business.

149
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,580
So you got the herb to get a son?

150
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,580
I will get the herb no matter what the price is.

151
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,580
Sir, my master wants to talk to you.

152
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,580
Why is he the first one?

153
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,580
That's right.

154
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,580
We have waited a long time.

155
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,580
Please be patient.

156
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,580
My master said that everything is fair.

157
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,580
It doesn't matter how to treat the disease.

158
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
Sir, please.

159
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:11,580
It's not fair.

160
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,580
Some people are born with a golden spoon.

161
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,580
They have to find ways to pass on the good fortune to their children.

162
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,580
Some people have to suffer.

163
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,580
Suffer?

164
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,580
Sir, you are fair and healthy.

165
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,580
You don't look sick.

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,580
My ancestors were all officials.

167
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:52,580
But I was born with a bad fortune.

168
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,580
I was born with a bad fortune.

169
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,580
But I have been living a good life for a few years.

170
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:07,580
I can't believe that I am old.

171
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,580
I will stay in this world for a few more days.

172
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,580
I will enjoy my wealth and power.

173
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,580
But there is always an end to human beings.

174
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Even if you are greedy, you can't be endless.

175
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Unless you want to live forever?

176
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Of course.

177
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,580
Why can't I live forever?

178
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,580
I have only one wish in my life.

179
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:46,580
I want to make it come true no matter how much I have to pay.

180
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
That's right.

181
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,580
There are so many things in this world.

182
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
I have been beautiful since I was a child.

183
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,580
I have been living in the countryside since I was a child.

184
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,580
But this year, I don't know where the bride came from.

185
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,580
They said she was prettier than me.

186
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,580
I am the first beauty.

187
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,580
I am so happy.

188
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Of course I am not convinced.

189
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,580
As long as I can win her, I am willing to die.

190
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,580
The second day

191
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,580
I have a son!

192
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,580
Thank you very much, Gu Shen Yi.

193
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
I... I have a son!

194
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Elder, my master wants to see you.

195
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
It's easy to say about the birth.

196
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
But the wish of the old man...

197
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
Can't he really live a long life?

198
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
We'll know when he comes out.

199
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
I'll go.

200
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Thank you.

201
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,580
Although I can't live a long life,

202
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,580
I can still be your brother.

203
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
A hundred years of spring and autumn.

204
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Enough.

205
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,580
Enough.

206
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Elder,

207
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
what do you think they said inside?

208
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,580
Why do I feel strange?

209
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
What about me?

210
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
It's getting dark.

211
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,580
I'll be the next one.

212
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,580
Don't worry.

213
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
Let's go.

214
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
You two are not in a hurry.

215
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Everything has its own way.

216
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
We'll come later.

217
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,580
We won't be in a hurry.

218
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Be careful.

219
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,580
I'm the most beautiful now.

220
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,580
I'm the most beautiful now.

221
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
I'm the most beautiful now.

222
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
I'm the most beautiful now.

223
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
I'm the most beautiful.

224
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,580
Be careful.

225
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,580
I'm the most beautiful.

226
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,580
I'm the most beautiful.

227
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
Be careful.

228
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
Take care.

229
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,580
You two are in the same room.

230
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,580
But my master only sees patients.

231
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
So which one of you wants to see a doctor?

232
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,580
Him.

233
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Me?

234
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Me?

235
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Go.

236
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,580
I'll wait for you.

237
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,580
Please come with me.

238
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,580
You're not afraid?

239
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
Afraid of what?

240
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
I heard that Gu Mingyi

241
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
is going to charge you for the treatment.

242
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,580
Aren't you afraid that

243
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
the lady will decide to keep you in the dark?

244
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,580
No.

245
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
Why?

246
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Because you're the real danger.

247
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
I'm not afraid.

248
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Gu Mingyi.

249
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,580
Why are you here?

250
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
What brings you here?

251
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,580
I don't know.

252
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,580
I'm just sick.

253
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,580
I have to see you first.

254
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
You don't even know

255
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,580
You don't know what disease you have.

256
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,580
You have nothing to ask for.

257
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,580
How could you come here?

258
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,580
Forget it.

259
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,580
Let me show you.

260
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,260
To Jun

261
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,240
I have some 73.

262
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,940
73?

263
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,380
Is that the number you are not able to see.

264
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,240
Perhaps it is because we are together.

265
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,180
If it's not meant to be,

266
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,540
why did you have to kill your heart and lungs

267
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,060
and become an old woman

268
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,580
to bring us here?

269
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,100
My lady,

270
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
it's not a good habit

271
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,420
to ask questions.

272
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,180
I'm a good-for-nothing.

273
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,100
Today,

274
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,500
I'll make it clear!

275
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,340
What's going on?

276
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,580
What does that mean?

277
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,940
The person inside is just a puppet.

278
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
He can't be hurt.

279
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
You're the one

280
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
who's leading all of this.

281
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,940
When did you find out?

282
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
I found out as soon as I entered.

283
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,500
This is a thousand years' worth of celestial plants.

284
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,180
It's still...

285
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,900
Old woman,

286
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,260
my master invites...

287
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,420
Hiding human beings under your names

288
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,620
is of no use to you,

289
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,980
is that right?

290
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,380
No, you're mistaken.

291
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,420
I only meant to save you guys.

292
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,420
You are the ones who asked me.

293
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,420
If it's not that you have insisted,

294
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,740
So you mean...

295
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:01,060
You're really a

296
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
after that they changed the color

297
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,280
The

298
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:43,640
everything in this world is fake

299
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,040
To capture the stunt show isn't fake

300
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,920
But as I said everything has its price

301
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,420
People want to make their ambition come true

302
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,900
they will try to sacrifice something more precious

303
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,620
Something more precious?

304
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,220
You still remember that middle-aged Licor ny of the cargo tube

305
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,060
I want a son

306
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,960
I want a son

307
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,200
Indeed, he will have a son.

308
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,920
But on the day of his birth, he will be a loser.

309
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,720
And that old man, even if he is in the rain, what will happen to him?

310
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,760
That's enough.

311
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,240
He's sick and sick. It's better to die.

312
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,880
As for that young lady who wants to change her appearance,

313
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
I took her eyes away.

314
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,000
Even if she has the beauty of Qingcheng,

315
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,520
she can't see anything.

316
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,800
Madman.

317
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,920
Madman? I'm a madman.

318
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,640
In order to achieve your goal, you should be a madman.

319
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,880
Everyone here, in order to achieve your goal,

320
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,080
can do anything.

321
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,880
What about you?

322
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,840
If I take your wife's position,

323
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,000
what kind of price will you pay?

324
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,040
You can try to move her.

325
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,400
Don't worry. I'm not interested in the lives of the businessmen.

326
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,600
But today, I'm lucky to meet a smart man.

327
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Play a game with me. How about it?

328
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,320
Okay. What game?

329
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,440
I took care of all the flowers and plants in the yard.

330
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,680
I'll give you some time to make tea.

331
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,280
If you can find the most precious one,

332
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,880
I'll help you for free.

333
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,280
Okay.

334
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,680
Okay.

335
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,680
You're a bit stupid.

336
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,080
This is just the most common Gongshi Song.

337
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,680
No.

338
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,880
This is the most precious one in this garden.

339
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,680
What do you mean by that?

340
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,280
Because other than this, everything else is fake.

341
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,280
What?

342
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,880
You're an angel?

343
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,080
Yes, a demon.

344
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,480
How many people did you trick these years?

345
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
Just take me away if you can.

346
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,280
But this is not good for you.

347
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,680
Because...

348
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,280
Because he's not a simple demon.

349
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,680
Are you okay?

350
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,280
I found this.

351
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,680
What is this?

352
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,480
It's the medical record he wrote.

353
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Right? It's from the fairy grass.

354
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I don't need this anymore.

355
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Why do you still take it out?

356
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
From the medical record you wrote,

357
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,680
you once took care of people with sincerity.

358
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,880
But why did you become like this?

359
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Sincere?

360
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,680
Sincere is a dream.

361
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,480
As for sincerity,

362
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,880
sincerity is not worth anything to these people.

363
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,680
Many years ago, I was a god of grass and wood.

364
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,880
I was being cultivated by people.

365
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,680
My master would take care of me every day.

366
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,280
I hope that one day I can cultivate spiritual knowledge

367
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,880
and treat diseases and save people.

368
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,080
He said that everything in life is bitter.

369
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,280
Since I have the chance to heal my illness,

370
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,280
I shouldn't waste it.

371
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,280
It's a pity that my cultivation is still shallow.

372
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,680
I can't become a human being.

373
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,880
He said that it's okay. He will wait for me.

374
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,280
I really believe in it.

375
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,480
But when I really became a human being,

376
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
I found out that

377
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,880
I was abandoned.

378
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,880
There was no one in the house.

379
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,280
My master never came back to find me.

380
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,680
I left Chang'an with a broken heart and came to Quzhou.

381
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,280
I wanted to save people here.

382
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,280
But I found out that these people are not worth saving.

383
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,480
What is life bitter?

384
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,680
This is clearly their karma.

385
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Yes.

386
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,880
You saw it too.

387
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,880
In the beginning, I treated every patient with all my heart.

388
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
But what happened?

389
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,080
Free treatment?

390
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,480
How can you believe that?

391
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
Could it be a scam?

392
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,280
What about the medical skills of this doctor?

393
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,680
Didn't you see him before?

394
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,080
I was just having fun.

395
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,080
If you don't charge me, I won't see you.

396
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,880
The wound on your tongue was cured by him?

397
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,080
I don't see him. Even if I don't take his medicine,

398
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,680
it will get better in a few days.

399
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Let's go. Let's go drink.

400
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,080
Let's go drink.

401
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,880
Let's go.

402
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,480
I was already thinking about saving the world, not about money.

403
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
But who knew that they wouldn't believe me?

404
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,880
I went to all the places to get my diagnosis.

405
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,680
I thought that as long as they could recover, they would believe me.

406
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,880
If I could pass on the truth,

407
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,080
I could become a famous doctor in the city.

408
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,480
But even if I did everything on my own,

409
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,080
those people wouldn't believe me.

410
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
My child ate your medicine yesterday.

411
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,280
He will be on the line soon.

412
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,680
Tell me. Is there something wrong with your medicine?

413
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,880
Impossible. Did the child eat food?

414
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,080
And my father.

415
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,480
When you were in the hospital, you said that he would be fine.

416
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,280
But yesterday...

417
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,680
He passed away yesterday.

418
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,880
You are a doctor. You deserve to be treated.

419
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
No, no.

420
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,680
That old man is already in his prime.

421
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Humans have a strong sword.

422
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,280
Leave me alone.

423
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,680
Doctor.

424
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,080
Doctor.

425
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,680
Go.

426
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,080
Life and death are predestined.

427
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Even a doctor can't do anything about it.

428
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,080
I treated patients and saved them. I didn't ask for any compensation.

429
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,280
But what about them? They even gave me up.

430
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,280
I later understood that they were greedy.

431
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
They only wanted what they could afford.

432
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,280
So I made a plan to make them pay a high price.

433
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,280
They knew the consequences, but for the sake of the king,

434
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,480
they still went back on their word and thanked me.

435
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
It's their fault that they treated you like this.

436
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
But you shouldn't be so stubborn.

437
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,880
You dare to say that the latter didn't sincerely ask for your help?

438
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,680
And why would these innocent people take the blame for their predecessors?

439
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,280
Innocent people?

440
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,080
They just haven't shown their true colors.

441
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,880
What's wrong with me being the one who sent them?

442
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,480
Everyone has a obsession.

443
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,080
Some people can spend their whole lives for their obsessions.

444
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,480
But that's not the reason why you love others.

445
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,280
You are indeed very smart.

446
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,880
It's a pity that you've realized my plan.

447
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,680
Otherwise, I will have you, the tongue-in-cheek, exchange for me.

448
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,480
Take this!

449
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,080
Wuzhen! Wuzhen!

450
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Wuzhen!

451
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,280
That was the cat's bow. Who is he?

452
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,480
How do you know about the cat's bow?

453
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,680
How did the cat's bow become a burden to me?

454
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,880
The one you're talking about is the previous cat's bow.

455
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,280
The previous cat's bow? Where is he now?

456
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,680
He died 18 years ago.

457
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,280
He died.

458
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,880
He died?

459
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,880
18 years ago, Chang'an was in a fire and many people died.

460
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,680
The previous cat's bow died because of the old man.

461
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,080
No wonder. There was no one in the house at that time.

462
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,280
No wonder he didn't come back to me.

463
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,680
So he didn't want me. So he died at that time.

464
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,080
It's all my fault.

465
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,880
Why are you blaming him?

466
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,080
It's because I have too much spiritual power.

467
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,880
It's because I can't do anything.

468
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,880
If I could have turned into a human, I might be able to save him.

469
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,280
It's all my fault.

470
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,680
The world is unpredictable. It's all up to fate.

471
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,480
Even if you're here, it can't be changed.

472
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,280
But there are still many days to come.

473
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
There are things that can't be changed.

474
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,880
But there are still things that can be changed.

475
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,880
Please wait 2 minutes.

476
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,080
Where is the monster?

477
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,280
He's already realized his mistake and is now a human.

478
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,280
When I'm better, you don't have to worry about me.

479
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,280
when Yuan's decapitated and fine back.

480
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,280
She doesn't have these feelings apart from getting old.

481
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,280
no more suffering.

482
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,280
the attack of Yuan's texture..

483
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
I have to tell you something.

484
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
But,

485
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,280
I can't save your wife.

486
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
She is not sick,

487
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
but her sister.

488
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
I give you my body.

489
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,280
Maybe it will be useful to you in the future.

490
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Congratulations!

491
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Thank you!

492
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,740
I heard that you've done a lot of work on the case of the

493
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Tui Na Guan and Tang Quan last time.

494
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,040
Now you're starting to learn the math?

495
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,040
It's still my wife who knows me.

496
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,540
I'm just doing some preparations.

497
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,120
What if there's another time

498
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,740
where I can save you from getting caught up in this?

499
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,540
There's no such thing as a chance.

500
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,540
You're not getting caught up in this.

501
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,540
I'm just trying to help you.

502
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
I'm not going to let you get caught up in this.

503
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,540
I'm just trying to help you.

504
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,540
I'm just trying to help you.

505
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,540
I'm just trying to help you.

506
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,540
There's no such thing as a chance.

507
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,540
You're waiting for me here?

508
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
Do you want to come play with me?

509
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,540
No.

510
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,540
Go ahead.

511
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Go ahead.

512
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,540
Lady Ling, this is the place.

513
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
What are you bringing me here to see?

514
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,540
Of course I'm bringing you something fun.

515
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Sit, sit, sit.

516
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,540
Lady Liu, I've learned a new magic these past few days.

517
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Take a look.

518
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,540
I...

519
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,540
I've really learned a new magic!

520
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,540
I'll do it again.

521
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,540
Ah...

522
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Ah...

523
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,540
Ah...

524
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,540
Ah...

525
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,540
Isn't it pretty?

526
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,540
Ah...

527
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
Ah...

528
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
Come out.

529
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,540
Come out? What do you mean, come out?

530
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,060
The

531
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,540
The?

532
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,540
Where is the The?

533
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,540
Where is the The?

534
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,540
It's almost winter.

535
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,540
Where did the fireflies come from?

536
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,540
These should be immortal.

537
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,540
They have a little bit of a monster power.

538
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,540
If it wasn't for the The,

539
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,540
how could you have been able to control them?

540
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,540
I told you I couldn't fool them.

541
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,540
Not to mention the monster power.

542
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,540
You've been so cold-hearted for hundreds of years.

543
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,540
How could you like these things?

544
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
I think Lady Liu likes them.

545
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,540
The moon is dark and the wind is high.

546
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,540
It's normal to see illusions.

547
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
I do like them.

548
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,540
Ah...

549
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,540
You... you two are...

550
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Xuan Hui.

551
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,540
Come here.

552
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,540
What's wrong?

553
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,540
Grandpa.

554
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,540
You're not supposed to be sitting here.

555
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,540
You... you stand here.

556
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,540
Grandpa, I can stand?

557
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
No, no, no.

558
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
You...

559
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,540
Xuan Hui.

560
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
You've been in Chang'an for months.

561
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,540
You can't live like this.

562
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
You've been in the house for two days.

563
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
You've been in the house for two days.

564
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,540
Why don't you find something to do?

565
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,540
Who's hungry?

566
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,540
I've never been late for practice.

567
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Not to mention, I've been practicing for hundreds of years.

568
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,540
If you hadn't put me in the monster prison,

569
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,540
I would have turned into a dragon

570
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,540
and entered the heaven and earth.

571
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,540
I would have been in a lot of trouble.

572
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,540
You didn't turn into a dragon.

573
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
Now you blame me?

574
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,540
That's how it is.

575
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Although the snake king

576
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
is sorry to me,

577
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,540
and he won't admit his mistake,

578
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,540
I was supposed to turn into a dragon.

579
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
Then,

580
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,540
you'll be in the house for two days,

581
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
not in Chang'an.

582
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,540
How can you be so stingy?

583
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Right?

584
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,540
Okay.

585
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,540
I'll wait and see

586
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,540
how you'll enter the heaven and earth,

587
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,540
and be in the house for two days.

588
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,540
Grandpa, I believe you'll turn into a dragon.

589
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Xuan Hui.

590
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
You just called me stingy, right?

591
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
Yes.

592
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
I'm sorry.

593
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
It's so beautiful.

594
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
It's so beautiful.

595
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
It's so beautiful.

596
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,540
If you're sleepy,

597
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,540
you can sleep for a while.

598
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,540
You're a mortal,

599
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
it's normal that you can't hold on for a night.

600
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,540
I'm fine.

601
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,540
I can hold on.

602
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,540
Mrs Liu, are you thirsty?

603
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Here, drink some water.

604
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,540
Here.

605
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,540
Here.

606
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,540
Here.

607
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
Here.

608
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
Here.

609
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,540
Here.

610
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,540
Here.

611
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,540
Here.
