1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Taobao Shankou invites you to watch the purple night

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,560
This must be handled as soon as possible

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
To send

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,960
Purple night can also be delivered in time

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,760
I am Xu Kai

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,360
I use Taobao Shankou to order takeout

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,160
More advantageous

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Invite you to watch the purple night

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,960
Natural water source transparent factory

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,720
Natural mineral elements

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,160
Suitable for the use of long-term farming

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,520
Invite you to watch the purple night

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The legend

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In Chang'an City, there is a secret place

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The name is called the demon world

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The second master of the cat snake

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They are mysterious

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Except for the second master and the four subordinates

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The rest of the important demons are not allowed to enter the human world

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Also avoid the enemy

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's right

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The second master is the most important

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The second master is the most important

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The second master is the most important

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's right

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That subordinate is the master of Changxi Palace

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They helped the court establish the Xuanjian Temple

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Search for the demon

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Want to eliminate the demon blood

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Both sides fight

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And in the end, Changxi Palace was destroyed

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Since then, the demon world has been balanced

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Maintaining the peace between the human and the demon

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Xuanjian Temple is also empty

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Be compared

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The demon world is in full swing

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The storm will finally rise again

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I advise you all

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In this city of Chang'an

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's best to go out after dawn

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Go home before midnight

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There is a demon

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Where do you want to go?

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Go

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Go

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Who is it?

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Chase

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't run

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Chase

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't run

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't run

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't run

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't run

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Search

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's go

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go

57
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Huang Zuo Ling

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wushu Niangzi

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Huang Zuo Ling comes to drink again

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I am here to do business

61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm afraid there are people who dare to come to you

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Daring people

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I only have beauty

64
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No one is afraid

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I clearly saw someone just now

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't mind your drinking money

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have an excuse today

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't ruin my place

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
More expensive than me

70
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,400
The Marquis of Yu'an's mansion

71
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,600
paid a lot of money to build this place.

72
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
He said he would propose to my son

73
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,120
on his birthday.

74
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,880
He finally escaped.

75
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,200
Who?

76
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,680
Marquis.

77
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,320
You can hide from anyone,

78
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,760
but you can't hide from me.

79
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,440
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

80
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,360
What did you want to see me for?

81
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,960
I heard that tomorrow is your birthday.

82
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,840
I prepared a birthday gift for you.

83
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,880
A gift?

84
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,680
This is...

85
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
A wedding ring.

86
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,720
What kind of gift is this?

87
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,520
This is the birthday gift I made for myself.

88
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm giving it to you.

89
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
How many carriages are in this?

90
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,520
This is the top of the mansion of the Marquis of Yu'an.

91
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,160
Whose wedding gift is this?

92
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,680
Brother Mei, it's time to get off work.

93
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,520
Don't be so hasty.

94
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
Look.

95
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,920
We just arrived at the wedding ceremony

96
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,280
for the engagement of my second wife.

97
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Waiter.

98
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
How much is it?

99
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,000
30,000 taels.

100
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,120
Thank you, sir.

101
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,280
Would you like to have a look?

102
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,680
What's so good about this?

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
Is this your first time in Chang'an?

104
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
I've been here for a month.

105
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,000
You've been here for a month.

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,080
But you don't know about the famous

107
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,840
and famous wedding ceremony in Chang'an.

108
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
My second wife

109
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,880
is the daughter of the Empress of the Wuzhen Palace.

110
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,960
She is the daughter of the Emperor's daughter,

111
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,840
the famous and famous wedding ceremony.

112
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,520
From�

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,640
This is the real gift I give to you.

114
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,320
If you are not weak, give me a gift.

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

116
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,720
Everyone knows that we are both rich and generous.

117
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,440
We are not the kind of people who care about etiquette.

118
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,400
Today is the day of the engagement ceremony.

119
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,920
It's hard to be self-reliant.

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
It's nothing to be happy about

121
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
and be willful about.

122
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,340
Yes, it makes sense.

123
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,440
Little Marquis,

124
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,840
come with me.

125
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,840
Dad.

126
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,080
You...

127
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,180
Be good to me.

128
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,420
Why didn't you answer later?

129
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,860
That woman

130
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,180
gave me surpluses.

131
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,020
Here.

132
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,060
Have some peaches to FY.

133
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,660
You really are something.

134
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,860
You never chose the wrong hand or emotion.

135
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,860
You've ruined all my bancoids.

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,100
You are such abase.

137
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,980
Out of starch arm of the Marquis,

138
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,420
I already helped you

139
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,580
How much did you earn?

140
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,180
It's a lot of money.

141
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,500
You didn't suspect the people from the Imperial Court, right?

142
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,620
I lost my way and couldn't find the clue.

143
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,260
I've arranged them to sit down and have a drink.

144
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,820
The smell of blood.

145
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,300
Did you fight with the monster just now?

146
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,380
It's the monster that killed people in the street.

147
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,460
Where's the monster?

148
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,380
It ran away.

149
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,460
But this fight

150
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,380
gave me some clues.

151
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,460
That monster might be like you.

152
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,500
A greedy one.

153
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,340
What do you mean?

154
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,540
Do you remember

155
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,300
the previous few events?

156
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,300
The first one

157
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,700
was the exorcism of the Ding Shi Lang.

158
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,380
He went home that day to get married,

159
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,780
dressed up,

160
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,940
dressed up,

161
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,140
and wore gold rings.

162
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,540
The second one

163
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,500
was the daughter of Tian Shi Lang, Mrs. Tian.

164
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,700
She's a regular guest in the city's jewelry shop.

165
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,580
She likes to dress up.

166
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,340
The third one

167
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,900
was the West Lake Shop.

168
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,980
The Lake Shop

169
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,780
is from the place where gold was produced in the West.

170
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,660
It's full of gold.

171
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,940
And the girl who was attacked

172
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,380
brought a pair of gold earrings.

173
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,740
It seems that

174
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,420
we have to make a decision

175
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,940
to lure her out.

176
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,340
Second Lady.

177
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,020
It's Ming Zhuang.

178
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,620
Tomorrow is the second lady's birthday.

179
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,460
Her Highness the Empress

180
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,900
asked me to send her a gift.

181
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,460
It turns out that Sister's wedding gift

182
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,460
arrived in advance.

183
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,540
That's right.

184
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,900
Her Highness also said that on the previous year's birthday of the county magistrate,

185
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,260
Her Highness had selected

186
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,340
twenty men from Chang'an as her names.

187
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,380
But she couldn't choose

188
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,740
the one that would suit her.

189
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,620
This year, Her Highness

190
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,020
is not so idle.

191
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,500
She ordered all the families

192
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,380
to hand over the chosen men

193
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,420
to be given a prize.

194
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,180
I believe that she will get a good reward.

195
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,860
Of course she got lucky.

196
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,340
Since you want success,

197
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,940
I'll see you right away.

198
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,820
Ming Zhuang,

199
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,900
send it down.

200
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,380
Tomorrow we'll have

201
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,260
a big birthday party

202
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,780
to attract the talents of all families.

203
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,700
Yes.

204
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,940
This is really urgent.

205
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,140
Go and tell them

206
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,220
that they will not address the giftdraw for tomorrow's birthday.

207
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,100
However, we cover slope

208
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,980
What should I do?

209
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,340
I'll wait for the right time.

210
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,660
Mei, help me.

211
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,020
I always get scolded by Minister Xu.

212
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
I'm a good coroner.

213
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,260
I'm punished to be a spy.

214
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,260
If this continues,

215
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
I'll be fired.

216
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,180
I feel so sorry for him.

217
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,580
I don't know anything about

218
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,580
what you did.

219
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm afraid I can't help you.

220
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,060
Of course you can.

221
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,220
I heard that

222
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,700
you're quite talented.

223
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,060
If you didn't miss three questions

224
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,380
and got the seventh place,

225
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,420
you wouldn't have come to our Xuanjian Bureau.

226
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,260
I can't help you

227
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,620
with the work.

228
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,540
But it's different today.

229
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,500
I heard that Xu was late for the banquet yesterday.

230
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,580
He was mocked

231
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,220
for having a dinner at our Xuanjian Bureau.

232
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,620
If I go to him now,

233
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,740
I'm afraid he'll call me directly

234
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,580
to check the dark library.

235
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,620
What?

236
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,260
Check the dark library?

237
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,380
Yes.

238
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,780
That place is so hazy.

239
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,140
The old masters who used to

240
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,580
take care of the dark library

241
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,860
all went home without a reason.

242
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,820
They went in and out of the right place.

243
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,300
Are you sure

244
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,460
that Minister Xu will be

245
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,740
beaten to check the dark library?

246
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,540
Yes.

247
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,580
I'll help you

248
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,020
if we have another meeting.

249
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,500
Let's go.

250
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,780
The bookworms in the government office

251
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,340
are so suspicious

252
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,940
and suspicious.

253
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,900
They're so secretive.

254
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,900
What about the gold guards?

255
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,740
They've searched the whole city for days.

256
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,820
They didn't find anything.

257
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,540
When it rains heavily in the city,

258
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,300
they'll hand the case to our Xuanjian Bureau.

259
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,620
What's the use of you?

260
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,620
What's the use of you?

261
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,620
Minister.

262
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,220
You.

263
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,260
Come here.

264
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,380
You seem to be more talented.

265
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,540
You're bold and brave.

266
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,580
What's your idea?

267
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,060
You're a man of great virtue.

268
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,740
Now you've seen the common people

269
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,020
and steal from the ghost city.

270
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,820
You must be unwilling to let go

271
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,780
and let people go.

272
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,780
You're the one who can't

273
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,580
do what common people can't do.

274
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
That's what you want

275
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,300
from the Xuanjian Bureau.

276
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,060
Well said.

277
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,580
I think

278
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,900
the Xuanjian Bureau

279
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,940
can't rely only on

280
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,820
asking for the evidence

281
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,820
and recording the whereabouts.

282
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,740
It needs to find the real culprit.

283
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm sure you'll be

284
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,020
well-prepared

285
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,300
and know where the case is.

286
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,380
At that time,

287
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,700
the culprit

288
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
or the monster

289
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,380
can't escape from your hands.

290
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:35,980
You.

291
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,660
In this way,

292
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,020
you won't be pointed out

293
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,660
as a weakling every time you go out.

294
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,500
You can only hide in the house

295
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,820
and be angry.

296
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,420
You.

297
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,260
You.

298
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,860
Get out of my sight.

299
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,060
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:57,660
Get out.

301
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,180
I'll get out, too.

302
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,460
We'll get out, too.

303
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,500
You're from the Mei family.

304
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,660
You're a low-ranking official

305
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,780
in such a place.

306
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,060
So what?

307
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,860
We have our own ways of living

308
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,540
and our own causes and conditions.

309
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,820
Great.

310
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,540
I just heard

311
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,020
such a rumor.

312
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,380
It's really

313
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,380
a great honor

314
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,580
and a great honor.

315
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,300
Brother.

316
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,220
I think it's time

317
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
for you to leave.

318
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,980
What's up, Brother?

319
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,020
Something.

320
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,780
Zhu Yu,

321
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,500
go to the banquet with me.

322
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,740
I'm not interested.

323
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,700
Zhu Yu,

324
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,620
help me, Brother.

325
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,580
Or I'll be beaten by my father.

326
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,100
I can help you.

327
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,740
Tell me

328
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,900
what's going on.

329
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,820
Have you seen

330
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,740
the daughter of the Qinghe County Lord of the Wu Family,

331
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,420
Wu Zhen?

332
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,500
I know her.

333
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,300
Li Youwen.

334
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,140
Her Majesty ordered all the families

335
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,620
to show the names of the unmarried men

336
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,660
to my second daughter.

337
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,740
You know

338
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,940
Her Majesty loves her very much.

339
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,460
She said...

340
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,220
Mind your words.

341
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,540
All families have to show the names of the unmarried men.

342
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,180
The Xie family who is so arrogant

343
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,260
has taken 19 men.

344
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,140
We don't want to admit defeat.

345
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,860
So, Brother, I...

346
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,660
I've taken them all.

347
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,140
I've taken them all.

348
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,420
I don't...

349
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,340
Mind your words.

350
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,460
We've taken 20 men.

351
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,980
Zhu Yu.

352
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,260
So,

353
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,220
you're just a man

354
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,340
who takes the lead.

355
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,900
I, Zhen, will never...

356
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,180
I will never take your...

357
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,420
I promise

358
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,420
it will be a...

359
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,580
A...

360
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,580
Pure banquet.

Come on, come on.

This town is really rough.

379
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
The second prince is enjoying his time.

380
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
He's always a man of his word.

381
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
He's really a man of his word.

382
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
He's really good at dancing.

383
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Little fish, stop looking.

384
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
It's already been put on.

385
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Put down your scroll.

386
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Thank you, Mister.

387
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Thank you, Mister.

388
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Thank you, talented man.

389
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
His poem is really good.

390
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
His poem is really good.

391
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Some people are willing to give up everything for a poem.

392
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Little fish,

393
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
that's the worst one in the Xie family.

394
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
The fifth most famous singer,

395
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
the famous Xie Luobai.

396
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Four years ago, he was still pursuing the real world.

397
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Xiao Si, I'll go over there and put it on.

398
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Okay.

399
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
The person from the Mei family?

400
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Which one of the Mei family is this young man?

401
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Why haven't I seen him before?

402
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Do we still have to report to the Xie family?

403
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I saw that young man's appearance was quite good.

404
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Could it be that Mister Mei went to find someone to make noodles?

405
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Isn't he a small official from a certain family?

406
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
That's right.

407
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
You guys are eating shit.

408
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Your mouths are not that smelly.

409
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
I'm Pang Zhi from the Mei family.

410
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
I'm the second son of the Mei family.

411
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm Pang Zhi from the Mei family.

412
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
I'm the same group as the fourth brother.

413
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Pang Zhi from the Mei family?

414
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
It seems that there was indeed a young man who came to Chang'an a while ago.

415
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,040
You're the one who was the one who was sent to the Xuanjian branch?

416
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
That's right.

417
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,040
I didn't expect that there was someone more powerful in the Mei family.

418
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
What did you say?

419
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,040
The Xuanjian branch has been empty for decades.

420
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
This young man went to the Xuanjian branch

421
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
and was delayed for the future.

422
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Don't make the Fifth Madam unhappy by looking at people like that.

423
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Make her feel that the Mei family is just a good friend of the Wu family.

424
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
But she turned her head from a chicken leg to a garland

425
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
and made it look like she was playing around.

426
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Playing around?

427
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
You, you, you, you're a crab.

428
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
You can't put your mouth down.

429
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,040
If it wasn't for the Mei family wants to play around with the Fifth Madam,

430
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
it should be the husband's own thinking.

431
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,040
The main idea is to trick the Fifth Madam and himself

432
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,040
to get a good life through his own face and take advantage of it.

433
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
That's how to make the Fifth Madam happy.

434
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,000
to take advantage of it.

435
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,520
Speaking of taking advantage of it,

436
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,280
today is the fifth lady's birthday.

437
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,760
You'd better eat and drink

438
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
and keep some good food in your mouth.

439
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,280
A person from a faraway family

440
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,120
dares to talk to us like this.

441
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,880
It seems that the Meis are indeed

442
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,720
unruly to their children.

443
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,960
It's okay.

444
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,000
The Xies are willing to take care of them.

445
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,680
No.

446
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,640
Xie Deng Luobai, what do you want?

447
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,720
Let me go.

448
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,800
You.

449
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,640
Go up and teach this young man.

450
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,000
Me?

451
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,080
I...

452
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,600
My Heavenly Brother.

453
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,400
What are you doing, Mr. Xie?

454
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,280
You dare to bully herself

455
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,840
on my birthday party?

456
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,160
What you said

457
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,360
is just a joke.

458
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,080
It's a pity

459
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,800
that this young man

460
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,400
has never seen anything.

461
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,600
He is a traitor.

462
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
He is a businessman.

463
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,760
He doesn't give you any respect.

464
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,120
Why should I give you respect?

465
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,920
The person I like

466
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,120
can give you no respect.

467
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,240
What are you joking about?

468
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,600
I'm not joking.

469
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,200
Didn't you say

470
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,080
the man I like

471
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,720
is prettier than you?

472
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,240
I didn't say that.

473
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,200
You know you are inferior to him.

474
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
You probably don't have the right to apologize.

475
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,680
Apologize?

476
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,440
Why?

477
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,480
What?

478
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,880
You want to be kicked out

479
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,560
like Young Master?

480
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,680
The servant did it in private.

481
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,640
It has nothing to do with me.

482
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,280
Leave it to Fifth Young Madam.

483
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,360
Come here.

484
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,720
Wei Xiaosi.

485
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,840
This handsome young man

486
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,280
is actually attracted by Fifth Young Master.

487
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,040
This little octopus.

488
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,720
He is flying and turning into a phoenix.

489
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,840
Mr. Mei.

490
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,400
Your Ladyship.

491
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,080
Can I have Fifth Young Madam?

492
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,280
I helped you just now.

493
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,640
You don't thank me?

494
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,040
Thank you, Fifth Young Madam.

495
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,600
But this little octopus was also forced.

496
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,640
I hope Fifth Young Madam won't make it hard for him.

497
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,880
You are so kind.

498
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,880
Forget it.

499
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,240
You can count on me.

500
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,800
What?

501
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,120
The people in Xieluo Bo love to talk nonsense.

502
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,640
But there is one thing

503
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,320
that makes sense.

504
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,240
The young man

505
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,120
looks good.

506
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,200
He can fool people.

507
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,280
He can fool people.

508
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,000
But I have an appointment tonight.

509
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,000
I'll ask you for tea another day.

510
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,080
No need.

511
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,680
See you.

512
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,440
By the way,

513
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,040
what's your name?

514
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,400
I'm Mei Zhuyu.

515
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,560
Mei Zhuyu?

516
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,680
Did he ask you to leave?

517
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,760
The young man just said

518
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,880
I was forced to leave.

519
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,200
He won't blame me.

520
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
He doesn't blame you.

521
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,560
I blame him.

522
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,600
The banquet tonight

523
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,200
is for you.

524
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
I don't understand what you are talking about.

525
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,000
I... I'm leaving.

526
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,160
Stop pretending.

527
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,840
I've been observing

528
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,200
that you are the most

529
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,440
handsome among all the guests.

530
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,640
I suddenly shot you with a bow and arrow.

531
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,080
If it's a long day,

532
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,160
I'll be avoiding you.

533
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,080
But you

534
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,760
are very cold.

535
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,320
I was just fooled.

536
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,440
That's because you know

537
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,760
that arrows can't hurt you.

538
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,800
Aren't you curious

539
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,640
why I noticed that?

540
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,720
Let me tell you.

541
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,800
I'm not just my look.

542
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,160
I let you run away yesterday.

543
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,280
So I ordered the guests

544
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
to wear gold and silver

545
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,520
to show themselves to you.

546
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,360
You didn't see me yesterday.

547
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,400
Stop pretending.

548
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,320
Don't think about it today.

549
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,040
Zhuyu,

550
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,760
the wine is good today.

551
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,240
Let's have another banquet with Brother 4th next time.

552
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,720
Slow down.

553
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,280
What's that sound?

554
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,960
No.

555
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,360
Are you in a hurry?

556
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,600
You can't wait for me.

557
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,160
No.

558
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,680
I think I heard

559
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,520
that you are fine.

560
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,200
Fine?

561
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,800
I can't be fine anymore.

562
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,760
Excuse me.

563
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,280
Mr. Mei.

564
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,440
Why are you here?

565
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Why are you in a hurry?

566
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,920
Do you want to join us?

567
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,920
Yes.

568
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,960
Brother 4th.

569
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,160
Brother 4th.

570
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,600
Why did you drink so much today?

571
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,280
I didn't drink much.

572
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,200
Wow, it's cute.

573
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,800
Foreigners all said that it was M Wouldn

574
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,360
who received the more powerful danger.

575
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,480
It's so lively

576
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,480
to have the breathe here.

577
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,200

诛邪当服

584
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Let me see.

585
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,480
Welcome to

586
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,040
the Demon Realm of Chang'an.

587
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,480
Chang'an is not a place

588
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,880
where you can just wander around.

589
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,680
Don't think about moving these people.

590
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,920
Although I am a hostage,

591
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,840
I have never hurt a demon.

592
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,680
You can say that?

593
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,480
I saw your birthday the other day.

594
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,600
That's not me.

595
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,640
Not you.

596
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,440
It's my hallucination.

597
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,920
I know that someone in Chang'an has been following her.

598
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,960
I've been looking for her whereabouts.

599
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,760
Her?

600
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,040
Make it clear.

601
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,560
Do you know what my origin is?

602
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,880
The Demon Realm of Chang'an

603
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,000
Come out.

604
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,600
Every time she hides behind me,

605
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,880
she isn't crisp.

606
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,440
You seem to be fresh.

607
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,360
You don't tell me

608
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,600
everything gets banned in the mortal world now.

609
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,140
Tell me

610
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,680
why you don't hand that demon away.

611
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,360
Because the killer has another easter egg.

612
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,420
Look.

613
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,780
Earrings?

614
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,140
Earrings form pairs.

615
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,360
They are also divided into one part as each made from that.

616
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,480
You mean

617
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,680
and the other half of the palace.

618
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,020
The one who is

619
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,040
showing off the palace talisman

620
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,480
and the one who is doing evil is the mother talisman.

621
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,080
But the reason why the mother talisman

622
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
attacks the one who is carrying the golden key

623
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,480
is to find the other half of the lost.

624
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,080
Even a small earring

625
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,400
can turn into a crystal and

626
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,960
give birth to soul spirit.

627
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,160
Just now, I heard him say

628
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,120
that they were made into ear rings

629
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,680
during the previous dynasty

630
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,400
and were paired with people

631
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,840
to nourish them with the spirit of the human being

632
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,000
and turn them into gold.

633
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,640
That's right.

634
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,640
For hundreds of years, we have been living together

635
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,680
and being paired with the mother talisman.

636
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,440
Half a month ago,

637
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,520
we first came to Chang'an

638
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,840
to see the beautiful scenery.

639
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,080
I had a feeling of being lost.

640
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,960
Until a lot of strange things happened in Chang'an,

641
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,160
I found that

642
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,880
Fu Xi was trying to find me.

643
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
I was just guessing.

644
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,200
That monster may be obsessed with gold.

645
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,200
It turned out to be looking for you.

646
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
But why did you

647
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
appear in Ruyi Pavilion again?

648
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,600
Fu Lei heard the spirit of the spirit.

649
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,440
I heard the voice he made

650
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,520
near Ruyi Pavilion.

651
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,920
I wanted to persuade him to stop looking for me

652
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,840
and stop harming people.

653
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,280
That's how I became a servant

654
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,440
and got into the banquet.

655
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,360
I'll go teach Fu Yan to check the ice.

656
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,000
No need.

657
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,480
I'm afraid that the mother talisman

658
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
has already been attached to someone else.

659
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,040
The day I want to fight with him,

660
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,560
he may have gone into the desert.

661
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,360
If I don't find him again,

662
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,480
there will be more trouble.

663
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,120
After the monster enters the demon,

664
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,720
you must be very careful.

665
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,480
Xiao Zhen, you are a half-monster.

666
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,400
You have no power in the daytime.

667
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,760
I know.

668
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,600
Fortunately,

669
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,560
Fu Lei is also in the night.

670
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,320
I'll wait until nightfall.

671
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,320
It's all my fault.

672
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
I'm weak in the demon power.

673
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
I can't help you.

674
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,520
Of course you can help me.

675
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,160
Uncle,

676
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,280
can you go to the Xuanjian Temple with me?

677
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,080
Of course.

678
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,080
The best spring tea.

679
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,640
Try it, my lady.

680
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,440
It's still good.

681
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,600
Brother Nian,

682
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,840
do you think this lady

683
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,440
really came to repay the favor

684
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,400
because she lost all her money?

685
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,200
It's hard to say.

686
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,040
I think

687
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,320
her intention to get drunk

688
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,600
is in Brother Mei.

689
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,080
What did she like about Mr. Mei?

690
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,600
Face.

691
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Mr. Mei, you don't like me?

692
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,840
My lady, you worry too much.

693
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,520
How dare Mr. Mei not like you?

694
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,760
Come here.

695
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,880
Come here.

696
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,920
Come here.

697
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,760
I met you last night.

698
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,640
Mr. Mei and I have a lot of fate.

699
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,080
But you are cruel.

700
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,040
You know I lost the money

701
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,760
and I'm not at ease.

702
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,560
Please explain to me.

703
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
I'll try my best.

704
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,400
What?

705
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,320
You wrote a sentence lightly

706
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
to comfort me?

707
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,600
Yes.

708
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,200
Here.

709
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,120
The county magistrate

710
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,400
has won this round.

711
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,200
We are brought to glory, Your crown princess.

712
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,400
If you want some thing,

713
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,480
Mr. Mei will do it.

714
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,320
She will not let you down

715
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,800
even if she Islamics.

716
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
The silk room.

717
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,560
Why are you here?

718
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,760
I'm here to play with you.

719
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,760
You're just in time.

720
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,960
What?

721
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,480
You're missing me?

722
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,800
Since you reported that

723
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,080
you lost your money last night,

724
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,240
according to the rules,

725
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,000
you need to submit a letter of appeal.

726
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,320
Can't you help me?

727
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,720
According to the rules,

728
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,160
you need to write to me personally.

729
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,320
I'm sorry.

730
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,600
I need to think of a way

731
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,840
to get this young man out of here.

732
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,480
I'm hungry.

733
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,680
Can you make me something to eat?

734
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,840
What do you want to eat?

735
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,640
Anything.

736
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,040
Something complicated.

737
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,440
Today, the ghost case

738
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,960
is all over Xuanjian Temple.

739
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,880
Maybe we can find the silk horse

740
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,160
in the scroll.

741
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,640
Sir,

742
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,120
you can walk back.

743
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,880
Başcu, go now.

744
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,560
What are you doing, Fifth Young Madam?

745
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,320
I'm just visiting your office.

746
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,840
Fifth Young Madam,

747
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,520
this is a public place.

748
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,160
I'm afraid it's a little inconvenient.

749
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,400
Why don't you eat in the Four Seasons' Kitchen?

750
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm sorry to have your clothes dirty.

751
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,520
I'm hungry.

752
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,040
I'm dizzy.

753
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,840
It's okay.

754
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,160
Let's eat.

755
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,400
You changed your clothes.

756
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,320
I'm sorry.

757
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,440
Fifth Young Madam is in the room.

758
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,960
Why don't you open the door?

759
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,640
I don't want to scare her.

760
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,760
Su Zhong, I've finished writing the song for you.

761
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,480
Please read it later.

762
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,240
Didn't you say

763
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
you had to write the song according to the rules?

764
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,600
I think Fifth Young Madam is too lazy to write these.

765
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,400
I have to break the rules.

766
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,000
My sister once told me

767
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,360
that life is in the world.

768
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,440
You can't make a big mistake.

769
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,040
Do you know why?

770
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,080
Why?

771
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,200
Because if a person makes a mistake and breaks the rules,

772
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,320
he will make another mistake.

773
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,080
Just like you broke the first rule,

774
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,000
there will be a next one.

775
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,000
I won't do that again.

776
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,360
I heard on my way here

777
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,200
that there is a broken road at the door of your house.

778
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,920
It's long, narrow and muddy.

779
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,480
You can't even get in the carriage.

780
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,440
The donkey carriage of you

781
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,800
was built by Lin Li at the entrance.

782
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,720
I'm very curious.

783
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,280
There is no money

784
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,680
or future in Xuanjian Temple.

785
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,800
Why are you still willing to stay here?

786
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,680
I'll get my pay and get my revenge.

787
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,520
I'll do the same wherever I go.

788
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,040
I'll just do my own thing.

789
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,320
Get your pay and get your revenge.

790
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,040
Get your pay and get your revenge?

791
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,480
It seems that you want to be a real gentleman.

792
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,640
Unlike me,

793
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,760
I only know to eat, drink and play.

794
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,280
I can't sleep.

795
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,040
Everyone in Chang'an is afraid of me,

796
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,360
scolding me,

797
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,560
and giving me instructions behind my back.

798
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,720
I don't care about them.

799
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,000
I wonder how others' hearts

800
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,960
can be clouded

801
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,240
and easily black and white.

802
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,260
Wolfie

803
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:06,040
I love you forever

804
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,040
If the love story can be re-written

805
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,040
and everything can be changed

806
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,040
I will wait for you for the rest of my life

807
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,040
See destiny break the seal

808
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,040
Love reincarnation

809
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,040
Wait for the return

810
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
When the world turns into the ocean

811
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
Pass through the past

812
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,040
This life has never left

813
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,040
Not quit persistence

814
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,040
Dye the time

815
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,040
Love
