1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,260
The

2
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,260
The

3
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,260
The

4
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,260
The

5
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,260
The

6
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,260
The

7
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,260
The

8
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,260
The

9
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,260
The

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,280
The

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,280
The

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
The

13
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,280
The

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,280
The

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,320
The

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
The

17
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,320
The

18
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,900
I'm going to make a

19
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,440
flower for the flower

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,440
I'm going to make a flower for the flower

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm going to make a flower for the flower

22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,440
I'm going to make a flower for the flower

23
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,440
I'm going to make a flower for the flower

24
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,700
I'm going to make a flower for the flower

25
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,700
I'm going to make a flower for the flower

26
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,700
I'm going to make a flower for the flower

27
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,700
Do you know

28
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,700
Mei Zhu is related to the Changxi Palace?

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
You're right.

30
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Because you said it.

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
I'll do it myself.

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
I'll do it myself.

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
I'll do it myself.

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
You like to do it yourself.

36
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
You like to do it yourself.

37
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
I know.

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
If you don't see this,

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
you won't give up on Mei Zhu no matter what.

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
you won't give up on Mei Zhu no matter what.

41
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
But Xiao Zhen,

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
I really didn't expect

43
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
that it would end up like this.

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
I didn't expect that yuan-pellet

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
to be in your body.

46
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
A'Rou,

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
why don't I recognize you?

48
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
You're still awake?

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
You're still awake?

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
You've been doing this for a whole night?

52
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
What's wrong with my wife?

53
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
What's wrong with my wife?

54
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
I've asked Ling Xiao earlier.

55
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
I've asked Ling Xiao earlier.

56
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
If something bad happened this time,

57
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Cat Lord and Snake Lord,

58
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
they're all injured.

59
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
But it's okay,

60
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
they won't die.

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Don't worry.

62
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
If something bad happened,

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
and they're injured,

64
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
how can I not worry?

65
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
I've said it too.

66
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
I've said it too.

67
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
It's not a big deal.

68
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
You're only half of the way.

69
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
But you mentioned about life and death.

70
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
It's not easy.

71
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
If I know who caused her so much trouble,

72
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
I'll beat him up.

73
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
You know this person.

74
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
You know him too.

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Who?

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
The one in your family.

77
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
He's much prettier than you.

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Little bamboo fish?

79
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,440
They haven't come back for a whole night?

80
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,440
But my wife is in a bad mood.

81
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
She took your husband out to play.

82
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
When my husband didn't come back for a whole night,

83
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
he would tell me

84
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
that he was going to come back.

85
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
He would tell me that

86
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
he was going to come back.

87
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Now my husband

88
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
is not in a good mood.

89
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Your husband is kind.

90
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
He can't be with you now.

91
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I...

92
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
He should be kind to his wife.

93
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
He should be kind to his wife.

94
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
But I'm the second good person in the family.

95
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
But I'm the second good person in the family.

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
No.

97
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Third.

98
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Fourth.

99
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Is it the fifth?

100
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Since you're going to go abroad for your birthday,

101
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
why do you have to prepare this?

102
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
What did she prepare?

103
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Mr. Mei.

104
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Mr. Mei.

105
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Didn't my wife come back with you?

106
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
You have finished the first half of you?

107
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Stop.

108
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
What are you doing in our house?

109
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I know you.

110
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I made you dinner before you left.

111
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Let me take Beanny away.

112
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Give it to your wife.

113
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
No!

114
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
When did it happen?

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
We were alone.

116
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
So what?

117
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
You have an affair with a bookstore owner.

118
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,600
snack-DCXC goes back

119
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,720
oh

120
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,780
small remains

121
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,540
I'll

122
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:47,820
Have to

123
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,480
Ask for a

124
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,780
There is no

125
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
scream

126
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,760
ka

127
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,200
NEXT

128
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,000
G language

129
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
How can I say it?

130
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
You really went into the demon room?

131
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,040
What did you do in the demon room?

132
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
Don't you have an earring?

133
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,240
You still want to ask me?

134
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,440
My earring is not very sharp.

135
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
I just said a rough idea.

136
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,640
What is rough idea?

137
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
She is the manager of the Leng Xiao in the house of Liu Niangzi.

138
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,640
She said you broke into the demon room.

139
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,040
And she said you were too heartless.

140
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,840
What are you doing here?

141
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,040
Zhu Yu.

142
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
Didn't you go into the demon room before?

143
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,640
Can you go in again?

144
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,840
Why?

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Your brother and I

146
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
are worried about Liu Niangzi.

147
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,240
I don't know what you are thinking.

148
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,840
That's all?

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,240
You?

150
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,240
Yes.

151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,040
When did you get the gear?

152
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
It's somewhere else.

153
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Ohh, I see.

154
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,240
Can you use your skills?

155
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,040
Well, not very well though.

156
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
I didn't see them.

157
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,640
I didn't open the door.

158
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Thank you.

159
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Thank you.

160
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
It's a mortal's song.

161
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
It's not easy to be a half-monster.

162
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
And I've sealed it for 18 years.

163
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
If not this time,

164
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
I don't know

165
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,640
what's hidden in my body.

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
The old cat palace said

167
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
there's no advantage in the world

168
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
but there's a price to pay.

169
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
I thought it was a conspiracy.

170
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
I didn't expect

171
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
it was him.

172
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Zhu Yu,

174
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
when are you going to

175
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
enter the demon's room with me?

176
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
You have a wide range of connections.

177
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Why don't you find someone else?

178
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
For example, Ling Xiao and Hu Zhu.

179
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
You think I haven't found them?

180
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
I promised them.

181
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I can't come here.

182
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
But after asking around,

183
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
I've figured it out.

184
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
They don't understand me.

185
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Zhu Yu,

186
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
only you

187
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
can connect with me.

188
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Ling Xiao,

189
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
I can't take you to the demon's room.

190
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
It's okay.

191
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
I'm patient.

192
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Let's see who can get through.

193
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
I'll go.

194
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Why are you still here?

195
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm here to take Xiao Zhen to rest.

196
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
The cat palace is staying with me today.

197
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Why?

198
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
I'm a man of my word.

199
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
You know how to avoid it.

200
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Don't you know why the cat is staying with me?

201
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
I'll stay with him in the demon's room.

202
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
You can go back to work.

203
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
Let's go.

204
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
What kind of wine am I drinking?

205
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Why is my mouth so big?

206
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Zhu Yu,

207
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
thank god you're here.

208
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
It smells so good.

209
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
If you need anything,

210
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
you don't have to bother.

211
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
We're not missing each other.

212
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
I'll come back when you're free.

213
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
That's for sure.

214
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I was worried about

215
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
the long-term treatment of Uncle Zhao.

216
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
But I'm not from the Changxi Palace.

217
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
I can't stay with him

218
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
and clean up the mess.

219
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Now the position of the master is vacant.

220
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
I want to hand him over to the second brother

221
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
and keep him as a substitute.

222
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Since the master left him to you,

223
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
he's yours now.

224
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,640
It was because Changming was practicing the evil arts,

225
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
that Changxijian refused to come back.

226
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
The second brother is very considerate.

227
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Changxijian will recognize him.

228
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Besides,

229
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Zhu Yu hasn't had time

230
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
to thank the second brother

231
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
for helping him in the night.

232
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
The night formation?

233
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
What does it have to do with the second brother?

234
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
The first brother

235
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
will be the second brother.

236
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
I can't come again.

237
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
The second brother can't stand it.

238
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Yes,

239
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
there is no third time

240
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
to change the formation twice.

241
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
That night,

242
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
I saw someone leave,

243
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
but I didn't know his identity.

244
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,640
I don't know how many tricks he did.

245
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,640
That's why I couldn't stop him in time.

246
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,640
If you hadn't been in touch with Changxijian,

247
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,640
you would have been in big trouble.

248
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Then the second brother

249
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
drove me down the mountain.

250
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
He seemed to be strict,

251
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
but he was a good man.

252
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
He was more considerate.

253
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Thank you, second brother.

254
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Not only me,

255
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
but also him.

256
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Changxijian was given to you by the master.

257
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
He will naturally protect you.

258
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,640
With Changxijian by your side,

259
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
we can rest assured.

260
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
But Changxi Palace...

261
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Did I say that?

262
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
The task of the master

263
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
shouldn't be controlled by the army.

264
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Although the demon clan of Chang'an

265
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
is not what Changming said,

266
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
it is still the same.

267
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
You stay in Chang'an

268
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
and work in the Sword Department.

269
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm afraid you will be in trouble again.

270
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,640
I hope you can use Changxijian

271
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
to fulfill the task of the master.

272
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Yes.

273
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
But this time,

274
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
I'm a little reluctant.

275
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Forget it.

276
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
The master said

277
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
everything has its own fate.

278
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
If there is a fate,

279
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
maybe we will meet again.

280
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Yes.

281
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Everything has its own fate.

282
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
What's wrong, brother?

283
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Nothing.

284
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Changxijian

285
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Lady Huchu, why are you here?

286
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I've been waiting since this morning.

287
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
You are really rude.

288
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Lady Huchu, what's the matter?

289
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
My master asked me to see you off.

290
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
You don't have to be so polite.

291
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
He said he wanted to see you guys out of Chang'an.

292
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
He wanted to see you guys out of Chang'an.

293
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
My master asked me to tell you

294
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
that you can rest assured.

295
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Since the yuan pellet is on him,

296
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
he will not let him

297
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
be in trouble again.

298
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
No matter what the price is,

299
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
so the mountain is high and the road is far.

300
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Take care.

301
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Take care.

302
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
You are being rude.

303
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Brothers, wait a moment.

304
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Why are you back?

305
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Isn't this your favorite

306
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Huping from Dongshen?

307
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Yes, his family is very many.

308
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
I've been waiting for a long time in the morning.

309
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
This is the last one.

310
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
What is this?

311
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Isn't it your food?

312
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
I was going to make food.

313
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,640
But you came early in the morning.

314
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
I'm afraid you haven't had breakfast.

315
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
You should eat something on the way back.

316
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
It's late.

317
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Yes.

318
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Then,

319
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
we'll leave now.

320
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Shuangjiang,

321
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
do you have other ideas?

322
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
What ideas?

323
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
You don't want to be a hero anymore?

324
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,640
I just want to be a hero.

325
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Let's go.

326
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Go.

327
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
You evil monster,

328
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
you're here to die.

329
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
What are you doing?

330
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:35,620
I'm a

331
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Be careful.

332
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Thank you.

333
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Are you okay?

334
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
You helped me.

335
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I should have the right to repay you.

336
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
But I'm a cultivator.

337
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
I'm not a cultivator.

338
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
I'm just a cultivator.

339
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
But now,

340
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
for you,

341
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Wait a minute.

342
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
You're not going to marry me, are you?

343
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Then you don't have to repay me.

344
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
You cultivate first.

345
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
I earn money first.

346
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
We're close.

347
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
We're not in the same boat.

348
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
I didn't expect that we're just friends.

349
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
You're so nice to me.

350
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
I've thought about it.

351
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
From now on,

352
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
You're my best friend.

353
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
I can do it for you.

354
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
As long as you say it, I'll do it.

355
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
You're welcome.

356
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Shuangjiang,

357
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
what's your wish?

358
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
I want to kill the devil.

359
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
I was in a hurry and didn't prepare.

360
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
I have this tiger pen on me.

361
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Give it to you.

362
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
I want to kill the devil.

363
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
What is your brother doing?

364
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm asking for my wife Liu's safety.

365
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
What do you want me to do?

366
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
You're asking for her safety.

367
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
You're a demon hunter.

368
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
You're making a wish. Don't bother.

369
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Xiao Zhu Yu,

370
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
If you kill my brother,

371
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm going to talk to my aunt.

372
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Don't go down.

373
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
Talk here.

374
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
It's the same.

375
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
I've been thinking about it.

376
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
Did I make a mistake at the beginning?

377
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
I should have listened to you.

378
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
There are some experiences in life.

379
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
You don't have to mention it.

380
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
But I said it before.

381
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,640
I know how exciting it is to love a man and a woman.

382
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
When you're in love,

383
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
you'll chase after it.

384
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
When you're lost,

385
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
you'll run.

386
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
What's wrong with that?

387
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Xiao Meng,

388
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
I just hope

389
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
you don't regret it

390
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
when you're in love.

391
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
You said we were both demon hunters.

392
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
You saw Sister Zhen, I saw Mrs. Liu.

393
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
What is this?

394
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Double win.

395
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
I think Brother Four

396
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
didn't chase Mrs. Liu these days.

397
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
I thought Brother Four had let go.

398
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Can I be like you?

399
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
I was afraid of disturbing others.

400
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I was just watching

401
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
and protecting her.

402
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
But

403
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
thank you.

404
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
I can't see or

405
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
protect her now.

406
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
What's that beautiful box?

407
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Birthday gift from my father-in-law.

408
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
From Uncle Wu?

409
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
It looks nice.

410
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
You and

411
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Sister Zhen?

412
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
They don't look alike.

413
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
You're not that cute.

414
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Sister Zhen is not that gentle.

415
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
She's like me and Mrs. Liu.

416
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
I really miss my Mrs. Liu.

417
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Why are you here?

419
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Mr. Mei?

420
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
This...

421
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Sister Zhen?

422
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Little Snake?

423
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
Four?

424
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
It's Mrs. Liu.

425
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
So

426
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
it was Mei Si

427
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
who

428
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
took this

429
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
and changed my body with it.

430
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
This sword was sent by Wu Guo Kong.

431
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
I didn't know

432
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
that it would be like this.

433
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Sister Zhen.

435
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
I really didn't expect

436
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
that I would make a wish

437
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
to Yue.

438
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
I really went into the demon's room

439
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
and saw Mrs. Liu.

440
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
But I didn't mean that.

441
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
I didn't mean that.

442
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
Don't cry.

443
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Don't cry!

444
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
I don't think this is a matter

445
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
of making a wish to Yue.

446
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
What else did you do before you came?

447
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
I didn't do anything.

448
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
There were two wooden dolls.

449
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
I played with them for a while and then...

450
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Wooden dolls?

451
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Is there something strange about them?

452
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Can we change them again?

453
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
I'm not sure.

454
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
I have to go see that doll first.

455
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Let's go.

456
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
To your house. My house?

457
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Yes. Your unreliable father

458
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
gave us two wooden dolls.

459
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
They are in your and Zhu Yu's house. Let's go.

460
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
They are acting.

461
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Hello, Mr. Duan.

462
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Hello.

463
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Play it well. Don't let others find out.

464
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Okay.

465
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
No.

466
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
How should I play it?

467
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Be smart.

468
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Mr. Duan. Mr. Snake.

469
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Mr. Snake. This is...

470
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
He's sick.

471
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
He's sick?

472
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Mrs. Liu.

473
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Is he okay?

474
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
He's fine.

475
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Don't worry.

476
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Mrs. Liu!

477
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Mrs. Liu!

478
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Mrs. Liu!

479
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
Mrs. Liu!

480
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Mr. Snake. Can you not use my face

481
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
to make that face?

482
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Come with me.

483
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
What?

484
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
Go and change our bodies.

485
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Okay.

486
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Come.

487
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Mrs. Liu.

488
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
These two.

489
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Can we change them now?

490
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
How?

491
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
You're noisy.

492
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm sorry.

493
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
I'm sorry.

494
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
I'm sorry.

496
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
I'm sorry.

497
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
I'm sorry.

498
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
I'm sorry.

499
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
I'm sorry.

500
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
I'm sorry.

501
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
I'm sorry.

502
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
I'm sorry.

503
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm sorry.

504
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
I'm sorry.

505
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
I'm sorry.

506
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
I'm sorry.

507
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Mei Ruyu.

508
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
You're here. Are you hungry?

509
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Have some food.

510
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
We…

511
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,160
You prepared it for me on my birthday.

512
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,200
I haven't finished it yet.

513
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,800
You don't have to do this.

514
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,200
You didn't want to be discovered.

515
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,560
So you came to see me with your back.

516
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,120
I knew what you wanted to say.

517
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,080
Madam,

518
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,240
I'm sorry.

519
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,800
I let you down

520
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,760
that night.

521
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,720
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,520
It's a good time.

523
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,800
You must like drinking in the month of June.

524
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,720
When you first came to me,

525
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,480
you liked drinking here.

526
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,640
I was always struggling with you at that time.

527
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,040
I don't know how to deal with it.

528
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,680
Now the spring is coming.

529
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,600
I want to bother you.

530
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,480
Come on.

531
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,600
Let's get divorced.

532
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,680
I said

533
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,640
let's get divorced.

534
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,440
Maybe you're afraid that others will know

535
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,240
that you're a disciple of Changxi Palace.

536
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
But I'm different.

537
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,440
I'm not afraid of you.

538
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,080
Please

539
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,520
keep it a secret for me

540
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,000
for the sake of our marriage.

541
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,240
If the people of Chang'an know about the demon's existence,

542
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,880
it will cause a big mess.

543
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
I'm no longer a disciple of Changxi Palace

544
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,400
since I came back from Quzhou.

545
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,040
How can we not be blessed by the palace rules?

546
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,240
And we can't be punished by Li City.

547
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,440
You are or are not

548
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,360
irrelevant to me

549
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
from now on.

550
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,000
The misunderstanding that happened 18 years ago has been resolved.

551
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
The demon's existence and Changxi Palace have been fixed.

552
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,640
Why can't we go back to the past?

553
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,960
Because I can't forget.

554
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,040
You

555
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,120
made up your mind

556
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,280
when you opened the cocoon.

557
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,840
I can never forget

558
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
everything that happened

559
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,680
before.

560
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,000
The nations we lived together

561
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,360
were filled with different

562
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,280
and different intentions.

563
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,280
You should know that our fate is over.

564
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
You can blame me.

565
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
But don't leave me.

566
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,280
I said I wouldn't let go.

567
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Now I look at you,

568
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
I only remember that one night.

569
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I only remember

570
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
the enemy who killed your parents

571
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
will live forever.

572
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
If you don't kill me,

573
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
you will face your enemy

574
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
day and night.

575
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
You will live forever.

576
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
If one day you don't love me and want to revenge,

577
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
I will sacrifice my life

578
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
for today's love.

579
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Little boy,

580
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
we are so hard to deal with,

581
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
why don't we let go of each other?

582
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
You are so lively every day,

583
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
why are you so stubborn now?

584
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Am I stubborn

585
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
or you are so happy?

586
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
You have no future,

587
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,280
so you can have many daughters.

588
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
It's a good thing

589
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
to have a wife

590
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
who is like you.

591
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
It's a good thing.

592
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
What about you?

593
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
I am a demon,

594
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,280
I can't be a monster.

595
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
I am

596
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,280
a happy and happy woman.

597
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Say it again.

598
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I am a happy and happy woman.

599
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
You are a demon.

600
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
You are a pyramid.

601
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
What can you do now?

602
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Who will remember who after a hundred years?

603
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
We are a wrong person from the beginning.

604
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
A demon can't be a good man

605
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,280
for a long time.

606
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Wang Jun,

607
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
when you are in love,

608
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Just let me go

609
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Your eyes

610
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:37,420
Will always try to keep them

611
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,820
There'sキH where I can là

612
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,180
THE WORLD

613
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,140
You really love him.

614
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,520
später

615
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,940
See you next time

616
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,760
The promise we made is like a wind blowing

617
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,280
How can I repay you?

618
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,280
The past is like a dream

619
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,280
The most painful moment has come

620
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,280
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life

621
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,280
But I can't save you

622
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Look at the petals falling

623
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,280
What's wrong with falling in love?

624
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,280
The moonlight shines on the cold and bitter heart

625
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,280
I hug you but you are silent

626
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Look at the petals falling

627
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,280
What's wrong with falling in love?

628
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,280
The moonlight shines on the end of the memory

629
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,280
How to say goodbye?

630
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,280
You look back

631
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,280
I always want to have you

632
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Thank you for watching
