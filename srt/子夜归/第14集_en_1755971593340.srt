1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit of a

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,020
little bit of a

5
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,120
little bit of a

6
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,020
little bit of a

7
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,020
little bit of a

8
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,020
little bit of a

9
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,020
little bit of a

10
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,020
little bit of a

11
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,020
little bit of a

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,020
little bit of a

13
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,020
little bit of a

14
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,020
little bit of a

15
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,020
little bit of a

16
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,020
little bit of a

17
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,020
little bit of a

18
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,740
little bit of

19
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,740
a little bit of a

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,240
little bit of a

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
little bit ,

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,760
thisêµ°

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,940
NongNong

24
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,940
and finally

25
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
Bales

26
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,940
Three

27
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,940
The smell of the 50-layer umbrella is really...

28
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Yesterday, there were a lot of people talking nonsense.

29
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,940
Sometimes they met demons, sometimes they met immortals.

30
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
They said everything.

31
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,940
I think Chengxian is better than playing with Liu Qiang for three days and nights.

32
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Who said it's not?

33
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
Chang'an is the emperor's home.

34
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
The air is very strong.

35
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,940
Where did the monster come from?

36
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
Yes.

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,940
Huang Zongli, I really saw the 50-layer umbrella.

38
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940
So you still went to the Yulongguan.

39
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,940
I...

40
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,940
This...

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
I...

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
This...

43
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
It's not what you think.

44
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,940
Look at Chang'an's wind system, look at Liu Xiang.

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,940
The beauty is close in front of you.

46
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,940
And you...

47
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,940
But I only saw the 50-layer umbrella.

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,940
I really have different thoughts about this cousin.

49
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,940
But you said this 50-layer umbrella is not so easy to follow.

50
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,940
It's really 50-layer.

51
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Search.

52
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
Stop.

53
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Sir, the cat's method is good.

54
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,940
Now the people are saying that the owner of the Yulongguan used 50-layer.

55
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,940
And accidentally put 50-layer in the water.

56
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,940
So many people have a phobia after drinking water.

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,940
The cat's method is really good.

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,940
Now we have found this place.

59
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,940
And we have solved the rumors about the demon.

60
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,940
It seems that the storm has passed.

61
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,940
What a coincidence, Miss Liu.

62
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,940
Why is Mr. Mei here?

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,940
I heard that Liu Xiang has a rumor about the demon's phobia.

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
So I want to come here to find out the news.

65
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,940
I didn't expect it to be the ghost of the 50-layer umbrella.

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Why is Mr. Mei here?

67
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,940
I read the ghost's phobia written by Mr. White Snake.

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,940
The witch said that this book was written by Mr. White Snake to his beloved.

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,940
I think Mr. White Snake is very clever.

70
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
It's very interesting.

71
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,940
I also want to learn from him.

72
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,940
How do you plan to learn?

73
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,940
I like to draw.

74
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,940
I want to collect some strange stories in person.

75
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,940
And then make a picture book.

76
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,940
Isn't this a unique gift?

77
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,940
I think Miss Liu will like it.

78
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
Let's go.

79
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Miss Liu.

80
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,940
But sir, that white snake is really interesting.

81
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
I think it's a gift.

82
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,940
Miss Liu didn't wait for me just now.

83
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,940
I think she likes this gift.

84
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Mr. White Snake

85
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Sir, they are all my peaches this year.

86
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
I didn't pick them well.

87
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,940
You'd better go to another place to buy them.

88
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,940
There.

89
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Go to his house to buy.

90
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
It doesn't matter.

91
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,940
Sir, help me pack some.

92
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,940
Is this peach delicious?

93
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Sir, lady.

94
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
I'm really sorry.

95
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
I'm getting old.

96
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,940
I can't taste the taste of peaches.

97
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Is this peach sour?

98
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
Yes.

99
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,940
It doesn't matter.

100
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
I like sour things.

101
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,940
Why do you like sour fruits?

102
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,940
There was a peach tree in my childhood.

103
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
The fruit was small and colorful.

104
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
It's more sour than this.

105
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
But I look forward to the fruit of that tree every year.

106
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Because there is only the fruit of that tree.

107
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,940
No one will think of it.

108
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
It's all mine.

109
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,940
It's rare that you like it.

110
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

111
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
Take two more.

112
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Okay.

113
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,940
Take two more.

114
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,940
Let me tell you.

115
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,940
This peach tree is not easy to support.

116
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,940
Once it's ripe, it's bitter and bitter.

117
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,940
It's sour when it's ripe.

118
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,940
This is a good time.

119
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,940
It's too short.

120
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
Thank you, sir.

121
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
Give it to him.

122
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
The sunset is coming.

123
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Let's go and see it together.

124
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
Okay.

125
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,940
The Little Brother's letter asked me to go out to buy horses.

126
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,940
It seems to have been figured out.

127
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,940
I don't know if it's the idea of dealing with the demon's world.

128
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,940
It doesn't matter if it doesn't work.

129
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,940
As long as you are a little bit away from that fox,

130
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
you are still our good disciple.

131
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
Master Shang Jiang.

132
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
Lady Hu Zhu.

133
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Master Shang Jiang.

134
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Why are you here?

135
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,940
I'm here to eat.

136
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm here to eat.

137
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
I'm here to eat.

138
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,940
I'm here to eat.

139
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
I'm here to eat.

140
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,940
I'm here to eat.

141
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,940
Sir, do you want to drink or listen to the music?

142
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,940
I want to make a table of wine.

143
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
Lady Hu Zhu.

144
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,940
Didn't you tell me?

145
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
Just this.

146
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
I'm going to be a master here.

147
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,940
No, you are still...

148
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Sir, this way, please.

149
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Let's go.

150
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,940
Lady Hu Zhu didn't lie to me.

151
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Eat.

152
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
What's wrong?

153
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Is the food in our Ruyi Restaurant not good?

154
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Not really.

155
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,940
It's not good.

156
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
It's not good.

157
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,940
Actually, I'm not only here to eat.

158
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,940
I'm going to Nanjie later.

159
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
It's so late.

160
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Why are you going to Nanjie?

161
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,940
Brother Shi asked me to buy a horse.

162
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
Buy a horse?

163
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
You've been out of town recently.

164
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
Don't ride a donkey?

165
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
I need to go to the road.

166
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
Road?

167
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,940
If it's a good horse,

168
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,940
I can go back to Quzhou faster.

169
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
You're going back to Quzhou?

170
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
Yes.

171
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,940
So I came here to say goodbye to you.

172
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
It's fate that we meet.

173
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,940
We can only meet again when we part.

174
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
Lady Hu Zhu, take care.

175
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
Master Shuang Jiang.

176
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Lady Hu Zhu, we're best friends.

177
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,940
I'm glad you care about me.

178
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,940
But I have to fulfill the mission of Shuang Jiang.

179
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,940
I want to tell you that Nanjie doesn't sell horses.

180
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,940
Buy a horse?

181
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
I have to go to the north street.

182
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Thank you, Lady Hu Zhu.

183
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,940
With her little money,

184
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
I'm afraid I can't even buy a bottle of wine on the table.

185
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
Yes.

186
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,940
Since you are so rich,

187
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
why don't you pay for the spices first?

188
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Yes.

189
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
Is it enough?

190
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,940
Yes.

191
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
But clearly, Lady Hu Zhu

192
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
doesn't care about Shuang Jiang.

193
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
You're so mean.

194
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
Mr. Mei's cousin

195
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,940
is selling horses for food.

196
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
You're a hundred-year-old demon.

197
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,940
Why do you compare with him?

198
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,940
Shopkeeper, the spices have been distributed.

199
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Yes.

200
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Shopkeeper,

201
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,940
that's the best Suhe incense.

202
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,940
When will we lower the price?

203
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
You're so rude.

204
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
It's not enough.

205
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,940
The big deal is done quickly.

206
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
What's wrong, Master Shuang Jiang?

207
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,940
Master, I'm the one who has to pay for it.

208
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,940
You bought a horse to get a ride?

209
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Yes.

210
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
My second wife's carriage is too attractive.

211
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
Mr. Mei came by himself.

212
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,940
Isn't that very sweet?

213
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
What's on your mind?

214
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Didn't you say you wanted to go?

215
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
Why are you looking at the flowers?

216
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,940
I spend my days

217
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,940
getting flowers for my wife's fulfilling vicious Manchus.

218
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,940
These are the texts

219
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,940
from Your Highness.

220
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,940
One of these was from Mencius

221
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
and sent by women to the other two.

222
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
Plot several.

223
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,780
The answer

224
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
I was blinded.

225
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,780
If that donkey comes, it's the same as last time.

226
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,780
Last time, last time, the western Zhaozhixing,

227
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,780
I had dreamed of the fifth wife.

228
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
What did you dream of?

229
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,780
The act of being a couple.

230
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:15,780
I said that since then, you've become strange.

231
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,780
It's okay. I'll just dream back.

232
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
Fox spirit.

233
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,780
What did you say?

234
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,780
That fifth wife is really a fox spirit.

235
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
Last time, it was really a fox spirit.

236
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,780
You can scold people.

237
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,780
But next time you scold people, can you change the word?

238
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
Don't always be a fox spirit.

239
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,780
Is there a more appropriate word than fox spirit?

240
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,780
What are you doing?

241
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,780
I'll see you live. Get out.

242
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
This...

243
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Unfortunately, the flower season is coming.

244
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
If there is any magic,

245
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
it would be nice to let the flowers bloom all year round.

246
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,780
The four seasons change, flowers bloom and there are seven seasons.

247
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Even if there is magic, it shouldn't go against the heaven.

248
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
What are you laughing at?

249
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
I remembered the cat in Duke Guo's mansion.

250
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
Which one?

251
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,780
A pear-shaped cat.

252
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
You're not afraid of it?

253
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,780
It's very kind.

254
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,780
But it's a little far from me.

255
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
I'm afraid of it.

256
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
I'm afraid of it.

257
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
I'm afraid of it.

258
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
I'm afraid of it.

259
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,780
I'm afraid of it.

260
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
I'm afraid of it.

261
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
I'm afraid of it.

262
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
I'm afraid of it.

263
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,780
It's not a lotus fan.

264
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
It's a lotus-scented jade.

265
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
It must like you to look good.

266
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
I like it too.

267
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
Did you go down the mountain for too long?

268
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
People in Changxi Palace are not allowed to fall in love.

269
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,780
This is not a rule.

270
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
Young Master,

271
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,780
sometimes you don't have to follow the rules.

272
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,780
I'm not a person who doesn't follow the rules.

273
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
I'm a person who doesn't follow the rules.

274
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,780
Sometimes you don't have to follow the rules.

275
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,780
I should be almost recovered.

276
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,780
I should leave the Mansion of the Five Kingdoms.

277
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
You're leaving?

278
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Yes.

279
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
What about me?

280
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
What?

281
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,780
You have nothing else to tell me?

282
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,780
I'm leaving.

283
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
You can leave if you want.

284
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,780
I can force you to stay.

285
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,780
You're so beautiful.

286
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,780
You want me to keep a distance.

287
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
I have to get to know you.

288
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
Let's go.

289
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Brother,

290
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,780
they are driving your car, right?

291
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,780
It's late.

292
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,780
Let's go back to the city.

293
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,780
We don't have a car or a horse.

294
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,780
We have feet.

295
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
Take the luggage.

296
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,780
Okay.

297
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,780
The Mansion of the Five Kingdoms

298
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
Brother.

299
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
Why haven't you sent it in yet?

300
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,780
Master,

301
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,780
I don't know why,

302
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
but the door is locked.

303
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
Locked?

304
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
I knew it.

305
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
You're a traitor.

306
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,780
Master.

307
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
Move.

308
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
Get up.

309
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Get up.

310
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,780
Since you're doing something serious,

311
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
why did you

312
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
lock the door

313
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
and open the door?

314
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,780
Thank you.

315
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
Father,

316
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,780
I've been influenced by you for years.

317
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
So I decided to change my mind

318
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,780
and study hard.

319
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,780
But I'm afraid you'll worry about my health.

320
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,780
You're so quiet.

321
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
Who are you fooling?

322
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,780
You used to be addicted to painting.

323
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
But now,

324
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,780
you've learned to play with clay.

325
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,780
Father,

326
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
it's not clay.

327
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,780
It's not clay.

328
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,780
Is it the transfer of culture and culture?

329
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,780
Yes.

330
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,780
It's the transfer of culture and culture.

331
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,780
Father,

332
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,780
I've asked many people to help me.

333
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,780
I finally got it.

334
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
With him,

335
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,780
I'll be able to succeed.

336
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,780
He can write.

337
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Look.

338
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,780
He can write

339
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,780
when he transfers to the art field.

340
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,780
He can write.

341
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
He can really write.

342
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
He...

343
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,780
He...

344
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,780
He really can write.

345
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,780
Look.

346
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,780
It's clearly a word.

347
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,780
Father,

348
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,780
how do you know it's a word?

349
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Look.

350
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I'm willing to give you

351
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
a thousand gold coins

352
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
and six gems

353
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
to rebuild your body.

354
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
Please bless my son

355
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,780
and make him a great man.

356
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
Please bless my son

357
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
and make him a great man.

358
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,780
If you really care about him,

359
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,780
why did you say that?

360
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,780
Why did you keep him for a few days?

361
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
It's not a big deal.

362
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,780
It's not clear.

363
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
How much gold?

364
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,780
He didn't want to take another step.

365
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,780
It means

366
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,780
I'm not that important to him.

367
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
It's rare.

368
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Our second wife

369
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,780
is trapped in love.

370
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,780
I have to be sad for a few days.

371
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,780
Okay.

372
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
Then I'll find some little tricks

373
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
to accompany you to sing.

374
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
I'll make you happy for a few days.

375
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
Of course you'll forget about that rich man.

376
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
Okay.

377
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,780
Jin Yan, take a rest here.

378
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
Eat first.

379
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,780
Enjoy your meal.

380
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,780
Hello.

381
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
This way, please.

382
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,780
Are you going to eat or stay at home?

383
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,780
Two rooms, two bowls of noodles.

384
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
And

385
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,780
the fried chicken with vinegar and scallion,

386
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
fried meat with chives,

387
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
green onion and celery,

388
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,780
lamb with water and...

389
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,780
pancake.

390
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
Can you finish it?

391
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
Why do you care so much?

392
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,780
I can afford it.

393
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,780
Please have a seat.

394
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
Jin Yan,

395
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,780
is he sick?

396
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,780
It's not autumn yet.

397
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
He's wearing so much.

398
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,780
He's sweating.

399
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Don't talk about others.

400
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,780
This is the room card.

401
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Please keep it.

402
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,780
Humph!

403
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Since you want to eat so much,

404
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,780
you should move too.

405
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,780
Put these luggage

406
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
in the room.

407
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,780
Okay.

408
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
bangs

409
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Merryy ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÑÑ.

410
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,780
Is that a holiday or host?

411
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,860
Can't you see?

412
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,260
This is...

413
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,540
We're in trouble!

414
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,740
In trouble!

415
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,220
Alarm...

416
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,800
puts something in stuff.

417
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,240
Stop!

418
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:44,780
You said you wouldn't come over, so you didn't come over.

419
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,780
You think you're a big star?

420
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
You're still laughing?

421
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
Give me money!

422
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,780
Where's the money?

423
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
No.

424
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
What?

425
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
You don't want to give it?

426
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,780
I don't have half a pound of money.

427
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:09,780
I think you're not wearing any money when you go out.

428
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,780
It's not possible, is it?

429
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,780
I'm wearing it, but the bag is in the room.

430
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,780
Why don't I take you to get it?

431
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
No need!

432
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,780
You think I'm the first day out to mess around?

433
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,780
I've seen many people like you who are delicate and smart.

434
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,780
You want to trick me?

435
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,780
Shen!

436
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,780
You're going too far!

437
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,780
It's four o'clock.

438
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,780
Go to the second floor.

439
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Okay.

440
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,780
Where are you?

441
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,780
Where are you?

442
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,780
Answer me!

443
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,780
It's said that the jade and the lotus are hard to fill.

444
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,780
It seems that the ancients can't afford me.

445
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,780
Grandma, will your room eat people?

446
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,780
Why is there no one up there?

447
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,780
Why don't you go and see for yourself?

448
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
Me?

449
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,780
Otherwise, they're all up there.

450
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,780
You're going to be in the wrong.

451
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,780
Why isn't there another one?

452
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,780
This one is the smartest.

453
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,780
You're smart.

454
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Waiter.

455
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
Report.

456
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Hurry up!

457
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Let's go!

458
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Let's go!

459
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,780
What are you waiting for?

460
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
Mister.

461
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
I'm Pei Ji Ya from Kunzhou.

462
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
Thank you for your help.

463
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,780
I didn't know you were so happy.

464
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,780
I didn't notice.

465
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,780
This is the two generals of the She Di.

466
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
You don't have to thank me.

467
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,780
I did that for my own good.

468
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,780
I should be grateful.

469
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
I don't know if you've had dinner.

470
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,780
I'll sit down and chat with you.

471
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,780
Mister.

472
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
How about...

473
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,780
Thank you.

474
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Please.

475
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
Thank you.

476
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,780
You're a friendly man.

477
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,780
I can't help you.

478
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,780
Why are you wearing so much?

479
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
I...

480
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
I'm sick.

481
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
My mother gave birth to me.

482
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,780
I've been weak since I was little.

483
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
I can't see the light.

484
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,780
I have to wear two more clothes every day.

485
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Poor man.

486
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,780
The next question is...

487
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,780
It's over.

488
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,780
I'm lucky to see you today.

489
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,780
You're brave and brave.

490
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
I'm very grateful.

491
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,780
I don't drink.

492
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,780
I don't like drinking when I was a kid.

493
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
I'll drink with you.

494
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,780
I'll drink with tea.

495
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
You're a handsome man.

496
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
Are you from Chang'an?

497
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
I'm from Chang'an.

498
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
Good.

499
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,780
I grew up in Chang'an.

500
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,780
I left because of family affairs.

501
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
I live in Kunzhou.

502
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,780
I haven't been back for many years.

503
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,780
I heard that Chang'an is very quiet now.

504
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,780
There are rules in every district.

505
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,780
What do you mean by every district?

506
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Pei Meng is right.

507
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,780
There are rules in every district.

508
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
Don't blame me.

509
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
I'm good at making incense.

510
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,780
I'm very sensitive to smell.

511
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,780
Speaking of which,

512
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,780
you have a lot of smell.

513
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Interesting.

514
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
What smell?

515
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,780
You have a soft smell.

516
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,780
Ma'an is your new sister.

517
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
How do you know?

518
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,780
You have some medicine.

519
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
You love the medicine.

520
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
You know it.

521
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,780
Have you been hurt recently?

522
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
I can smell it.

523
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
And some...

524
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,780
The smell of women.

525
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
This...

526
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,780
This is a joke.

527
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,780
I see that you are very talented.

528
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,780
I'm sure there are many women who are interested in you.

529
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
I'm very happy.

530
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
I'm sorry.

531
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,780
Speaking of women,

532
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
it reminds me of my childhood.

533
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,780
I was not in good health when I was a kid.

534
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,780
When outsiders saw me,

535
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
they would avoid me.

536
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,780
Only he treated me differently.

537
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,780
I fell in love with him.

538
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,780
But it's a pity that

539
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,780
things are not as good as people wish.

540
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,780
I went to Kunzhou far away from home.

541
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,780
We were separated by two countries.

542
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,780
I suffered a lot

543
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,780
for my old friend.

544
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,780
But I can't stand it.

545
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,780
I remember that

546
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,780
the only time I cried was because of him.

547
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,780
I was not in good health.

548
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,780
I liked him a lot.

549
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
But I didn't want to marry him.

550
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Now,

551
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
I'm in good health.

552
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
I'll go to Chang'an immediately.

553
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,780
I won't let him down this time.

554
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
You went to Chang'an with your brother.

555
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
You are so affectionate.

556
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
It's really...

557
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,780
touching.

558
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
What about you?

559
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
Do you have someone you like?

560
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
Yes.

561
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,780
Can you tell me your story?

562
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
Life is full of love.

563
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,780
But we don't have that kind of fate.

564
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
I see.

565
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,780
You have a first impression.

566
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,780
But I'm just a commoner.

567
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,780
I just want to be with him

568
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
and be with him forever.

569
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
Mr. Mei,

570
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,780
can I have a word with you?

571
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,780
We can go to the farthest place.

572
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
If we treat each other sincerely,

573
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
we will never be alone.

574
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,780
Thank you.

575
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,780
This is the best day I've had recently.

576
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,780
Mr. Pei is really nice.

577
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,780
What do you think, brother?

578
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
It's strange.

579
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
Strange?

580
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
What's strange?

581
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
I think Mr. Pei

582
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,780
is a little more affectionate than us.

583
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,780
Although Mr. Pei looks a little weak,

584
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,780
he is still very warm-hearted.

585
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,780
I guess he just likes to talk.

586
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,780
Maybe.

587
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
What's wrong?

588
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
Nothing.

589
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,780
I think it's just too much.

590
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,780
It'll be fine after a break.

591
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,780
Give me your hand.

592
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
How is it?

593
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Nothing serious, right?

594
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,780
It looks like he has a stomach upset.

595
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
Okay.

596
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,780
But why does he still have a strong poison?

597
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,780
Let's go find the doctor.

598
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
What's wrong with you?

599
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
Take care.

600
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,780
Mr. Pei, lock.

601
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Mei is very cautious.

602
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
What?

603
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
Are you sick?

604
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
Aunt Mei told me

605
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
to go to the water table.

606
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,780
Then why on earth is he alone in the water allowances?

607
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
Are you overreacting?

608
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
How is it going?

609
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,220
I spent some money.

610
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,420
The bandits will be released in a few days.

611
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,460
This game is so easy.

612
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,020
Don't worry.

613
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,860
Mister,

614
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,020
there's only a big bag in this room.

615
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,540
Do you want to open it?

616
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,460
No.

617
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,740
I'm not interested in it.

618
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,980
Mister, I don't understand.

619
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,260
You poisoned the jade jade.

620
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,180
Why did you only poison the twin?

621
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,060
I used the incense poison this time.

622
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,300
It needs to be paired with wine and food.

623
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,580
But the jade jade

624
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,980
is useless when it's not paired with wine and food.

625
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,460
I see.

626
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,460
I can't let you get poisoned.

627
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,780
I think you should be more cruel

628
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,060
and kill him.

629
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,420
I got the news

630
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,820
that she has nothing to do with my cousin.

631
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,060
Why would a defeated general kill her?

632
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,340
Besides,

633
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,020
I'm so kind.

634
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,660
You're right.

635
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,260
Never mind.

636
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,660
At least I met someone

637
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,260
who knows what kind of man

638
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,300
my cousin likes.

639
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,660
Let's go to Chang'an.

640
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,500
Over there.

641
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,660
The promise I made to you is like a wind blowing in the wind

642
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:04,660
How can I repay you?

643
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,660
The past is like a dream

644
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:15,660
The pain is only a moment

645
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,660
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life

646
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,660
But I can't save you

647
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,660
The petals are falling

648
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,660
What's wrong with falling in love?

649
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:44,660
The moonlight is cool

650
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,660
I hug you but you are silent

651
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,660
But the petals are falling

652
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,660
What's wrong with falling in love?

653
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,660
The eyes are shining at the end of the memory

654
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:16,660
How to see you look back?

655
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:22,660
I always want to have you

656
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,660
Thank you for watching!
