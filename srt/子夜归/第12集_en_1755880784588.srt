1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Night Returns

2
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We have been together for a long time

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I have been thinking about how to end it

4
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
These days I finally think it through

5
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I will follow what Elder Hui said

6
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The winner is the king

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The loser is the loser

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How about it?

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's great

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then do you dare to open the life and death game?

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
To solve the life and death game?

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If I win

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't be the master of the Hui family

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is the life and death game?

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The monster and the elder open the life and death game

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's completely unimportant

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The Night Returns

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The game is about life and death

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The game is about life and death

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The game is about life and death

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The monster is forbidden

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What? The cat dare not to answer?

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's really heart-wrenching

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's really heart-wrenching

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think everyone has a good chance

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Will the cat answer?

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No matter which one is dead, it's not a small thing

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't talk nonsense

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will answer

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I will answer

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will answer

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Snake

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What is the life and death game?

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Snake

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are still young

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You don't often play the monster

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know if it's normal

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The life and death game is set by the second master

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In order to prevent the monster from

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The last guarantee of the monster

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The monster and the elder are superhuman

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If there are demons who are not obedient

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You can play the life and death game

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You can play the life and death game

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Both sides

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Both sides don't talk about identity

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No matter the background

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Just kill the battle

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The life and death game is no longer

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There is no possibility

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But there are also hundreds of years of life and death

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The monster and the elder are different

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's even more so

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is really

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a bit too hasty

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So I came to beg the snake

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I came to beg the snake

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is there a chance to turn around?

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have no choice

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Snake

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If the little cat is really dead

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I will help him

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Kill that old monkey

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The snake

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The snake

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The snake

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The snake

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The snake

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The snake

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The snake

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The snake

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What are you doing?

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What are you doing?

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Want fish

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Have a good appetite

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hu Zhu sent it

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You are so kind.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm a criminal.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I should be kind.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What?

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Nothing.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You have something on your mind?

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Something on my mind?

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm thinking if I have a chance,

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can build a house for you.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And then let me sing the song of Changmen?

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know such a story?

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I just finished reading it.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The martial arts of the five states are rich in books.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The books are rich.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You have learned a lot.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's okay if you have learned a lot.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You even compare me to a couple.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Who told you to talk nonsense and cheat people?

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is not what you usually say.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I mean,

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
if you don't understand, you can't say it.

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can't keep your promise.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't do it.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You never open your mouth to talk.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Brother Jiao,

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
have you forgotten that

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
people in Changxi Palace don't love each other?

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I haven't forgotten.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then you...

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There will be no result.

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I didn't plan to marry him.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I love him,

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
but I'm afraid of him.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I just want to have a good marriage.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I should go.

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You don't ask me.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why?

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ask me where I'm going.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where are you going?

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have an appointment with another man.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Then come back early.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I will come back.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm back.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Did you brainwash your lover's memory?

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I will prepare the medicine.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm going friendlies,

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I will live my life.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Open your mouth.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Wait!

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why is it the moon night?

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you reading this thing so fast?

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I like reading books.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But aren't you mortals most afraid of these things?

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Not entirely.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
My wife Liu is most interested in this strange art.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So she likes you, so you have to like it.

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What is this?

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You don't understand.

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
To like someone, you have to understand everything about them.

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What they think, what they like.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Little Nix, tell me.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Can I call you big brother?

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Tell me, tell me.

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let me see if this is right.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You must be a snake demon.

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You don't know these things.

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You know a lot.

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Isn't it the moon night?

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The moon doesn't appear on the day of the moon.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The evil spirit is the most evil.

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So the fight between the demons is often in the moon.

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The evil spirit is always in the moon.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So that's it.

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But you are all demons.

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why do you have to kill each other?

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The demons are the same as humans.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They have the desire to have a bad thought.

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you know that our snake demon has another name?

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Long-legged.

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What is long-legged?

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's a dragon.

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The snake demon can be turned into a dragon after 100 years of cultivation.

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a dragon.

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's a dragon.

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's a dragon.

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You are over 100 years old.

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are over 100 years old.

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You are so old.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You are so old.

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You are so old.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I mean, why haven't you turned into a dragon?

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Because before the snake demon turned into a dragon,

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
it was the weakest.

172
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
On the day of the moon, the demons were walking at night.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The white ghosts were all over the place.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's just a rule of the demon world for thousands of years.

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The weak are strong and the winner is the king.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's the night of the moon again.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know who will be the strong tonight.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Who will be the king?

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Who will be the king?

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's been a thousand years since the old man of the snake demon.

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's been a thousand years since the old man of the snake demon.

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The cat palace has been in practice for more than ten years.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Isn't this a close match?

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can't say that.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The cat palace is a doll.

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But it has the power of the cat palace.

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If it can be integrated into the temple,

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the winner is not known.

189
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In your opinion,

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
our cat palace has a face.

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The cat palace is a doll.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But it has the power of the cat palace.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's a doll.

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But it has the power of the cat palace.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's a doll.

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But it has the power of the cat palace.

197
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's a doll.

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But it has the power of the cat palace.

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's a doll.

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000

But it has the power of the cat palace.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a doll.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But it has the power of the cat palace.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you like to make people another cat palace,

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
we can take the water brothers to steam the cat's blood.

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So does the cat palace.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000

This old monkey is crazy. How dare he break the enchantment?

257
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,180
He's been using the power of the nine-spirit.

258
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,680
Even if he wins, he's still going to use the enchantment.

259
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
Is he stupid?

260
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,680
If he really wins the demon, who can control him?

261
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
This is a trap.

262
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
I'm going to attack the demon.

263
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
This is a trap.

264
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm going to attack the demon.

265
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
I'm going to attack the demon.

266
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
I'm going to attack the demon.

267
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,580
He's broken the enchantment.

268
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
He's broken the enchantment.

269
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,580
What about the enchantment?

270
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,580
What about the enchantment?

271
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,580
Just to deal with me.

272
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
I don't blame the demon for losing his life.

273
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,580
I don't blame the demon for losing his life.

274
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,580
I don't blame the demon for losing his life.

275
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
What's the matter with losing your life?

276
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
As long as I can get rid of you,

277
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,580
it's worth it.

278
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,580
The king of Xiangzhou.

279
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
The king of Xiangzhou.

280
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
There shouldn't be a thing like you.

281
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
There shouldn't be a thing like you.

282
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480

He's scared.

289
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
He's scared.

290
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
He's scared.

291
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
He's scared.

292
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
He's scared.

293
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
He's scared.

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
He's scared.

He's scared.

296
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
He's scared.

297
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,380
The King of Xiangzhou

298
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
The King of Xiangzhou

299
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,380
Oh, no!

300
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,380
The King of Xiangzhou is in trouble!

301
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,380
Is the King of Xiangzhou all right?

302
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,380
You're over so soon?

303
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,380
He's scared.

304
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,380
It's useless.

305
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,380
Win or lose,

306
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
our lives are not in the game.

307
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,360

You worship the strong

358
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Just because you know yourself as a strong person

359
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
But have you ever thought

360
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,960
One day you will die in the hands of a stronger person

361
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,960

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
You are right

365
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
The strong are the rulers

366
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,960
But the rulers are not to kill and take

367
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
The power is in the hands

368
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,960
But to protect the two sides of the human and demon

369
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Protect the weakest life

370
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Not to be compared to the stronger

371
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Master Mao Gong, do you have anything to say?

372
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Elder Hui broke the boundary between the human and the demon

373
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
Of course he deserves to die

374
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,960
But he is old

375
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Yes

376
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Since the establishment of the demon

377
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
He has been following the second master

378
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
He has been loyal for so many years

379
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
He has no credit and no hard work

380
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Master Mao Gong

381
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,960
In the eyes of Elder Hui's years of service

382
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Just because he was confused

383
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Please spare his life

384
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Me?

385
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
I can do everything

386
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Then, please spare his life

387
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,960
It's easy to spare his life

388
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
After a thousand years of cultivation

389
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Only the flesh is left

390
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Return to the human world

391
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Since you like to distinguish between the strong and the weak

392
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,960
I will punish you as a weak tree

393
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Experience a weak and painful

394
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Let's go, Elder He

395
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Elders, is this meaningful?

396
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Please obey Master Mao Gong's order

397
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
How is it?

398
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Can you still hold on?

399
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
I

400
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Fortunately you are not dead

401
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
You can't bear to leave me?

402
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
That's not it

403
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
I am not dead

404
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
I am not dead

405
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
I am not dead

406
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
I am not dead

407
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
I am not dead

408
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
That's not it

409
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
It's regret

410
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
I was impulsive that day

411
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Said if you were dead, I would help you revenge

412
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,960
After all, it's the old demon of Grandpa's generation

413
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Still very good

414
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
You are a little bit of a little cat

415
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
It's just that the demon world is a little bit of a bad thing

416
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
This battle

417
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
There are a lot of things to do

418
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
The barrier that will break the elder

419
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Can be on fire

420
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
I have asked Zhu Ying to check

421
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,960
See what the barrier is

422
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Xiao Zhen

423
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Your body is unstable

424
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
There is a mirror battle

425
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Or you should go to my place to rest

426
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
I should go home

427
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
You are like this, what do you remember to do?

428
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I have to talk

429
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
I have to talk

430
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Why hasn't the husband of the Mei family rested yet?

431
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
I am waiting for the fifth wife

432
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
It's almost midnight

433
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
She hasn't returned yet

434
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
I am a little worried

435
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
You don't have to worry

436
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
My second wife likes to play

437
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Always return late

438
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Sometimes it will be in the Ruyi Tower

439
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Come back in the morning

440
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
But she said before leaving the house

441
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Will come back today

442
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
I will wait a little longer

443
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
I don't know why

444
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
I always have a bad feeling

445
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
You are worried too much

446
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
In Chang'an city

447
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
No one can bully my second wife

448
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Sister Ming Zhuang

449
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
The Mei family is too worried

450
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
What is the worry?

451
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Look at the Mei

452
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
Is it like the forgotten stone in the script?

453
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
No rules

454
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Anyway, she is a guest

455
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
I think

456
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,960
This guest is going to be the master

457
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
This voice is like a person

458
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Will it be rude?

459
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
It's late at night

460
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
What are you doing?

461
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Waiting for you to go home

462
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
Fortunately I am back

463
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
You are

464
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Fighting

465
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Very tired

466
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Why are you fighting again?

467
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Because I don't like to be entangled with people

468
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
What you say

469
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Always make people listen and not believe

470
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Really

471
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
That older one

472
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I still like

473
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Younger brother

474
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Are your legs better?

475
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Recovered very quickly

476
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Then send me back

477
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Should be fine

478
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,960
If

479
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Never made up

480
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,960
How can this ease

481
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
Will be more gentle

482
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Like a mermaid

483
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Protecting her toes

484
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,960
That year flowers bloom

485
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,960
When the water is long

486
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
My wife

487
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
My wife

488
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Should I get up first?

489
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,960
As long as people see

490
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,960
Not good

491
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
I'm going to the bathroom

492
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
I'm going to the bathroom

493
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
I'm going to the bathroom

494
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I'm going to the bathroom

495
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
I'm going to the bathroom

496
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm going to the bathroom

497
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
I'm going to the bathroom

498
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
I'm going to the bathroom

499
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
I'm going to the bathroom

500
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
I'm going to the bathroom

501
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
I'm going to the bathroom

502
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm going to the bathroom

503
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
I'm going to the bathroom

504
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
I'm going to the bathroom

505
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
I'm going to the bathroom

506
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
I'm going to the bathroom

507
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
I'm going to the bathroom

508
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
I'm going to the bathroom

509
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm going to the bathroom

510
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
I'm going to the bathroom

511
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
I'm going to the bathroom

512
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
I'm going to the bathroom

513
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
I'm going to the bathroom

514
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
I'm going to the bathroom

515
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
I'm going to the bathroom

516
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
I'm going to the bathroom

517
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
I'm going to the bathroom

518
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
I'm going to the bathroom

519
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,300
Ah

520
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
That's...

521
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,960
What are you doing?

522
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
What are you doing?

523
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
I

524
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
That's...

525
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Ah

526
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,460
My

527
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,080
Father!

528
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,480
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

529
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,100
I'm here to see you.

530
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,360
Don't worry, Brother Shi.

531
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,820
I know you're here in the middle of the night,

532
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,960
so I came in here.

533
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,860
I didn't knock on the door,

534
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,540
I was afraid that others might be rude to me.

535
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,680
What do you want from me?

536
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,680
It's nothing.

537
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,560
I just remembered one thing.

538
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,920
Go ahead.

539
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,240
That morning on the Lantern Festival,

540
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,360
I happened to see a black shadow

541
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,240
and he said

542
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,440
he saw a monster-like shadow.

543
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,000
I was so shocked.

544
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,960
Do you think it's suspicious

545
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,560
now that you think about it?

546
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,800
I'd rather believe it is.

547
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,520
Anyway, I didn't think it was suspicious at that time.

548
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,880
Do you think

549
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,360
the sky is suspicious tonight?

550
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
Monster-like?

551
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,920
Is it?

552
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,320
No.

553
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,920
All right.

554
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,320
You go back first.

555
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,400
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

556
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,480
Okay.

557
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,080
Finally, I have something to do.

558
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,040
The door is there.

559
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,360
Don't break into the house or the wall.

560
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,440
I know.

561
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,320
Miss Liu,

562
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,960
I need to talk to you.

563
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,280
You're alive!

564
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,120
Miss Liu.

565
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,480
Miss Liu.

566
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,120
It's so late.

567
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,720
Are you just back or going out?

568
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
What are you doing here?

569
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,600
Tonight is the night of the moon.

570
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,800
The evil sister's fierce spirit is the most powerful.

571
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,600
I'm afraid you're not safe.

572
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,720
I'm here to guard you.

573
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,960
You've been here for half a night.

574
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,960
That's not it.

575
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,640
I just fell asleep.

576
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm fine.

577
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,800
You don't have to stay here.

578
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,000
If someone sees you,

579
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
they'll talk about you.

580
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,640
If you're fine,

581
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,200
I'll leave now.

582
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,160
By the way,

583
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm sorry.

584
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,560
What are you going to say?

585
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,840
Tonight is the night of the moon.

586
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,120
The evil sister's fierce spirit is the most powerful.

587
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,560
How did you know?

588
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,800
It's mentioned in the demon's trick

589
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,200
written by the white snake.

590
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,520
If you're interested,

591
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,320
I'll show you later.

592
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,240
No need.

593
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,040
I'm just asking.

594
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,160
Come on.

595
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,920
I really left?

596
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Is that what I wrote?

597
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,540
I'm going to make a

598
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,680
little bit of a

599
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,600
little bit of a

600
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,280
little bit of a

601
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,680
little bit of a

602
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,940
little bit of a

603
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,480
little bit of a

604
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
little bit of a

605
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
little bit of a

606
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
little bit of a

607
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
little bit of a

608
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,620
little bit of a

609
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,620
little bit of a

610
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,620
little bit of a

611
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,620
little bit of a

612
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,620
little bit of a

613
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,620
little bit of a

614
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,620
little bit of a

615
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,620
little bit of a

616
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,620
little bit of a

617
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,620
little bit of a

618
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,620
the

619
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,620
my

620
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,620
my

621
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,620
my

622
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,880
Sorry, It is the last journalist.

623
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,080
ping

624
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,300
be asshole

625
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,860
Strong Yuan Jiang

626
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,300
Buhua Valley

627
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,060
Wonderful

628
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,180
Chinese

629
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,220
Must be

630
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,620
What's going on? Why is she exactly like me?

631
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:20,620
Lord Angel, if you can let me go, I'll tell you the secret of the girl you're with.

632
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,620
If it's a secret, then you should keep it.

633
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,620
I'll save your life.

634
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,620
The land of Chang'an is like the sky.

635
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,620
The water is hard to wash away.

636
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,620
The Yaman Xunwen only has a few people.

637
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,620
It's like a ghost.

638
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,620
There's a legend about a demon in Chang'an.

639
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,620
It's been a long time.

640
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,620
The demon is weird.

641
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
It's weird.

642
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,620
It's not dead.

643
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,620
It needs to be eliminated.

644
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,620
Kill it.

645
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
Take middle class.

646
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,620
Go to her.

647
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,620
Buttermoon?

648
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,620
You ask the best majesty for this.

649
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,620
The other guys are just your irmahs.

650
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,620
I want to be type.

651
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:29,460
But the pain is only a moment

652
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,180
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life

653
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,820
But I can't

654
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,500
Look at the petals falling

655
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:52,380
What's wrong with falling in love?

656
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,900
The moonlight shines on the breath

657
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,660
I hug you, but you are silent

658
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,340
But the petals are falling

659
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:15,100
What's wrong with falling in love?

660
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,540
The eyes shine on the end of memories

661
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,300
How to say goodbye?

662
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,980
The look in your eyes

663
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:37,860
It's a long story

664
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

665
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

666
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

667
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

668
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
