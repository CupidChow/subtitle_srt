00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000

little bit of a

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
little bit of a

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
little bit of a

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
little bit of a

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
little bit of a

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
little bit of a

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
little bit of a

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
little bit issues

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
little bit tension

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
little bit sex

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
level

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Generally.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why?

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't understand why these books are full of love and affection.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But these books are all about reunion.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A man and a woman's marriage is about reunion.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If these stories are for marriage,

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and women have nothing else to do,

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and their marriage is over,

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
it will at least make their life a little bit more miserable.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If someone knew you said that,

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
they would definitely say you are a man of great self-respect.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I was just talking to you.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you feel better?

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Does it still hurt?

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's not burning anymore.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hurry up!

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Enough.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What are you smiling at?

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Nothing.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I suddenly feel really good.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Then eat more.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It seems that my second wife is very busy.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sit down and eat together.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm afraid that you don't feel that way.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I suddenly remember that I have to go to Ruyi House.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mingzhuang, watch Mr. Mei take his medicine.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't worry, second wife.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
By the way, when Mr. Mei leaves,

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
be careful of the second floor at the door.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have been hurt when I practiced with Xiao Zhen.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Although I have to repair it, I still can't do much.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I often go back to accompany people.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have something to do, too.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What's going on?

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There are many holes in my body.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Since last night,

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
there have been many accidents.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There are also small demons.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The snake palace is too busy to come.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They need our help.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mr. Mei, this is the medicine and candy that the mistress prepared for you.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll take this candy.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, but don't eat too much.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:40,840
Brother Xiao, Chang'an is always full of

111
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,680
I didn't notice anything.

112
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Didn't Brother 4 say that he saw it?

113
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Is it really here?

114
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Mr. Mei.

115
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Huang Zoling.

116
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Where is Mr. Mei going?

117
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
My cousin is going to Chang'an.

118
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Take him for a walk.

119
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
A walk in Liu Xiang?

120
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
It's all Chang'an's style.

121
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
I understand.

122
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,840
But I still advise you two to go somewhere else.

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Why?

124
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Recently, Chang'an left a kind of poison in the wind and air.

125
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,840
It's harmful to people, but it's not worth it.

126
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,840
I was going to seal this Liu Xiang and investigate it carefully.

127
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,840
But I didn't expect that there were so many high-ranking officials and officials.

128
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
It's really hard to stop.

129
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Since that's the case, we won't bother you.

130
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Goodbye.

131
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Mr. Mei, rest early.

132
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
I'll go.

133
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Didn't Huang Zoling say that the alley is not blocked?

134
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Why did you just go in?

135
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Why did you pretend to leave and turn back?

136
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,840
They don't want to block me, but they can't.

137
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Huang Zoling is my friend.

138
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I don't want to get them involved.

139
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
You're so stubborn.

140
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Where's the thing I told you to bring?

141
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
I'll go.

142
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Why did you pretend to leave?

143
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
I'm the governor of the Prefectural Office.

144
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,840
It's not easy to explain why the government officials came here.

145
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
I got it.

146
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
What's this?

147
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Nine-in-one pills.

148
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,840
It can change the tone of the sound within two hours after being taken.

149
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
No one else can hear your voice.

150
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
This is one of the treasures I collected.

151
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
What's going on?

152
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Didn't you say it can change the tone?

153
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
How's it going?

154
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Forget it.

155
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Your treasure will always be guarded.

156
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
What about the rest?

157
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Don't worry, Shiguang.

158
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
There won't be any problems this time.

159
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Look.

160
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Simple and effective.

161
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Keep it in mind.

162
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Please.

163
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Take care.

164
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
It's the eighteenth.

165
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,840
What kind of magic trick did the old man use?

166
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
It's so disturbing.

167
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
What's the rule of the snake palace?

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
According to the old rules,

169
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
we should erase the memories of mortals first.

170
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Ling Xiao and Zhu Ying

171
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,840
should also make up for those little demons that escaped.

172
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Okay.

173
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,840
We'll wait for the barrier to be closed.

174
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
We'll wait for mortals to enter.

175
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
We'll go to the mortal world to repair the place.

176
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Then it'll be easier.

177
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Yes.

178
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Greetings, Your Excellency.

179
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Your Excellencies,

180
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
we found another suspicious place.

181
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
The clothing store?

182
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
The place where the leather bag is.

183
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Okay.

184
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
You should go look for other places.

185
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Yes.

186
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Where did the old man go?

187
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Go.

188
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Your hands are so real.

189
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Yes.

190
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Everyone is hand-painted.

191
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
The clothes are made of the hands of demons.

192
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Naturally, they are fake.

193
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
I heard that

194
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
the demons with shallow cultivation

195
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
are not in shape yet.

196
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Some people who look like me

197
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
will rent or buy

198
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,840
a hand-painted piece of clothing here.

199
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Those who are willing to spend a lot of money

200
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
can even buy it.

201
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Yes.

202
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
From hair, skin, to five-curved limbs,

203
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
they can all be chosen.

204
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
They can only pay when they are satisfied.

205
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Boss, you are a human-shaped demon.

206
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Naturally, you are not familiar with clothing stores.

207
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,840
It's hard for us demons to be human-shaped.

208
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Some of them, even if they are,

209
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,840
they are not tired or ugly.

210
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,840
After all, not every demon is like me.

211
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Okay. Leave it to me.

212
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Go and see if there are other stores.

213
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
By the way, boss,

214
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
you have to be careful.

215
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
The opposite is Liu Xiang's store.

216
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
You are so famous

217
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
that no one can see you.

218
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Which store is the opposite?

219
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Yunnong store.

220
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
His business is always not serious.

221
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,840
He is mischievous and mischievous.

222
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,840
You have asked about Bo Jceksin?

223
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,840
You know him as well.

224
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
No, I know rather well.

225
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
He is common ghosts.

226
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
He is very strict.

227
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
He can take complete action.

228
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Are you sure you don't wear any clothes?

229
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
These are on me.

230
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Moreover,

231
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
It's been a long time.

232
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
The shadow of the four castles

233
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
was also near Liu Xiang, right?

234
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Yes.

235
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Where are they?

236
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Where are they?

237
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
It's strange.

238
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Where are they?

239
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
The Shadow of the Four Castles

240
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
What a strong little wolf!

241
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I'm not here to play.

242
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
I'm really not here to play.

243
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
Beauty, I'm here.

244
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Where is the beauty?

245
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Beauty, I'm here.

246
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
This is...

247
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
a five-star umbrella.

248
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Sir, I think I'm going the wrong way.

249
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Where is this place?

250
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Here.

251
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
It's just an empty room in the Yulong Pavilion.

252
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
What's that sound?

253
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Nothing.

254
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
I'll go inside and have a look.

255
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
No.

256
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Why not?

257
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
The Ghost Pavilion

258
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
It's the Ghost Pavilion.

259
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Why is the Sun family's husband lying here?

260
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Help!

261
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
What's wrong with you?

262
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Sir, sir, wake up.

263
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Wake up.

264
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
Are you okay?

265
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
What beauty?

266
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I'm afraid you have another five-star umbrella.

267
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Help me up.

268
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
What's wrong?

269
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
A man has entered the room and is suspicious.

270
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
What are you playing?

271
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Where am I playing?

272
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Are you okay?

273
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
I'm fine.

274
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
I'm fine.

275
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
I'm fine.

276
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm fine.

277
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
I'm fine.

278
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm fine.

279
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
I'm fine.

280
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Are you okay?

281
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
How did you deal with the human in the room?

282
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,840
I threw him out after he had rubbed the holy stone.

283
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Who was kicking me just now?

284
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
I'll kill him.

285
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Chang'an is too scary.

286
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Luckily I ran fast.

287
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Junior Brother, let's go back to the mountain.

288
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,840
This is not a place for human.

289
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Yes.

290
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
This is not a place for human.

291
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
I've repaired it for a night and it's finally fixed.

292
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
I changed to a new technique.

293
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
It's much better than before.

294
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Wu Er.

295
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
I'm here.

296
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
It's Mr. Shu.

297
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Why are you here, Your Highness?

298
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
There are 50 Jin Yao umbrellas in Chang'an again.

299
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
I've been looking for them for several days.

300
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
Fifty umbrellas?

301
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
I'll go back to work.

302
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
You guys be careful.

303
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
By the way,

304
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Wu Er,

305
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I have something to tell you.

306
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Go ahead.

307
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,840
That little boy in your family,

308
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,840
did he still live in your house recently?

309
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Yes.

310
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Do you know where he was yesterday?

311
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Of course, in Duke's Mansion.

312
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Look at you.

313
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Are you naive?

314
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
That little boy in your family,

315
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
wanted to go to Liu Xiang last night.

316
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Luckily, your brother and I blocked him back.

317
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Luckily, he didn't get lost.

318
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Brother, am I interesting?

319
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
You mean,

320
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
he wanted to go to the brothel?

321
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
I don't believe it.

322
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
I can trust him.

323
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
He's not that kind of person.

324
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
He can't do that.

325
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Wu Er,

326
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,840
you've seen many men before and after.

327
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Who do you trust?

328
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Why are you so partial to him?

329
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
You trust everything.

330
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,840
The nature of this man is to enjoy the fun and drink.

331
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Drink?

332
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,840
You've seen me enjoy the fun and drink?

333
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,840
The nature of this man is to be loved by men and women.

334
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
That's right.

335
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Forget it.

336
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
As long as you know what you're doing.

337
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
I'll get back to work.

338
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Xiao Zhen,

339
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
do you really believe that?

340
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Yes.

341
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
I want to believe you.

342
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Wu Er.

343
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Uncle Wu.

344
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Uncle Wu.

345
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
What are you doing?

346
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
If you join hands with me,

347
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,840
you can do whatever you want.

348
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,840
I'm not afraid of you.

349
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I have nothing to do with you.

350
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
I'm not afraid of you.

351
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
I have nothing to do with you.

352
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Nothing to do with you?

353
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Have you forgotten the past?

354
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
That year,

355
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,840
my bones fell into the mud.

356
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,840
I was blinded by the five elements.

357
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,840
I spent all my energy

358
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,840
to move them one by one

359
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,840
and let them break out of the mud

360
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,840
and come to the world.

361
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
It's raining outside.

362
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Let's go inside.

363
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Okay.

364
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Let's go.

365
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Let's go.

366
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Sir, a duck.

367
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Okay.

368
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Walk faster.

369
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Everything is meant to be.

370
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm destined to come back to the world.

371
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,840
But Guma is an ancient ice tree.

372
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,600
I will make you pay in Your essa carrying cultures.

373
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,780
Here dies a letter.

374
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,780
I heard that Chang'an is in chaos and the Emperor is seriously injured.

375
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,780
I hope that you two can help us to get rid of Chang'an's evil spirits.

376
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,780
How is it, Senior Brother? Let's get up early and go back.

377
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
When the time comes, we'll bring our brothers to kill them.

378
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
We'll also bring you some evil spirits.

379
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,780
Changxi Palace has been closed for a hundred years.

380
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Now that we want to return to Chang'an,

381
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,780
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

382
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,780
We can't just leave Chang'an.

383
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,780
We have to get rid of the evil spirits.

384
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,780
We have to get rid of the evil spirits.

385
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,780
We have to get rid of the evil spirits.

386
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,780
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

387
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
Senior Brother, since you brought it up,

388
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
it means that you're already familiar with it.

389
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,780
Moreover, getting rid of the evil spirits is the mission of our Changxi Palace disciples.

390
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Let alone the closing of the temple for a hundred years,

391
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
even if it's a thousand years,

392
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,780
it's still a must.

393
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Although I entered the demon room last night,

394
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,780
it was too hasty.

395
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,780
I don't even know what's going on in the demon room.

396
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Then what should we do?

397
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,780
I'll stay in Chang'an for the time being

398
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,780
to continue investigating the situation of the demon room

399
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
and then make a plan.

400
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Is Chang'an really that chaotic?

401
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,780
Chang'an

402
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
Did you guys encounter any strange things last night?

403
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,780
We did!

404
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
What?

405
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,780
Last night, I don't know if I was drunk

406
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,780
or if I had a hallucination.

407
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,780
I clearly saw a crack on the bedside table.

408
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,780
When I opened my eyes,

409
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,780
I could smell the sweetness of the nose.

410
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,780
It seemed to have fallen into the sugar water shop.

411
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,780
You don't know,

412
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,780
the bowls and spoons in there were clattering.

413
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,780
On the other hand, I saw a bee that was bigger than a human.

414
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780
I slept last night too.

415
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,780
I seemed to have arrived at a strange place.

416
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
There was a bar over there.

417
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,780
But that owner was not a human.

418
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,780
What was that?

419
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,780
That owner was a skinny monkey.

420
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
I saw it!

421
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,780
Then he was a scary monster!

422
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,780
The human world is just like what Zhu Ying said.

423
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,780
Last night, there was a hole in the barrier.

424
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,780
Many people claimed that they entered a dream

425
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,780
and saw some strange things.

426
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Although the barrier has been repaired,

427
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,780
it won't be exposed to the demon world for a while.

428
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,780
But the rumors are getting more and more.

429
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,780
It's hard to avoid suspicion.

430
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,780
These mortals are always forgetful.

431
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,780
In the past, even if there was a leak,

432
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,780
it was just a mix of their spiritual knowledge.

433
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,780
They would forget it in a few days.

434
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,780
But this time,

435
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,780
why is it so serious?

436
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,780
Actually,

437
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
the barrier was missing in the past.

438
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,780
It was just a few places.

439
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,780
If we find the seal in time,

440
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
we won't notice it easily.

441
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,780
This Elder Hui...

442
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,780
If the old monkey didn't do it because of him,

443
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,780
the barrier wouldn't be so much broken.

444
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,780
Everyone has a strange story.

445
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,780
Everyone has a story.

446
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,780
Am I right, Elder Bai?

447
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,780
Go on. I'm listening.

448
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,780
So you still have no idea

449
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,780
after all these things.

450
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,780
You usually scold the cat palace.

451
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,780
Now you four have caused a huge trouble.

452
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Why are you all avoiding it?

453
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Please calm down, Mr. Shu.

454
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,780
The thing that the Hui family did

455
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
was that he was too confused.

456
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
We three have nothing to do with it.

457
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,780
We didn't try to push it.

458
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,780
But this matter is really too urgent.

459
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,780
That's right.

460
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
The cat palace is always very kind.

461
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,780
Mr. Shu is also very wise.

462
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,780
You can think of some ways to deal with it.

463
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,780
We are all ears.

464
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,780
Just do whatever you want us to do.

465
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,780
I can't think of anything.

466
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,780
Sir, in my opinion,

467
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,780
if you want to avoid any trouble,

468
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,780
you should do it thoroughly.

469
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
What do you mean?

470
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,780
If you have too many people, you will be too talkative.

471
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,780
You should just show up in the night

472
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,780
to the people near the Liu Xiang.

473
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Nong Ya?

474
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,780
Kill them all.

475
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,780
What are you talking about?

476
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
This is the fastest way.

477
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,780
I have a kind of demon body,

478
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,780
colorless and tasteless.

479
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,780
But if you put it in the water,

480
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,780
it's hard to find it in the government.

481
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
Nonsense!

482
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
Do you know how many people were there

483
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
when you entered the Liu Xiang?

484
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
57.

485
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,780
How many people were there around the Liu Xiang?

486
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,780
112.

487
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,780
You want to kill them all?

488
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,780
If the demon world is discovered,

489
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,780
it will be hard to be peaceful.

490
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,780
You said

491
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,780
that was the trouble of Elder Hui.

492
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
How can you transfer it to the innocent mortals?

493
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
Only a hundred people.

494
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,780
It's not as bad as the people

495
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,780
who were killed by the Queen.

496
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,780
Mortals' lives are like grass.

497
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
Why should we follow the rules?

498
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,780
You are the head of the demon palace.

499
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,780
How can you say that

500
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,780
you follow the rules?

501
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,780
I know that the rules are not allowed to kill.

502
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
But only a hundred people

503
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,780
are not allowed to kill.

504
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,780
Even if you kill a hundred people,

505
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,780
it's not a big deal.

506
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,780
Xiao Zhen.

507
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Call the demon world

508
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,780
my lord.

509
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,780
My lord,

510
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
if mortals discover the existence of the demon world,

511
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,780
it will be hard to be peaceful.

512
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,780
I'm also thinking for the demon world.

513
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,780
What you said is not reasonable.

514
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,780
I think...

515
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,780
I remember that I'm the cat.

516
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
I don't agree with it.

517
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,780
I don't want to kill a thousand people

518
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,780
just because of a single cat.

519
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,780
I advise you

520
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,780
that the demon world is a cat.

521
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,780
No one

522
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,780
can kill without thinking.

523
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,780
This is the rule.

524
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,780
Lord Shu.

525
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,780
Please remember it.

526
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
Yes.

527
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,780
Okay.

528
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,780
Then I will do as you say.

529
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,780
I will go prepare the demon rule.

530
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,780
What Wu Zishu said

531
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,780
is for the demon world.

532
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,780
But it's really

533
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,780
a bit too extreme.

534
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,780
I'm afraid it will cause

535
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,780
unnecessary trouble.

536
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,780
I will take full responsibility.

537
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,780
I will handle it.

538
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,780
Please leave.

539
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
Are you really angry with Wu Zishu?

540
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,780
He always has this kind of temper.

541
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,780
He is always

542
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,780
a bit harsh

543
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,780
to people other than you.

544
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,780
I always think

545
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,780
that I know him very well.

546
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,780
But I didn't expect

547
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
that in his eyes,

548
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,780
people's lives are so delicate.

549
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
In the eyes of people,

550
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,780
the lives of

551
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,780
us demons

552
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,780
are not like that.

553
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,780
Two hundred years ago,

554
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,780
I was in the human world

555
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,780
with the name of White Snake Wolf.

556
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,780
I met Duan Lang.

557
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,780
We met by writing books.

558
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,780
He wrote Duan'an Zhe'yu.

559
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,780
I wrote the demon rule.

560
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
It's a heavenly harmony.

561
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,780
He said he was clear-minded with me.

562
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,780
I believed him.

563
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,780
He said he accepted all my good and bad.

564
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
I also believed him.

565
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,780
He said he would never leave me.

566
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,780
I still believed him.

567
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,780
And then?

568
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,780
And then...

569
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,780
He found my demon body by accident.

570
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,780
He ran away.

571
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
Duan Lang!

572
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Demon!

573
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,780
Demon!

574
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,780
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,780
I'm sorry.

576
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,780
I'm sorry.

577
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
I'm sorry.

578
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,780
I'm sorry.

579
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
I'm sorry.

580
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
I'm sorry.

581
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
I thought I would never meet with him again.

582
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,780
But I didn't think he would grow so strong.

583
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
And he said he would return to me.

584
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
Black Snake, let's get married.

585
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:27,140
I don't.

586
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,140
You put the poison in the wine?

587
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Chengqing, you really think you're a human?

588
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Go to hell!

589
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,140
I will never forget how he looked.

590
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,140
He had a sharp tongue and a fierce face.

591
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
He was a ruthless man.

592
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
Mr. Qianqian,

593
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
how shameless!

594
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
You never talked to me about the past.

595
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,140
Why are you telling me this today?

596
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,140
I'm not telling you this to hurt you.

597
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,140
I want to tell you.

598
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Xiao Meng,

599
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,140
don't think too much about it.

600
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
Look through everyone around you.

601
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,140
There are two sides to everything in this world.

602
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,140
The closer you get, the more sharp his other side is.

603
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
