1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit of a

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,320
little bit of a

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,720
little bit of a

6
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,560
little bit of a

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
little bit of a

8
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
little bit of a

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
little bit of a

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
little bit of a

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
little bit of a

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
little bit of a

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
little bit of a

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
little bit of a

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
little bit of a

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
little bit of a

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
little bit of a

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
little bit of a

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,560
little bit of a

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,760
little bit of a

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,360
little bit of a

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
little bit of a

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
little bit of a

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,160
little bit of a

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Episode 16

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Elder Hui said the same demon before.

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
Now you can try it.

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
No wonder the Pond of Buhua was after you.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
You regained your memory and your original body.

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
What is your relationship with Lord Gui Ying?

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
You don't need to know.

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
What exactly do you want me to do?

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Elder Hui is a thousand years old.

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
He knows a lot about the past.

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
I think he can help me.

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
You're not afraid that I'll lie to you.

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Elder Hui is so bold.

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
I can let you continue to be a rat.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Is it because you haven't eaten enough water?

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Of course I dare not.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,160
I will do everything as you say.

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Gui Ying yuan pill.

43
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Find me back.

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Gui Ying yuan pill.

45
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,160
The good of the future is also the good of the past.

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

47
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Gui Ying yuan pill.

48
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
The good of the future is also the good of the past.

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

54
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

57
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

58
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

59
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
So the couple who rule the world is also the couple.

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
This is god-eating!

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:05,160
What's going on?

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
What's this?

64
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
It's cold.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
It's okay.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
It's okay.

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
It's okay.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
It's okay.

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
It's cold.

70
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
It's cold.

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
It's cold.

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
It's cold.

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Madam.

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
What's going on?

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Don't move.

76
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Madam, don't move.

77
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
What is this?

78
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Oh my god!

79
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Oh my god!

80
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Golden fish!

81
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Big golden fish!

82
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,160
What a weirdo!

83
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
What kind of blood have these people been affected by recently?

84
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
They are all crazy about it.

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
It's like,

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
there are things to think about and things to dream about.

87
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
People don't live as they usually do.

88
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
When they fall asleep, they dream of releasing them.

89
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,160
But when they are released, they are too much.

90
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Be serious.

91
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
But even if it's like that, it's too weird.

92
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Just dreaming.

93
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
How can you dream of releasing them?

94
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
It's like there's some kind of infectious disease.

95
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Dreaming?

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Don't think about it if you don't have a death wish.

97
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Tomorrow's wedding is the real thing.

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
That's right.

99
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
There's a monster and a ghost.

100
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
You can't see them.

101
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
The cat house is getting married tomorrow.

102
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Why are you here tonight?

103
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
There's another monster in town.

104
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Let me check his background.

105
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
You must have gone there for nothing.

107
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,040
Why?

108
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,520
The demon tube you're looking for

109
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,920
is not recorded in the library.

110
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,280
Judging by the situation,

111
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,560
it should have been made a demon recently.

112
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,920
Xiao Zhen,

113
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,320
why didn't you come to me

114
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,960
when you were looking for the book?

115
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,280
I think you

116
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,000
was busy with the matter of Hui Gate.

117
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,600
So I didn't bother you.

118
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,280
Didn't you say

119
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,720
these books are all about the collection of the ancient books?

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,760
You can't report to the Heavenly King.

121
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,440
Why did you...

122
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,720
So what if it's about the collection of the ancient books?

123
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,360
If you don't need it,

124
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,160
they're all like a waste of paper.

125
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,160
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,640
Shu,

127
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm getting married.

128
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,360
You should have your own life, too.

129
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,800
I only have you.

130
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,640
You may not like me,

131
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,520
but you don't need me.

132
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,560
I need you, Master Shu.

133
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
You're different.

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:35,600
I am not interested in you anymore.

135
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
Both of you

136
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,160
For 18 years, we have never met.

137
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,160
She is a woman you can't get.

138
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,160
You can never get her.

139
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
She is not yours.

140
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,160
If you are like this,

141
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,160
then don't you dare to touch me.

142
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Oh no, it's too late.

143
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,160
It's too late.

144
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,160
It's so hot.

145
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Still sleeping? Wake up.

146
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Second Madam.

147
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Second Madam.

148
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Second Madam.

149
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Chen, stop sleeping.

150
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Today is your wedding day.

151
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,160
It's my wedding day, not yours.

152
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
What's the rush?

153
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
What are you talking about?

154
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
You are talking nonsense.

155
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
You don't have any rules.

156
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
It's your wedding day.

157
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Second Madam.

158
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Which woman is like you?

159
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,160
You are still talking nonsense.

160
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Yes.

161
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Tell her to get up and dress up.

162
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm going to work outside.

163
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Yes, Duke.

164
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Second Madam.

165
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
You go over there.

166
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
No, no, no.

167
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Come, come, come.

168
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Once the groom comes in, we will start.

169
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
We must give Xiao Zhu Yu a big horse.

170
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Yes, sir.

171
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,160
But isn't Brother Mei your brother?

172
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Yes.

173
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
So what?

174
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Although Xiao Zhu Yu is my cousin,

175
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
I grew up with Sister Zhen.

176
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
We have a deeper relationship.

177
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
So Sister Zhen is more important.

178
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,160
But shouldn't we be on Sister Mei's side?

179
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
This...

180
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Wait.

181
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Although you are Sister Mei's,

182
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
you are Sister Zhen's.

183
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
In short, you are all my sisters.

184
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
In short,

185
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
we must do our best to work together.

186
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
We must not let Xiao Zhu Yu bully my sister.

187
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
I'm sorry.

197
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,160
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,160
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Stop head-crabbing.

221
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,560
What are you doing?

222
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I didn't do anything wrong.

223
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm flattered.

224
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Kill them all!

225
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Why don't you hide, Little bamboo fish?

226
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
What do you mean?

227
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,160
This is a custom. You have to be good at it.

228
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
For the sake of it, at least pretend.

229
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
I see.

230
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Hit it.

231
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
I feel like he's insulting us.

232
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Hit it!

233
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
What are you doing?

234
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
You are my father's

280
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
meaning.

281
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
What are you doing?

282
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm waiting for the flowers.

283
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I don't know.

284
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I haven't been married.

285
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
On the wedding day,

286
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
the bride's best friend

287
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
needs to help complete the last step of the wedding dress.

288
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
The bride's flowers are beautiful.

289
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
No.

290
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Do we have any other friends besides the five of us?

291
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Or women?

292
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
No.

293
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
All the nobles

294
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
don't want to be involved in the marriage.

295
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Why would the bride

296
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
take on her own name to help her?

297
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
But

298
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
she saved me.

299
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
The bride.

300
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
The bride.

301
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
We were married when we were young.

302
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
We've been fighting for years.

303
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
It's been a long time.

304
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Today, someone dared to marry you.

305
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
I have to congratulate you.

306
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
I told you.

307
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
I'm glad to hear that.

309
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Of course, we also have to

310
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
enjoy the happiness of the two of us.

311
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Let's continue, my lady.

312
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Transfer.

313
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Transfer and reception.

314
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
The generation of generations.

315
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
A permanent brood.

316
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
With the권, we will have a long time to live!

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:23,160
The first bow.

325
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:32,160
The second bow.

326
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:40,160
The third bow.

327
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:52,160
The fourth bow.

328
00:21:52,160 --> 00:22:04,160
The fifth bow.

329
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:16,160
The sixth bow.

330
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:25,160
The seventh bow.

331
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:43,160
The eighth bow.

332
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:56,160
The first bow.

333
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:05,160
The eighth bow.

334
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
When did you like him?

335
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Maybe when he said

336
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,160
when the girl was not in the marriage,

337
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
when I was in trouble,

338
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
I was so desperate that

339
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
he could understand me,

340
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,160
and take me in his arms.

341
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Like the rain, protecting the branches.

342
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
What are you laughing at?

343
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Nothing.

344
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,160
I just feel so good.

345
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
In the demon world,

346
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
I am a monster with a half-dead body.

347
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
In the human world,

348
00:23:41,160 --> 00:24:05,260
I am a

349
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
monster with a half-dead body.

350
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I can take you in my arms.

351
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:17,160
I can take you in my arms.

352
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,160
The third bow.

353
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Although he is so handsome,

354
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,160
he is so attractive,

355
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
but his life is so cold.

356
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
I let you take care of him,

357
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,160
just to warm him up.

358
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
I found this time

359
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,160
that you are different from the other time.

360
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Maybe because

361
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,160
it's too cold at night,

362
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I want to have a light.

363
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Please,

364
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
marry him and

365
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,160
live together for a hundred years.

366
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
The rules of the Changxi Palace.

367
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
If you want to leave the Changxi Palace,

368
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,160
you must enter the Baiye Town

369
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,160
and be possessed by the white-eyed bird.

370
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
What's so good about the Fox Realm?

371
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Is it really worth your sacrifice?

372
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,160
It's worth it.

373
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I thought that

374
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
I was just trying to find out the truth

375
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,160
and kill the demons.

376
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Until I met them,

377
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:30,160
I finally had a desire for the future.

378
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Only when you have a desire,

379
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
can you live a happy life.

380
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,160
What do you want to do?

381
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Just do it.

382
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
So I think

383
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,160
it's worth my doing.

384
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Let's drink.

385
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Notice the headphone by the river.

386
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Drink well so teleparatory.

387
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
From now on,

388
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
give your house to me.

389
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
300.

390
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,120
I thought that he wouldn't meet my expectation.

391
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,280
Now, it's so easy to achieve it when my terms and conditions did not meet.

392
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,020
Let's wishinar Cang Changgui appropriate well in the dream entrust Ngou 91.

393
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,680
What's happening is that all of us must work hard for both instance.

394
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,220
Love is soиком

395
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,500

cutter

399
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,420
cutter

400
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,340
knife

401
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,640
cutter

402
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,460
knife

403
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,240
Yes.

404
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,160
What voodoo salt possesses?

405
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,200
To help the body give knowledge to understand.

406
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,040
WHO obtain the sounds from kissing?

407
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,380
There is something i dont know about love,

408
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,020
but not so serious...

409
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,020
What will happen in the future?

410
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
Actually,

411
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
I almost got married once.

412
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,020
Once?

413
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
Married?

414
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
You really think you're a human?

415
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
Go to hell!

416
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,020
Later,

417
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,020
I was discovered by the former snake god.

418
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,020
I was brought back to the demon world to heal.

419
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,020
I swore to myself

420
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,020
that I would kill him when I recovered.

421
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
To avenge him.

422
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
But I forgot one thing.

423
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
I thought

424
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,020
he would be afraid.

425
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
He would be afraid.

426
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
He would regret.

427
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
But I forgot

428
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,020
that the time I spent healing

429
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,020
was a lifetime for him.

430
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
The number of demons is thousands.

431
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
They have gone through many hardships.

432
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
They say snakes are cold.

433
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
But they are not as cold as you mortals.

434
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
They are not as cold as you mortals.

435
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
You

436
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
say you like them.

437
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
But when you calm down,

438
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
you have to make a decision.

439
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,020
I'm not that kind of man.

440
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Don't worry, Sixth Madam.

441
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
The number of demons is thousands.

442
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
They are destined to die.

443
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,020
I'm not that kind of man.

444
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Come on.

445
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
Let's drink.

446
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
If you want to fall in love,

447
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
you have to be kind.

448
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,020
I don't know what will happen to Wuzhen and Meizhu Yu.

449
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
I only know

450
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,020
that he was born a coward.

451
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,020
He had to take a step in this hardship.

452
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
But, Meizhu Yu,

453
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
you only have a few decades of good time.

454
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
Why do you waste it on me?

455
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Don't think too much, Sixth Madam.

456
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,020
I will like you

457
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
one day.

458
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
I will like you

459
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
the day you die.

460
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
I will like you the day you get well.

461
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,020
After a hundred years,

462
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
I will die.

463
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
Of course, there will be others

464
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
who will like you.

465
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,020
Don't bother me, Sixth Madam.

466
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
Do you know?

467
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,020
I have decided

468
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
whether it's worth it or not.

469
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,020
Why are you looking at me like that?

470
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Because you are beautiful.

471
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
Wuzhen is getting married today.

472
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
She is the most beautiful bride.

473
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
If one day,

474
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
you wear a wedding dress,

475
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
you will be more beautiful than your real sister.

476
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,020
Sixth Madam,

477
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,020
I will go and help Zhu Yu.

478
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,020
Otherwise,

479
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,020
I am worried that the wedding room will be empty tonight.

480
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,020
I am coming.

481
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,020
I am coming.

482
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,020
Come on.

483
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,020
Come on.

484
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,020
She is going to do something big tonight.

485
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
Come on.

486
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,020
You don't have to keep looking at me.

487
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
Sixth Madam,

488
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,020
you have to behave yourself on the wedding day.

489
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,020
If you are rude,

490
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,020
you will be looked down on

491
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
by your husband

492
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,020
even if you don't look at others.

493
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,020
He won't.

494
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,020
Don't worry.

495
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
I will be the first bride

496
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,020
who is trapped in Chang'an City.

497
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,020
Of course.

498
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,020
Other ladies in Chang'an City

499
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
sleep well at night.

500
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
Cheers.

501
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
Cheers.

502
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
Drink more on the wedding day.

503
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,020
Where is the fourth husband?

504
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,020
He just threw up.

505
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,020
He is resting next to the bride.

506
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
No.

507
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,020
He is the one who stole the bride's wedding wine.

508
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
I am sorry.

509
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
I am sorry.

510
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
I am sorry.

511
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
I am sorry.

512
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
I am sorry.

513
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
I am sorry.

514
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,020
I am sorry.

515
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,020
I am sorry.

516
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
I am sorry.

517
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
I am sorry.

518
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
I am sorry.

519
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
I am sorry.

520
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
I am sorry.

521
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
I am sorry.

522
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
I am sorry.

523
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
I am sorry.

524
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,020
I am sorry.

525
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
I am sorry.

526
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
I am sorry.

527
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
I am sorry.

528
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,020
I am sorry.

529
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
I am sorry.

530
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
I am sorry.

531
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
I am sorry.

532
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
I am sorry.

533
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
I am sorry.

534
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
I am sorry.

535
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
I am sorry.

536
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
I am sorry.

537
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
I am sorry.

538
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
I am sorry.

539
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
I am sorry.

540
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
I am sorry.

541
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
I am sorry.

542
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
I am sorry.

543
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,020
I am sorry.

544
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
I am sorry.

545
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
I am sorry.

546
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
I am sorry.

547
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,020
I am sorry.

548
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,020
I am sorry.

549
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,020
I am sorry.

550
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,020
I am sorry.

551
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
I am sorry.

552
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020
I am sorry.

553
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
I am sorry.

554
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
I am sorry.

555
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,020
I am sorry.

556
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,020
I am sorry.

557
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
I am sorry.

558
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
I am sorry.

559
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
I am sorry.

560
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
I am sorry.

561
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,020

563
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
I am sorry.

564
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,540
Miss Liu.

565
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,780
Drink up.

566
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,740
Miss Liu.

567
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
Miss Liu.

568
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,520
Let me see my dear wife.

569
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,280
I am still here.

570
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,740
Get up.

571
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
Miss Liu.

572
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,260
I hurt myself because I am too young.

573
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,260
I wise it up.

574
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,120
Go and count the

575
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,520
这个

576
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,420
I've been with you for more than ten years.

577
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,620
You must be very clear about it.

578
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,700
But why did you avoid me so often?

579
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
But fortunately,

580
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,660
we've finally

581
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,620
made it to the right place.

582
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,900
Lei Si Lang,

583
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,540
how many bottles have you drunk?

584
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,700
You're drunk like this.

585
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,540
My lady,

586
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,740
we've worked so hard

587
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,020
to make it happen.

588
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,300
Let's go.

589
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,820
Let's go.

590
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,620
Lei Si Lang.

591
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,140
Yuan Shao Si,

592
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,100
where are you going?

593
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,420
Everyone, eat well and drink well.

594
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,140
I've received

595
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,620
your blessings.

596
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,020
No.

597
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,180
It's the demon.

598
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,260
It's a big deal.

599
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,540
My lady.

600
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,060
My lady.

601
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,540
He's possessed by the demon.

602
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,500
We must get the demon out of his body.

603
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,100
My lady.

604
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,220
My lady, you've really put in a lot of effort.

605
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,020
Ask someone to visit Mr. Mei.

606
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,220
Don't make a fuss.

607
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,620
Madam.

608
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,260
Madam.

609
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,700
Why is the bride standing so high?

610
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
Why is she so low?

611
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,060
Why is she so low?

612
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,220
Great.

613
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,780
I have magic in the daytime.

614
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,020
I finally become a full demon.

615
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
Are you all right?

616
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,540
I won't let anything happen to her.

617
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,860
She's awake.

618
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
Zhenjian is awake.

619
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,420
Come.

620
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,740
Zhenjian.

621
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Zhenjian.

622
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,260
Zhenjian.

623
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
Zhenjian.

624
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,580
Zhenjian.

625
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,020
Zhenjian.

626
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
But it's not true.

627
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,940
Zhu Yu, you're amazing.

628
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,460
You're really awake

629
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,580
after half an hour of talking.

630
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,420
Why are you so fierce?

631
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,420
You almost died.

632
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,420
How could she not be fierce?

633
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,140
But...

634
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,180
What's going on with you?

635
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,300
Uncle.

636
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,420
I'm drunk.

637
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,740
When I woke up,

638
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,420
I was already outside.

639
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,460
I just had a dream.

640
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,660
Have a rest.

641
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,580
The guest was a bit thin.

642
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
I'll go and clean it up.

643
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,620
His wife just woke up.

644
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,220
What is she going to clean up?

645
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,340
Father.

646
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,660
Zhen.

647
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,180
Are you feeling unwell?

648
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,020
I was looking for a secret recipe

649
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,260
in the earth temple.

650
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,220
I made all kinds of food.

651
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,820
Do you want to try?

652
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,860
Then please make some for me.

653
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,580
No problem.

654
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,180
Wait.

655
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,820
Wait.

656
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,580
No problem.

657
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,700
Zhenjian.

658
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,140
If you want to get rid of Uncle Wu,

659
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,860
you don't have to make such a stupid excuse.

660
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,460
I just don't understand.

661
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,300
I'm just a mortal being controlled.

662
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,380
How can a monster be attacked?

663
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,180
This little demon

664
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,180
was attacked on my wedding day.

665
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,380
I must bring it back.

666
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,100
The demon in the dream that appeared in the night

667
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,500
entered the dream in the day

668
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,820
or in the crowd?

669
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,580
This is not a coincidence.

670
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,700
Why are you here?

671
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,620
Brother.

672
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
When did you arrive in Chang'an?

673
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,180
Just now.

674
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,780
Did the chief ask you to go down the mountain?

675
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,740
No.

676
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,780
I ran out of the mountain.

677
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,460
You know, Brother.

678
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,740
I couldn't stay in the mountain.

679
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,700
I didn't expect that

680
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,460
I would run into your wedding.

681
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,540
I was going to buy some buns for you.

682
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,700
But I saw you running out of the house.

683
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,340
Brother.

684
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,780
You ran away from the wedding?

685
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,780
A little demon in Chang'an

686
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,100
disturbed the wedding.

687
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,140
It almost hurt my wife.

688
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,220
Is it a dream?

689
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,300
This demon is very naughty.

690
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,780
It's very naughty.

691
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,620
It likes to enter other people's dreams

692
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,860
to make other people's dreams come true

693
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,660
and to fulfill the things that are in the heart.

694
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,300
It sounds so tricky.

695
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,060
It's not tricky.

696
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,980
Brother, what are you going to do?

697
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,620
Go find that demon.

698
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,820
I'll go with you.

699
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,740
Then you can't talk too much.

700
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,820
Okay.

701
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,380
But what kind of demon are we looking for?

702
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,380
A demon in a dream?

703
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,140
This demon used to like to

704
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,740
spy on other people's dreams.

705
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,140
Then it found that the real desire of the forest

706
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,900
often existed in the dream.

707
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,700
So it often sneaked into the dream

708
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,740
and controlled it.

709
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,900
This demon is the spirit of the dream.

710
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,180
The longer it grows, the bigger it is.

711
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,260
Although it hasn't hurt its life yet,

712
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,500
it will be sooner or later.

713
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,660
Then what are you going to do?

714
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,300
The shadow snake comes out of the hole.

715
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,940
It's a good sign.

716
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,740
The demon has been getting better and better.

717
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,420
It's time to get what you want.

718
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,740
It will show up tonight.

719
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,260
The demon in the dream likes to dream.

720
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,460
Let's make one for him.

721
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,020
But where should we make this dream?

722
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,580
All the people who are in the dream

723
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,540
belong to seven directions of Chang'an.

724
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,740
Now there is only the south-east without a secret path.

725
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,700
South-east?

726
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,700
There is one more thing that is appropriate.

727
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,660
Tonight,

728
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,460
I will take it back.

729
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,340
One day,

730
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,980
I will make these demons

731
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,460
disappear in Chang'an.

732
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:16,860
Jing

733
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,820
украї

734
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,860
detriment

735
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:33,860
The promise I made to you is like a kite flying in the wind

736
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:39,860
How can I repay you?

737
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,860
The past is like a dream

738
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:50,860
But the pain is only a moment

739
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,860
I only want to be with you in my life

740
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:02,860
But I can't save you

741
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:08,860
Look at the petals falling

742
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,860
What's wrong with falling in love?

743
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,860
The moonlight shines on the cold and bitter heart

744
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:25,860
I hug you but you are silent

745
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,860
Look at the petals falling

746
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:36,860
What's wrong with falling in love?

747
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:42,860
The moonlight shines on the end of memories

748
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:48,860
How to say goodbye?

749
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,860
You look back

750
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:58,860
I always say I have

751
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:23,860
Thank you for watching
