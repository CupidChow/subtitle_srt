00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,600
that

9
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,500
mother

00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,440
burned

00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,000
y

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hu Zhu?

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Yes, Miss Hu Zhu.

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You are...

15
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
passing by here?

16
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
No, I'm here to find you.

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Find me?

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hu Zhu!

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't take the monster!

20
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Come out and die!

21
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
What are you doing?

22
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Miss Hu Zhu,

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
are you sure the monster is hiding here?

24
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Yes.

25
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
There are many wild cats here these days.

26
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Even the cats in the house came here.

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,500
It's very hot and humid.

28
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
I'll go and check.

29
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Go ahead, Miss Hu Zhu.

30
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I'll go and check.

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll go and check.

32
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Go ahead, Miss Hu Zhu.

33
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
I'll go and check.

34
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
It's very cold.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,500
There are no people living here.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's so ruined.

37
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
What's the matter with the cats?

38
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
These cats...

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
are only a few.

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
That's right.

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
The monster is right in front of us.

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
I can't see anything.

43
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Miss Hu Zhu,

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
if you're afraid,

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you can go back first.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
I can wait here alone.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,500
What's there to be afraid of?

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Master Shuang Jiang

49
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
is a master of Taoism.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He's very powerful.

51
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
No monster can escape your spell.

52
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Don't say that.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's not far.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's within one mile.

55
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,000
I think I can sense it.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Really?

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
it's a long way.

59
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
It's not far.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's not far.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
within ten steps,

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,000
it'll be a group of chickens.

64
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
What if the monster

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
walks in front of you?

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
The monster...

67
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
can't walk in front of me.

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Then some monsters

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
have very deep Taoism.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
It's good to hide.

71
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
That's okay.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,500
Let me show you something.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All these years,

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
people outside

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
say that our Xuanjian Temple

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
is not doing any good.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Now,

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
we have no brothers.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But who can give us

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
a good reputation?

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Nian Li,

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
didn't you go

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to give the master

84
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,000
a reply for Brother Mei?

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What?

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Did you hear

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
some nonsense again?

88
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Don't say that.

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
There are really

90
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
some people on the street.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know which idiot

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
came out.

93
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
He's playing with a knife

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
and said he could catch a monster.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm the most skilled

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
disciple in the sect.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,500
So,

98
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,000
I can catch that monster.

99
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,000
You're...

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,500
You're really skilled.

101
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,000
But,

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
after all, it's a monster.

103
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
It's fierce and cunning.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's easy to see.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If I fight with the monster,

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
it'll be bad if I hurt you.

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
You'd better go back.

108
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Master Shuang Jiang,

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you mean

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,500
the monster is evil inside,

111
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,000
and it looks ugly?

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,500
Of course.

113
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
But I heard

114
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,000
some monsters look very beautiful.

115
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Like the fox monster in the book.

116
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,000
Isn't it the existence of the beautiful lady?

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're wrong.

118
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Those are nonsense

119
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
from the boring storytellers.

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
The fox monster you mentioned

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
is just a fox in the wild.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,500
It's sharp,

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,000
and it's ugly.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,500
How could a monster

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,500
turn into a beautiful lady?

126
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Think about it.

127
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Am I right?

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's too much.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Princess.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Princess, be careful.

147
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Thank you.

148
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Who?

149
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Who's the one who stole my heart?

150
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
You scared all my friends away.

151
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
It's a group of grapes.

152
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Master,

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
where's your skill?

155
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
I'll call you.

156
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
I'll call you.

157
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Will you say yes?

158
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Yes.

159
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
What's your name?

160
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Yes, it's a group of grapes.

161
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
A group of grapes.

162
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Master,

163
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
you're so good.

164
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
You took the grapes away

165
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
as soon as you called it.

166
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
I took it?

167
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I took it?

168
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't be afraid.

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Thank you, Fifth Madam.

170
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
I didn't...

171
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Good boy. Don't be afraid.

172
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I won't hurt you.

173
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Why are you here?

174
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I want to ask you.

175
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I ordered someone to buy you a drink.

176
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Didn't you say you were busy?

177
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
I heard my cousin was called to catch the monster.

178
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm worried about him.

179
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
So I came to see.

180
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Your cousin is quite worrying.

181
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm kidding.

182
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Don't be afraid.

183
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
It's Hu Zhu who said

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
you're in trouble now.

185
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
The soldiers are looking for a job.

186
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I heard from the accountant of Ruyi House

187
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
that the workshop is strange.

188
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
So I went to see the soldiers

189
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
to see what they were doing.

190
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
I see.

191
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
What is Fifth Madam doing here?

192
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
You didn't come to the garden.

193
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm bored.

194
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I came to see the fun.

195
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Okay.

196
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Wait.

197
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I'm doing this for your own good.

198
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
There are many cats in it.

199
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
It's okay. I'll go and have a look.

200
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Are you avoiding me?

201
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
I am.

202
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
The trip to the west was a work of Young Master.

203
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I had to meddle.

204
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
I didn't help you,

205
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
but I made trouble for you.

206
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
It's indeed a wrong move.

207
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
If you don't mind,

208
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,500
I can stay away from you in the future.

209
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
It has nothing to do with Fifth Madam.

210
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
It's my own problem.

211
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Your problem?

212
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
It's not that you're rude.

213
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm not innocent.

214
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
What do you mean?

215
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I used to feel that I was determined

216
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
and not being tolerated by others.

217
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Now I understand that I overestimated myself.

218
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
In the end, I'm just a commoner.

219
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
He said he was the one who asked for it.

220
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,500
It seems that he is ambitious and not afraid of anything.

221
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
In my opinion,

222
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
you don't have to beg yourself.

223
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
I don't have to beg?

224
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I read a saying when I was a child.

225
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
It's not that I don't believe it.

226
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
I believe that

227
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,500
only when one has desire can one live a happy life.

228
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Young Master,

229
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
do whatever you want to do.

230
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm in the fire of this world.

231
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Brother, I've done it.

232
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I've taken your monster.

233
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I've taken the monster?

234
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Yes.

235
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm so powerful now.

236
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Lady Hu Zhu saw it.

237
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
You can ask her if you don't believe me.

238
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Yes, you're so powerful.

239
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Sorry, my cousin is too reckless.

240
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
It's good for you two.

241
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
If so, we'll leave now.

242
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Let's go.

243
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
It was so dangerous just now.

244
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
That monster is small, but it's so powerful.

245
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
It's so powerful that it can carry such a big square.

246
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
If I hadn't lost my foot, I would have been injured.

247
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
But you know I'm good.

248
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Why does this man look a little strange?

249
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Why does this man look a little strange?

250
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
He's just not used to the new staff.

251
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Chang'an is praising him today.

252
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
He's not used to it.

253
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Maybe he's like you.

254
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
He has to spend a few days every now and then.

255
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Let's not talk about him.

256
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
How are you two?

257
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Don't mention him.

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
It's a waste of my time.

259
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Changxi Palace is better than the Prime Minister's catch.

260
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,500
I think it's the same trick as the Prime Minister.

261
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Don't take it to heart.

262
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Give him some money.

263
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
We're relieved that we've finished the play.

264
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
As for that little monster,

265
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
I can't just let him go.

266
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Don't be afraid.

267
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
That big guy has already beaten me away.

268
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
You like little cats a lot.

269
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Uncle.

270
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
What kind of medicine are you?

271
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Let me go.

272
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
It doesn't matter what kind of medicine we are.

273
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Who are you?

274
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Why did you bring so many little cats to the shrine?

275
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Why should I tell you?

276
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Let me down.

277
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
It's okay if you don't tell me.

278
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,500
I like children who don't listen to me the most.

279
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Okay.

280
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
If he doesn't listen, we'll split him up.

281
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
You eat meat, I eat bones.

282
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
No, no, no.

283
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
I'll say it.

284
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I'll say it.

285
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I'll say it.

286
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Can't I say it?

287
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I was a Putan Chengjing in the shrine.

288
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Putan Chengjing was very lively here in the past.

289
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Many people come to worship the Qi Yuan every day.

290
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
They went to the Qi Yuan again.

291
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
But then I don't know why,

292
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
no one came.

293
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
It's not white here either.

294
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
I feel so lonely.

295
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
That's why I attracted the cats around me to accompany me.

296
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I used to be quite forgetful here.

297
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Later, I built a Guanyin Pavilion outside the city.

298
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
This side is naturally clear.

299
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Since then, there have been no more fresh stories to listen to.

300
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
No one talks to me.

301
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
But they don't talk to you.

302
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
That's the Qi Yuan.

303
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
You're a little Putan, you're just being used.

304
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
What's so good about this kind of day?

305
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I don't understand either.

306
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Although they're always on me,

307
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
it still hurts a little.

308
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
But I just feel like the days back then

309
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
are more interesting than they are now.

310
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
You won't feel lonely if you don't need it.

311
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Kid, if you feel lonely,

312
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
will you come with us?

313
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Where to?

314
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
The demon world, a place that needs you.

315
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm done eating.

330
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Brother, what do you want to talk about?

331
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
He's resting without a good mood.

332
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Little brother. Look at this.

333
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Your aunt won't turn it over.

334
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Just look at it.

335
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I'm looking for you.

336
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I have something to tell you.

337
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
What is it?

338
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,460
As a master,

339
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,380
I shouldn't have stopped you

340
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,540
from killing the demons.

341
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,380
But Chang'an is not Xuzhou.

342
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,100
You'll be in trouble

343
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,420
if you make a scene like this.

344
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,020
Did I make a scene?

345
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,940
I think I'm quite low-key.

346
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,060
Then I'll be low-key.

347
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,620
But, Senior,

348
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,980
why do people in Chang'an say

349
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,500
that the Changxi Palace is fake?

350
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,820
If you mention the word Changxi,

351
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,820
they'll think you're a liar.

352
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,660
Changxi Palace has been closed for a hundred years.

353
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,420
It's been left empty.

354
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,420
There will inevitably be people with evil intentions.

355
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,300
They'll use the name of Changxi Palace

356
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,820
to make a scene.

357
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,180
Why should we close the place?

358
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,500
Although Chang'an is a big place,

359
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,020
there are so many people and demons.

360
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,820
There are so many living things.

361
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,340
I don't want to give those bad guys a chance to do something.

362
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,620
Master once said

363
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,300
that Changxi Palace is not a place

364
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,780
that is not natural

365
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
but is driven away by demons.

366
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,300
It's the Chang'an Monster

367
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,100
who bullied us.

368
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,540
No.

369
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,660
I have to kill them.

370
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,420
Don't be impulsive.

371
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,020
Fine.

372
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,700
I went down the mountain to get rid of the demons.

373
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,580
But I can't sign up for the competition.

374
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,700
It's not fair.

375
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,260
You want to get rid of the demons

376
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,300
just to sign up for the competition?

377
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,140
Yes.

378
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,620
I'm different from you.

379
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,380
You're innocent.

380
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,700
You don't care about the name.

381
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,620
I'm not.

382
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,460
I went down the mountain to get rid of the demons

383
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,940
just to be a hero.

384
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,940
It's so strange

385
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,460
to do good deeds without being known.

386
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,060
Anyway,

387
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,140
I'm just a commoner.

388
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,020
I believe

389
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
that people have desires

390
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,420
to live a happy life.

391
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,220
Young Master,

392
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,740
do whatever you want.

393
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
The champion of the sales is proud.

394
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,780
We invite you to continue.

395
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,580
Uncle,

396
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,260
I think

397
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,220
you're steaming meat.

398
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,860
I'm enjoying my life now.

399
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,420
Is it necessary to be so hot?

400
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,900
The medicine can't be cured in a second.

401
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,260
It needs to be improved.

402
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,020
But don't worry, Young Master.

403
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,540
After a while,

404
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,740
you'll be a full demon.

405
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,700
Everything will be fine.

406
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,260
Master Shu.

407
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,660
I told you

408
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,260
not to disturb me.

409
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,980
Master Shu,

410
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,780
there's a guest who wants to see you.

411
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,020
So I want to ask you.

412
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,740
Then come another day.

413
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,220
Well...

414
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,260
Well...

415
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,420
It's not appropriate.

416
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,540
Not appropriate?

417
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,060
There's a mistake in the account book.

418
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,820
The police broke the demon's order.

419
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,180
From today,

420
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,700
we'll start the night.

421
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,460
Will you write it?

422
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,020
No.

423
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,900
I never write.

424
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,220
I never write.

425
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,540
You!...

426
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Stand back.

427
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,040
Stand up.

428
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,900
Stand back.

429
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,620
Stand back.

430
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,820
Stand back.

431
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,740
Stand back quickly.

432
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,460
How was it?

433
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,360
I'm all!

434
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,760
I'm all for you!

435
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,340
Black Wall and if extraordinary

436
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,280
Black Wall and if extraordinary

437
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,980
Su him

438
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,920
Blue Wall

439
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
and the Duke of Yongzhou,

440
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
and the Governor of Xuanjian,

441
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
and the Governor of Yongzhou,

442
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
and the Governor of Xuanjian,

443
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
I hope to lead the Court of Judicial Review

444
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
and solve the case for the people,

445
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
and for the peace of Yicheng,

446
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
and to take the position of Governor Xu Luan first.

447
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
His age is old,

448
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
and he can't be the son of Xuanjian.

449
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
I hope to

450
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
send him back to his hometown, Yongzhou,

451
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
and to take the position of Governor of Yongzhou.

452
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
and to send him back to his hometown, Yongzhou,

453
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
I hope to be able to lead

454
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
the families of Y inchan

455
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
and not let down the hope of the Court beginro

456
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Director Fan, born this month!

457
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Did my husband marry truly?

458
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,040
Although got married,

459
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I still can't let him be my master.

460
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Air balls are to protect dissolve the husband by the nature delete

461
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,540

to discuss where Yishan fell!

464
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
Director Fan,

465
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,540
our director, is now young and threshold

466
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
I'm so happy!

467
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,540
I'm so happy!

468
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,540
I'm so happy!

469
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
I'm so happy!

470
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,540
I'm so happy!

471
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
I'm so happy!

472
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,540
I'm so happy!

473
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,540
I'm so happy!

474
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,540
I'm so happy!

475
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
I'm so happy!

476
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
I'm so happy!

477
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,540
I'm so happy!

478
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
I'm so happy!

479
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,540
I'm so happy!

480
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,540
I'm so happy!

481
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,540
I'm so happy!

482
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,540
I'm so happy!

483
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,540
I'm so happy!

484
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:17,400
Where is the

485
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,240
Well,

486
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,020
What's wrong with you?

487
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,400
What's wrong with you?

488
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Tsk.

489
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,400
I'm sorry for the loss of you in the palace and in private.

490
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Enough.

491
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Didn't you recommend me to be the governor of Yongzhou

492
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
to Minister Liu?

493
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,400
You don't have to say sorry to me.

494
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
To be honest,

495
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I've thought of countless words to scold you that day.

496
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
But when I'm free,

497
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I'll think about it.

498
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
You're right.

499
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
I've been in charge of Xuanjian Temple for many years.

500
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,400
I didn't do anything serious.

501
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,400
I know how others scold me and talk about me in the back.

502
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
I don't care.

503
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Fine.

504
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Put it in the room.

505
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,400
You're young,

506
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
talented,

507
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
and aware of the situation for the people.

508
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
You're really wronged

509
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,400
for living in the dark library.

510
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I just did my duty.

511
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Duty?

512
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
It's easy to say,

513
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
but it's really hard to do.

514
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
When I was young,

515
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
I was a high-ranking official.

516
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
I was admitted to Chang'an.

517
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I was full of worries.

518
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,400
I wanted to do my duty for the country and the people.

519
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
But in the end,

520
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
I was scolded by others.

521
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Eighteen years ago,

522
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
you were still young

523
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
when the Chang'an Fire and Rescue were in chaos.

524
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
You probably haven't seen that scene.

525
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,400
That's what we call a life-and-death situation.

526
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
My friend and I

527
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
worked on this case together.

528
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,400
We're both from the same hometown

529
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
and from the same village.

530
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,400
We're both officials in Chang'an.

531
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
He was always loyal to me.

532
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,400
This case is not to be involved in too much.

533
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Otherwise, you'll be in danger.

534
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Only later did I know

535
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Chang'an

536
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
was not clean.

537
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Not clean?

538
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
No.

539
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
At that time,

540
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
I marked all the places of the ghost case

541
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
in Chang'an.

542
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
On the map.

543
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
I thought

544
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
that one day,

545
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
I would find out about these cases one by one.

546
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
But later I realized

547
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
that Chang'an was not simple.

548
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
The case was simple.

549
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
It was hard to deal with outsiders.

550
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
The Changxi Palace in Dingjing, the Ming Dynasty,

551
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
was of course not there a hundred years ago.

552
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
We were all so weak

553
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
that we could break through the ghost case

554
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
and fight the monsters.

555
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
I didn't give up.

556
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
This thing is too heavy.

557
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I won't take it away.

558
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,400
I'll give it to you as a souvenir.

559
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
It's yours.

560
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Today is the first day of the lunar month.

561
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Didn't you want to enter the palace before?

562
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Then I'll

563
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
take the opportunity to

564
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
make a decision

565
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
without forgetting my original intention.

566
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
I'll be there.

567
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
What are you looking for?

568
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
I'm Mei Zhuyu from the Xuanjian Bureau.

569
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
May I ask what you are?

570
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
The Dark Road Pavilion is located in the palace.

571
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
In order to change the general,

572
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
a female official is transferred to the position of the general.

573
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
So you are the official of Dark Road Pavilion.

574
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
So you are the new Mei Zhuyu

575
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,400
who is the director of the Xuanjian Bureau.

576
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
I wonder if Mei Siyu

577
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
is looking for something?

578
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
I have sorted out the files in the private office

579
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
and found one missing.

580
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
I heard that the former director Xu Luan said

581
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
that this file had been transferred to the palace

582
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
and placed here temporarily.

583
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
So I came to look for it.

584
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
The files hidden in the Dark Road Pavilion

585
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
are already in the dark.

586
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
You want to look for the files,

587
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
why don't you let the Li family in the Pavilion

588
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
help you find them?

589
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
It's not easy.

590
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
There are still some files in the private office.

591
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
I still want to check other records

592
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
besides this file.

593
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Instead of bothering the Li family,

594
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
I'd rather do it myself.

595
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
I don't understand.

596
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Since it's a past case,

597
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
why do you investigate it?

598
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
It's just missing a file.

599
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
You are a new secretary.

600
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Do you have to come to look for it?

601
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Is there nothing important

602
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
from those files?

603
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Okay.

604
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Yes.

605
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
It can be disappeared.

606
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Okay.

607
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
effect.

608
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
What's wrong with Noble Consort Mei?

609
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
My Meizhu from Tang Palace came to the palace today.

610
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I heard that Her Majesty has already gone to Dark Road Pavilion

611
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
to meet her.

612
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
What is Sister Zhao up to again?

613
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
She is so fierce.

614
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm afraid that Young Master can't handle her.

615
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,400
The so-called meaning of ignorance is far from the truth.

616
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
The reason why we established the Xuanjian Bureau

617
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
is to solve the mystery of the case,

618
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
protect the people, and bring peace to the world.

619
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
As the Minister of Xuanjian Bureau,

620
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
it is our duty to find clues to solve the case

621
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
and help the people.

622
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Moreover,

623
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
the case of the past Xuanjian Bureau

624
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
is not related to the case of today.

625
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
The mystery of the case is often illogical,

626
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
but it has a purpose.

627
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Today, the case is not solved.

628
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Maybe it can be a good thing from the past.

629
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
It is called

630
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
the truth is the truth.

631
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
It can be understood.

632
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
The truth is the truth.

633
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Well said.

634
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I didn't know that in Chang'an,

635
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
there is a young man like you.

636
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
It's up to you.

637
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
It's a little boring

638
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
to live in such a small Xuanjian Bureau.

639
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
I can say a few words

640
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
in the palace.

641
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
I'm willing to live in a good place

642
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
when I'm not dead.

643
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Since you are an official,

644
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
no matter where you work,

645
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
you should do your best.

646
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
No matter where you work, you should be an official.

647
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
That's a good...

648
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
I'm a little narrow-minded.

649
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
It's the first time

650
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
you admit your mistake.

651
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Why don't you know the rules?

652
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Sister,

653
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
I was rude to let the emperor

654
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
to hit the empress.

655
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
It's okay.

656
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
I'm sorry to see the empress,

658
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Consort Mei

659
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
and Qinghe.

660
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
You don't look nervous

661
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
when you see me.

662
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm not nervous

663
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
when I see you.

664
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
You can talk well.

665
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
You have been in Chang'an

666
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
for a while.

667
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I haven't called you into the palace.

668
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
I'm sorry.

669
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
You can come to the palace

670
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
when you have free time.

671
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Look at you.

672
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
What are you doing in the palace today?

673
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
I miss you.

674
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
You miss me?

675
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Did the emperor ask you to play cards

676
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
or play with the pot?

677
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
I played chess

678
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
for a while.

679
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Okay.

680
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Go and see Yuan Zhen.

681
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
He is not well recently.

682
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
He stays in the palace all day long.

683
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
He is very bored.

684
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
He keeps talking about you.

685
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Okay.

686
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Yuan Zhen will be happy

687
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
when he sees me.

688
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I'll take him away.

689
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Your footwork

690
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
is very interesting.

691
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
What you said

692
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
is really

693
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
very good.

694
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
You have a good understanding

695
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
of the first intention of the Xuanjians.

696
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Your attitude

697
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
is not humble.

698
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
You are a good child.

699
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Thank you for your compliment.

700
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Zhen

701
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
has a good taste.

702
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
I'm here.

703
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Didn't my wife come to see Yuan Zhen?

704
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Don't send me away.

705
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
I didn't send you away.

706
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
You sent me away.

707
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
I'm here.

708
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Tong, the ghost is here again.

709
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
What's going on?

710
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Don't touch it.

711
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
What's wrong?

712
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Your Highness,

713
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
look at this flower.

714
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Tong, the ghost is here again.

715
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Princess,

716
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
is this blood?

717
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
It's just a flower.

718
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
It looks a little strange.

719
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Who is in charge of this flower recently?

720
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
I'm here to accompany you.

721
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Are you still in pain?

722
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
No.

723
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
What is that?

724
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
What is it?

725
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Woman?

726
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,300
The

727
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
The

728
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
The

729
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
The

730
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
The

The

The

The

734
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
The

735
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
The

736
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
The

737
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
The

738
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
The

739
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
The

740
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
The

741
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
The

742
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
The

743
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
The

744
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
The

745
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
The

746
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
The

747
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
The

748
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
The

749
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
The

750
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
The

751
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
The

752
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
The

753
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
The

754
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
The

755
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
The

756
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
The

757
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
The

758
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
