1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
little bit of

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
what is right

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What can I do to make you feel better?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to talk to you.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's really a woman.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's go.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
When did the process of making tea come to an end?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Half a month ago,

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
this strange thing started in the tea garden.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This woman was wandering under the tree.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Her body was covered with white dust.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
She was covered with mud.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She looked like a ghost.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When I first saw her, I thought I was blind.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But soon I met her for the second time.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The strange thing happened at that time.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Strange thing?

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My lady,

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
this tea tree has been in the palace for a long time.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's what Princess Yuanzhen loves.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Although it usually looks like a night cat,

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
it's the first time to bloom flowers this year.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We were happy at that time.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The princess especially rewarded us.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Not long after,

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the tea tree suddenly started to fall.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's bleeding.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Even...

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Even every night,

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the garden can hear the sound of the seven-leaf clover.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's like a ghost crying.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's a ghost, a ghost crying.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Nonsense.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We also feel very bad.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But after we checked several times,

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we didn't find out where the problem was.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know what disease this white tea is having.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's a death sentence.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Since there is a strange thing,

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
why didn't you report to the queen?

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The princess really likes this tea tree.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She is worried that if the queen knew about this,

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
she would definitely ask someone to punish this tree.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So she especially told us

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
not to spread this matter.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Forget it.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Leave.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't spread this matter.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,840
The

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Haven't you been very busy lately?

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You didn't go back to the Xuanjian Bureau?

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Since it's a strange thing,

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it's my business.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I should find out.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wuniangzi,

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
aren't you really afraid of ghosts?

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm afraid.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ghosts are naturally afraid.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But if it's a good-looking ghost,

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
then don't talk about it.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think I should know who it is.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Who is it?

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you hungry?

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is the money you paid for the ghost two days ago.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I brought it to you.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I almost forgot.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Fortunately, the lady of the lake is very kind.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thank you, lady of the lake,

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
for introducing me to business.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I have to repay you.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You don't have to.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Just give me the fox tail.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The seven-colored fox tail.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I really didn't see it.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This...

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What? You don't want to?

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I want to say this is not real.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's not worth it.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's not real?

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What do you mean?

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is a rabbit's fur.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's dyed.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Because it looks like a fox tail after it's made.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So the seven-colored fox tail is its name.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Not material.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So you're so proud

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
just because you hunted a rabbit.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can catch a rabbit?

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Come.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Isn't it great?

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's so great.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I didn't expect that we're just two-sided.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're so nice to me.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've thought about it.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
From now on,

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Lady of the Lake is my best friend.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
From now on,

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can do anything for you.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I won't say anything else.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're so polite.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
For the sake of Lady Wu and Mr. Mei,

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll take care of you.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Just because they know each other?

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You don't know?

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They?

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They don't just know each other.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What?

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You mean they're in that kind of relationship?

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's not a normal friendship.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I didn't expect that

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
you're so nice to me.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're a fox.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What did you say?

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Fox?

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Fox.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Anyway,

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
my brother won't like Lady Wu.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You don't know me.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
When I was young,

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was only strong.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But I didn't have any skills.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So I used to play every day.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Not only during the day,

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I even took a rest at night.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The other nine...

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Cousin?

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They all thought I couldn't do it.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I was so stupid.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I couldn't do it.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But Cousin didn't say anything.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He was always in the study.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He was not happy with me.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But he was kind.

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Until one night,

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I was still practicing in the yard.

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That was the first time Cousin approached me.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He pointed out the wrong place for me.

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He helped me improve my martial arts.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Since that night,

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
he came every day at that time.

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The time of two cups of tea

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
was like this every day.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because of his guidance,

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I entered the school.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I was very grateful to him.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I thought he had a good impression of me.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Or he couldn't stand seeing me work so hard.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So he helped me.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But later he told me

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I didn't have to thank him.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Then I knew

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
he was because I was too noisy every night.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He wanted to help me enter the school earlier.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He wanted to help me enter the school earlier.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So he could sleep well at night.

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He told you directly?

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Cousin

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
doesn't look like he has a bad temper.

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He is very upright.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But in fact,

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
he is the most determined.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He decided

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
no one could change.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He didn't want to say it.

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No one could know.

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He was very hard to please.

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sometimes

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't think I was familiar with him.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He seemed to be always calm,

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
calm, not angry,

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and not happy.

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There is a saying,

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
no desire is strong.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The less desire in the world,

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
the less weakness.

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So even if the fifth wife has many benefits,

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
my brother

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
will not be interested in her.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Where did you get it?

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
In the sunroom.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I stole it.

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I will go.

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Fifth wife, can you tell me now

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
who is that white woman?

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The workers are afraid of ghosts

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and are passionate about exaggerating the truth.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The truth is often

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that people are deceiving ghosts.

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There are few people

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
who can walk here at night

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
without any care.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The reason is

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the young girl is worried about her husband.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I am here.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I heard that my mother is coming to the palace tonight.

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
She is coming to see me.

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I will go out and talk to you.

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is the medicine that the doctor gave me.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But I know

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that you are the real patient.

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But how can I save you?

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It is a white tea tree.

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why do you always drive me away?

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I am not a ghost.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You always drive me away.

237
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I am lonely

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and it is not interesting.

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Not interesting?

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I will play with you.

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Who is she?

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Greetings, princess.

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
She is the cousin of the Noble Consort Mei.

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
My partner.

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Guan Yuanzhen,

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
what are you doing here?

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I am not in a good mood.

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I am walking around.

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Not in a good mood?

250
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Are you scared by the white tea tree?

252
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I will be cut by someone.

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No, no.

254
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
She is my friend.

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I can't look at it.

256
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This tree has been with me for many years.

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I will say anything to it.

258
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Many years?

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I really can't bear to part with it.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yuanzhen.

261
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What?

262
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
She has been cold recently.

263
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am afraid she is not well.

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Please take her back.

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I will ask someone to change the doctor.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay.

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Come out.

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You...

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Who are you?

270
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The Demon Lord.

271
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The Demon Lord?

272
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What is it?

273
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It doesn't matter.

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Where did you come from?

275
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I have never seen you before.

276
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If you care about Yuanzhen,

277
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
you should trust me.

278
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I am her aunt.

279
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I won't harm her.

280
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Many years ago,

281
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I had a spiritual heart.

282
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Then,

283
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the marriage was ruined

284
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and the Demon Lord saved her.

285
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She came to the palace

286
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
every day

287
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to talk to me.

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
She was talking nonsense.

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Until half a year ago,

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I started to be more and more human.

291
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No wonder Yuan Ding said

292
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
you just started this year.

293
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It was not because of them.

294
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I thought

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I could show her flowers.

296
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But the days were too short.

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
In the middle of the month,

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I was trapped by these

299
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
demons who came from nowhere.

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
In these days,

301
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I have seen many

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
of them.

303
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Do you know there is another name

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
for white tea flowers?

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
White tea

306
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
is also called

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the broken flower.

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why is it called this name?

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Because most of the flowers in the world

310
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
fall off

311
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
when they are withered.

312
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Only white tea

313
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
flowers

314
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
fall off

315
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
when they are withered.

316
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
They are broken.

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't want Yuan Zhen

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
to see me like this.

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But...

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I can't stop her.

321
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You are awake, Princess.

322
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do you feel uncomfortable?

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How come I am back?

324
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Brother, I want to go back

325
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and help her.

326
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
She? Who are you?

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Ren Zhen values you so much.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If you die like this,

329
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
how sad she will be.

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
She is my sister.

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I will help her.

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
She is my sister.

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
How sad she will be.

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I won't let her be sad.

335
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can only make a bottle of

336
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
honey wine for 20 years.

337
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I finally

338
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
stole it out.

339
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
These bugs are so cheap.

340
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It smells so good.

341
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I am so tired.

342
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I am so tired.

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That white tea tree is just sick.

344
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You must help her.

345
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
care about that tree?

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
In my heart,

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
it is different.

349
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
How?

350
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The palace is so big.

351
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But my father and mother are busy.

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The palace is so crowded.

353
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Only he is with me.

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Listen to me.

355
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Brother,

356
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
don't you have someone

357
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
you want to keep?

358
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You are so fast

359
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
when you are not in a hurry.

360
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How is Yuan Zhen?

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The doctor said he is fine.

362
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is...

363
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Do you think

364
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
it is fresh?

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How could these poisonous geese

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
fall into the water?

367
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Maybe...

368
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Maybe...

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The geese are splashing water.

370
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Geese are always splashing water.

371
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
How could they do that?

372
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It smells so sweet.

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Actually, I just

374
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
spilled the wine.

375
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Wine?

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
When I went to the bathroom,

377
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I passed by the cold and mist.

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I took it.

379
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I am so careless.

380
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I didn't drink the wine.

381
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Many poisonous geese are sweet.

382
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So they often destroy the flowers and plants.

383
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The sweet smell in the water

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
led them here.

385
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So they couldn't fly

386
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
because of the water.

387
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They died in the water.

388
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think the reason why

389
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the workers say they are sick

390
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
is because of these poisonous geese.

391
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
My wife did a good thing.

392
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes.

393
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You are so knowledgeable.

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Okay.

395
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Since there is nothing wrong with the tea,

396
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
we should leave the palace.

397
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He is just a tree in other people's eyes.

398
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But in my heart,

399
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
he is my only friend.

400
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He doesn't know how to speak.

401
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But I can feel

402
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
that he has been

403
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
with me and protected me

404
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
all these years.

405
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
When I need him,

406
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
he is always there.

407
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Brother, he is different from others.

408
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I want to keep him.

409
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I want to keep him.

410
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I didn't have a bad thought.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I didn't commit a crime.

412
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I am so sorry.

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I am so sorry.

414
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But

415
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
this is the only time.

416
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I am sorry.

417
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
My lady, we are here.

418
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you for the ride.

419
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Little boy.

420
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Your old road

421
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
is not like this, right?

422
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The old road was uneven.

423
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So I had to fix it.

424
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You must have spent a lot of money

425
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
to make such a big hole.

426
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You have such a big determination

427
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
when you just got into the private life.

428
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It has nothing to do with the heat.

429
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It is...

430
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It is a broken road.

431
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I should have fixed it earlier.

432
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:06,460
Gawd

433
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,460
He is doingCrect!

434
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Shige, why are you staring at him?

435
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Why don't you read it?

436
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The more I read, the more I get annoyed.

437
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But this thing is not good either.

438
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Xiao Zhen, I have to talk to you about this.

439
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I promise I won't do anything.

440
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If I force the White Tea Crystal back to the demon city,

441
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the White Tea Crystal will be very sad.

442
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes, the love of a young man who has been with the guardian since childhood is incomparable.

443
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Enough.

444
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You two stop acting here.

445
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Let's forget about the White Tea Crystal.

446
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
For the next step,

447
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Wu Zi Shu, why did you call me here?

448
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I have something to report to the snake palace.

449
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
A few days ago, a man came to report that a mortal was looking for a demon's book.

450
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It seems to be the demon tea chicken that the White Snake Wolf lived in the previous dynasty.

451
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
White Snake Wolf?

452
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
What a familiar name.

453
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Isn't this the painting of the snake palace 200 years ago?

454
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This book has been out for almost 200 years, but someone still remembers it.

455
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's quite eye-catching.

456
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But someone suddenly asked about this book.

457
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm worried that there is something inside.

458
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
What's there to be afraid of?

459
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The two sides will definitely meet.

460
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
We'll know who the other person is when we go down to see.

461
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
If it's someone like the Angel, who wants to find something,

462
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
it's a good thing to kill him.

463
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
What if the mortal is just looking for a book?

464
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Then I'll sign him.

465
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What if it's a plum?

466
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'll sign it.

467
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He runs so fast.

468
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Nothing more.

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
This book is originally from Boss Shu.

470
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Sister Zhen.

471
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yes.

472
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Mrs Liu. Mrs Liu.

473
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Mrs Liu.

474
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What are you shouting?

475
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I thought Mrs Liu didn't hear you.

476
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What do you want from me?

477
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I thought about it.

478
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The reason Mrs Liu doesn't believe me

479
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
is probably because she doesn't know anything about the demon.

480
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So I found an ancient book in Chang'an City

481
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
that I want to tell Mrs Liu.

482
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I don't need it.

483
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Whether you need it or not, listen to me.

484
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I heard that this white snake was the most famous

485
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:23,180
and most famous

486
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,180
in Chang'an City.

487
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,180
It's very famous.

488
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,180
These three spices are the best spices

489
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,180
we have in our store.

490
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Mrs Liu, this demon fried chicken

491
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,180
looks like a demon.

492
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,180
If you read it carefully, you can see the different styles

493
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
and the different ways to deal with different demons.

494
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
It's divided into seven parts.

495
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,180
The first part is about demon and demon.

496
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
The second part is about the world,

497
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
the mountains and the sea, the chaos.

498
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,180
And the third part is about the world.

499
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
The most famous one is the monster in the mountains

500
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
written by the white snake.

501
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
It's a very famous book.

502
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Mrs Liu,

503
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
this is my favorite book.

504
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
It's about

505
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
the story of the demon traveling the world.

506
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
The demon is not evil.

507
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,180
It's like a human.

508
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
It's happy and emotional.

509
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Not all demons attack people.

510
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Of course, the heart of the demon is not evil.

511
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
That's all.

512
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,180
Tell me about

513
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
the most scary part of this fried chicken.

514
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
You are so bold.

515
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,180
The most scary part

516
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
must be the woman.

517
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
The woman.

518
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
Tell me where is the scary part.

519
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
Where is it?

520
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,180
The woman is a monster.

521
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
She appears with a woman's appearance.

522
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,180
She has long hair and a face that doesn't show.

523
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
I heard that the woman

524
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
likes to appear behind people without any sound.

525
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
She is so powerful

526
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,180
that she can kill people.

527
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
And her fingers are like a tree.

528
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,180
Just like this?

529
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Just like this?

530
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
Like this?

531
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
Get up.

532
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Get up.

533
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,180
The demon!

534
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Run!

535
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,180
It's me, Ling Xiao.

536
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
Ling Xiao?

537
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,180
I'm just kidding.

538
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,180
You are so annoying.

539
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,180
You are so small.

540
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,180
I don't want to be embarrassed.

541
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,180
Minister Mei.

542
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,180
I understand

543
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,180
what you mean by this.

544
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,180
But I have to tell you

545
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,180
that I'm not afraid of

546
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,180
the demon's words.

547
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,180
I won't go to the demon's house.

548
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
The thing about the demon

549
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,180
is very strange.

550
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
It's very interesting.

551
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Why should I avoid it?

552
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,180
So,

553
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
you are interested in the demon.

554
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,180
Even though you don't like to study,

555
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
your skills

556
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,180
are very good.

557
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,180
My hobby

558
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,180
is not as good as yours.

559
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,180
I can't be a good student.

560
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
We are different.

561
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
We are different.

562
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,180
We are different.

563
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Don't bother me.

564
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
Ling Xiao.

565
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
Let me go.

566
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Okay.

567
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,180
You are interested in the demon.

568
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,180
I have a lot to tell you.

569
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
The cameraman wrote it very well.

570
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Let me go.

571
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Madam Liu.

572
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
What are you laughing at?

573
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,180
I want to beat you to death.

574
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
You.

575
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180
Are you scared?

576
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,180
Don't you think it's too much to bully Xiao Si?

577
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
I know what I'm doing.

578
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Who is the one who is trying to

579
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,180
entangle me?

580
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,180
I know what I'm doing.

581
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,180
I'm not a talent.

582
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,180
I did it.

583
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,180
Get out.

584
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,180
Xiao Meng, get out.

585
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,180
I didn't hide.

586
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,180
You will be punished.

587
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,180
Forget it.

588
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,180
The demon is coming.

589
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
It seems that tonight

590
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,180
it will be thunder.

591
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,180
It's coming.

592
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
How can you keep sooner?

593
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,180
You half-man and half-demon.

594
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,180
why are you doing evil deeds?

595
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,180
why a member of the demon group do you have the right to lead?

596
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Yes.

597
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,180
He may be right.

598
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,180
Who are you?

599
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,180
I am a dragon king.

600
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
Come on.

601
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,180
Let me out.

602
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,180
Let me out.

603
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Stop.

604
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
Don't go.

605
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
I want to be with you.

606
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
Let me out.

607
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,180
Let me out.

608
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,180
Let me out.

609
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Let me out.

610
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
I want to be with you.

611
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,180
Let me out.

612
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Let me out.

613
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
Let me out.

614
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Let me out.

615
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
Let me out.

616
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,180
Let me out.

617
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
You are being arrested.

618
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,180
You escaped from the prison.

619
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,180
You are being arrested.

620
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,180
You are the one who is being arrested.

621
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,180
You are the one who is being arrested.

622
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,180
You are so fast.

623
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
I helped the second uncle.

624
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,780
I helped the first generation of Second Aunt build it.

625
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,860
I know some tricks.

626
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,460
I know you hate that little cat.

627
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,940
If you can help me get out,

628
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,500
I can help you with this.

629
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,860
You help me?

630
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,860
Isn't it that half-human half-monster girl?

631
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,020
The last time she escaped,

632
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,780
she caught me.

633
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I have the same hatred with her.

634
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,500
I see.

635
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,780
I do have a little impression of this.

636
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,220
I heard about it.

637
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,740
Although you were sent to the Demon's Prison,

638
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,180
you are still the elder of the Hui Sect.

639
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,020
You have good ears.

640
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,180
The elder's body is thick and thick.

641
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,940
He does things in a variety of ways.

642
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,340
But I'm different.

643
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,220
I don't have to worry about her.

644
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,900
So, do you want to cooperate?

645
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,820
The Demon's Prison is strict.

646
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,180
I'm afraid it won't be punished.

647
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,700
I haven't finished yet.

648
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,620
Fortunately, tonight,

649
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,500
the second aunt of the Demon's will use the thunder to break the evil.

650
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,460
At that time,

651
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,540
we need to tear the barrier into small cracks

652
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,980
to let the thunder in.

653
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,860
And I can use the power of the sky to make the demon stronger.

654
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,260
Then I can break the barrier

655
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,540
and let you leave with this opportunity.

656
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,820
I was imprisoned for a hundred years.

657
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,260
I escaped several times and was caught.

658
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,340
I have to pay for it.

659
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,980
It's a deal.

660
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,300
I did it on my own.

661
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,740
Now the case is in Xuanjian Temple.

662
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,140
Your Majesty.

663
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,860
Your Majesty.

664
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,820
The former Minister of Xuanjian Temple, Xu Luan,

665
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,140
is not going to be able to do it soon.

666
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,460
I'm very worried.

667
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,180
I will advise you to take this paper back.

668
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,740
In comparison,

669
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,740
the current Meizhu Yu,

670
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,420
whether it's from the West suburb case,

671
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,660
or from the time after he joined Xuanjian Temple,

672
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,700
he can see it.

673
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,460
Your Majesty.

674
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,540
This paper belongs to Xuanjian Temple.

675
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,940
In that case,

676
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,020
it's better to return it.

677
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,140
Xuanjian Temple is just a private matter.

678
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,100
Do you think

679
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,900
it's really possible to take it?

680
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,580
I think this person is upright and strict.

681
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,340
He doesn't seek credit.

682
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,580
He is a person to be entrusted.

683
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Yi's Mansion

684
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,900
It has been a long time

685
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:41,660
since I saw such an她まあ

686
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,540
Your Majesty is joking?

687
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,780
I was talking casually to you.

688
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,780
You're right.

689
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,420
The past Xuan case

690
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,740
may also be related to the case of today.

691
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,100
If the Heaven Fire 18 years ago really happened,

692
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,140
then we should face it.

693
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,700
If we just avoid it like Xu Luan,

694
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,220
then how can we solve this matter

695
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,180
and keep the world peaceful?

696
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,580
So Your Majesty also has this idea.

697
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:19,500
I just keep making up my mind.

698
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,980
I hesitate to make up my mind.

699
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,460
It's all thanks to Your Majesty's quick-wittedness.

700
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,740
Actually, I also want to know

701
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,980
if there are really demons in Chang'an City.

702
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,820
Is it true that

703
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,740
there is another world we don't know?

704
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,880
God

705
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,900
Add an extra photoshoot post.

706
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
You
