1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit of a

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,320
little bit of a

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
little bit of a

6
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
little bit of a

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
little bit of a

8
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
little bit of a

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
little bit of a

10
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,320
little bit of a

11
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,320
little bit of a

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
little bit of a

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
little bit of a

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
little bit of a

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
little bit of a

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
little bit of a

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
little bit of a

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
little bit of a

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
little bit of a

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
little bit of a

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
little bit of a

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
little bit of a

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
little bit of a

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
little bit the

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
product it's

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,320
called

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,320
cam Ort troubled

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Maidong, help me!

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Vici Lamant, sing loudly.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Maidong, come back!

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Boss, the protection array is ready.

33
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
The barrier has been opened. Get ready.

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
It's time.

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
The barrier has been opened. Get ready.

36
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
You are Xuan Hui?

37
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Yes, I am.

38
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
What?

39
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
The barrier has been opened. Get ready.

40
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
The most important thing in the human mind is

41
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
to destroy the barrier.

42
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
The barrier has been opened. Get ready.

43
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Second,

44
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
although the people were badly hurt

45
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
after three days of fire,

46
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
the survivors of the barrier were not even half of them.

47
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
The ancient temple was checked and the body was not found,

48
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
but the body was not found.

49
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Third,

50
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
the gate was quiet.

51
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Only a few people

52
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
were able to see the ghost shadow.

53
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
They dared not to say their names

54
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
when they asked again.

55
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
They then turned their heads and denied the truth.

56
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,240
They were all

57
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,320
the same.

58
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
They were all different.

59
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
They were all different.

60
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
There is a legend about the ghost

61
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
in Chang'an.

62
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
It is indeed the ghost

63
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
who caused the chaos.

64
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Uncle!

65
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Uncle!

66
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Uncle!

67
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Uncle!

68
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Lady Liu actually likes monsters?

69
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
This is too...

70
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
It is so different.

71
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
But is there a monster in this world?

72
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
There should be.

73
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
I have seen it in the Liu family.

74
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
The White Snake Wolf is so wild. I don't want to see it.

75
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
It is...

76
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
It is...

77
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
It is a snake again.

78
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
This...

79
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
How is it?

80
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
It is okay.

81
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
The immortal spirit is in a hurry.

82
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
It will be fine after a few days.

83
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
The scene is a bit big today.

84
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
But Uncle always asks,

85
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
why is the spirit of the formation broken?

86
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Our Lord Shu is a book.

87
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Maybe he is afraid that

88
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
the thunder will light him up.

89
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Maybe.

90
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I think

91
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
the spirit of the formation is broken.

92
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
It is not a big deal.

93
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
After all,

94
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
it is the bone of the evil spirit.

95
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
It has a murderous aura.

96
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Ling Xiao,

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
is there anything wrong with it?

98
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
I have checked it just now.

99
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
There is no trace of murderous aura.

100
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
I am afraid that the cat's attack

101
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
has consumed a lot of energy today.

102
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
But it is over.

103
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
We can have a good rest for a few days.

104
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
I am afraid that we can't rest.

105
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Why?

106
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Boss, have you forgotten

107
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
what day it is tomorrow?

108
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
The day of the light.

109
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
I am not going.

110
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
You mean,

111
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
there is a demon in Chang'an?

112
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
The secret scrolls in the palace

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
are not sealed.

114
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
We need to be more careful.

115
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Let's see if there is any clue.

116
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
I will do it.

117
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Okay.

118
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
But, Shi He,

119
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
where are you going?

120
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Today is the day of the light.

121
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
All the officials of the six departments

122
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
are going to the imperial city to light up.

123
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
You are leaving me alone?

124
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I am tired.

125
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
You are so fresh.

126
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
You said you wouldn't help me in the rain.

127
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
You don't earn a penny.

128
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Why are you eating?

129
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
It's my fault.

130
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Besides,

131
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
I don't want to earn money.

132
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
I don't know how to do other things.

133
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
You...

134
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Pour me some water.

135
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
I am so thirsty.

136
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
I will drink some water.

137
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
I am so thirsty.

138
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Pour me some water.

139
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
You are still eating?

140
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Put it down.

141
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
You...

142
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Isn't this the family of Xiao Zhu Yu?

143
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
You are out of words.

144
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Wen Hua,

145
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
did you live with the master of Changxi Palace?

146
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
No.

147
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
What are you doing?

148
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I heard there is a master who can destroy evil and eliminate demons.

149
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Are you the master of Changxi Palace?

150
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Yes.

151
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
It's me.

152
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Second Lady.

153
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Second Lady.

154
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Today is the Lantern Festival.

155
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
You shouldn't be sleeping.

156
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
You should get up and wash yourself.

157
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Second Lady.

158
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
It's almost time.

159
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
You should get up and eat something.

160
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
The empress is here.

161
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Second Lady.

162
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Second Lady.

163
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Second Lady.

164
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Zhen Er.

165
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Where are you going?

166
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
You are in a hurry.

167
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
As the second daughter of the Fifth Duke,

168
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
you should be

169
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
polite and generous.

170
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Look at you.

171
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Wei Mian, you are too generous.

172
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Don't be angry.

173
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
It's good that you are here.

174
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
It's a rare occasion.

175
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
You should make a wish.

176
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Isn't it a good time to make a wish?

177
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
It's not the right time.

178
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
It's not the right time?

179
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
You are too young

180
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
and sick.

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
You won't wake up in three months.

182
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
If you don't make a wish

183
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
to the heaven,

184
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
you won't be able to

185
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
get well.

186
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
You are right.

187
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
What do you want?

188
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
I want to make a wish

189
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
for the world to be peaceful.

190
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
The world to be peaceful?

191
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Don't make a wish.

192
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
The world will be in chaos.

193
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Your Highness.

194
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Consort Mei.

195
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I, Mei Zhu Yu, greet Your Highness.

196
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Consort Mei.

197
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
I'm here to see you.

198
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I heard that you

199
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
have solved the case of the two years of the year.

200
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
You really have made a great contribution to our family.

201
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
It's my duty.

202
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Minister Mei.

203
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Do you know

204
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
what day is the Lantern Festival?

205
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
The Lantern Festival is the day when people pray for their wishes.

206
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Don't worry, Your Highness.

207
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
I have already told Zhu Yu about it.

208
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Then, Zhu Yu,

209
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
do you have any wishes?

210
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
I have a wish.

211
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
The weather is good and the world is peaceful.

212
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
The world is peaceful.

213
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
The world is peaceful.

214
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
I'm very happy

215
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
to be in the world.

216
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I'm a gentleman.

217
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
A'Jie.

218
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
You are too

219
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
obvious.

220
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
The frost of the gods

221
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
is not usually defeated.

222
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
At the critical moment,

223
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
it should be respected.

224
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Especially,

225
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
you are the good age to find a wife.

226
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
You should be more sincere.

227
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Let the lantern

228
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
bring your wishes to the sky.

229
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
The god will

230
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
arrange a good

231
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
wife for you.

232
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
A good husband.

233
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
I hope the Buddhist teaching will be useful.

234
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
This...

235
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
I mean, I will be sincere.

236
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
This is so big.

237
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
This is also beautiful.

238
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
This is made of cloth.

239
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
This is made of paper.

240
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Just a lantern.

241
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
It's too hard.

242
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
To choose a beautiful lantern,

243
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
I thought the god

244
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
would be proud of the lantern.

245
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
It's just a young man's

246
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
naughty personality.

247
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
But the cat

248
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
is not a cat.

249
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
The cat is a cat.

250
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm just a cat.

251
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
But the cat is only

252
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
twenty years old.

253
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
I should ask myself why

254
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
I don't have such a new wife.

255
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
You said it's a young man's

256
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
new wife.

257
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
What are you doing

258
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
with the snake demon for hundreds of years?

259
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Do you think I'm willing?

260
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
At least I'm

261
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
the daughter of the family of the minister.

262
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
I have to pretend.

263
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Hello.

264
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Princess.

265
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Master.

266
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Aren't you going to do hairpin festival?

267
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm looking for the demons.

268
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
You said

269
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
you are looking for the demons?

270
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Today I saw

271
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,680
I just saw a shadow of a demon.

272
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Just in case,

273
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,920
I came out to look for it.

274
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,640
But it seems

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,320
it's not that suspicious.

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,200
Be careful, there's a demon!

277
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,840
I'm sorry, Miss Hu Zhu.

278
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,040
Are you okay?

279
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
I'm fine.

280
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,800
Then...

281
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,120
Then I'll continue to look for the demon.

282
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,520
Master Shao Jiang,

283
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,720
it's a rare occasion.

284
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,680
Let's light the lanterns together.

285
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,880
Master Shao Jiang,

286
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,240
let's light the lanterns together.

287
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,600
We've lit a lot of lanterns.

288
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,480
Let's go.

289
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,000
Mr. Mei,

290
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,960
can I have a word with you?

291
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,600
What's the matter, Lady Xian?

292
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Recently, I've heard people mention Mr. Mei.

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,840
They say he's a young and talented man.

294
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,280
Now that the Xuanjian Temple is back on the right track,

295
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,920
Mr. Mei is a great man.

296
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,760
Are you all talking about him?

297
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,080
Mr. Mei is a righteous man.

298
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,840
I have something to say to him.

299
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,320
Is there a secret you want to tell me?

300
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,760
No.

301
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,040
I just heard a lot about him.

302
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,600
I don't want to disappoint you.

303
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,680
I admire you a lot.

304
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,600
You may not know,

305
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,240
but my father is strict with his work.

306
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,480
If I don't invite him to my wedding,

307
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,960
I won't be able to meet other people.

308
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,600
Although you can't force your parents to be free,

309
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,000
it's not within the range of the Xuanjian Temple.

310
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,520
No.

311
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,320
Actually, my father is a good man.

312
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,640
He's good to both my parents and the younger generation.

313
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,080
My father is a good man.

314
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,200
He has many disciples.

315
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
He's good to their disciples.

316
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,120
I want to ask Mr. Mei

317
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,680
if he's willing to be my teacher

318
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,200
and be my wife.

319
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,040
The Xuanjian Temple is independent of the six ministries.

320
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,960
If it's related to the six officials,

321
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm afraid it's suspicious.

322
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,560
Besides,

323
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,320
the case of the Xuanjian Temple

324
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,800
is different from the other ones.

325
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
Then don't talk about anything else.

326
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,400
Just me.

327
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,040
What?

328
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,960
What did you say about Lady Xie?

329
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Mr. Mei is a good man.

330
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,280
I'm glad to meet you for the first time.

331
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,400
I want to ask if you

332
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
have any feelings for me.

333
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Thank you for your kindness.

334
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,360
I just don't have any feelings for you.

335
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,160
You hate me?

336
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
I just talked to Lady Xie for a few times.

337
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
Why do you say you hate me?

338
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,360
My family background

339
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,640
is a bit different.

340
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,040
Why are you so indifferent?

341
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,720
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,120
Mr. Mei, don't you want to make it clear?

343
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,360
I just think that if you really like me,

344
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,240
it has nothing to do with these external forces.

345
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,240
I'm not happy about Lady Xie.

346
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,000
Mr. Mei, don't misunderstand.

347
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,760
I've been taught by women since I was a child.

348
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,400
I won't bother you with the family affairs.

349
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,400
I don't want to be like you,

350
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
who are not disciplined at all.

351
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,000
It's okay if I'm not disciplined.

352
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,480
It's okay if I'm not proud.

353
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,200
Everyone has their own way of living.

354
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,160
The Fifth Lady also has her own way of life.

355
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,600
You don't like me.

356
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,720
Do you want to be a horseman?

357
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,960
I just don't agree with what Lady Xie said.

358
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,280
It seems that the rumors outside are not true.

359
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,160
Mr. Mei and Lady Qinghe are very close.

360
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,360
You were just born as a private ambassador.

361
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,560
Are you so happy to forget that there is no one in your heart?

362
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,760
If I let my father say something to you,

363
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,520
you...

364
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Lady Xie, talk to me.

365
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
Don't be angry.

366
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,560
Why are you here?

367
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
You are good at scheming.

368
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,040
You are laughing at me.

369
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Lady Xie, what's wrong with you?

370
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,760
Sister Xie is timid.

371
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,800
Please forgive her.

372
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,320
Don't scare her anymore.

373
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,880
I didn't.

374
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,640
It's just that she...

375
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,760
She praised Mr. Mei for

376
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,400
helping Mr. Xie.

377
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,160
She praised him for his bright future.

378
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,680
Mr. Xie is not a man of power.

379
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,800
He is better than those who are in the way.

380
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Mr. Mei,

381
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,760
would you like to enjoy the lanterns together?

382
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,600
Okay.

383
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,280
Okay.

384
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,800
Master Shuangjiang,

385
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,320
do you have any wishes?

386
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
Kill the demon and kill the devil.

387
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,040
Kill the demon and kill the devil.

388
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,120
How do you write it?

389
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,320
Kill the demon and kill the devil.

390
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,760
I don't know.

391
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,800
Don't you have any serious wishes?

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
Serious?

393
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,760
It's coming.

394
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,600
So?

395
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,040
What wish have you made?

396
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,000
Naturally marry your wife DJ Liu.

397
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,200
appearance crazy

398
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,240
You've set aside so many lanterns.

399
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:20,560
have

400
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,300
I'm not afraid to mix anything up with this Lu Man Man Qi Sleep Help me

401
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
I'm afraid of accidents.

402
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
So I put so many lamps.

403
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
There will be a lamp that can be seen by God.

404
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
I don't know if God can see me.

405
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
But your wife Liu

406
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
saw it.

407
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,300
I don't know what wish my wife Liu made.

408
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
Xiaosu.

409
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Sister Zhen.

410
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
What?

411
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Your wife Liu's.

412
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Just get used to it.

413
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Sister Zhen.

414
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
At least, your wife Liu put a lamp.

415
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm also thinking about it.

416
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Don't you put a lamp?

417
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
I'm not a child.

418
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
I believe this.

419
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
It doesn't matter if you believe it.

420
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Aunt Huang, this big head.

421
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
She put two lamps.

422
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
She said she wanted to get married.

423
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
I won't do it.

424
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Aunt Huang.

425
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
This thing.

426
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,300
You put a lamp to pray to God.

427
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
It's better to find a beauty to come quickly.

428
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
If you want to buy a lot of beauty products,

429
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
you can save more.

430
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
People in Chang'an don't say that

431
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
the lamp of God is the most beautiful.

432
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Do you want to make a wish?

433
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Okay.

434
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Sister Chen, you agreed to it in a single word?

435
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
I always advise you to light the lanterns.

436
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
You are always so obedient.

437
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
Make a wish.

438
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Since it was you who helped me to make this lantern,

439
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,300
I hope you can live a long life.

440
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
May you be healthy.

441
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
May you be happy.

442
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
May you be safe.

443
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
May you be successful.

444
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Wait.

445
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
You are writing a poem.

446
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Can you make a wish?

447
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
Write it well.

448
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I will write a poem.

449
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
I will write a poem.

450
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
I will write a poem.

451
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
I will write a poem.

452
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
I will write a poem.

453
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,300
I will write a poem.

454
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
I will write a poem.

455
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
I will write a poem.

456
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
I will write a poem.

457
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
I will write a poem.

458
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I will write a poem.

459
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
I will write a poem.

460
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
I will write a poem.

461
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
I will write a poem.

462
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
and then break our secret

463
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,100
our love would have disappeared

464
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
When time turns into dust

465
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,900
and we practice between so much

466
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,140
it does not matter now

467
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,000
our love will never retreat

468
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,300
until we laugh at last

469
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,060
Let the вот Então

470
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,060
May the world be harmonious

471
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,860
Larr stained the years with disruption

472
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
It's so weird.

473
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
Wait.

474
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,060
This is...

475
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
The Demon Tree.

476
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,060
There's a demon in the Sky Lantern.

477
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
I have a bad feeling.

478
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Wushu Goddess,

479
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,060
I have a bad feeling.

480
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Don't worry.

481
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,060
I'll go to the Heaven.

482
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
I'll go to the Heaven.

483
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,060
I'll go to the Heaven.

484
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,060
I'll go to the Heaven.

485
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
Wushu Goddess,

486
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,060
what are you talking about?

487
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
I said your Sky Lantern is very good.

488
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Of course.

489
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
How can I say I'm a master?

490
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
Then you do it again.

491
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
Okay.

492
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,060
In Chang'an City,

493
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,060
there's someone who can play such a great game.

494
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
I don't have one.

495
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
Yeah.

496
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
I've never seen such a big Sky Lantern.

497
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,060
I don't know whose Sky Lantern it is.

498
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
What's going on?

499
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
What's going on?

500
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
Run!

501
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
Run!

502
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Run!

503
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
Run!

504
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
Run!

505
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
Run!

506
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,060
Run!

507
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Run!

508
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,060
Run!

509
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,060
Run!

510
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,060
Wushu Goddess.

511
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
It's a black fire.

512
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Why did she run out of the monster fish?

513
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,060
It's hit me.

514
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,060
Wait.

515
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
There are many people here.

516
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
If there's no one, it's too late.

517
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,060
I'll handle the Sky Lantern.

518
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,060
Okay.

519
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,060
There's a monster fish in the lantern.

520
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,060
The black snake is nearby.

521
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
I'll go find it.

522
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,060
Be careful.

523
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,060
Okay.

524
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Your Highness.

525
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
Luo, what's wrong?

526
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Arrange the guards to take everyone down.

527
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Don't hide in the cage.

528
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
Besides,

529
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
go to the Liao Temple on the same day.

530
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,060
Yes.

531
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Let's go.

532
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,060
Go.

533
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,060
Go.

534
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,060
Hurry up.

535
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
Hurry up.

536
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
This way.

537
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
This way.

538
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
Help!

539
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Hurry up.

540
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,060
What's going on?

541
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,060
How did it get such a big fire?

542
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,060
Did you see the lantern?

543
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,060
Who put it there?

544
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,060
It's easy to get caught.

545
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,060
It's too dangerous.

546
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,060
I'll go to the Heaven.

547
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,060
What's going on?

548
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,060
Your Highness.

549
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,060
The prison has informed the prison.

550
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
It will be here soon.

551
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,060
There are many people who will light the lantern tonight.

552
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,060
Tell them

553
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,060
to let the people in the family light the lantern.

554
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,060
There can't be any more chaos.

555
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,060
Besides,

556
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
the whole city

557
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,060
will be on fire.

558
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
No one

559
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,060
is allowed to light the lantern again.

560
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
Yes.

561
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
This way.

562
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,060
This way.

563
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,060
Lady Liu.

564
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,060
Lady Liu.

565
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
May I ask

566
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
if you have seen the Lady of the Qinghe River?

567
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,060
Have you seen the Lady of the Qinghe River?

568
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,060
The Lady of the Qinghe River is tall,

569
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,060
and has a sharp eye.

570
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,060
You should have come down earlier.

571
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,060
Lady of the Qinghe River.

572
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,060
May I ask if you have seen the Lady of the Qinghe River?

573
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,060
Yes.

574
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,060
She pushed me down

575
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,060
to the west side of the gate.

576
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
And then?

577
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
Where is she?

578
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
I don't know.

579
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
I turned around

580
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
and the fire blew.

581
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
Mei Zeng Shi.

582
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,060
What are you doing?

583
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,060
The Lady of the Qinghe River may still be up there.

584
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,060
Wu Er and I have known each other for many years.

585
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,060
She is not an ordinary lady.

586
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
With her skills,

587
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,060
she may be able to maintain her position.

588
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,060
And the fire will be on soon.

589
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,060
What's the use of you going up there?

590
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,060
As for Wu Er,

591
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,040
You may Curry

592
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
iss atychotesis,

593
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,060
and respecto to columns.

594
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,420
I know how to make 來

595
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,720
and っ

596
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,560
Generation 1.

597
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
dochibachi

598
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
come back

599
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,120
help!

600
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
its repentance

601
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
what else do you want to go

602
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
I've been waiting for you for six years.

603
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
I can't see the light in the monster prison.

604
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
I can't remember how long it's been.

605
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
How did you escape the monster prison?

606
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Why did you kill the cat?

607
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
You care about the cat.

608
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Don't talk to me about it.

609
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
So many years have passed.

610
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
You're still the same.

611
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
You don't even have a word for Han Xuan.

612
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
Han Xuan?

613
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
I'm not Han Xuan.

614
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
I don't have a word for him.

615
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Han Xuan?

616
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
I have.

617
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm not Han Xuan.

618
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
I can't beat you.

619
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Don't push me.

620
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
You're a snake.

621
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
You can't use your body.

622
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
This is not a personal torture.

623
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
This is at most the elder's teaching the younger generation.

624
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Nonsense.

625
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
There is no elder in the world.

626
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
They put the younger generation in the monster prison.

627
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
It's all clear.

628
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
You hurt the cat today.

629
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
If you insist on resisting,

630
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,560
I can kill you.

631
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
You really want to kill me?

632
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
For an outsider,

633
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
You want to kill me?

634
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
I'm not Han Xuan.

635
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I'm Han Xuan.

636
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
I'm not Han Xuan.

637
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
I'm Han Xuan.

638
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
I'm Han Xuan.

639
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
I'm Han Xuan.

640
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
I'm Han Xuan.

641
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm Han Xuan.

642
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
I'm Han Xuan.

643
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm Han Xuan.

644
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
I'm Han Xuan.

645
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm Han Xuan.

646
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
I'm Han Xuan.

647
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
I'm Han Xuan.

648
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
I'm Han Xuan.

649
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm Han Xuan.

650
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
I'm Han Xuan.

651
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm Han Xuan.

652
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
I'm Han Xuan.

653
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm Han Xuan.

654
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm Han Xuan.

655
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
I'm Han Xuan.

656
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
I'm Han Xuan.

657
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
I'm Han Xuan.

658
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I'm Han Xuan.

659
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
I'm Han Xuan.

660
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
I'm Han Xuan.

661
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
I'm Han Xuan.

662
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
I'm Han Xuan.

663
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
I'm Han Xuan.

664
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I'm Han Xuan.

665
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,560
I'm Han Xuan.

666
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
I'm Han Xuan.

667
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
I'm Han Xuan.

668
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
I'm Han Xuan.

669
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
I'm Han Xuan.

670
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
I'm Han Xuan.

671
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm Han Xuan.

672
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
I'm Han Xuan.

673
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
I'm Han Xuan.

674
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,560
I'm Han Xuan.

675
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
I'm Han Xuan.

676
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
Don't leave me, Anxin!

677
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Wuzhen! Wuzhen!

678
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Wuzhen!

679
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
Wuzhen!

680
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,560
It's them! Wuzhen!

681
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
I've given the medicine to the Minister of the Plum Village.

682
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
It can temporarily ease the pain.

683
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,560
But his injury will need to be kept for a while.

684
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
After all, the wall is already high.

685
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Sometimes the leg injury will be so serious when holding the string and falling.

686
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
I'm afraid it will leave a bad mark in the future.

687
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,560
Mingzhuang, I remember that my father collected a lot of precious herbs.

688
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Take the imperial physician to find them.

689
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
See what can be used.

690
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Wuzhen!

691
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Is that Xuan Hui tonight?

692
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
It's her.

693
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,560
She should be in the prison.

694
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Why did she run out again?

695
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
I'll deal with it in the palace.

696
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Go.

697
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Boss!

698
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
No!

699
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
No!

700
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
No!

701
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,560
The past is like a dream,

702
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,560
but the pain is only a moment.

703
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,560
I only want to be with you for the rest of my life,

704
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,560
but I can't save you.

705
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Look, the petals are falling.

706
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,560
What's wrong with falling in love?

707
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,560
The moonlight is bright and the breath is cool.

708
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,560
I hug you and you are silent.

709
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,560
Look, the petals are falling.

710
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,560
What's wrong with falling in love?

711
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,560
The moonlight is bright and the breath is cool.

712
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,560
What's wrong with falling in love?

713
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:40,560
You look back at the past.

714
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,560
You look back at the past.
