1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Um experiment

2
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,500
Ugh

3
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Episode 14

4
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,500
Master.

5
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,140
Junior Brother Shi.

6
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,500
The generals have told us

7
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,500
all about your sword skills in Xuanjian Temple.

8
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,540
After you left Chang'an,

9
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,340
you not only helped Xuanjian Temple to break the mystery,

10
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,180
but also captured the demon.

11
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,380
You even found the place of the demon.

12
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,060
You didn't forget it.

13
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,740
Thank you.

14
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,380
So there is a demon in Chang'an?

15
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,140
Yes.

16
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,860
But I only entered for a short time.

17
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,780
I haven't found the way to enter the demon's room.

18
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,380
It's not easy to do it alone.

19
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,900
At least we can prove

20
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,460
that the news we got is true.

21
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,700
But I heard that now there are many rumors in Chang'an.

22
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,780
The story of the demon and the demon fox.

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,180
The demon room is really a long story.

24
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,540
It seems that we have no choice

25
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,540
when we go down the mountain.

26
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
You are right.

27
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,580
We need to go down the mountain as soon as possible.

28
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,220
I have prepared a lot of demon-pulling array.

29
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:14,940
Yes.

30
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,460
We can't let the demon room continue to make up stories.

31
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,660
Then we go down the mountain to remove the demon.

32
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,260
Yes.

33
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,740
Everyone.

34
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,260
The demon and the demon fox are not related.

35
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,460
They are human.

36
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,580
Human?

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,980
What do you mean?

38
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,220
How can the demon be the cause of the trouble?

39
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,420
It's really a trouble.

40
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,220
What do you mean?

41
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,020
Someone has built a evil trick

42
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,180
to draw out many demons with the demon.

43
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,540
I'm looking for personal gain.

44
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,420
I happened to see it.

45
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,420
It's a big deal for you to go down the mountain.

46
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
I don't interfere.

47
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,980
But the demon fox is not the demon's work.

48
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,940
Evil trick?

49
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,940
Chang'an has no demon chaos.

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,980
Then...

51
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,020
Do we still go down the mountain?

52
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,980
It seems that it's not a hurry.

53
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,260
I'm just preparing more array

54
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,380
to make up stories.

55
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
What do you think?

56
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,980
Yes.

57
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,060
It's not a day's work to remove the demon.

58
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,380
We need to plan it slowly.

59
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,340
All right.

60
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,980
All right.

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,100
Let's put this thing aside.

62
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,980
When Junior Brother Shi comes back to the palace,

63
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,340
I have another thing

64
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,940
to discuss with you.

65
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,380
Chu Yu is my favorite disciple.

66
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,060
He is talented and has a profound skill.

67
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,460
Now he is better than us in understanding the demon world.

68
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,180
I want to appoint Junior Brother Shi

69
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,140
as the chief manager

70
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,860
and write that I will take charge of Changxi Palace.

71
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,180
He?

72
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,660
He is also qualified.

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,300
Don't talk nonsense.

74
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,260
Chief.

75
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,460
I am still a little bit qualified.

76
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,340
Please take back your order

77
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,340
and appoint someone else.

78
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,460
Junior Brother.

79
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,500
I can understand that you are worried.

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,460
I have already...

81
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,060
Chief.

82
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,220
Actually, I came back this time

83
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,780
to explain the demon fox thing.

84
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,060
And also

85
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,380
to take the punishment.

86
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,140
Take the punishment?

87
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,740
What punishment?

88
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,980
I have been taught by my master for many years.

89
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,660
If there is any need in Changxi Palace in the future,

90
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,420
I will definitely do my best.

91
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,940
I will not forget the mission I have been given for many years.

92
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,340
It's just that

93
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,140
I have been alone

94
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
and moved by love

95
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,420
these days in Chang'an.

96
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,060
Please help me

97
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,340
to go out of the mountain alone

98
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,740
and marry her

99
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,620
and live together for a hundred years.

100
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,620
I will.

101
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,500
Master.

102
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,220
If you still know

103
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,460
what I have done today,

104
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,220
will you be disappointed?

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,620
Young man.

106
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,740
Is this what you want?

107
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,420
What do you want her to do?

108
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,580
Yes.

109
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,460
What did you say?

110
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,420
You want to eat her?

111
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,300
I haven't eaten meat for a long time.

112
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,220
But

113
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,260
you caught it first.

114
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,020
It's yours.

115
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,620
Young man.

116
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,180
You are not old enough to be a gentleman.

117
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,540
Since you met me and her,

118
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,620
we are meant to be.

119
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,580
I will give you a tip today.

120
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,660
Demon fox is strong.

121
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
I will win the prize.

122
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,420
I will win the prize.

123
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,420
Look.

124
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,060
This is not a wild chicken.

125
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,900
This is a vicious

126
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,940
chicken-chicken.

127
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,540
You are quite bold.

128
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,020
You look like a good girl.

129
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,700
I am hungry.

130
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,420
You are hungry?

131
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,780
Why are you not full?

132
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,860
My parents are dead.

133
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,460
I live alone in the manor.

134
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,340
If you don't have parents,

135
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,300
are there no others in the manor?

136
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,340
Yes.

137
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,500
But...

138
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,100
But no one takes you as a family.

139
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,300
Yes.

140
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,660
If so,

141
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,780
why don't you follow me?

142
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,820
Think about it.

143
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,820
You are my apprentice.

144
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,780
I will cook chicken for you.

145
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,580
I am your apprentice.

146
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,900
What do you do?

147
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,340
You are so cautious.

148
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,060
Yes.

149
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,980
I am the Four Heavenly Masters of Changxi Palace.

150
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,220
What does Changxi Palace do?

151
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,100
Changxi Palace is a good place.

152
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,220
It can catch demons and kill evil spirits.

153
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,860
It is a good place to do good deeds.

154
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,900
Master.

155
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I am not a disciple.

156
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,460
Although I can catch demons and kill evil spirits,

157
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,540
I can't break the rules.

158
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,700
Master.

159
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,260
What are you eating?

160
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,780
Shi.

161
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,860
I was thinking that you went to practice swordplay.

162
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,260
You just came back at this time.

163
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,420
The chicken just hatched.

164
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,060
The fire is just right.

165
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,780
Come on.

166
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,100
Come on.

167
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,820
Shi, eat it.

168
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,460
What's wrong?

169
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,300
I am studying today.

170
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,140
There is blood in the book.

171
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,220
I need to take the opportunity to practice.

172
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,460
That's strange.

173
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,820
You are cute.

174
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,460
Why are you getting more and more boring?

175
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,700
I know you are a person with a clear mind.

176
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,820
You have the talent to practice.

177
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,660
But you are too obsessed with books.

178
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,980
How about this?

179
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,020
I will give you a lesson.

180
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,740
Tell me.

181
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,340
What is it?

182
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,620
The book says that

183
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,740
human and natural things are the same.

184
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,900
You need to be calm and calm.

185
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,820
You can get it only when you are not concerned.

186
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,380
Why do you practice?

187
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,620
Shi.

188
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,340
You don't even know why you practice.

189
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,620
So the way you practice

190
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,620
is just a game of chess.

191
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,140
People have their own ways.

192
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,700
Like my master.

193
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,020
I like this roasted chicken every day.

194
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,180
But it will bother me.

195
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,060
I can manage Changxi Palace.

196
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,820
It won't delay my killing demons and demons.

197
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,420
Right?

198
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,700
Then...

199
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,420
What do you think

200
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,300
I should do in the future?

201
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,740
You have to think about it.

202
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,380
Don't worry.

203
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,580
You need to practice your mind first.

204
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,060
The way you practice is natural.

205
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,420
It's done by the heart.

206
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,580
You can use your mind

207
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,740
to eat the chicken.

208
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,300
You can use your life to find it.

209
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,900
Eat it.

210
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
You are so creative.

211
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,060
I can name so many chickens.

212
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,140
Someone made this.

213
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,860
Have a taste.

214
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,820
Tastes good?

215
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,220
Thank you, Master.

216
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,460
Enjoy it.

217
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
I have lots of it here already.

218
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,780
I've never left Changxi Palace.

219
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,740
I was blinded by the prosperity of Chang'an.

220
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,420
It's also a human nature.

221
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,380
As long as you're willing to change it and accept it,

222
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,140
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

223
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,620
How to change a love

224
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,180
that is so strong and so strong?

225
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,660
I've been loyal to people.

226
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,260
Today,

227
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,140
if I still make the wrong choice,

228
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,300
I'll face the life and death decisions.

229
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,820
How can you believe

230
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,980
I won't avoid harm

231
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,220
and live for the sake of the world

232
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,580
and ignore it?

233
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,140
You've knelt here for days.

234
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,340
You still won't repent?

235
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,580
If that's the case,

236
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,140
even as the leader,

237
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,660
I can't protect you anymore.

238
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,220
Changxi Palace rules.

239
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,140
If I want to leave Changxi Palace,

240
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,340
I must attack Baiye Town

241
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,060
and be possessed by the White-leafed Godbird.

242
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,260
After that,

243
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,580
I'll hang out with Changxi Palace again.

244
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,820
Thank you, Leader.

245
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,540
The Black-leafed Godbird

246
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,780
He should be banished

247
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,500
from such a treacherous place.

248
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,380
Why did you cover for him?

249
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,660
He's my favorite disciple.

250
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,220
I tried to cultivate him.

251
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,300
But he's so biased now.

252
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,060
I'm the leader,

253
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,740
so I can only defend.

254
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,540
You've given him a chance.

255
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,340
Now he's confused by the girl outside.

256
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,460
He's so ungrateful.

257
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,460
If he's selfish,

258
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,860
he'll be in trouble.

259
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,260
Can you really do that?

260
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,660
Changxi Palace is always fair.

261
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,460
Now he's admitted his selfishness

262
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,300
and insisted on making contributions.

263
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,980
Who can stop him?

264
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060
But Senior Brother...

265
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,140
Yes.

266
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,660
If others think so,

267
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,940
they'll send him to Baiye Town immediately.

268
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,180
He even gave him a few days to reflect on himself.

269
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,780
But the rules are rules.

270
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,260
You really want to...

271
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,460
Don't worry.

272
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,020
Baiye Town won't kill him.

273
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,460
But he'll be punished.

274
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,820
I heard that Baiye Town is so painful.

275
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,140
It's like a thousand knives and a thousand thorns.

276
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,620
A disciple left the palace a hundred years ago.

277
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,380
After going through the town,

278
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,700
he suffered from pain for many years.

279
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,340
He couldn't bear it anymore

280
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
and ended up suicide.

281
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,500
Well...

282
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,460
When Junior Brother steps into this town tomorrow,

283
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,060
the White-Eye Bird will come to save him.

284
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,180
It's very spiritual.

285
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,660
Junior Brother Wu,

286
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,260
do you have anything else to ask?

287
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,820
No.

288
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,020
You're the last one to ask.

289
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,820
Well...

290
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,980
Let's go back.

291
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,500
Okay.

292
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,940
A few days later

293
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,980
The cat's going to marry someone!

294
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,500
The cat's going to marry someone!

295
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,780
Do you know that?

296
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,300
The cat's going to marry someone!

297
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,100
What's wrong?

298
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,860
Who?

299
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
I heard that the cat's going to marry a mortal.

300
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,940
A mortal?

301
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,700
Even the cat's going to marry someone?

302
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,700
Even the cat's going to marry someone?

303
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,260
When will you marry me?

304
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,900
How dare you!

305
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,420
How dare you!

306
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,580
It's said that

307
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,940
the cat's going to marry someone in the mortal world.

308
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,380
Is it true?

309
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,620
I'm wondering

310
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,860
how you got so much news

311
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,380
from the mortal world

312
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,940
when you stay in the demon world all day long.

313
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,580
There's no such thing as a wall of mud in the world.

314
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,700
Anyway, I heard that

315
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,140
the cat's only answer is

316
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
true or false.

317
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,860
What's the difference between true and false?

318
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,580
How does the cat's going to marry someone?

319
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,340
The cat's going to marry someone

320
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,100
is related to the demon world.

321
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,060
Since ancient times,

322
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,020
the cat's never married a mortal.

323
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,820
Yes.

324
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,940
The cat's going to marry someone is too ridiculous.

325
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,460
It's impossible.

326
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,860
Then, tell me

327
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,620
what's wrong with this?

328
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,340
Which of the demons' laws says

329
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,340
the cat's going to marry someone?

330
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,020
Since the beginning of the demon world,

331
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,940
it's never happened.

332
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,580
I can't do anything

333
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,900
that others can't do.

334
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,820
My lord,

335
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,740
since you took over the cat's world,

336
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,460
you've always been in contact with others.

337
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,100
You always want to make peace with others.

338
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,740
But how can you always have good results?

339
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,140
What the elder of the Jiemeng Sect said

340
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,660
seems to be a grudge against the cat's world.

341
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,940
Yes.

342
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,740
I was wrong.

343
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,980
Since you have no objection,

344
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
this matter...

345
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,820
My lord.

346
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,540
But I have a objection.

347
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Don't you care about it?

348
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,820
My lord Shu,

349
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,620
I made the decision.

350
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,620
I was wrong.

351
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,300
My fate is not in the hands of others.

352
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,740
It's in the hands of others.

353
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,100
Should you set your own course?

354
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
The cat's world

355
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,900
What about the demon world after marriage?

356
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,580
Don't worry.

357
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,860
The demon world can't be discussed with others.

358
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,100
It's a rule.

359
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,220
As always.

360
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,380
I'm willing to experience

361
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,460
it once.

362
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,100
Zheng'er.

363
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,540
Zheng'er, is that you?

364
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Zheng'er.

365
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,500
I heard it.

366
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,660
It's not me.

367
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,380
You saw a ghost this morning.

368
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,660
You know it's morning.

369
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,300
You didn't sleep well this morning.

370
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,980
You read books here.

371
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,340
And you read this kind of cloth.

372
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,540
You read well.

373
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,980
I know

374
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,220
that you have to read more in life.

375
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,060
Hey.

376
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,860
Why are you sighing?

377
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,620
What does Meizhu Yu mean?

378
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,340
He said he would go back to Quzhou.

379
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,780
But why hasn't he come back yet?

380
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,620
Is he trying to trick you?

381
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,540
He's just pretending to be suspicious.

382
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,020
He doesn't plan to come back.

383
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,980
He just ran away.

384
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,300
Pretending to be suspicious?

385
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,700
That's your trick.

386
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,020
Me?

387
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,620
Have you forgotten

388
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,840
how you dealt with those

389
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,660
who were asking for marriage?

390
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Zheng'er.

391
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,100
It's not that I don't trust you.

392
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
It's just that...

393
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,100
Master Douyun.

394
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,380
He's done many sins.

395
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,780
He'll be punished.

396
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,740
He'll be struck by lightning.

397
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Father.

398
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,780
You can't be afraid of me.

399
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,980
He'll come back.

400
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,100
He said he'll be back in ten days.

401
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,580
It's been twelve days now.

402
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,180
Yeah.

403
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,180
It's been twelve days.

404
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
It's been twelve days.

405
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,180
It's been twelve days.

406
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,180
It's been twelve days.

407
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180
It's been twelve days.

408
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,180
It's been twelve days.

409
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
It's been twelve days.

410
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,180
It's been twelve days.

411
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,180
It's been twelve days.

412
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
It's been twelve days.

413
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
It's been twelve days.

414
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
It's been twelve days.

415
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,180
It's been twelve days.

416
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
It's been twelve days.

417
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
It's been twelve days.

418
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Brother.

419
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Brother.

420
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,060
Brother.

421
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,060
It's my fault.

422
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,060
I was locked up.

423
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
That's why I was released.

424
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
But I heard about you

425
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,060
after I released you.

426
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
I was so anxious.

427
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
I heard that you didn't eat

428
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
for days.

429
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
So I stole some steamed buns.

430
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Please eat some.

431
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
No.

432
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Brother.

433
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
Are you really going to leave the palace?

434
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,940
I broke the ring.

435
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
I have to make a choice.

436
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Besides,

437
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
she's still waiting for me.

438
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
What's so good about that fox?

439
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
Is she really worth your effort?

440
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
She's worth it.

441
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
She's worth it.

442
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
I don't understand.

443
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,820
I didn't understand either.

444
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
I thought

445
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,820
the thought of death

446
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
was just to find out the truth

447
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,820
and kill the demon.

448
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,820
For eighteen years,

449
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,820
this thought

450
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,820
was always in my heart.

451
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Besides this obsession,

452
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
I saw the world

453
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,700
without any joy or expectation.

454
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
I thought I would spend my life

455
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
like this

456
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
until I met her.

457
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Do you know

458
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
the first time I saw her was?

459
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
That day,

460
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
I went back to Chang'an.

461
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
She looked so sad

462
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
but I couldn't forget her.

463
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
Go!

464
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Go!

465
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
Go!

466
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
Later,

467
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
she was entangled with me

468
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
and was alone.

469
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
I thought

470
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
the earth

471
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
was destined to be.

472
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,700
Junior Brother,

473
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
all these years,

474
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,700
I always feel

475
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
we look so close

476
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
but we are not.

477
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,580
I feel you look so sad

478
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,580
and you are a demon.

479
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,580
I...

480
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
I didn't expect

481
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,580
you would have such a heavy heart.

482
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,580
I don't dare to say that

483
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
before I see the truth.

484
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
I saw her in the world

485
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
and I thought

486
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,580
the world was so good.

487
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Besides thinking about me,

488
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
I finally

489
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
have a longing for the future.

490
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
So I think

491
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
she deserves my help.

492
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
I can't let the one I love

493
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
stay in Chang'an alone

494
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
in danger.

495
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
I have to go back and protect her.

496
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
I can't let the thing that happened 18 years ago

497
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,460
happen again.

498
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,460
I'm sorry.

501
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
I'm sorry.

502
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,460
I'm sorry.

503
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
I'm sorry.

504
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,460
I'm sorry.

508
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,460
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,460
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
I'm sorry.

511
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,460
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
I'm sorry.

513
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
I'm sorry.

514
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
I'm sorry.

515
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,460
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
I'm sorry.

517
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,460
I'm sorry.

518
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,460
I'm sorry.

519
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
I'm sorry.

520
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
I'm sorry.

521
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
I'm sorry.

522
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
I'm sorry.

523
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
I'm sorry.

524
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
I'm sorry.

525
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
I'm sorry.

526
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
I'm sorry.

527
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,460
I'm sorry.

528
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
I'm sorry.

529
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
Brother.

530
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,580
Let's continue the job here.

531
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,220
You can give orders now.

532
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,540
If Changxi Palace disciples want to cross the palace gate

533
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,540
and enter theuttering vanilla,

534
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,340
they can leave by themselves.

535
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,340
after the birds wear the clothes.

536
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
Brother Chi Chi.

537
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,340
What the hell is this formation?

538
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,340
Zhou Yu, are you sure you can handle it?

539
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,340
It's just a flesh wound. It's nothing.

540
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,340
Senior Brother, this is too much.

541
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,340
These birds...

542
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,340
How can they just pass by?

543
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Once the formation is opened, nothing can be opened.

544
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,340
Senior Brother!

545
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Senior Brother!

546
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
Senior Brother!

547
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Senior Brother!

548
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,340
It's finally over.

549
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
Senior Brother!

550
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
Senior Brother!

551
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

552
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,340
What's going on?

553
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
I've never heard of the second punishment.

554
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,340
What's wrong?

555
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Shen Yan, Bai Ye is a divine bird.

556
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
How can a divine bird make a mistake?

557
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
It's so strange.

558
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,340
It must be the God Formation.

559
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,340
Why is Senior Brother so panic?

560
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Senior Brother!

561
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,340
Wake up!

562
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,340
We can't do it again.

563
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Senior Brother can't stand it.

564
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,340
Yeah, let's do it again.

565
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
There's no third time.

566
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Understand the status lines?

567
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Similarizati

568
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,340
Xiao Shi Tian.

569
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,140
Benxing Shrine.

570
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,340
Round taking place.

571
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:32,800
Lin tightens her arms and

572
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:44,940
Thus instills constant fear within her boyfriend

573
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,160
Boss,are you sure you will go to Rank 9 today?

574
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,480
Since Uncle is on leave,

575
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,120
you have to manage Ruyi Pavilion

576
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,000
and help him with the book.

577
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,400
It must be hard for you.

578
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,680
As the boss,

579
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,880
I feel sorry for you.

580
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,640
It's too noisy at home.

581
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,520
I can't stay here.

582
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,640
Are you still worried about

583
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,960
Mr. Mei's death?

584
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,600
Why hasn't he come back yet?

585
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,960
Will something happen?

586
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,160
With Mr. Mei's ability,

587
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,000
nothing can happen.

588
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,800
But if

589
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
he doesn't want to come back in time,

590
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,720
boss,

591
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,640
are you really so calm?

592
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,400
Otherwise, what can I do?

593
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,680
Crying and making trouble?

594
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,520
It seems that our cat palace

595
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,480
is really sad.

596
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,040
Come on, come on.

597
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,160
Come on, come on.

598
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,040
Buy some green grass.

599
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,840
Buy some green grass.

600
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,080
Buy some green grass.

601
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
Buy some green grass.

602
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Buy some green grass.

603
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,520
It's been so many days.

604
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Mr. Mei hasn't come back yet.

605
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,800
In my opinion,

606
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,320
it's obvious.

607
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,720
He must have been

608
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,840
engaged.

609
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,640
That's right.

610
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,440
We've been here before.

611
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,640
We know it.

612
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,720
That's right.

613
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,320
Right?

614
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Come on, come on.

615
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Come on, come on.

616
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,480
The gambling house

617
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,960
is starting to gamble.

618
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
Let's see if Mr. Mei can come back and get married.

619
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,520
Let's make a bet.

620
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,360
If there's no man, we'll make money.

621
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,720
It's not a loss to think like that.

622
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,120
Boss.

623
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,920
Come on.

624
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Let's bet on a bet.

625
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Here comes a young lady.

626
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Come on.

627
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,520
Don't be depressed.

628
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,920
Mr. Mei hasn't come back for more than ten days.

629
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,520
He must have been engaged.

630
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,920
He must have been engaged.

631
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
He must have been engaged.

632
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
Let's bet on this.

633
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Come on.

634
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
That's right.

635
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,120
Bet on this.

636
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
It'll definitely work.

637
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,120
What?

638
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,720
Do you hope

639
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,120
Mr. Mei will come back?

640
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,120
I hope he'll come back earlier.

641
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Come back soon.

642
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,920
He won't come back.

643
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
That's right.

644
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
He's right.

645
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
That's right.

646
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Come on.

647
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Come on.

648
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,320
Brother.

649
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Brother.

650
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Brother.

651
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Brother.

652
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Wake up.

653
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
This

654
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,920
is too...

655
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,720
It's really too bad.

656
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,920
I've only heard about it before.

657
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,720
It's the first time I've seen these gods.

658
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Brother.

659
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
The new god.

660
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
He's still alive.

661
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
How is that possible?

662
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
From now on,

663
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
from now on,

664
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
you're no longer a member of Changxi Palace.

665
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,720
Thank you, brothers.

666
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,720
For taking care of me for so many years.

667
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,120
I hope you all

668
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,720
rest in peace

669
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,720
and live a long life.

670
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Zhu Yun.

671
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
After this,

672
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,320
why don't you rest in Changxi Palace for a few days?

673
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
No.

674
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,720
Since you're not from Changxi Palace,

675
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,120
you can't stay and rest.

676
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
No need.

677
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,920
I have an appointment in Chang'an with someone.

678
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
I have to go back early.

679
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
No need to rest.

680
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Fine.

681
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,920
But before I leave,

682
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,920
there's one more difficult thing.

683
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Changxi Sword

684
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
must be kept.

685
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Yes.

686
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,920
Master left this to you.

687
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,920
But what he left for you

688
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,920
is a disciple of Changxi Palace.

689
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
Not a person who abandoned the sect

690
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,520
for the sake of the world.

691
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Yes.

692
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Changxi Sword is the master of Changxi Palace.

693
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,920
It must be kept.

694
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Is my sword ready?

695
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
Master.

696
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,320
I still have homework to do today.

697
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,920
I can't let you do it for nothing.

698
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,920
Of course, I have a good thing for you.

699
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Okay.

700
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,920
What good thing?

701
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,920
I'll use the magic weapon to change your chicken.

702
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Master.

703
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,320
This sword is your personal item.

704
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,520
You should take it.

705
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
How can you give it to me?

706
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,920
You're old.

707
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
You should arrange the funeral.

708
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Master.

709
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
I'm kidding.

710
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Since the battle with the monster three months ago,

711
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
your internal injury hasn't fully healed yet.

712
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,920
I think I'm old.

713
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,920
This Changxi Sword is for you.

714
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,320
It's also a burden.

715
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,720
I'll leave the responsibility of removing the monster to you.

716
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Master.

717
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,120
Even if you want to entrust Changxi Sword to me,

718
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
it's not my turn.

719
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,320
You're the successor of the sect.

720
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,720
The position of the sect has nothing to do with Changxi Sword.

721
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,520
It's just a sword.

722
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,520
It's for removing the monster.

723
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Besides,

724
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,320
your senior brother is diligent in cultivation and righteous.

725
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,520
He won't mind.

726
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,320
The responsibility of the angel

727
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
shouldn't be trapped by a sword.

728
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,520
I hope you can take it to see the world

729
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,520
and experience the friendship and the world.

730
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Take it.

731
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Go and try it.

732
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,520
He hasn't recognized the new owner yet.

733
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,120
You should communicate with him with your heart.

734
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:55,120
The starry sky is bright and the night is long

735
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:01,120
The snow is soft and the frost is falling

736
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,120
When the years pass by,

737
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,120
what should I do?

738
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Will it be love or obsession?

739
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,120
You and I are in the middle of the song

740
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,120
I won't go back even if I die

741
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,120
I'll be the fire that burns the world

742
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,120
When the world is cold

743
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,120
I'll be the light that shines on the world

744
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Look at me, listening to the music

745
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
I know

746
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,120
you can't bear to lose the faith of my master in Changxi Sword.

747
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,120
But this is Changxi Sword.

748
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,120
You still have to take the big picture.

749
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:19,120
The starry sky is bright and the night is long

750
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,120
The snow is soft and the frost is falling

751
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,120
When the years pass by,

752
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
what should I do?

753
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,120
Will it be love or obsession?

754
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,120
You and I are in the middle of the song

755
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,120
The past is sad and the past is sad

756
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:52,120
The most painful moment is the moment of decision

757
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,120
I only want to be with you in my life

758
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,120
But I can't

759
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Look at the petals falling

760
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:16,120
But what's wrong with falling in love?

761
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,120
The moonlight shines on the bright future

762
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:27,120
I hug you and you are silent

763
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:33,120
But the petals are falling

764
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:39,120
But what's wrong with falling in love?

765
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,120
The moonlight shines on the bright future

766
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:55,120
How to see you again?

767
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,120
I always want to have you

768
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Thanks for watching!
