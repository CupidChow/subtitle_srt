1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
little bit of a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
little bit of a

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
little bit of a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
little bit of a

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit of a

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
little bit of a

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit of a

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
little bit of a

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of a

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
little bit of a

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of a

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
little bit of a

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
little bit of a

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit of a

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
little bit of a

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
little bit of a

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
little bit of a

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
little bit of a

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
little bit of a

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
little bit of a

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
little bit of a

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
little bit of a

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
little bit of a

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
little bit of a

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
little bit a

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is a place for fireworks.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's hard to find happiness and happiness.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's more useful for the dreamer.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Here they are.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't understand why I have to help.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The dreamer is greedy.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He treats the prank as a hobby.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The more he has a crush on the dreamer, the more he likes it.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now he relies on the essence of the dream to grow bigger.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His taste is getting more and more delicate.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He is a very good dreamer.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He is a very good dreamer.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He is a very good dreamer.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The more he has a crush on the dream to grow bigger.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
His taste is getting more and more delicate.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I think only your dream can satisfy him.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
My dream?

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why?

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Every time you are a person, I am half of you.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are different.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You are the first wind in Chang'an.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The first hidden hidden.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The first limitless scenery.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The first big medicine for the people.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Me?

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Of course.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The bridge you walked is more than the road I walked.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The people you like are more than the hair I had.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You have been with me for eight lifetimes.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Your desire, your secret, your dream.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can't imagine how wonderful it is.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If the monster is normal, he won't let you go.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Come on.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sir, if you want to take my bag, just say it.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
After all, I am...

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's start.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
To be honest, I feel very stressed when you two stare at me like this.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't sleep at all.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can't sleep?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You have to sleep if you can't sleep.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's really...

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Isn't that Ruyi Tower?

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Is the red-haired lady in danger?

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Who is so rude to save me?

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You...

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You look like this.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So cute.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What do you want?

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You should know that I am a cat demon in my dream.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Cats love fish.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Especially you, a cat demon who is fat all day.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I am just a little character.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I am just curious.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Besides, even if you eat me, you won't have much cultivation.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then I will only eat half of it.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I will only let you die.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can only wait on the ground.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't wander around anymore.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't scare me, okay?

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can do nothing else.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But I can't be free.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I am a demon for now.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I am just wandering in the clouds.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can experience their various desires.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
In their dreams, I can relieve their depression and loneliness.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I can give them a little bit of freedom.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Isn't that a good thing?

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Isn't that good?

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why are you targeting me?

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Freedom in dreams?

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You have to clean up after you wake up.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's not easy.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let them be in their dreams all the time.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They can't wake up.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think you are dreaming.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You are disturbing people's hearts with your dreams.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You are causing chaos in the human world.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
As a cat, I have to take you back to the demon world to accept your punishment.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I am not good.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What can you do to me?

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Didn't you notice?

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are already in your dreams.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is not Ling Xiao's dream.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have seen his dream.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's so boring.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's not worth seeing.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You are in my dream now.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Your dream?

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The dream of dreaming about demons and dreams.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The dream of embracing everything and absorbing everything.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I am in charge of the dream.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I am in charge of the dream.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You are outside.

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is a dream.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can touch Ling Xiao's flowery body.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How could this dream be broken?

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can't.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I can't.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't.

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can't.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can't.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I can't.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can't.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I can't.

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What's going on?

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Where is the lady of the lake?

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What are you doing?

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're so nervous.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm fine.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've been waiting for you.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So I'm just resting here.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Where is your waist?

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's gone.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Gone?

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But it's gone well.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What do you mean?

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I didn't want to catch it.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But I was just passing by.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's go.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Shu Qi is still here.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Where are we going?

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
To find the demon.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Demon?

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Boss, you should wake up.

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've brought you back to the demon world.

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can't leave without my permission.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why did you catch me?

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You broke into someone else's dream without permission.

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's not wrong.

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I broke into someone else's dream

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and made them feel no pressure.

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I did it on purpose.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I made up for my regret and achieved my dream.

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Shouldn't they be happy?

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Whether they're happy or not

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is their business.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How can you decide?

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why did you do that?

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why?

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because it's fun.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't know.

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Dreams are delicious.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Some dreams are sweet.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Like the honey.

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Golden honeycomb.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Flowery house.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Full of children.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And the other dreams are sour.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Anger.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Greed.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Greed.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And...

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And...

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Bitter and sad.

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Like those who have secrets

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but can't tell the truth.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
For fun,

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
you make the mortal life chaotic.

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's ridiculous.

214
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm helping them.

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Humans are the most hypocritical.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They think in their hearts.

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But they don't admit it.

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm doing this

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
to make them enjoy their real desires.

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
To do what they want to do

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but they don't dare to do it.

223
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Real desires?

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I just entered your dream.

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I saw you want to be a boxing girl.

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You want to be with that handsome man.

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Just say it.

228
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why are you hitting me?

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Put me down.

230
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Put me down.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I mean,

232
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
have you been with someone for a long time?

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're so boring.

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You think in your heart.

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why don't you admit it?

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You want to enter my dream again?

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No, no, no.

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't dare.

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I want to hear

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
what my boss's dream is.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You want to hear?

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Next time I...

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll tell you.

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You like to spy on others' privacy.

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You're always on the edge of others' lives.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's because you don't read much.

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
From tomorrow,

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
you'll go to the witch's house to study.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Witch's house?

251
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't tell me

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the witch of the witch's house

253
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
still has to study.

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Not only people study.

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't want to.

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'd rather go to the witch's house.

257
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's not up to you.

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Come back.

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't want to.

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't want to study.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I really don't want to study.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So,

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
you let this dream demon go on purpose?

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's just a little demon.

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It won't be a big deal if we catch it.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's better to let it go and catch a big fish.

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So,

268
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
did you catch it?

269
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Shu Qi

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
is really here.

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The witch's house

272
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
No wonder I can't find the witch's house.

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Because the witch's house

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
is not hidden in a place in Chang'an.

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But the whole Chang'an

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
is a witch's house.

277
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The witch's house is

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
another Chang'an.

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't let the witch's house

280
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
go to waste.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I live in the Changming Palace.

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't let it go to waste.

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Who wants me?

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where is this?

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why am I here?

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The witch's house

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
While the witch's house is in chaos,

288
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Changxi Palace is about to go down.

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What's wrong?

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Nothing.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What's wrong?

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Brother,

293
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
you look scary.

294
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Actually,

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
it's nothing.

296
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I just want to ask

297
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
what should we do next?

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Although we know where the witch's house is,

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
we don't know how to get in.

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But since the two witches

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
disappeared near the shabby temple,

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
there must be something to prove.

303
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You mean

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
we should find the shabby temple

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and find a way?

306
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The witch's house is not clear.

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There are only two of us.

308
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We should wait and see.

309
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes.

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes.

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're right.

312
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
One day,

313
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I will clear this place

314
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
of chaos.

315
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Chang'an

316
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
will be a more clear Chang'an.

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What happened today

318
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
will not happen again.

319
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Chang'an

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
How is it?

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I feel like I just fell asleep.

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Be quiet.

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I got it.

324
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Got it.

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
My boss

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
has already dreamt of the witch's house.

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It might be a little bit exciting here.

328
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's okay now.

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You go back first.

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Master Shuang Jiang.

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
When will you be back in Chang'an?

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I just arrived.

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Just you?

334
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
How about

335
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
finding two ladies

336
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
to sing with you?

337
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No, no need.

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I have something

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
to tell you.

340
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You helped me before.

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You helped me before.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I should have done it.

343
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But I'm a cultivator.

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Although I'm not that good at cultivating,

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm just doing it for fun.

346
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
There are things I shouldn't have done.

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But now,

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
for you,

349
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I made a lot of mistakes.

350
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Wait.

351
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You're so kind.

352
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You're not going to marry me, are you?

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I...

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Then you don't have to repay me.

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You cultivate yourself,

356
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and I earn money.

357
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We're even.

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We're even.

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's not what I meant.

360
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Then what do you mean?

361
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Actually,

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I know who you are.

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So,

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I want to persuade you to turn back.

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I can make you a bet.

366
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A bet?

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm a businesswoman.

368
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You want to get me?

369
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Who do you think I am?

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm just making money.

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Did I see it wrong?

372
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I shouldn't have.

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're finally back.

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What's wrong?

375
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You're asking me?

376
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I've been out for a long time.

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm stuck in this heat.

378
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
How can I not be scolded by the county?

379
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Did my wife scold you?

380
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Not really.

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It was the lady next to me.

382
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
She was so harsh.

383
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll go see my wife.

384
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Old Jun!

385
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Old Jun!

386
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I haven't told you how much I've suffered!

387
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Old Jun!

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Is my wife asleep?

389
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'll go check.

390
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Mrs. Min Zhuang.

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Mr. Mei.

392
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You left your wife at the wedding.

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You haven't come home for half a day.

394
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What's the point?

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What's more important than the wedding?

396
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm wrong.

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But can you tell me where my wife is?

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Isn't she in her room?

399
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
She said she was tired and wanted to sleep.

400
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
She told us not to wait outside.

401
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I thought she hadn't woken up yet.

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I was thinking of changing her to get up to wash her face.

403
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This ugly monster.

404
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It hurts my head.

405
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh no.

406
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Mr. Mei.

407
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Mrs. Mei is really missing.

408
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Where do you think she's going?

409
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Mrs. Min Zhuang is waiting here.

410
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'll go check on her in the Ruyi House.

411
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Mr. Mei.

412
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Madam.

413
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You were here just now.

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I was just about to go to the bathroom.

415
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I was just about to go to the bathroom.

416
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I was just about to go to the bathroom.

417
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You were here just now?

418
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I was here just now.

419
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You're shy.

421
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You're shy.

422
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You're shy.

423
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're shy.

424
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You're shy.

425
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You're shy.

426
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You're shy.

427
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You're shy.

428
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You're shy.

429
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You're shy.

430
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You're shy.

431
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You're shy.

432
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're shy.

433
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're shy.

434
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You're shy.

435
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You're shy.

436
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You're shy.

437
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You're shy.

438
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You're shy.

439
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You're shy.

440
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You're shy.

441
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You're shy.

442
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You're shy.

443
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You're shy.

444
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You're shy.

445
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're shy.

446
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You're shy.

447
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You're shy.

448
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I almost got you into trouble on the wedding day.

449
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm the one who's in the dream. How can I blame you?

450
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But I can't lose you again.

451
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You won't lose me.

452
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I will never leave you.

453
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Really?

454
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

455
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I will never allow anyone to hurt you again.

456
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I will never let you go.

457
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm looking for you in the fire of death.

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm looking for you in the fire of death.

459
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm looking for you in the fire of death.

460
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Did I really see it wrong?

461
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Should I tell Senior Brother?

462
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm so anxious.

463
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't even have the appetite to eat.

464
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I didn't see anyone.

465
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Second...

466
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Senior Brother?

467
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What's the matter?

468
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
This is so absurd.

469
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They are all girls returning home.

470
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm the one who's going to visit them.

471
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I can just go there myself.

472
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's already afternoon.

473
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Why haven't I seen them yet?

474
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Isn't that great?

475
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm afraid that you will have grandchildren soon.

476
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You should be happy.

477
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm not happy.

478
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You two are finally out of the room.

479
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Even though you are newly married and young,

480
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
you should have a good mind.

481
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You should be aware of certain things.

482
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Don't mind our young people's business.

483
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm worried about your health.

484
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Don't worry.

485
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Look at what I'm talking about.

486
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's the stomach.

487
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Are you okay?

488
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm a little dizzy from hunger.

489
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yes.

490
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Mister, there's a letter for you.

491
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What?

492
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Go ahead.

493
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's nothing.

494
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's not an important matter.

495
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Okay.

496
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Senior Brother,

497
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
we live here.

498
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Isn't it too simple?

499
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
As the saying goes,

500
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
the great task of the Heaven River is to be done by the private eye.

501
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's hard to do it, but hard to do it.

502
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You should be patient.

503
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
After all, there are still demons in Chang'an.

504
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Don't be too careless.

505
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We are demon hunters.

506
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
They are demons.

507
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
There's no reason for a mouse to run after a cat.

508
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Now the demon world is in a difficult time.

509
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Be careful.

510
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Don't be nervous.

511
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
They don't know our appearance.

512
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
They won't know.

513
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Now that you've lost your eyesight,

514
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
your evil powers have been gone.

515
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You'd better get out of here.

516
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Don't come back.

517
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
No!

518
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Sect Leader Changming.

519
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
If it weren't for the previous traitor,

520
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
he would have lied to the demon world.

521
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
If he had made others hesitate,

522
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
we would have left long ago.

523
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
How could he waste so much time?

524
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There are only a few of us left.

525
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
If you ask me,

526
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
his punishment is too light.

527
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Anyway,

528
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
we still came to Chang'an.

529
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We will return together.

530
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The news of the recent alliance with the demons

531
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
has been spread in Chang'an.

532
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
God is still on the side of Senior Brother.

533
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I hope the news will be effective.

534
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I will do my best to get you to Chang'an.

535
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But I don't understand

536
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
why the Sect Leader sent Chihua to find Mei Zhuyu.

537
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
If it weren't for the two of them,

538
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I don't know Mei Zhuyu

539
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
has already found the demon world.

540
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It seems that there is a lot of difficulty

541
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
without her when returning to Chang'an.

542
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Besides, I have the Long-Lost Sword.

543
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Didn't you already have the Long-Lost Sword

544
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
in your hands?

545
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Although I have the Long-Lost Sword,

546
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I haven't been able to return it.

547
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What?

548
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What's going on?

549
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't know either.

550
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Maybe she did something.

551
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
However, Lian Fu,

552
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
don't let anyone else know about this.

553
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The most important thing now

554
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
is the establishment of Chang'an in Changxi Palace.

555
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Don't let anyone else know about this.

556
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
This matter

557
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
will be discussed in the future.

558
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Okay.

559
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Mei Zhuyu?

560
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
How could it be her?

561
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Mei Zhuyu?

562
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I never thought that

563
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I would meet you here in Chang'an.

564
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We have heard about the demon in your dreams.

565
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We knew that the two of you have been communicating with each other.

566
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
When we learned that you found the demon world,

567
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
you urged us to leave the mountain.

568
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
If it wasn't for Zhao Qi,

569
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
we wouldn't have come.

570
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So when you left the mountain this time...

571
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What the sect leader meant was

572
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
since you already knew that the demon world was here,

573
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
if you could find a way to open the demon world,

574
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
we could break it down,

575
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
kill the demon, and eliminate the demon.

576
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
What's wrong?

577
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Do you have any other ideas?

578
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's my wish to remove the demon world

579
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and return Chang'an to peace.

580
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Let alone the grudge of my parents.

581
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But the demon in the demon world is still unknown.

582
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm afraid that if I take the risk to break the barrier,

583
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I will only be in danger.

584
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
What the sect leader meant was

585
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to fight quickly and eliminate the demon world.

586
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm afraid that this can't be changed.

587
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Since the sect leader has already decided,

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
why did you come to me?

589
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Although you are not from Changxi Palace,

590
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
we have the same goal.

591
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
If we work together,

592
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm sure that the demon world can't escape.

593
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So you want me to cooperate with you.

594
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
We are unfamiliar with Chang'an.

595
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We need your help.

596
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And the place where the demon disappeared.

597
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I think you know better than us.

598
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I know.

599
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
When you were tortured,

600
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
we were a little cold.

601
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't blame you.

602
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't care.

603
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I can help you with this.

604
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But I have been with the demon world for 18 years.

605
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I can wait, but I can't fail.

606
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I only wish that

607
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
if I fight,

608
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I can avoid the demon world.

609
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Boss,

610
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
drink the medicine.

611
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Drink the medicine first.

612
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
This is the medicine that has been made by the spirit of the pig for 100 years.

613
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This is too stinky.

614
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It tastes a little stinky, but it's a big tonic.

615
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A lot of things have happened recently.

616
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You have to take care of yourself.

617
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
This is really too difficult to swallow.

618
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
In the demon world,

619
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
the pig is the second tonic.

620
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
If you don't think it's successful,

621
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
then go to Uncle Wu.

622
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm going to go.

623
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm done drinking the medicine.

624
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I should go back.

625
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I came to your place

626
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
because I was going out with Mrs. Liu.

627
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I dare not stay.

628
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

629
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Your husband is generous.

630
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I don't mind if you come to the Ruyi House to have fun.

631
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
My husband is so handsome.

632
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Who wants to go out and see the outside world?

633
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Come on.

634
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Master, where is he?

635
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
He has left.

636
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's Xiao Zhen's oil.

637
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What did you buy when you went out with Mrs. Liu today?

638
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Nothing.

639
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You don't have to save money for me.

640
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I didn't save money.

641
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I believe my husband has the ability to earn money.

642
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Come on.

643
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's not right, Mr. Song.

644
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It's not personal.

645
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Come to shoot arrows.

646
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Give the master a flower to win the game.

647
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Shoot.

648
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'll do it myself.

649
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'll earn the good and the bad myself.

650
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Master,

651
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
all three arrows can hit the bell.

652
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Then you can win the flower.

653
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Your bell is too high.

654
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's hard to hit it once.

655
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Master.

656
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Are you going to talk to my wife?

657
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It was, but not now.

658
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Do you need me to tell her?

659
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
How do you know?

660
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Xiao Zhen won't wait for you to get used to it.

661
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And come out to see me in the middle of the night.

662
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Between you and me,

663
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
who is closer to him?

664
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Who is more hostile to him?

665
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's hard to say.

666
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Xiao Zhen is tough.

667
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
He has to try everything by himself.

668
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It seems that he has to pretend to be tough.

669
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So you...

670
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Mr. Mei appeared late.

671
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I don't know what happened between Xiao Zhen and me.

672
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You don't have to ask.

673
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
After all, it's been more than ten years.

674
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's not something that can be said clearly.

675
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm not interested in the stories you're talking about.

676
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Moreover,

677
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
this is a personal matter.

678
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
My wife has to admit it herself.

679
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Mei Zhuyu,

680
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
what's the relationship between Xiao Zhen and me?

681
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's not your turn to talk.

682
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You just remember,

683
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
if you dare to hurt Xiao Zhen,

684
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I will not spare you.

685
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I will protect my wife.

686
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But if you have this spare time,

687
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it's better to find something to do.

688
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Recently, Qiu Han,

689
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
if he comes out to see me in the middle of the night,

690
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
remember to tell him to wear more clothes.

691
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's so quiet.

692
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Mister.

693
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
What are you doing?

694
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I just saw your uncle's friend.

695
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
He said a few words.

696
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'm sorry.

701
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'm sorry.

702
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm sorry.

703
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm sorry.

704
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm sorry.

708
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm sorry.
