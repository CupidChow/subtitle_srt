1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You just want to make a deal with the Snake King?

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Just say it.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I want to use a snake forest on you to exchange your lives.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How about it?

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The one who stole the snake forest was you?

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What a pity. That snake man was useless.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In the end, I had to deal with him myself.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're now under Liu Huang's control.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If I do something, it'll make me look too much like a person.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why don't you take the initiative and make this deal with me?

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You three should be on the edge.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No! No!

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No!

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Mrs. Liu!

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Grandpa!

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Xue Hui!

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Grandpa!

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Xue Hui!

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you okay?

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're so big.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why are you crying?

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why are you crying?

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Grandpa!

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sister...

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What did you call me?

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I just wanted to get married.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I... I know.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I...

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I know.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Xue Hui!

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Xue Hui!

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Boss, we're here.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Boss, we're here.

54
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The wind blows through the eyes

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The winter is coming

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The wind turns into a cold rain

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How can I not open the door when you're in the room?

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can't hear

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The scenery is falling

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm too lazy to scare her.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Su Zhuang, I'm done writing for you.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think you're too lazy to write these.

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have to break the rules once.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The little boy broke the first rule.

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And there will be a next one.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't want to leave

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The more I look at the beautiful scenery

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The more I remember

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The more ruthless and the more heartless

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The more I'm used to the rain

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The more I seek for you

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I seek for you

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
My lady, Minister Mei wrote a letter.

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He said he was going to take a leave for a while.

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He ordered me to take the responsibility of the minister for now.

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But after this time, I found out

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that Minister Mei was not easy.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know how he managed

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
so many things.

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, Brother Mei asked me to help the minister.

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I also feel confused.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But these difficulties

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
are very easy for him.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But I...

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You don't have to worry too much.

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He is

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
so hard that he won't show himself.

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He looks like a cloud.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But since he handed over the Xuanjing Temple to you

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I believe you can do it.

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Then the wind, then the moon, then the fog

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The long night is in my dream

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Then the heart, then the bridge, then the scenery

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I am in the fire of this world

95
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The more I climb into the window, the more I don't want to leave

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The more I look at the beautiful scenery, the more I remember

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The more ruthless, the more ruthless

98
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The more I use this cloud, the more I seek my destiny

99
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's you

100
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Then the wind, then the moon, then the fog

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The long night is in my dream

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Then the heart, then the bridge, then the scenery

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am in the fire of this world

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then the wind, then the moon, then the fog

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The long night is in my dream

106
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Then the heart, then the bridge, then the scenery

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I am in the fire of this world

108
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I am in the fire of this world

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's you

110
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My lord, my lord is back

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You didn't send any message back to Quzhou this time

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I was so worried

113
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I lost weight

114
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But I thought the day after tomorrow is the new year

115
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So I should be back by the end of the year

116
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
My lord, what do you want to eat the day after tomorrow?

117
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No, my lord, why are you back alone?

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Where is my husband?

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, where is my husband?

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Boss, boss

121
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's wrong?

122
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What's wrong?

123
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Xiaomeng, let's go back

124
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm afraid Chang'an is going to change

125
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Meisilang

126
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You are the best friend in this world

127
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think he is willing to be with you

128
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Please find a good Quzhou for him

129
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And bury him in peace

130
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Zhenjian, you must be careful

131
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I will

132
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:59,000
My lord, you are back

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Are you still hurt?

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You should go to rest

135
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm fine, I just need to rest for a few days

136
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Good

137
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Lingxiao, Guzhong, send the order

138
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Send more guards to guard the entrance

139
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We can't let Lao Haozi in

140
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yes

141
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Now the enemy is in our way

142
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We can't act recklessly

143
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You should rest

144
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We will figure out the other party's plan

145
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Ok

146
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Take care of your lord

147
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Ok

148
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
My lord, be careful

149
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Boss, don't worry

150
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We have never lost our patrols during this period

151
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The elite soldiers have not been suspicious

152
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Xiao Zhen

153
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Uncle, you are back

154
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm back

155
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm back

156
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm back

157
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm back

158
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm back

159
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm back

160
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm back

161
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm back

162
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm back

163
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Uncle

164
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You

165
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You remember me

166
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes

167
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I remember

168
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So

169
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What did Chaoxi Palace do

170
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
To help you recover your memory

171
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know

172
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The cave is so mysterious

173
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Some secret weapons

174
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That we don't know

175
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Are not strange

176
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Wait a minute

177
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Come

178
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Come

179
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Come

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Come

181
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Come

182
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Come

183
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Come

184
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Come

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Come

186
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come

187
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Uncle

188
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
In the demon world

189
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Only the blood of the cat and the spirit of the snake

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Can enter the forbidden place

191
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The Demon Temple

192
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The Biao Island

193
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The Shenling Hall

194
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The Silver Cave

195
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And the Demon Fist

196
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's all

197
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But you have sent me to investigate

198
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Nothing strange

199
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Nothing strange

200
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No

201
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What's wrong

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I remember there is an air-raid warehouse

203
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Next to the old room

204
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But it was left by the second uncle

205
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes

206
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That place has been abandoned for many years

207
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No one has been there for a long time

208
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No one has been there

209
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No one knows what's inside

210
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Nothing

211
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Nothing

212
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Boss

213
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Did we

214
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Find the wrong place

215
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No

216
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I have a feeling

217
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's here

218
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Let's find it again

219
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The Demon Temple

220
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The Silver Cave

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The Silver Cave

222
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The Silver Cave

223
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The Silver Cave

224
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The Silver Cave

225
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The Silver Cave

226
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The Silver Cave

227
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The Silver Cave

228
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The Silver Cave

229
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The Silver Cave

230
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The Silver Cave

231
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The Silver Cave

232
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The Silver Cave

233
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The Silver Cave

234
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This is

235
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The Demon Fox

236
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,160
supported by more than 10,000 more people.

237
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:18,380
Because of the

238
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,920
Uniball,

239
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,240
I could not

240
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,040
even abandon our summit on this journey.

241
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,920
Impossible.

242
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:32,800
Wasn't this also a trick?

243
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,660
Oh各位傅國私

244
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:51,660
Yup, the

245
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,580
um

246
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:18,360
Grubby.

247
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:32,080
One day.

248
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,460
It's B.

249
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,600
Small after one hundred thousand years.

250
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
I'm afraid that you're not in time to visit.

251
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Did you go to the old warehouse yesterday?

252
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,600
You're so righteous, but you didn't even ask me a question.

253
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Ridiculous.

254
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,600
You hurt the snake's bow in such a way that it's making a fuss.

255
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
What is there to ask?

256
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
You have a clear conscience.

257
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,600
I think you had your own plan yesterday.

258
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
We agreed to work together,

259
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,600
but you didn't take it away and you're blaming me?

260
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
You're always so thoughtful.

261
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,600
I took it away to protect myself.

262
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I told you, I don't care how you deal with the human world or the demon world.

263
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I just want to see that thing and take it away.

264
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Lord Shu, you've never seen that thing.

265
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Are you sure it has something to do with our plan?

266
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Why would I be so sure?

267
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Eighteen years ago, the evil spirit and the ghost were trying to kill me.

268
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I think it's connected to the demon world.

269
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Who are you?

270
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Xiao Chen.

271
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,600
It's me, Lord Qiang Yi.

272
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Lord Qiang Yi.

273
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,600
The ancient art of war, the enemy of the gun, the enemy of the country.

274
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
It's called Qiang Yi.

275
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,600
After Changxi Palace woke up, I remembered this dream.

276
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I thought it was just a dream when I was sick.

277
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Until I connected to the past little by little.

278
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Then I realized it was all true.

279
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,600
So you're not aware of life and death,

280
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,600
just trying to confuse me and find a time to expose me.

281
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
I just want to know the truth.

282
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
The truth?

283
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
The truth is that we were at a disadvantage.

284
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I was the only one who could do anything.

285
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
But you were so powerful that you were actually the only one who could do anything.

286
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
I helped you become the best demon in the world.

287
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
I helped you become a perfect cat.

288
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,600
This is the truth you wanted.

289
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Then why did you betray me?

290
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,600
No, you betrayed me.

291
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I... I obviously like you so much.

292
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,600
I did everything for you.

293
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Don't you need all this?

294
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I need it?

295
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,600
You know you can't do anything, but you say I need it?

296
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
I need Elder Fusheng Hui.

297
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,600
I need the snake palace.

298
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
I need to steal the snake spirit.

299
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I need to kill the innocent. I don't need it!

300
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,600
You like me so much that I feel disgusted.

301
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
What else do you have against Elder Hui?

302
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,600
I think if you are in the control of the Hui family,

303
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,600
the blood-sucking ghost will return to the world tonight.

304
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
You can't stop it.

305
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Even if Chang'an is destroyed, it's okay.

306
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
I will save you.

307
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
If you are like how you were for 18 years,

308
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
obedient to me,

309
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
I will continue to guard and protect you.

310
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
You are the safest here.

311
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
I don't need it.

312
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I don't need such protection.

313
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
I never want it!

314
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
What's wrong?

315
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
You are the blood-sucking ghost.

316
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
You are the blood-sucking ghost.

317
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
My little town is finally complete.

318
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
It seems you don't need me anymore.

319
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
It's all my fault.

320
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
The old disease that I was so worried about

321
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
should have been hidden in the cave.

322
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
It shouldn't have appeared in the world.

323
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
If that's the case...

324
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Uncle!

325
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Uncle!

326
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Uncle!

327
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Why are you not taking off your clothes?

328
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Why are you doing this?

329
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Xiao Zhen,

330
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
I am sorry.

331
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I am sorry.

332
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I am sorry.

333
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
I am sorry.

334
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I am sorry.

335
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
I am sorry.

336
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I am sorry.

337
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I am sorry.

338
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
If you don't need me,

339
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,600
it doesn't matter if you take off your clothes

340
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
or not.

341
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
It doesn't matter anymore.

342
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
No!

343
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
No!

344
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
I am not the one!

345
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
I am not the one!

346
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Uncle, do you like this place?

347
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I like it.

348
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
I like it.

349
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Sha...

350
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Sha Jin...

351
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Ohh...

352
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,600
You killed my demon and you think you're a demon?

353
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Fine. If you want to save them, come to the bottom of the hell.

354
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
I'll be waiting for you.

355
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,200
Very well.

356
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,200
Please come over.

357
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,240
Your Majesty, please have an early behaviour from the hearts of the villagers and lieutenant time fairy.

358
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,460
There's no one you can arrange for more important future for.

359
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:22,120
However, if myuyi the

360
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,480
Also your eighth child

361
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,480
What do you mean?

362
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,480
I don't know why you and the evil ghost are together.

363
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,480
It seems that you already know who Wu Zishu is.

364
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
What a pity.

365
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,480
He is just a useless thing that is given to a man and a woman.

366
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
But I don't understand.

367
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,480
What don't you understand?

368
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,480
A thousand years ago, I was just a little rat.

369
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Any mortal can bully me.

370
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:12,320
I am a

371
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
I

372
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,480
I knew that the ghost that I met took me in.

373
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I saw him build this demon room.

374
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,480
He told me that this was my shelter.

375
00:33:50,480 --> 00:34:15,380
He also told us that mortals are all

376
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,480
You are wrong.

377
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Demons should be self-willed.

378
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,480
They are not biased to be self-willed.

379
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
You are not a demon.

380
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
You are not a cat in the demon world.

381
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
You are not worthy.

382
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Do you know what this is?

383
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
You took it from the old warehouse.

384
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
You are wrong.

385
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,480
This is the power of the ghost.

386
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,480
It absorbs the evil thoughts in the hearts of all demons.

387
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Do you know why the demon world is so down today?

388
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Because of you.

389
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,480
I tell you.

390
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,480
The source of your body is about to be born.

391
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,480
I want to use this power to destroy Chang'an.

392
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,480
I want to win the title of the great ghost.

393
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:27,480
I will be the greatest hero in the world.

394
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Elder Wei.

395
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,480
I don't know how much your strong will is for the demon world.

396
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,480
How much is for yourself?

397
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,480
To prove that you are not a rat who can be bullied by others.

398
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Snake King, don't you worry?

399
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,480
What's the use of being anxious?

400
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Little girl.

401
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,480
I will pass on the position of cat palace to you.

402
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Cat palace?

403
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,480
What is the cat palace?

404
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,480
That is an important position.

405
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
You are the most important person in the world.

406
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,480
You are the most important person in the world.

407
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,480
That is an important position.

408
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,480
A mission that cannot be failed.

409
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,480
I'm afraid I'm going to let you down.

410
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Why do you say that?

411
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,480
I can't be a qualified cat palace.

412
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Then what do you think is a qualified cat palace?

413
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,480
When you face the most difficult situation,

414
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,480
when you face the choice that you have to make,

415
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,480
you will understand.

416
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I'm sorry.

417
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,480
I'm sorry.

418
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Mi Zhu Yu.

419
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
It's useless.

420
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Only the power of the demon king can defeat this wolf.

421
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Go find the snake.

422
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,480
Go find the snake.

423
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,480
How is that possible?

424
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,480
I... I saw you.

425
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,480
What?

426
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,480
The night that happened 18 years ago.

427
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Where are you?

428
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,480
What did you do?

429
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,480
There is really no other way to kill the ghost.

430
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Killing the ghost is not a death sentence.

431
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,480
The demon and the sword can be compared to the ghost,

432
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,480
but they cannot completely destroy the source.

433
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Now that the time is near,

434
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
we can only use the power of the wolf

435
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,480
to seal the ghost source in her body.

436
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,480
And she will be punished to become a half demon.

437
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Maybe one day,

438
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
someone will break through the heaven

439
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,480
and find the way to destroy the ghost camp.

440
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,480
But right now, there is no other choice.

441
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
No.

442
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Maybe there is another way.

443
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Put the evil spirit source in my body.

444
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,480
This is the best choice.

445
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

446
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

447
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

448
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

449
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

450
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

451
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

452
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

453
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

454
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,480
I will use the power of the wolf to seal the ghost camp.

455
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,480
The old man must have caused a lot of trouble while we were in the ghost camp.

456
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,480
The old man must have caused a lot of trouble while we were in the ghost camp.

457
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,480
The two elders may head back to deal with the matters here.

458
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
We will listen to it.

459
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Yes.

460
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,520
Dongchuan

461
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,640
Boss

462
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,960
Are you alright?

463
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,240
I am fine

464
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,600
R grim repellent

465
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,240
His plan is getting reported

466
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,180
effects
