1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,720
little bit of a

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit of a

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,320
little bit of a

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,720
little bit of a

6
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,560
little bit of a

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
little bit of a

8
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
little bit of a

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
little bit of a

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
little bit of a

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
little bit of a

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
little bit of a

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,360
little bit of a

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
little bit of a

15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,300
little bit of a

16
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,540
little bit of a

17
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,820
little bit of a

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,560
The Ferryman

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Episode 16

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Why don't I give you a hand?

22
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
I heard that there is a way to help you in the imperial kitchen.

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Why don't you buy some and go back?

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
You talk so much.

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Those who don't stay will be the most afraid of the night.

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Wu Zhen?

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
What are you doing?

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
I haven't seen you for a few days.

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
I miss you.

30
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
I want to invite you to have a try.

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Do you have such a good friend?

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Where did you get the incense?

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Manager Lin Xiao's new incense.

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,560
He said that it can be mixed in the water.

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
It can be used to calm the mind.

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm too lazy to go downstairs.

37
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
The fifth lady is so humiliated.

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
It seems that you can't forget the old love.

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
No.

40
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
I just want to humiliate you.

41
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
You!

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,560
The Ferryman has a good reputation.

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
But he doesn't teach people.

44
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
He doesn't care about peace.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
He doesn't do justice.

46
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
He doesn't marry a good husband.

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
He always fights against the family.

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,560
He only cares about the relationship between men and women.

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm so naughty.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
I'm just a bad person.

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
I'm not as good as you.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,560
I'm just a bad person.

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
You!

54
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
What's wrong with me?

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Manager Lin Xiao.

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Please remember to pay me the incense.

57
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Okay.

58
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
In case this is spread.

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
The Ferryman is used by the Xie family.

60
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I can't pay you.

61
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Who asked you to pay?

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
No need.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Then you pay yourself.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Pay yourself.

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Pay.

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Don't take it too seriously.

67
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,560
I always like to find Xiao Guan to play the zither and play the music.

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
It's not once or twice.

69
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Xiao Zhu Yu.

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Do you know why my sister is so unruly?

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
She is out of the box.

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
This is related to the accident 18 years ago.

73
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Chang'an's chaos.

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Do you know?

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
I know.

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
That night, I happened to meet my sisters.

77
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
But my sister was lost.

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
She was unconscious when she was looking for her.

79
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
She was unconscious for three months.

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
The whole Wu family has prepared the funeral.

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
But I don't want to...

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
The Ferryman

83
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
She just woke up?

84
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Yes.

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
What happened after that?

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
After that, her mood changed.

87
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
The whole Wu family was so happy to see her lost.

88
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
They all adored her.

89
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
In the whole Chang'an,

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
except her sister,

91
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
no one dared to bother her.

92
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
So,

93
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
I want to remind you

94
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
to not bother your sister.

95
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm afraid you can't.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I have a good news.

97
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
My daughter Liu's father

98
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
is the new minister of Liu Palace.

99
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
He's going to hold a funeral in a few days.

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
All the people there are from a noble family.

101
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
My father said he would send you to attend the funeral.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
You can see it.

103
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Forget it.

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
I have something more important to do.

105
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
What is it?

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
I heard that the demons were in chaos

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
because of the Buhua Valley.

108
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Uncle is looking for

109
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
the whereabouts of that thing.

110
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
I believe it will be solved soon.

111
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Here it is.

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
You are?

113
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm Mei Zhuyu from the Xuanjian Temple.

114
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
I heard you and Minister Xu talking.

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Can you tell me the details?

116
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
The thing is

117
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
I was sleeping at night.

118
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Suddenly a voice appeared.

119
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
The monster always appears after sunset.

120
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
What if he comes at night?

121
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
All right. It's getting late.

122
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
I should go.

123
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
He's going to fall. I should go.

124
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
He's well-treated.

125
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Where is the Buhua Valley?

126
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Master, you should go.

127
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
I can't.

128
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Xuanjian Temple is in chaos.

129
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Xuanjian Temple is in chaos.

130
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Who is it?

131
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Who is it?

132
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Who is it?

133
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Are you all right?

134
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I was attacked by the monster.

135
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm hurt.

136
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
I'm hurt.

137
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Was it a cat?

138
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
A cat?

139
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
The monster ran away?

140
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm relieved.

141
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Master, my treasure.

142
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
All my treasures are treasures.

143
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
You didn't touch them.

144
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
I didn't mean anything else.

145
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
They are real.

146
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
I'm afraid you can't afford them.

147
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Look. It's the same as the precious items.

148
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
This lamp is a gift from Minister Liu.

149
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
If you touch it, it will be broken.

150
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Shao Weiyan?

151
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Boss, who are you fighting with?

152
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Don't mention it.

153
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Buhua Valley is not found.

154
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
It's almost discovered.

155
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Come.

156
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
It's not urgent.

157
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Buhua Valley is lifeless.

158
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
But it's full of traps.

159
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
It will be a mess sooner or later.

160
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm not afraid to find its traces.

161
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Keep an eye on it.

162
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Don't worry.

163
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
What is this?

164
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
New medicine.

165
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
It can help you to wash your hair and bones.

166
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
It can help you to wash your hair and bones.

167
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
How do you feel?

168
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
How do you feel?

169
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
I feel like...

170
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
What should we do?

171
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
What should we do?

172
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
We will be found.

173
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I think it's pretty.

174
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Do you have a tail?

175
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
It's at his place.

176
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Boss.

177
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Boss.

178
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Boss.

179
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
It's okay.

180
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
It's okay.

181
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
It's okay.

182
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
It's okay.

183
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
It's okay.

184
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
You're so old.

185
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
You just came back.

186
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Don't you feel tired?

187
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
I'm a disciple of Changxi Palace.

188
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
I'm a disciple of Changxi Palace.

189
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
I told you.

190
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Changxi Palace is gone.

191
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Don't worry about me.

192
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Don't worry about me.

193
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Tell me how are you and your sister?

194
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Tell me how are you and your sister?

195
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
You didn't offend her, did you?

196
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
You know I'm not married yet.

197
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
You know I'm not married yet.

198
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
If I stay at home for a day, I'll offend her.

199
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
That's right.

200
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Your sister is strict with you.

201
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Your sister is strict with you.

202
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
But I believe

203
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
she cares about you.

204
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
I can't help you to deal with her.

205
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
But I'll always

206
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
be with you.

207
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Thank you.

208
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Tell me.

209
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
What do you want?

210
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Liu Gongshen

211
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
is promoted.

212
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
He's the minister of the Ministry of Personnel.

213
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
His birthday banquet

214
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
is on your behalf.

215
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Why don't you go yourself?

216
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
I've already

217
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
finished my work.

218
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
And

219
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
this is

220
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
the Qun Wen treasure

221
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
I finally got.

222
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Dad, I beg you.

223
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Don't pick up these trashes again.

224
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
The garbage in the house is gone.

225
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
I got

226
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
rare treasures.

227
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Zhen,

228
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
go for dad.

229
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Go to the banquet. I beg you.

230
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
I beg you.

231
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
I'll go.

232
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
My good girl.

233
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
If you're sweating

234
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
this much, you can wear it.

235
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Sir, look at these.

236
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Thank you for coming.

237
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Sir.

238
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
I took the things I fixed the other day.

239
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Are they fixed?

240
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Of course.

241
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Look.

242
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Where did you fix it?

243
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Look.

244
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
There's one missing.

245
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Well, sir,

247
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
you can choose one.

248
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
I'll ask someone to help you.

249
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
What do you think?

250
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
You're good at business.

251
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Well, I'll choose one.

252
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
You're more serious.

253
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Thank you for your care.

254
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
These are all normal.

255
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
This is all I need.

256
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Since you've said it,

257
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
I'll send someone to help you.

258
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
What do you think?

259
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
OK.

260
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
The light is really

261
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
a rare thing.

262
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Yes.

263
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Light it up.

264
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
According to the figure of the woman,

265
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
I don't know what kind of eye

266
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
she made.

267
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Yes.

268
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Look.

269
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
It's like she's walking down the wall.

270
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Yes.

271
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
It's better if she can dance

272
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
and sing a song.

273
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Dance and sing a song?

274
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Yes.

275
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
It's better to cook for me

276
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
and clean the room.

277
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Yes.

278
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
She turned around.

279
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
She turned around.

280
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
She turned around.

281
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
What?

282
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
I saw her just now.

283
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
She turned around.

284
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
What's wrong with her?

285
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Stop talking nonsense.

286
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Light the lantern.

287
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
No.

288
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
It's a gift from Lady Daguang.

289
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Don't be late.

290
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
No.

291
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Light the lantern.

292
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Light the lantern.

293
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Light the lantern.

294
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Light the lantern.

295
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Light the lantern.

296
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Light the lantern.

297
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
Little fish.

298
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
I know you changed your mind and agreed to come to the banquet.

299
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
My father was so happy.

300
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
He also said I was right.

301
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Yes.

302
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I...

303
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
I came to Liu's Mansion last time.

304
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Five years ago.

305
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
That time,

306
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
I waited for a long time at the gate of Liu's Mansion.

307
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Finally, I waited for Lady Liu to come out of the mansion.

308
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
I proposed to her.

309
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
I can't forget it.

310
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Lady Liu looked at me

311
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
and showed

312
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
the smile of two children.

313
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Then

314
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
she said one word.

315
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Okay.

316
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Get out.

317
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Since then, as long as I gave her a gift,

318
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
she would return it.

319
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
I won't let you

320
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
come near the mansion again.

321
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Otherwise, you will bite me.

322
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
If Lady Liu didn't invite me,

323
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
I wouldn't have the chance to enter the mansion.

324
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
It's late.

325
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
We should go in.

326
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Yes. Let's go.

327
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Wait for me.

328
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Whose little boy is this?

329
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
The donkey cart is so old.

330
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Why do you have to take it as a pride?

331
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
This is Mr. Mei of Xuanjian Temple.

332
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Not long ago,

333
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
he offended the Lord of Qinghe.

334
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
So it's him.

335
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm so sorry.

336
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Are you all right?

337
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Thank you for your visit.

338
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm fine.

339
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm fine.

340
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
I'm fine.

341
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
The cart that His Majesty gave is really

342
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
good.

343
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
I need two horses to pull it.

344
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I like the donkey cart.

345
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
It's delicate

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
and cute.

347
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
It's delicate and cute.

348
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
It seems that you are in a good mood today.

349
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
You are really a good teacher.

350
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Don't worry. I'm here.

351
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
I won't let other dogs bite you.

352
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
I'm here.

353
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
I'm here.

354
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm here.

355
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
I'm here.

356
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
I'm here.

357
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm here.

358
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm here.

359
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm here.

360
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
I'm here.

361
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm here.

362
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm here.

363
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
I'm here.

364
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm here.

365
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
I'm here.

366
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
I'm here.

367
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
My father is not in Chang'an today.

368
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
He prepared a gift for me.

369
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
He asked me to give it to Uncle Liu.

370
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
These are my father's treasures.

371
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
These are also the treasures of the Duke?

372
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
Yes.

373
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
What?

374
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Is it possible that some man

375
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
has a crush on Liu Niangzi

376
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
and accidentally got mixed up with Li?

377
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,560
But it looks like

378
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,560
this fortune is not interesting.

379
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
It seems that I have to

380
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
find a chance to make up for it.

381
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Is it not...

382
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
It's a gift from Wu Niangzi.

383
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
I heard that the two ladies

384
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
are always making trouble.

385
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Now it seems that Wu Niangzi is doing well.

386
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
Congratulations to the two of you.

387
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
You talk too much.

388
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
My things

389
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
can be given and thrown away.

390
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
It's not the turn of others to command.

391
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
Roll it up.

392
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Who gave this to you?

393
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm Mei Zhu Yu from the Sword Department.

394
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Greetings, Minister Liu.

395
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
You are the young man

396
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
who returned to Chang'an.

397
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
I'm a common man.

398
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Please don't mind.

399
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Thank you,

400
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
young man.

401
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
This inkstone is soft and smooth.

402
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Although it is light,

403
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
it is a good material

404
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
that can be used.

405
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Just like you,

406
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
you are good at polishing.

407
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
You have a bright future.

408
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Thank you, Minister Liu.

409
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
You are generous and generous.

410
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
You are right.

411
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
I hope you can get rid of your bad habits

412
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,560
and make a great success.

413
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
I don't like

414
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Wu Niangzi.

415
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
What did you say?

416
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Didn't you hear what Wu Niangzi said?

417
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Even if Wu Niangzi doesn't want it,

418
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
it's not the turn of others to command.

419
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
So if you meet me again,

420
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
please give me less advice.

421
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Xiu Wu,

422
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
don't talk so much.

423
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Take out your gift

424
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
and show everyone how good it is.

425
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
I have a gift

426
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
for you.

427
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
It's for you, too.

428
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
I know you are always humble.

429
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
So I'd like to borrow a flower

430
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
and give it to you.

431
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
This is...

432
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
I made a lantern for you.

433
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Light it.

434
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
It's beautiful.

435
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
The lantern is so delicate

436
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
and it's made of gemstone.

437
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
It must be very expensive.

438
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
No, no.

439
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
The lady on the lantern

440
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
is Liu Niangzi.

441
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Look,

442
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
there is a poem

443
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
and a poem.

444
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
The seven valley of Zhenshan

445
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
is a dream.

446
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
The four horses of Gao are

447
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
far away from Changjing.

448
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
The book is 3000 miles away.

449
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
The poem is

450
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
for the sake of the people.

451
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
It's a good poem.

452
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
It's a good poem.

453
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
You are indeed a talented man of Chang'an.

454
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
It's a beautiful poem.

455
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
It's very touching.

456
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
It's a poem.

457
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
It's a poem.

458
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
It's a poem.

459
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
It's a poem.

460
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
It's a poem.

461
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
It's a poem.

462
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
It's a poem.

463
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
It's a poem.

464
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
It's a poem.

465
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
It's a poem.

466
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
It's a poem.

467
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
It's a poem.

468
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
It's a poem.

469
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
It's a poem.

470
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
You also saw that thing just now.

471
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Did you look for it?

472
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
What?

473
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Are you

474
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
curious about me?

475
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
There are few

476
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
good women in Chang'an.

477
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
But you look

478
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
calm and calm.

479
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Calm?

480
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Calm doesn't mean

481
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
there are few.

482
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
It doesn't mean there aren't.

483
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Now you work in the drug store.

484
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Have you ever seen

485
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
my book in the warehouse?

486
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
The second wife of the Duke of the Five Kingdoms,

487
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Wuzhen,

488
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
was 24 years old

489
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
and had been dating for many years.

490
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Now there are more than 80 men

491
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
who are not good enough for her.

492
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
They all turned against each other

493
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
and complained.

494
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
The Duke of the Five Kingdoms

495
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
is obsessed with the art of heaven.

496
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
He has been looking for

497
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
the world's famous poems for 20 years.

498
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
He has been looking for

499
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
many treasures

500
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
and many money.

501
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
I am so

502
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
lucky.

503
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
I see.

504
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I heard that many monsters

505
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
will turn into human beings.

506
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Their temperament is different from human beings.

507
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Maybe there are

508
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
monsters in us.

509
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
As for tonight...

510
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
If I'm not wrong,

511
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
there should be a shadow monster.

512
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Maybe it's the shadow of the lily lantern.

513
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Shadow monster?

514
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
You know a lot.

515
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Such a strange name.

516
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
How do you know?

517
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
I grew up in the countryside.

518
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
I'm used to the monster's charm.

519
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Besides, the fifth wife

520
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
is from Chang'an.

521
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
She should know why the Xuanjian Bureau was set up.

522
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
She is very smart.

523
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
What's the strange thing?

524
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
I see.

525
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
What about the main matter of the Xuanjian Bureau?

526
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Is there any way?

527
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
After all, a monster is around.

528
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I can't help but be worried.

529
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
I remember reading in the book

530
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
that this kind of shadow monster

531
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
is often hidden in the shadow

532
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
and appears in the form of a shadow.

533
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Tonight, there are many guests.

534
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
It's also a dark time.

535
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
The shadow is full of people.

536
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
The shadow is in a mess.

537
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Isn't there a lot more

538
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
monsters hiding?

539
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
I'm going to the dark room.

540
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
I'm going to the dark room.

541
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
I'm going to the dark room.

542
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
I'm going to the dark room.

543
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm going to the dark room.

544
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
I'm going to the dark room.

545
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
I'm going to the dark room.

546
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
I'm going to the dark room.

547
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
I'm going to the dark room.

548
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
I'm going to the dark room.

549
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I'm going to the dark room.

550
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
I'm going to the dark room.

551
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
I'm going to the dark room.

552
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm going to the dark room.

553
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Gate of Eternity

554
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,140
Hey! Please help me with the duration 어

555
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
?

556
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
I didn't introduce you last time.

557
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Pretty well Hey! Let's play

558
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,620
Yes, he

559
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
will score 80.

560
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,560
First, let's mittens.

561
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,560
The fifth lady played the game of guessing the shadow when she was young.

562
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
What is this?

563
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Lighting the candle in the house, everyone ran and chased one person.

564
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
The one who chased was the winner of the shadow of the other person.

565
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,560
The one who was caught continues to chase the other person.

566
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
At that time, it was...

567
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
It was my favorite game.

568
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Later, I came up with a way to win.

569
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
First, extinguish the candle,

570
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
and make the other person lose their shadow.

571
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
If you move in secret and light the candle again,

572
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,560
you can easily step on the shadow of the other person.

573
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
You mean...

574
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Can extinguish the candle,

575
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,560
and lure the monster out of the main hall,

576
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
and find the place where no one is,

577
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
and make him appear at once.

578
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,560
After the monster is lured out?

579
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
After...

580
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
Don't you still have your treasure?

581
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,560
I only helped you half.

582
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
I only helped you half.

583
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560

I only helped you half.

586
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
I only helped you half.

587
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
I only helped you half.

588
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I only helped you half.

589
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
I only helped you half.

590
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
I only helped you half.

591
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I only helped you half.

592
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
I only helped you half.

593
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
I only helped you half.

594
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
I only helped you half.

595
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
I only helped you half.

596
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
I only helped you half.

597
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
I only helped you half.

598
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
I only helped you half.

599
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,560
I only helped you half.

600
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
I only helped you half.

601
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
I only helped you half.

602
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I only helped you half.

603
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
I only helped you half.

604
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,560
I only helped you half.

605
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
I only helped you half.

606
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
I only helped you half.

607
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I only helped you half.

608
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
I only helped you half.

609
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
I only helped you half.

610
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
I only helped you half.

611
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
I only helped you half.

612
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
I only helped you half.

613
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
My light is out.

614
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
What is happening?

615
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Enough talking.

616
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Enough talking.

617
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

618
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

619
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

620
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

621
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

622
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

623
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

624
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

625
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

626
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

627
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

628
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

629
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

630
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

631
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

632
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I can help you.

633
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,560
Lang Ji!

634
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
ubby

635
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,360
Human

636
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,160
Burt

637
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,540
To stop prevalence of this?

638
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:07,000
You run quite fast.

639
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,960
Your man, Zhenzhen.

640
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,720
What's going on?

641
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,920
That drink was just near the study.

642
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,160
It was quite bitter.

643
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,640
What?

644
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:21,760
Stop moving!

645
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,880
Love!

646
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

647
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

648
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

649
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

650
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

651
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

652
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

653
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

654
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

655
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

656
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

657
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

658
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

659
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

660
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

661
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

662
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

663
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

664
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

665
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

666
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

667
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

668
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

669
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

670
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

671
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

672
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

673
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

674
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
SG!

675
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,940
SG!

676
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,240
Buhua valley.

677
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,740
I'm hiding it from Buhua valley.

678
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:59,080
Why the hell is she screaming these heights???

679
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,300
Oh lord no!

680
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,680
I can't hope for better.

681
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,700
Let me go!

682
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,600
What!?

683
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,120
simplified

684
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,260
If it didn't work salt

685
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,440
The health insurance

686
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,120
Stop talking nonsense

687
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Hurry up!

688
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Hurry up!

689
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
Hurry up!

690
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
Hurry up!

691
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Hurry up!

692
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
Where did the ghost come from?

693
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
The ghost is over there!

694
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
The ghost is over there!

695
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Protect the mother!

696
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Hurry up!

697
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
Hurry up!

698
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Are you okay?

699
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
Why are you here?

700
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,120
Did you find anything?

701
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
No.

702
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I just saw the lanterns from the White Dragon.

703
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Why are you sending the portrait of the Lady Liu?

704
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
It's not me.

705
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,120
Someone put the painting in my gift.

706
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
That person is...

707
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Brother Si.

708
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,120
Little Si.

709
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
No matter what kind of person it is,

710
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
someone will like it.

711
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Brother Si.

712
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
Brother Si.

713
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
Brother Si.

714
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Brother Si.

715
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
Brother Si.

716
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Brother Si.

717
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
Brother Si.

718
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Brother Si.

719
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,120
Brother Si.

720
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Brother Si.

721
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,120
Brother Si.

722
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
Brother Si.

723
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
Everyone will like it.

724
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
What a pity.

725
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,120
I'm going to be a bad woman.

726
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
You are so delicate.

727
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,120
You are so beautiful.

728
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,120
How can you write something

729
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,120
that I don't want on the banquet?

730
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
It's just a word from the Lady Wu.

731
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,120
You are so modest.

732
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
You are not a person.

733
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Lady Wu.

734
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Are you angry?

735
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Don't scold me.

736
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
I'm going.

737
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Xielou Baishi Bureau.

738
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,120
The book is 3000 miles away.

739
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,120
It's only for the sake of the poet's reputation.

740
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
No.

741
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
What's wrong?

742
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,120
What is carved on this lamp

743
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
is different from the one in the poem.

744
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Whether it's written in the poem

745
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
or sent by Xielou Bai,

746
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,120
they are all book covers.

747
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
And what is carved on this lamp

748
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,120
is a book cover.

749
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,120
But why did you change it?

750
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,120
Maybe the person in the poem is not Xielou Bai.

751
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,120
It's more like a woman.

752
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,120
The love story can be repeated,

753
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,120
and nothing can be changed.

754
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,120
I will wait for you for the rest of my life.

755
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
But fate is like a seal.

756
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,120
How can love be forgotten?

757
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,120
When the promise is turned into a sea of grass,

758
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,120
and we pass by each other,

759
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,120
the memories of being together never leave.

760
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
My persistent love

761
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:46,120
will be forever.

762
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,120
If the love story can be repeated,

763
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120
and nothing can be changed.

764
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,120
I will wait for you for the rest of my life.

765
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,120
But fate is like a seal.

766
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,120
How can love be forgotten?

767
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,120
When the promise is turned into a sea of grass,

768
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,120
and we pass by each other,

769
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,120
the memories of being together never leave.

770
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,120
My persistent love

771
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:32,120
will be forever.

772
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,120
