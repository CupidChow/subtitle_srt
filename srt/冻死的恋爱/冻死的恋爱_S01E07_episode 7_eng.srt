1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,710

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,780
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,010

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,130
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,110

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,140
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,740
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,270
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,090

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,200

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,240

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,240
 Yeo Reum!

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,950
 Goo Yeo Reum!

15
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,240
 She looks so pitiful.

16
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,580
 What in the world?

17
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,570
 Whoa!  Why's your bag so heavy?

18
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,460
 - Park Jae Hoon? 
 - Yeah!

19
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,080
 You should beat my score of 562.

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,480
 Go on. Fighting, fighting!

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,460
 That won't do.

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,420
 You've got a long way to go.

23
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,670
 I said I'll carry it.

24
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,460
 Why? I should at least carry the bag of a pitiful repeat student.

25
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,110
 How is school?

26
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,430
 Is it fun?

27
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,370
 It's so-so.

28
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,240
 It must be great.

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,910
 Campus romance...

30
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,980
 Have you gone on blind dates?

31
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,330
 Twice.

32
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,350
 The seniors set them up.

33
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,640
 Whoa, great.

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,990
 Was there anyone you liked?

35
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,810
 Not really.

36
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,400
 What have you been up to these days?

37
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,890
 You know, same old for me.

38
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,010
 Academy, home, library...

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,210
 Jae Hoon.

40
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,590
 Yeah.

41
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,910
 Drink with me today.

42
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,340
 I want to experience a blackout.

43
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,210
 Why are you trying to blackout before you even start drinking?

44
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,450
 Let's just try it, yeah?

45
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,140
 I want to drink and crawl on all fours like a dog.

46
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,590
 I don't drink that much.

47
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,630
 - Why not? 
 - Since I'm going to become a surgeon.

48
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,570
 I don't want to destroy my central nervous system for meaningless entertainment.

49
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,450
 God, you're so full of yourself.

50
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,400
 Yeah.

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
 Then...

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,410
 I'll drink like a maniac and you can take it slow.

53
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,070
 Why are you craving alcohol so much?

54
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,250
 Because I'm depressed.

55
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,690
 It's my one and only 20-year-old spring,

56
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,400
 and everyone is shining, but I'm the only gloomy one.

57
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,040
 The whole world is in color,

58
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,340
 but I'm the only one in black and white.

59
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,380
 Take it slow.

60
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,190
 - Next. 
 - Take it slow.

61
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,820
 Jae Hoon, what's a surgeon?

62
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,270
 A doctor who performs surgeries.

63
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,640
 Then you're going to cut people's skin open and look at blood and stuff?

64
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,540
 I'll be saving people with a knife.

65
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,730
 That was a bit cool just now.

66
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,130
 Yeo Reum, you said you wanted to be a mass communication major?

67
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,840
 Yeah, I'm going to become a PD.

68
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,980
 Why?

69
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,350
 Was there a specific motive?

70
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,860
 I just take classes at the academy all day long,

71
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,570
 study at the library until midnight,

72
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,600
 go home and wash up...

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,500
 And before I go to sleep,

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,530
 watching one episode of a variety show before bed

75
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,220
 is my single joy of the day.

76
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,610
 It's the only time of the day I get to laugh.

77
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,510
 That's why I also want to become someone who can make people laugh in the future.

78
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,340
 I want to make a program that's fun and warm.

79
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,700
 I think you can.

80
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,250
 - You're a funny kid. 
 - Right?

81
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,410
 I'm a funny kid, right?

82
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,540
 And you're warmhearted.

83
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,900
 Give me some, too.

84
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,220
 Hey.

85
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,330
 You never contacted me after graduation.

86
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,550
 I was a little sad.

87
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,680
 I didn't want to distract you from studying.

88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,780
 What about you? Why didn't you contact me?

89
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,190
 I didn't want to distract you from having fun.

90
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,000
 I have the most fun when I'm hanging out with you.

91
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,900
 Anyway, you can call me whenever you get depressed while studying.

92
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,670
 What if I call you and you're in class?

93
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,680
 - I'll leave in the middle. 
 - What if it's an exam period?

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,000
 That doesn't matter, either.

95
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,750
 Hey, are you okay?

96
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,230
 Man, are you drunk already?

97
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,750
 I should've known, judging by your quick pace.

98
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:35,010
 What if I contacted you and you're meeting with pretty girls?

99
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,780
 I won't do those anymore.

100
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,330
 Goo Yeo Reum.

101
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,570
 Yeo Reum, are you asleep?

102
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,390
 Yeo Reum?

103
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,300
 Did you sleep well?

104
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,950
 No, not that.

105
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,180
 What should I text her?

106
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,160

107
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,680
 I totally blacked out last night.

108
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,010
 I'm insane! How could a mere repeat student drink and kiss someone?

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,570
 The agony of the day after drinking and causing trouble...

110
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,900
 I'm moved, but I also want to die.

111
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,110
 Did you get home safe last night?

112
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,090
 Yeah, yeah, yeah...

113
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,250
 What about you?

114
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,200
 Are you feeling okay?

115
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,070
 I must've drank too much.

116
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,890
 My stomach feels so acidic, and my head really hurts, too.

117
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,780
 Really? Sure, sure.

118
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,010
 Yeo Reum, what do you remember? You don't remember anything at all?

119
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,260
 I don't remember anything at all. Nothing.

120
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,140
 Oh, really?

121
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,310
 Let's meet later tonight.

122
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,120
 Sorry, I'm going to head to the library after my classes ends.

123
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,840
 I wanted to have dinner with you.

124
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,610
 I'll buy you something delicious, Yeo Reum.

125
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,680
 I can't cut today, too.

126
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,110
 I'm never going to repeat for the third year.

127
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,160
 Never, never.

128
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,960
 I'm going to focus on studying from now on.

129
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,930
 Is that so...

130
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,330
 - I need to get going! 
 - Okay.

131
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,300
 Good luck in class.

132
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,540
 Okay, you, too!

133
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,080
 Okay.

134
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,340

135
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,220
We'll begin the chicken fight!

136
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,390
Ladies, please get ready for the game!

137
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,430

138
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,160
Man, my mom will scold me if I catch a cold.

139
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,240
Who do you think will win?

140
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,800
Jang Tae Mi.

141
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,700
She seems unexpectedly competitive.

142
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,130
I think Geum Soo Mi.

143
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,580
Her eyes are...

144
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,950
like the eyes of a carnivore.

145
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,720
Take a look.

146
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,130
Me? Me?

147
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,970
Camera, please get a bit closer.

148
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,310
Oh, no! No, no!

149
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,650
I told you, right?

150
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,390
Wow, Geum Soo Mi.

151
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,040
The starved lion of the "Kingdom of Love."

152
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,890
You're right. That is pretty unexpected.

153
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,140
She doesn't even budge.

154
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,640
- Hey! 
 - A tighter distance.

155
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,790
Hey!

156
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,650
Are you okay?

157
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,470
Yes, I'm okay.

158
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,360
Close up on the expression.

159
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,000
Jang Tae Mi!

160
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,470
Did he just do that?

161
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,320
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

162
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,830
I slightly sprained it.

163
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,670
Can you get up?

164
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,130
No, you can't like this.

165
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,940
Hold on to me.

166
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,370
Park Ji Wan.

167
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,120
Are you okay?

168
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,740
I'm... okay...

169
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,350
Get up.

170
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,000
Your... clothes got ripped.

171
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,140
Here, use this to cover yourself.

172
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,010
Thank you.

173
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,080
You'll be okay.

174
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,430
Man... I think we're done for.

175
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,080
We didn't get selected for first impressions,

176
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,700
we got splashed by water, and we don't have a date ticket.

177
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,010
I'm going to be so humiliated in front of everyone I know once this broadcasts.

178
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,570
I know.

179
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,200
I really wanted to win a date ticket today.

180
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,290
I felt the need to do something, so I ground my teeth and tried to win,

181
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,180
but I couldn't even win and just became the vicious bitch.

182
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm doomed.

183
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,880
You were pretty scary earlier.

184
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,190
- Sorry. 
 - I was the first one you attacked!

185
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,340
Am I such a pushover?

186
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,620
That's not it.

187
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,870
You looked the most dainty.

188
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,290
Hey— No way!

189
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,410
Really!

190
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,940
- Gosh. 
 - Really.

191
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,850
Please return to your places.

192
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,220
Park Ji Wan, please choose the man you want to go on a date with.

193
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,510
The man... I want to go on a date with...

194
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,560
is Kim Joon Ho.

195
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,270
Would you like to...

196
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,900
go on a date with me?

197
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,180
It would be my honor.

198
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,490
Showers are heading our way, so we're going to wrap up!

199
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,050
- Good job! 
 - Good job.

200
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,600
Gosh!

201
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,000
The game turned out fun,

202
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,400
but their date gives me zero anticipation.

203
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,990
I'm curious.

204
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,210
It's Park Ji Wan's first date ever,

205
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,540
so there's excitement to that.

206
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,730
Sure.

207
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,990
We do need a subplot, so they can be the side dishes.

208
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,600
Let's aim for something sticky for the main dish.

209
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,900
With a deep kiss.

210
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,170
Kang Chae Ri, let's not go too far.

211
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,750
What do you mean?

212
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,570
Physical touch should occur naturally when two people's feelings align.

213
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,220
Without the staff's intervention.

214
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,780
Did I tell you to force them?

215
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,200
We'll make a plan, create the mood,

216
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,860
and make their feelings naturally align.

217
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,670
Hey, even so, how can they kiss on the first date—

218
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,980
In a world where one-night stands are a piece of cake, kissing is nothing.

219
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,020
Are you a conservative woman?

220
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,290
No, nothing like that—

221
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,990
I already announced it—

222
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,370
Everyone is creating a plan, so you should contribute an idea as well.

223
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,090
Eat up.

224
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,170
Enjoy your food!

225
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,620
 - Okay.  
 - I leave PD Goo Yeo Reum in your care!

226
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,940
- It's so good! 
 - Thank you!

227
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,880
All right, this is all on PD Goo Yeo Reum!

228
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeo Reum!

229
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,560
- Yeah. 
 - I looked all over for you.

230
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,920
Why are you eating in the corner?

231
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,760
I've been pushed around by everyone,

232
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,630
so I wanted to at least eat in peace.

233
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm going to have to intrude on your peace.

234
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,510
What are you doing?

235
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,620
Here. You don't need to get the meat off the bone for me.

236
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,590
Just eat it.

237
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,870
Oh, what about you? Have you eaten?

238
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,120
You think the boss of a restaurant will starve?

239
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,480
Hurry and eat.

240
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,210
Meat is the best for when you're low on energy.

241
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,860
It's delicious.

242
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,950
How you're feeling...

243
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,240
and if it's bearable...

244
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,160
Can I ask you these things?

245
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,010
I don't feel great,

246
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,110
but it's bearable.

247
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,730
I need to film others dating,

248
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,520
but my love cells are at rock bottom right now.

249
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,930
Forget about love and the likes.

250
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,430
I hope the earth will end.

251
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,160
That's how I feel.

252
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000
Watching others date with rosy eyes isn't that enjoyable.

253
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,140
But work is still work,

254
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,220
so it's bearable.

255
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,940
Your program's going to be a hit.

256
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,300
Your emotions are so melodramatic, so Season 2 will be a hit.

257
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,600
Our main PD is a totally crazy bitch,

258
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,570
but I think I can do something crazier than she can.

259
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,710
Good, good. Show them your craziness!

260
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,300
You can do it!

261
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,230
I can do it.

262
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,640
- Yeo Reum. 
 - Yeah?

263
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,060
You know I'm always on your side, right?

264
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,740
Yeah, I know.

265
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,380
Eat up.

266
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,680
Our little Jang Geum. 
  (T/N: Historical female figure known for cooking.)

267
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,740
Put one on top.

268
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,930
There's something fishy.

269
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,010
What is?

270
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,200
There's something fishy!

271
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,790
- I'm asking, what? 
 - Look.

272
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,270
Park Jae Hoon stars in a matchmaking program like this.

273
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,200
There is quite a considerable error in the context.

274
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,700
There's something that's being kept from me here somewhere.

275
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,310
Which is why Park Jae Hoon is here doing this!

276
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,020
Don't speak like you know everything about me.

277
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,150
I also... hunger for a relationship.

278
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,420
Does that mean you're an attention seeker like John Jang or Ssamjang or whatever?

279
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,200
- Is that right? 
 - That's right.

280
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,180
I must be an attention seeker.

281
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,020
As if.

282
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,750
How's Yeo Reum doing? Is she doing better?

283
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,060
Well... she's okay. Trying hard not to show it.

284
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,210
Okay. You should take care of her since you're already here.

285
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,700
Take a look while you pass by.

286
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,770
Hey, what are friends for?

287
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,320
When she needs it, give her your support!

288
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,690
- I confessed to Yeo Reum and got rejected. 
 - And get rejected!

289
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,970
What? When?

290
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,120
A few days ago.

291
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,640
You crazy...

292
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,350
You lunatic.

293
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,880
Tell me everything on a nano-level, and don't leave out a single detail.

294
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,220
"I don't plan to make a move for now. Just keep my feelings in mind."

295
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,900
That's what I said, but she said that's overwhelming.

296
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,400
She asked to stay friends, so I said okay.

297
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,920
That's how nonchalant you are about coming on this program?

298
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,330
Goodness, gosh.

299
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,860
The timing between you two is twisted. Twisted!

300
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,030
For now... For now, I don't want to overwhelm her.

301
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,300
Until Yeo Reum can gather herself and feel better, I'm going to shut up and wait.

302
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,520
I mean, what can you gain by shutting up and waiting?

303
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,580
Then, what can I do?

304
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,800
- Look. 
 - Okay.

305
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,970
Slight... give her slight pressure

306
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,240
as if you're there but not there.

307
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,640
Slide in without her realizing it.

308
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,310
"Huh? Who was that?" and bam! It's you.

309
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,700
That's what you should do while waiting!

310
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,970
- Gosh, you potato. 
 - Is that right?

311
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,630
Of course!

312
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,620
Jae Hoon, that's what a person's heart is like.

313
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,800
It caves in when it's at its weakest.

314
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,460
Not just cave in but fall over.

315
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,510
That is valid.

316
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,740
You're right.

317
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,160
Don't get her stolen by some random guy. Okay?

318
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,780
Stay alert!

319
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,340
Senior! I'm here.

320
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,980
You're here?

321
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,630
- What about food? 
 - I barely caught the food truck in time.

322
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,300
Good job.

323
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,260
Oh, Senior. A brief consultation, please?

324
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,250
- Consultation? 
 - Yes.

325
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,060
Consultation?

326
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,820
What consultation?

327
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,690
Why would you hold a consultation in there?

328
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,150
Why? What is it?

329
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,090
Please take a look at this.

330
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,530
Gosh, what is it?

331
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,790
I discovered this while editing, but I felt uncomfortable.

332
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,380
Here.

333
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,820
Senior Chae Ri went in and turned off the audio...

334
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,860
And after they shared a discussion,

335
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,940
the next scene is when Han Ji Yeon appears at the swimming pool.

336
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,120
- What about it? 
 - Look. In slow motion.

337
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,950
I think Han Ji Yeon fell into the pool intentionally.

338
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,980
I think Senior Kang Chae Ri ordered her to.

339
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,450
No way.

340
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,720
I tried reading their lips.

341
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,840
"I thought there weren't any scripts."

342
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,750
"We don't have scripts."

343
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,840
"However..."

344
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,780
"You should write your own script."

345
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,900
What do you think? It fits, right?

346
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,980
That's what they said, right?

347
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,830
Sang Woo, we're a variety program.

348
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,790
We're not "Unanswered Questions."

349
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,700
I know that...

350
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,670
I also know that it's all a script to a certain degree.

351
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,010
But Park Jae Hoon is your friend, and he joined after a rushed request.

352
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,270
You should be aware of any suspicious situations.

353
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,350
 It's shaking?

354
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,660
 Senior, don't tease me because I'm young.

355
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,080
 When did I ever tease you?

356
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,220
 Are you toying with me right now?

357
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,780
 How could I... toy around with you?

358
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,490
 I'm not.

359
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,630
 Please toy around with me.

360
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,300
 We are not suited for each other.

361
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,260
 You haven't even done it with me...

362
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,780
 How would you know our chemistry?

363
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,110
No.

364
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,100
It's probably not. It must not be.

365
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,780
Her clothes?

366
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,580
It might be summer, but the ground is still cold. Gosh.

367
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,120
♫  I want to meet someone, hey come on  ♫

368
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,540
♫  I want to love again, I want to  ♫

369
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,770
♫  I love you  ♫

370
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,620
- You didn't need to. 
 - Please sit comfortably.

371
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,740
Kim Sang Woo!

372
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,770
♫  The second time was bearable  ♫

373
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,450
Thanks!

374
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,540
♫  But the third and fourth time  ♫

375
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,160
He's quick.

376
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,730
I think we should buff that.

377
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,860
Prop team!

378
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,990
Please come here.

379
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,200
Hold on.

380
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,460
Water.

381
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,630
Here.

382
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,140
Water.

383
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,400
♫  I can't like someone intentionally  ♫

384
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,600
♫  Even if I have to live alone  ♫

385
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,160
♫  My love, my love  ♫

386
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,720
♫  I want to find it no matter what it takes  ♫

387
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,930
♫  My first love that makes my heart pound  ♫

388
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,870
Writer, do you have an extra hair tie?

389
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,170
Let's see...

390
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,440
Here.

391
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,600
Thank you.

392
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,140
Senior, tie it with this.

393
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,520
- Thank you. 
 - Who in the world is that guy?

394
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,510
- But Park Jae Hoon. 
 - Yes.

395
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,420
Why did you ask for a hair tie?

396
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,220
Was it to give to someone?

397
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,830
Yes...

398
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,570
If it's for Ji Yeon, please give it to her in front of the camera.

399
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,820
These trivial episodes are the real deal.

400
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,460
Right.

401
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,310
I'm going to use it.

402
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,290
It's for your hair?

403
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,110
I don't want pimples.

404
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,800
♫  I want to love again  ♫

405
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,400
♫  I want to meet someone  ♫

406
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,800
♫  I want to love again  ♫

407
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,430
♫  I want to love  ♫

408
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,030
♫  I want to love again  ♫

409
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,180
 I haven't thought about making a commitment for a very long time.

410
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,530

411
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,630

412
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,170

413
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,690

414
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,350

415
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,820
N-No way.

416
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,800
The food is here!

417
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,100
Let's eat first, everyone.

418
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,540
This is all so we can eat. Right?

419
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,210
Great.

420
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,150
- Don't we need to shake this? 
 - That's right.

421
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,440
- Mix. 
 - Just trust me on this.

422
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,500
Wow, look at the visuals! It looks so good!

423
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,870
All right, let's dig in. I'll wrap it in lettuce.

424
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,650
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

425
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,970
You know how to eat.

426
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,400
As expected of our PD.

427
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,950
- It's so good! 
 - It's totally delicious!

428
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,050
How is it? How is it? It's good, right?

429
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,290
It's so delicious!

430
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,510
- Wow. 
 - PD Kang.

431
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,980
- It's so good. 
 - You can eat.

432
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,770
- Eat up, eat up. 
 - Hurry and eat.

433
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,780
Please eat, it's so good.

434
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,070
The cast started a drinking game.

435
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,740
- Drinking game? 
 - Yes.

436
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,820
- It'll be fun if someone gets wasted. 
 - Exactly.

437
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,910
- How's the mood? 
 - The mood is good for now.

438
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,030
Dig in. It's really good.

439
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,340
Okay, then. I'm going to ask the next question.

440
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,890
Hold up your hands.

441
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,390
To the center. To the center.

442
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,970
All right.

443
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:14,010
I've been in "some" with two people simultaneously!

444
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,490
Yes, thumbs up. No, thumbs down. One, two, three!

445
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,520

446
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,290
W-What's this? You three.

447
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,000
Park Jae Hoon, you were probably popular.

448
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,460
Don't we need a lie detector?

449
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,430
"Some" is a form of dating.

450
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,590
He's trying to maintain his image!

451
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,870
If you haven't, hurry up and drink.

452
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,890
 Drink!

453
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,960
 Drink! Drink!

454
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,530
Hee Chang, make sure they don't fall low on alcohol.

455
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,600
 All right.

456
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,640
It's delicious.

457
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,570
It's my turn now!

458
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,660
I've kissed for more than an hour!

459
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,960
That's intense, that's intense!

460
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,100
Not a peck, but a kiss.

461
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,250
Is it okay to ask that on broadcast?

462
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,890
Everyone's an adult. Isn't mature content of this extent okay?

463
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,690
One, two, three!

464
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,660

465
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,910
Soo Mi!

466
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,960
Jae Hoon and Ji Wan. Drink!

467
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,760
 Drink! Drink! Drink!

468
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,640
I'll be her black knight! 
  (T/N: He drinks for her and is granted a wish.)

469
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,210
- What? 
 - What knight?

470
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,330
- What the? 
 - Whoa.

471
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,770
Geum Soo Mi, would you like to go outside for some air with me?

472
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,580
I'd love to.

473
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,030
Hey!

474
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,570
Deviant behavior during a game— Yes or no?

475
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,870
Please let it slide.

476
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,380
This isn't a retreat. It's the "Kingdom of Love."

477
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,870
Let's let them go.

478
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,470
I hope it goes well.

479
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,400
Fine, go ahead.

480
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,500
Go, go.

481
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,560
What the heck?

482
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,300
I've... wanted to die after breaking up

483
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,160
with the person I love.

484
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,750
I like that question.

485
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,620
I know. I'm getting sentimental.

486
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,760
All right, one, two, three!

487
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,630

488
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,080
I thought you'd be someone very emotional.

489
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,570
Honestly...

490
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,580
I'm a mo-sol. 
  (T/N: Never been in a relationship.)

491
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,170
Mo-sol?

492
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,380
I've never broken up with anyone.

493
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,120
Whoa, that's so sad.

494
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:06,730
 I've kissed in a public place before.

495
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,680
 Isn't Ji Wan drinking too much?

496
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,420
 Someone should be her black knight.

497
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,150
 - She drank so much. 
 - You're not drunk, are you?

498
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,100
Ji Wan.

499
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,090
Are you drunk?

500
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,840
This is the most drunk I've ever been in my life.

501
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,860
It's really fun.

502
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,110
It's also my first time playing games

503
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,850
and having fun with people.

504
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:04,230
I was a total outsider in college.

505
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:09,890
I've never been to club events, nor any retreats.

506
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:16,560
I've never really done anything all my life.

507
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:25,100
Ji Wan, it's really late, so you should go in and sleep.

508
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,320
You need to sleep in order to sober up.

509
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,560
Let's go in, come on.

510
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,240
J-Ji Wan, w-what's wrong?

511
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,040
I just want to escort you back—

512
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,720
Don't touch me.

513
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,960
I'm sorry.

514
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,310
Yes.

515
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,590
Please excuse me.

516
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,880
Well, you're already in here.

517
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,240
I dropped by to see if you needed anything particular for your date tomorrow.

518
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,850
I'm good for now.

519
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,790
It's the first date, so it's going to be set up very romantically.

520
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,340
Yes, thank you.

521
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,310
Okay.

522
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,940
Excuse me, PD Kim!

523
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,990
Yes?

524
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,790
Hold on.

525
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,770
Let's talk.

526
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,970
About what?

527
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,140
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to ask you this, but...

528
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,180
do you have a girlfriend?

529
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,840
I don't.

530
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,440
Why do you...

531
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,570
Then what's your ideal type?

532
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,850
For example, do you prefer older women?

533
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,890
Most of the women I've dated were all older, I guess.

534
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,030
- Older? 
 - Yes.

535
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,500
Older?

536
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,380
Older.

537
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,830
I knew it.

538
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,140
Then, how many years older are you willing to date?

539
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,180
I never exactly set a limit...

540
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,680
How many years...

541
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,580
But why?

542
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,320
Why do you keep asking me personal questions?

543
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,000
A person can ask questions...

544
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,560
How do you feel about a blind date?

545
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,650
My younger sister.

546
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,620
She's nice. She's very nice.

547
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,720
And she's two years older than you.

548
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,590
How about it? She's great.

549
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,890
- You like her? 
 - Yes.

550
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,560
Good.

551
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,390
Is there anything we can use from tonight?

552
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,900
There was something weird...

553
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,460
Park Ji Wan and Kim Joon Ho.

554
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,940
- They fought. 
 - They fought?

555
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,470
Well, technically, it was a slight conflict.

556
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,940
- Turn on the recording. 
 - Okay.

557
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,030
Here.

558
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,930
There is something going on.

559
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,400
Doesn't it seem a bit odd?

560
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,110
You're right.

561
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,810
Who's accompanying Ji Wan and Joon Ho's date tomorrow?

562
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,760
Me.

563
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,550
Writer Jang, please join them tomorrow.

564
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,570
- Me? 
 - Go and ask what happened.

565
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:36,430
We can also check if there was a problem we weren't aware of.

566
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,450
Okay.

567
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,140
What about Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon's kiss?

568
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,580
Is there a plan yet?

569
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,610
I'm going to fix the location for the lounge of the hotel sponsoring us.

570
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,700
The nightscape here is killer.

571
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,460
Well, the space looks good.

572
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,120
There's a private secret room made of glass there.

573
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,690
After some drinks, I'm going to ask them to go inside there.

574
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,770
Are you the one accompanying them tomorrow?

575
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,720
Yes.

576
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,200
Not bad, but...

577
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,700
Goo Yeo Reum, what do you think?

578
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,560
Let's not put a camera inside the room.

579
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,270
There you go speaking nonsense again.

580
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,770
The recruiting team that looked around the site right here.

581
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,430
They said that the sky-blue curtains are pretty.

582
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,680
Put those two in there, set the lighting,

583
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,970
and let's film their silhouettes from outside.

584
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,150
It'd be great if they kiss,

585
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,550
and even if they don't, the mood will be set.

586
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,780
Doesn't it sound romantic?

587
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,060
I'm about to be convinced.

588
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,760
Tell me more.

589
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,820
If we add a camera into the room, then they'll both be aware of it.

590
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,780
Let's match their pace and make them feel at ease.

591
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,070
All right, let's do that.

592
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,890
- Hee Chang, you got that? 
 - Yes. That's how I'll proceed.

593
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,090
Okay, everyone did a great job today, too.

594
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,960
All right, dismissed.

595
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,300
- Dismissed. 
 - Good job.

596
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,330
Good work.

597
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,850
Sang Woo!

598
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,780
Yes, Senior.

599
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,270
During the shoot tomorrow, keep a careful eye on Park Ji Wan.

600
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,700
Are you worried?

601
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,470
No.

602
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,640
I insisted that she be selected.

603
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,900
The more I observe her from the side,

604
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,620
I can tell she's a pure-hearted and good person.

605
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,590
So I want to show that to the viewers.

606
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,880
Okay. I understand.

607
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,600
I'll leave it to you.

608
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,320
Let's go.

609
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,270
Writer Jang!

610
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,310
As the emerging shot later, we should film a full shot and close-up.

611
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:17,010
♫  A love so precious  ♫

612
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,220
The car's coming. Let's get ready!

613
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,080
We'll start filming now!

614
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,350
♫  Burned me black and left  ♫

615
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:30,270
♫  I hoped you'd be my final love  ♫

616
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,600
They're so cute. It's Ji Wan this time.

617
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,720
How pretty.

618
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,360
♫  How will I live on trusting?  ♫

619
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,140
♫  What's wrong with you? You saw wrong  ♫

620
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,730
♫  I've lived by my guts all this time  ♫

621
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:49,770
♫  But after loving once, I got hurt big time  ♫

622
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,890
Shall we?

623
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,680
♫  Summer  ♫

624
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,810
♫  I can't without you, never  ♫

625
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,630
I think we need to go this way.

626

♫  I miss you, please come back to me  ♫

♫  I'm definitely going to find you  ♫

♫  And we'll have a beautiful love forever  ♫

630
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,620
Be careful on the way up.

631
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,600
♫  This summer  ♫

632

♫  Where are you, my love?  ♫

633

♫  I think I know what love is now  ♫

634
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,470
It must have taken a lot of effort, right?

635
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,770
Yeah.

636
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,130
♫  I can't live because I miss you so much  ♫

637
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,770
- They're too awkward. 
 - Exactly.

638
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,960
I'm not sure if we'll get a good date out of this today.

639
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:50,000
♫  This summer  ♫

640
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,360
Shall we toast?

641
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,010
Ji Wan, what's wrong?

642
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,670
I'm just so thankful.

643
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,120
For what?

644
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,020
You must be upset because of me.

645
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,840
But you're not showing it,

646
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,360
and you continue being kind to me.

647
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,660
I'm sorry... and thankful.

648
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:51,100
I was... just worried that you

649
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,420
might be mad.

650
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,470
I'm really sorry for surprising you yesterday.

651
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,460
It was my mistake.

652
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,530
If I made you feel bad...

653
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,540
No. It's my problem.

654
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:07,450
You did nothing wrong.

655
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,860
In middle school...

656
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,510
whenever it was a holiday,

657
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,570
my older cousin would...

658
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,540
touch my body.

659
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,100
What?

660
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:38,500
I couldn't tell anyone.

661
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,070
This is the first time.

662
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,650
When I was in school,

663
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,840
whenever the holidays approached,

664
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,140
I was so afraid...

665
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,760
that I wanted to die.

666
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,470
I'm sorry, Ji Wan.

667
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,000
I... I really made a mistake.

668
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,470
It's not your fault.

669
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,410
I'm... the weird one.

670
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,020
What do you mean?

671
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,110
Don't say that.

672
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,900
I wanted to escape from that...

673
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,190
I wanted to escape from those memories...

674
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,270
so like a hikkikomori, 
  (T/N: Someone who lives in their room and doesn't come out)

675
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,390
I stayed holed up in my room.

676
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,750
I couldn't...

677
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,840
even love myself.

678
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,360
Now, I won't... live like that any longer.

679
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,750
I'm going to change.

680
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,970
I'm going to lose weight and I'm going to love.

681
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,700
I joined "Kingdom of Love"

682
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,400
because I wanted to become happy.

683
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,860
Ji Wan...

684
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,920
People said that they felt

685
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,120
their hearts flutter

686
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,840
and pound while reading my webtoons,

687
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,140
but I've never once...

688
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,660
felt like that.

689
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,310
So I want to know...

690
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,370
what that feels like.

691
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,000
Goo Yeo Reum. You got a good catch.

692
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,940
Park Ji Wan just dropped a bomb.

693
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,140
- What do you mean? 
 - Writer Jang just called me.

694
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,990
She talked about how she was sexually molested during middle school.

695
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,830
- What? 
 - So we'll begin this season with this as the first issue.

696
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,520
We won't need Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon's kiss scene anymore.

697
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,760
Did Park Ji Wan consent to broadcasting that?

698
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,900
What's there to consent to?

699
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,600
She clearly knew the camera was rolling and still chose to disclose it.

700
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,320
So, of course, it's being broadcasted.

701
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,940
Choosing Park Ji Wan was a divine move.

702
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,770
I approve.

703
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,940
Hey, Sang Woo. Where are you?

704
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,890
I'm on my way to the editing room to edit today's footage.

705
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:46,080
I was actually about to call you.

706
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,560
 Yeah, how was Park Ji Wan today?

707
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,450
Park Ji Wan came to me after filming...

708
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,270
 Excuse me, PD Kim.

709
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,030
 What I said earlier,

710
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,870
 I don't want that to be broadcasted.

711
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:04,200
 You mean... about your middle school days?

712
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,320
 I don't know what got into me earlier.

713
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,670
 If Mom watches the show, she'll be miserable.

714
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,040
 Mom doesn't know anything.

715
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,200
 It happened a long time ago and it's in the past.

716
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,600
 I don't want to make it a big deal now.

717
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,950
 I ask you this favor.

718
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,900
What should we do, Senior?

719
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:35,000
For now, don't share today's footage on the server and just hold onto it.

720
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,160
 Will that be okay?

721
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,190
- Senior Kang Chae Ri's going to throw a fit.  
  - I'll call you.

722
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,920
Just hold on until tonight.

723
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,490
Okay.

724
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,340
Are you crazy?

725
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,070
Wow...

726
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:59,730
You really have a knack for sidestepping high viewing rates.

727
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,670
The party concerned says she wants us to edit it out.

728
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,610
If we start listening to the requests of the cast, there will be no end.

729
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,590
Editing rights are entirely up to the staff.

730
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,440
I know. But this is a big deal.

731
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,780
It's a personal trauma and wound.

732
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,370
We don't know what the after-effects will be.

733
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,570
We need to tread carefully.

734
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,640
If you want to make programs while concerning yourself with these things,

735
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,640
then transfer to the religion channel.

736
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,620
There's something called broadcasting ethics.

737
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,820
There's a line we shouldn't cross.

738
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,280
Was it a hidden camera?

739
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,650
Did someone force her to speak?

740
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,540
A grown adult made her own choice to speak in front of the camera.

741
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,690
That's unspoken consent that we can broadcast it.

742
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,780
It's a big wound to her and her family.

743
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,140
Broadcasting something like that is a huge deal when you're not a celebrity.

744
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,450
- Must you pour salt on her wound? 
 - Yes.

745
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,720
I'm going to broadcast it.

746
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,810
It's not illegal.

747
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,760
- Hey, Kang Chae Ri! 
 - Goo Yeo Reum!

748
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,220
I won't stand you abusing your seniority anymore.

749
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,510
I'll get that kiss scene.

750
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,480
- What? 
 - Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon's kiss scene.

751
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,270
Let's make that our first issue.

752
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:20,050
I'll think about it if you get sexy footage.

753
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,580
Gosh. So annoying.

754
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,170
 Yes, and some ice, too.

755
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,460
 - Director. 
 - Sure, sure.

756
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,970
- Thank you. 
 - All right.

757
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,650
Okay, Writer, we need to hurry up.

758
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,200
There's not much time.

759
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,680
Please rush the settings a bit!

760
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,050
We'll do a test shot!

761
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,960
Okay, looks good!

762
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,220
This is nothing.

763
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,360
- Beautiful view, right? 
 - Yeah.

764
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,590
It's so pretty.

765
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,420
Thank you.

766
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,320
No problem.

767
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,580
The atmosphere here is really nice.

768
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,160
Right? The atmosphere is nice.

769
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,170
Don't you think love will appear out of thin air?

770
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:53,450
I'm starting to adjust to your straightforward speech.

771
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,940
I often drank this wine while studying in the States.

772
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,920
It's bringing back memories.

773
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,340
You must like wine.

774
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,600
I like it since I can drink it slowly.

775
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,910
Wine is different with the first and last glass.

776
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,420
The better the wine,

777
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:22,500
the longer we need to wait before it shows its true colors.

778
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,940
I thought it was a shame every time I went on a blind date.

779
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,270
Having to show my true colors in that short time.

780
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,500
I just need a little more time.

781
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,810
If I'm given a little more time, I can show that I'm a great person.

782
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:47,400
You don't recognize a great person by waiting.

783
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,100
You just recognize such quality right away.

784
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:54,630
You're like that, too.

785
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,200
- Senior, what brings you here? 
 - Hello.

786
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,100
It's an important shoot, so I stopped by.

787
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,480
- Oh, okay. 
 - Is it going well?

788
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,150
It's totally awesome.

789
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,950
It looks pretty.

790
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,080

791
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,940
PD Goo... You're here?

792
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,590
Is your date going well?

793
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,620
Yes. It's so nice here.

794
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:48,300
Han Ji Yeon, there's something I'd like to ask.

795
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,100
I won't beat around the bush.

796
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,790
When you fell into the pool on the first day,

797
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:57,250
was that... intentional?

798
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,530
Yes.

799
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,040
I fell intentionally.

800
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:08,250
Can I ask why you did that?

801
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:12,030
I wanted things to go well with Park Jae Hoon.

802
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:15,340
I wanted to grab his attention somehow.

803
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:21,060
Do you have sincere feelings or... is it because of the program?

804
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,540
You're aware we met on a blind date, right?

805
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,520
I continued to like him.

806
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,100
It's the first time I liked someone after coming of age.

807
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,670
When I met him again here, I thought it was fate.

808
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:42,150
Of course, that's just my opinion.

809
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:46,010
Let me ask you one more intrusive question.

810
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:49,800
Then, are you okay with physical touch?

811
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,320
- Physical touch as in— 
 - A kiss.

812
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,470
We need it for the flow of the program,

813
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,650
so if you two are okay with it... we want to film it tonight.

814
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,310
What a blow to my pride.

815
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,910
I'm okay with it,

816
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,310
but I don't think Jae Hoon will be.

817
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,390
They're really forcing us to date.

818
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,060
We'll proceed in this order.

819
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,870
Okay, please ask the two participants to standby.

820
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,840
All right.

821
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,820
Okay.

822
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,910
We'll start filiming in five minutes...

823
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,850
Huh? Where did Ji Yeon go?

824
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:53,860
We need to start filming right away.

825
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,030
I was in here alone.

826
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,860
Oh, really?

827
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,870
Hold on.

828
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,070
Han Ji Yeon!

829
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,540
Han Ji Yeon, are you in here?

830
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:18,130
- What are you doing here? 
 - PD Goo, have you seen Han Ji Yeon?

831
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,370
I saw her in the restroom earlier.

832
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,630
Why's she taking so long to fix her makeup?

833
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,760
I'll go ahead.

834
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,370
What's wrong?

835
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,310
Jae Hoon...

836
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,310
I have a favor to ask you.

837
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,250
What is it?

838
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,920
- Let me borrow your lips. 
 - What?

839
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,050
If Han Ji Yeon comes in, just...

840
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,870
make the mood and...

841
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,740
give her a kiss.

842
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:11,610
I need to prevent a major accident.

843
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:14,380
I'm sincerely asking you.

844
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:21,480
- You call this a favor? 
 - We're not in our twenties.

845
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:26,000
We're grown adults, so a simple kiss is okay. Right?

846
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,550
In a world where one nights are a piece of cake.

847
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,170
Don't you think so?

848
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,510
It doesn't matter to you if I kiss another woman?

849
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,590
Wow.

850
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,560
Wow...

851
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,550
The job of a PD is incredible.

852
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:57,710
You know I have feelings for you, and you still want to ask me that?

853
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,250
Jae Hoon, you see...

854
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,690
I'm in a real stitch.

855
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:09,560
Goo Yeo Reum, let me ask you again.

856
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,920
You really don't care if I kiss another woman?

857
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,310
Okay, we'll resume filiming!

858
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,460
A simple kiss is fine?

859
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,400
In a world where one nights are a piece of cake?

860
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,000
- Jae Hoon... 
 - If they are... then why don't you try it with me?

861
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,860
♫  Slow down the pace, you might slip  ♫

862
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:07,420
♫  Look around, you might be surprised to bump into something  ♫

863
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:15,400
♫  It's still not good timing, you're standing still  ♫

864
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:21,320
♫  We can stand together, a bit closer  ♫

865
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:29,000
♫  It's unfamiliar as my heart flutters suddenly  ♫

866
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,560
♫  It's awkward, but carefully and slowly  ♫

867
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,640
♫  Just like this, making eye contact  ♫

868
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,220
♫  A love that started, unfathomable  ♫

869
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,200
♫  Take care not to get mixed up  ♫

870
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:48,600
♫  Match your timing and don't be too clumsy  ♫

871
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,420

872
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,170
 - She suddenly disappeared. 
 - Disappeared?

873
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,400
 How can you make a mistake like this?

874
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,880
 If it gets broadcasted, it'll gather a lot of attention.

875
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,940
 - Would they edit it out? 
 - It can't be broadcasted.

876
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,290
 Senior, I made a big mess.

877
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,720
 What? Why did you do that?

878
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,240
 The community is on fire. They want to know who Park Jae Hoon kissed.

879
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,810
 How can you link a kiss scene like that?

880
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,180
 This is how you make a program.

881
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,790
 Jae Hoon, let's meet up.

882
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,500
 It has to be you for me.

883
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,810
 I'm misunderstanding by myself?

884
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,370
 I became more certain yesterday.

885
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,490
 Look me in the eyes and tell me.

886
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:22,600
♫  It's unfamiliar as my heart flutters suddenly  ♫
