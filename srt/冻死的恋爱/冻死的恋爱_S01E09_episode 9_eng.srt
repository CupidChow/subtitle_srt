00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,970

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,670

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,710
♫  Dive with you, towards the wide sea  ♫

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,110

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,080
♫  Jump in love, I fly with wings called you  ♫

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,110

♫  There is nothing to be afraid of  ♫

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,160
♫  In the world called you, it sparkles and lingers here  ♫

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,480
♫  What I found while wandering was you who 
 was always by my side  ♫

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,360
♫  I'm already ready for you  ♫

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,010

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,770

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,010

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,570

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,240
 Yes?

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,430
 Hey, Dr. Park. What brings you here?

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,330
 Doctor, I have the presentation for the Spring Conference next month.

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,040
 I'd like you to take a look.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,740
 Okay.

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,500
 I'll review it thoroughly over the weekend and let you know.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,100
 Thank you.

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,560
 I heard you don't leave the hospital at all after becoming the chief.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,380
 Well, it isn't that I don't leave. I can't.

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,960
 There are emergencies constantly.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,860
 It's the fate of a neurosurgeon.

25
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,870
 You lost a lot of weight.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,350
 Eat properly, even if it's just one meal.

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,740
 Okay.

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,560
 Jae Hoon, let's have a drink next ftime you're off...

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,560
 Just you and me.

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,210
 Okay, Father.

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,540
 Do you have an appointment?

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,150
 I'm going to my high school alumni gathering for the first time in a while.

33
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,120
 I see.

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,220
 Keep a good lookout here.

35
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,360
 - Have a good time. 
 - Okay.

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,630

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,260

38
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,280
- Thank you. 
 - You can have this one right here.

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
Would you like fruit, too?

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,510
- I'll— 
 - Goodness, good morning!

41
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,030
 Hello.

42
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,300

43
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,020
I touched it first.

44
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,090
I don't think so.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,650
"Two men, comma...

46
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,500
very serious about strawberry jam, comma."

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,750
Please make it pink.

48
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,500
A deeper pink, like...

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,830
tacky flowery pink.

50
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,070
That's good.

51
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,560
Take out the last comma and

52
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,390
let's change it to a heart.

53
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,000

54
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,140
Eat it with milk.

55
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,090
Okay.

56
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,460
Thank you.

57
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,770
"Is today also going to be sweet?"

58
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,250
 If it gets aired, it'll gain a lot of attention.

59
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,800
 Will the staff edit that out?

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,570
 It can't ever be aired. Never.

61
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,690
 The broadcasting station would want to air it out.

62
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,820
 It really can't be aired, though.

63
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,600
Ms. Ji Wan... even if...

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,430
it's really only a what-if...

65
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,190
If it doesn't get edited, don't worry too much.

66
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,010
You have me.

67
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,670
Pardon me, but can I ask you one thing?

68
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,490
Sure. Of course.

69
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,920
During the first impression selection...

70
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,110
why did you choose me?

71
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,780
I was curious about your reason.

72
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,520
I fell for you at first sight.

73
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,170
At first sight?

74
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,110
Yes.

75
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,870
You have the impression that I tend to like.

76
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,470
The impression he tends to like?

77
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,580

78
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,300
Yes?

79
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,910
Senior, this is your Americano with three shots.

80
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,950
Gosh! I was craving caffeine so much right now.

81
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,850
Thank you.

82
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,160
I feel like I'm alive now.

83
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,030
Oh, Senior...

84
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,730
I saw a weird post while checking on the reactions on the SNS and

85
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,400
the community forum this morning.

86
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,100
What post?

87
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,950
It's a post regarding the cast member Park Jae Hoon.

88
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,100
One second, please.

89
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,240
Please take a look.

90
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,640
What's this?

91
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,140

92
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,940
Who the heck is spewing this nonsense?

93
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,050

This place has a lot of firepower so the stories spread quickly.

94
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,250
Journalists publish articles using posts from here.

95
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,180
It has more than 500 replies.

96
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,290
What do we do? It might get very noisy if things go wrong.

97
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,600
Unni, Unni, Unni! Unni, take a look at this.

98
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,590
What is it now?

99
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,590
Mr. Park Jae Hoon... was apparently kicked out from the hospital for malpractice.

100
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,710
What?

101
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,010

102
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,860

103
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,630
Shit. This is nuts.

104
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,750
Did you know about this?

105
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,750
- It's a baseless rumor. 
 - Are you sure?

106
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,420
Yes.

107
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,880
It's definitely not because of malpractice.

108
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,350
It might not be malpractice legally, but...

109
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,110
things like this matter because of ethics and morals.

110
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,490
Running away from a hospital while doing a fellowship isn't rational, either.

111
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,320
Jae Hoon had personal circumstances back then.

112
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,570
What's certain is that this post is a rumor.

113
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,770
Did a person die or not?

114
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,210
I'm asking if he has even the slightest reason to be criticized.

115
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,020
Did a person die during an operation or not?

116
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,190
Mr. Park Jae Hoon.

117
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,820
Hello.

118
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,460
I usually only stay in the monitor room, so I don't get to meet you in person.

119
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,980
That's true.

120
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,960
Is the filming doable?

121
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,340
Well... I couldn't adapt at first because

122
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,920
there were cameras everywhere.

123
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,140
But now, I think I got used to it.

124
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,920
Everyone's like that.

125
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,510
It's only strange at first,

126
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,450
but they all show their true colors eventually after getting used to it.

127
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,800
Are you also looking at my true colors?

128
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,790
Momentary viewer ratings spike every time you and

129
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,780
Ms. Han Ji Yeon show up together.

130
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,630
So I'm focusing more on appropriate

131
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,810
makeup rather than the true colors of you two...

132
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,910
as the producer.

133
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,170
I've been thinking about this...

134
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,370
but Ms. Kang Chae Ri, no...

135
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,390
PD Kang Chae Ri.

136
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,830
I think you're really funny.

137
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,630
I'm not really the funny type.

138
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,780
Getting your nose fractured, vomiting on the street,

139
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,300
and exposing other people's true colors...

140
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,760
I think you're more than funny enough.

141
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,820
If you think it'll be funny,

142
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,240
should I also try exposing you?

143
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,430
Sure.

144
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,230
- Aren't you scared? 
 - Of what?

145
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,840
You're being loved as the National Boyfriend, but 
  (T/N: Loved by the entire country)

146
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,300
a fall takes only a moment.

147
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm such an analog person that

148
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,680
I don't do SNS or go on my phone...

149
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,270
so the National Boyfriend title also

150
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,300
doesn't feel fitting for me, either.

151
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,950
Then, why did you come out here?

152
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,900
Didn't you come out because you wanted to be loved?

153
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,550
Love...

154
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,500
Of course, I do.

155
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,260
Then get your head on straight.

156
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,290
Love, popularity, hate, jealousy, and mockery...

157
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,560
Including turning an individual into a stupid idiot in a moment

158
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
is only a difference of one perilla leaf.

159
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,210
So use your chopsticks properly.

160
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,940
The producer is the one...

161
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,000
who holds the chopsticks.

162
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm the perilla leaf.

163
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,580
Why did you bring me here to be a perilla leaf?

164
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,930
I heard you told Yeo Reum to bring me here.

165
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,390
This is good enough for the full shot.

166
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,090
VJs, please get closer to them.

167
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
You're a good runner.

168
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,100
What the heck?

169
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,950
Ji Yeon, how unexpected.

170
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,980
What is?

171
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,690
I was really surprised at what a good runner you are.

172
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,840
I enjoy running.

173
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,820
You don't seem like the type to wear sweats.

174
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,340
I dressed up all this time to make good impressions.

175
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,570
Wait, then...

176
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,480
Oh, I see...

177
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,580
It's going to be hard to win with looks anyway.

178
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,310
I'm going to take it easy.

179
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,500
Why?

180
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,080
Was I... too straightforward again?

181
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,730
Well, nothing like that.

182
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,130
Struggling to look good and then losing my footing...

183
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,680
I acted stupid without realizing it.

184
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,490
I'm not going to do that anymore.

185
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,540
The comments people leave

186
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,680
all say I'm the national one-sided lover.

187
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,180
That must've been quite hurtful.

188
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,760
It doesn't matter.

189
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,050
Since it's already like this,

190
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,220
I'm going to set aside my reputation

191
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,700
and do things my way.

192
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,760
That's why I ran straight ahead today.

193
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,100
Bare-faced and sweaty...

194
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,090
and the sight of me panting...

195
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,210
Even if I don't look pretty, this is me.

196
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,330
Ji Yeon,

197
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,930
I thought this.

198
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,950
Who am I that this person is saying this to me?

199
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,250
I really...

200
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,240
think I received an undeserved love confession.

201
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Are you drawing the line again?

202
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

203
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,260
If I'm to respect that undeserved confession,

204
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,860
I realized that I should do my best to find out what kind of person you are.

205
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,580
While starring in this show,

206
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,910
I didn't think at all about...

207
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,840
what it meant or

208
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,730
how much impact it would hold.

209
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,120
I was too complacent.

210
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,350
Jae Hoon...

211
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,270
You told me

212
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,990
that the eyes can't hide anything.

213
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,840
I could really relate to those words...

214
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,980
and it made me not want to lie to anyone.

215
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,230
I can't promise you how anything will turn out

216
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,490
in the end,

217
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,950
but I'll do my best to treat you sincerely.

218
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,060
Now, I'm also curious about what kind of person you are.

219
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,970
Great job.

220
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,530
You, too.

221
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,130
Good job, Ji Yeon.

222
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,370
You guys did great.

223
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,390
We won't film our way back to the hotel.

224
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,770
You can go at ease.

225
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,610
Jae Hoon, can we talk for a moment?

226
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,930
Go on ahead...

227
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,140
to the car.

228
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,370
What?

229
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,860
Well...

230
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,080
About the reason you quit the hospital back then,

231
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,140
there are weird rumors circulating on the internet.

232
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,130
Rumors?

233
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,720
Well, they're just posts on a community forum for now,

234
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,060
but just in case.

235
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,480
We're discussing what we should do if things get blown up.

236
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,450
You want to use that for the show, too?

237
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,560
No... Jae Hoon, that's not what I—

238
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,400
How's everything so easy for you?

239
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,060
Or am I the one that's easy to you?

240
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,560
Don't try to mess with what happened back then.

241
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,330
 The producer is the one...

242
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,670
 who holds the chopsticks.

243
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,920
 And I'm the perilla leaf.

244
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,940
 Why did you bring me here to be a perilla leaf?

245
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,500
 I heard you told Yeo Reum to bring me here.

246
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,340
 Perilla leaves were raised in Asia such as Korea, India, and China since ancient times,

247
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,890
 but did you know that Korea is the only country that

248
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,190
 eats them for food?

249
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,380
 I didn't know that.

250
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,540
 In reality dating programs like this,

251
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,000
 doctors, lawyers,

252
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,270
 and other professionals must come out like kimchi at a restaurant.

253
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,180
 I couldn't just bring in fermented kimchi or geotjeori as a replacement. 
 (T/N: Unripe kimchi)

254
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,090
 I'm going to try making kimchi with perilla leaves this time.

255
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,600
 That's why I told her to bring you here.

256
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,080
 Since you have a refreshing vibe.

257
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,510
 I can't win with words.

258
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,070
Hey, Yeo Reum.

259
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,480
Hye Jin, what are you up to?

260
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,050
 Oh, I'm closing up right now.

261
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,590
What's wrong with your voice?

262
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,570
I'm just... feeling a bit down.

263
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,560
Where are you?

264
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,510
Han River.

265
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,410
Stay there. I'll come over.

266
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,530
You can come out?

267
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,160
 Of course, I can.

268
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Wait right there. Okay.

269
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,680
- I'm going out for a sec. 
 - Okay.

270
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,720
Hye Jin,

271
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,160
you can't drink. You know that, right?

272
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,620
I'll take care of myself.

273
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,850
Go home and sleep first.

274
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,860
Please ring these up.

275
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,440
Hey, Dae Shik.

276
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,460
 Hey, Yeo Reum, it's me.

277
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,250
Well...

278
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,270
I contemplated whether I should call you or not,

279
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,540
but I thought it would...

280
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,760
be best to tell you.

281
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,750
Yeah, what is it?

282
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,220
Um... Well...

283
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,650
Hye Jin and I...

284
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,970
are doing IVF (In vitro fertilization).

285
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,200
IVF?

286
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,260
It's been a while, but...

287
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,270
Gosh...

288
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,530
We tried multiple times, but it didn't work out.

289
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,600
 It's not easy.

290
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,660
 And Hye Jin shed a lot of tears.

291
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,730
We're going to try again next month,

292
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,780
but she absolutely must not drink alcohol.

293
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,430
It's really bad for the body.

294
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,940
Dae Shik, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

295
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,450
Hey! Don't be sorry. I'm the one who's sorry.

296
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,230
 You seem to be troubled about something.

297
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,500
 You know how Hye Jin is.

298
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,530
 She has a hard time talking about her feelings.

299
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,980
I think I might be overreacting,

300
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,490
but I was just worried.

301
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,800
  Sorry.

302
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,240
So, how about some Sprite?

303
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,510
Can you party gently with some Sprite?

304
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,870
Okay, we will.

305
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,500
Don't worry.

306
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,700
Sorry, Yeo Reum. I'm supposed to be your friend, but...

307
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,110
Sorry for what? I'm the one who's sorry.

308
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,550
But...

309
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,740
I envy Hye Jin.

310
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,190
Having a reliable husband like you...

311
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,700
makes me a bit envious today.

312
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,650
What are you saying that for?

313
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,020
You know that Hye Jin...

314
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,510
is living a difficult life after meeting me.

315
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,470
 So...

316
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,230
don't let Hye Jin know you know about this.

317
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,280
 - All right?  
 - Yeah.

318
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,550
I definitely won't.

319
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,590
Okay, take care, Dae Shik.

320
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,380
All right. Sorry! Okay!

321
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,250
Okay!

322
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,190
I'm sorry, but please take three out and charge me for just this one.

323
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,370
- Hold on. 
 - Okay.

324
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,850
Hye Jin, it's me.

325
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,180
What should I do?

326
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,460
I got a filming schedule out of nowhere.

327
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,050
Yeah. I guess we need to meet next time.

328
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,000
Sorry.

329
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,290
Yeah, let's meet next time.

330
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,960
Let's party all night next time.

331
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay.

332
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,080
What are you doing here?

333
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,010
You didn't go back?

334
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,970
I did, but I came back.

335
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,210
I thought you would be sitting here like this.

336
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,300
You won't even feel anything with this.

337
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,130
You normally start with four cans.

338
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,620
Why are you picking a fight?

339
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,220
Why are you acting pitiful?

340
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,680
What are you doing here alone?

341
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,340
It's not easy...

342
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,240
for me, neither.

343
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,260
What isn't?

344
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,240
What's not easy for you?

345
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,970
I just do the best I can,

346
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,110
but things always go haywire.

347
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,020
And nothing ever goes how I want it to.

348
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,870
I wanted to become a very successful PD,

349
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,410
but in reality, I'm just mediocre...

350
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,450
I'm just a PD.

351
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,240
I wanted to become a good friend,

352
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,250
but I don't even know how my friend is feeling.

353
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,800
And it's like I was always the only one whining.

354
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,730
Even love.

355
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,240
Every heart I lay a hand on... crumbles away like a pile of ash.

356
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,210
What about me?

357
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,820
Can I ask you just one more time...

358
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,690
How do you feel about me?

359
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,320
You're the least easy one.

360
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,630
You're the hardest one of all.

361
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,050
Thanks for earlier.

362
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,440
For what you said to me.

363
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,230
But I keep... getting curious,

364
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,320
which is not so cool.

365
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,690
About what?

366
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,300
If you just said that out of courtesy because you thought I'd be embarrassed

367
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,330
after the first episode was broadcast,

368
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,080
or if...

369
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,850
you were being sincere.

370
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,500
I was sincere.

371
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,940
After the show was broadcast,

372
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,270
I thought you might be really upset,

373
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,270
so I was very concerned.

374
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,540
So that's why I thought, I must tell her

375
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,010
in front of everyone.

376
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,770
It wasn't out of courtesy.

377
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,690
I was sincere.

378
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,590
Something smells really good.

379
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,830
Whoa! He's doing something.

380
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,880
What is it?

381
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,830
It smells really delicious.

382
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,240
Wow, Chef!

383
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,470
You're really showing us your true character.

384
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,010
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

385
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,590
What is it?

386
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,780
Could you send Jang Tae Mi to the backyard?

387
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,420
Well... for free?

388
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,580
At least give us a bite.

389
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,380
Hey, we shouldn't lay a hand on this.

390
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,740
I'll definitely cook something for you later on.

391
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,450
I was just kidding! Just kidding. I'll send her over.

392
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,940
She's so lucky!

393
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,510
I know. She's going to be so happy.

394
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,870
Please come this way.

395
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,540
What is all this?

396
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,800
Surprise!

397
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,080
It's practically... Madrid.

398
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,810
Have a seat.

399
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,790
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

400
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,190
It's so delicious!

401
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,670
Is it?

402
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,510
It was made by Korea's top chef, so taste is a given.

403
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,650
But the fact that you made this just for me is what's really touching.

404
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,780
It's made of potatoes that grew under the sea breeze,

405
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,250
so it's bound to taste different.

406
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,070
Oh, I see.

407
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,210
It's a one-of-a-kind dish made just for you.

408
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,940
I've been curious since before,

409
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,540
but at what age did you go to study abroad?

410
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,240
At 21 years old.

411
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,700
You were quite young.

412
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,350
Yes, I was.

413
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,280
You must be a golden spoon. 
  (T/N: Born into a rich family)

414
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,140
Since you were able to study abroad at such a young age.

415
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,220
Not necessarily, but yeah...

416
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,190
I need to go to the restroom for a second.

417
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,010
I need to powder my face, and I'm sweating, too.

418
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,960
Sure, go ahead.

419
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,170
Gosh, what's taking her so long?

420
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,650
Jang Tae Mi is throwing up again?

421
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,690
She doesn't even take off her mic.

422
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,130
God damn, I really don't want to hear her gag.

423
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,110
She's all bones anyway. Why does she throw up all the time?

424
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,850
She's all bones because she keeps throwing up.

425
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,510
Yesterday, she threw up after eating chicken,

426
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,600
and she threw up after eating cake a few days ago.

427
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,070
She should just not eat anything. Why is she throwing up?

428
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,430
She can just eat greed to begin with.

429
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,010
She's maintaining her reputation.

430
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,510
When is she going to come out?

431
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,360
 Yes!

432
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,980
I heard you were working, so I brought you coffee.

433
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,890
Oh, thank you.

434
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,790
Do you want to sit down for a moment before you go?

435
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,370
Sure.

436
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,110
Wow, you came all the way here to work?

437
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,180
Something urgent came up.

438
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,380
There's an important case my immediate super took over,

439
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,350
and it was sentenced today.

440
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,520
The client was brought into custody.

441
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,440
What does being in custody mean?

442
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,340
Oh, to put it simply, it means to be taken straight from court to prison.

443
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,130
- That's a really big deal. 
 - Yes.

444
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,430
That's why there's so much to take care of.

445
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,370
The prosecutor is at fault. The prosecutor!

446
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,250
How dare he trouble you with that shitty judgment?

447
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,310
Oh, the judge makes the judgment,

448
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,600
and the prosecutor prosecutes...

449
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,210
Never mind. That's not what's important.

450
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,760
Exactly, why did they have to complicate things by taking your clementine?

451
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,670
Should I scold them?

452
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,450
Why the sudden dad joke?

453
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,020
I'm being sincere, though.

454
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,480
I can really scold them.

455
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,060
No, not that.

456
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,190
Weren't you joking when you said clementine?

457
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,240
Clementine...

458
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,440
Client...

459
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,430
You weren't joking...

460
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,260
Clementine. Customer...

461
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,250
Oh, that's... customer is guest...

462
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,600
Then what's clementine?

463
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,650
♫  Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Clementine  ♫

464
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:03,140
♫  You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorrow, Clementine  ♫

465
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,400
- Thanks. 
 - Yeah.

466
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,220
Jae Hoon.

467
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,490
Yesterday... I think you misunderstood something.

468
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,400
Misunderstood what?

469
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,930
There's a rumor going around that you quit the hospital because of a medical accident.

470
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,440
So the staff gathered for a meeting.

471
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,750
And what did you say in there?

472
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,460
I just... gave them the facts.

473
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,460
Facts? What facts?

474
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,130
Exactly what happened.

475
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:57,040
To you, PDs, the cast are just pawns on a chessboard.

476
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,420
- Park Jae Hoon. 
 - You say we're not,

477
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,480
but I'm someone who agreed to be manipulated by you.

478
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,650
And the staff manipulate the cast.

479
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,100
That's what broadcasting is about, and that's your job.

480
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,900
And my past is just story material.

481
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,410
That's a misunderstanding.

482
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,600
You really think I would manipulate you?

483
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,010
I really had no choice, but to share your story—

484
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,230
Yeo Reum, you have the upper hand.

485
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,480
I'm just a cast member and you're a producer.

486
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,500
And I...

487
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,730
liked you.

488
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,880
And you don't think much of me.

489
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,350
So there's no need for you to make excuses.

490
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,070
I'm sorry.

491
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,790
It was a long wait, right?

492
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,440
It's okay.

493
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,260
I had sudden indigestion.

494
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,840
Oh, really?

495
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,300
Oh, what should we do?

496
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,740
We should call it a day...

497
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,320
and can I ask you out on a date next time?

498
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,560
Sure, okay.

499
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,010
I'm really sorry.

500
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,010
I'll go inside and take a brief rest.

501
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,110
Okay, get some rest. Go on.

502
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,640
- What are you doing right now? 
 - What?

503
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,770
Why would you throw this out?

504
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,120
They're just leftovers.

505
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,770
Leftovers? It looks untouched!

506
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,050
It's food waste. It should be thrown out.

507
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,380
I'll eat it.

508
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,360
Why would you eat someone else's leftovers?

509
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,040
Wait! No!

510
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,230
You'll get punished if you throw out good food.

511
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,210
It looks good.

512
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,700
I can't believe food like this exists!

513
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,510
Is it good?

514
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,850
It's really delicious.

515
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,930
It makes me feel good and happy.

516
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,120
It probably tastes bad since it got cold.

517
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,600
These aren't just potatoes, they're gold tots, gold tots.

518
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,600
Well, they're potatoes grown under the sea breeze.

519
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,210
That's why they taste good.

520
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,550
They're potatoes that embraced the sea breeze,

521
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,170
which make them fluffy and salty.

522
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,110
No wonder they're delicious.

523
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,500
They're very special potatoes.

524
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,850
Yes, exactly that type of potato.

525
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,270
I wonder if it's because you're a webtoon artist,

526
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,830
but you use words so nicely.

527
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,230
Chef John Jang, you seem like a good person.

528
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,990
Me?

529
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,740
A dish... holds the feelings of the person who makes it.

530
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,550
It turned cold, but judging by how it's still delicious,

531
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,870
it must be because your heart is warm.

532
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,910
Well...

533
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,610
How can you say something so cringy without giving me a warning?

534
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,120
I know, right?

535
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,470
It must be because I draw cartoons and write tons of cringy lines.

536
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:11,020
Make sure... to cook this again for Tae Mi.

537
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,770
How sorry must she feel that she couldn't eat this?

538
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,550
If you could tell me one more time, I'll write everything down.

539
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,500
This month's work for you was assigned by Senior Kang Chae Ri.

540
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,120
 This month's settlement forecast file in an excel file which should be accurate to the won.

541
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,350
 And then site hunting.

542
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,370
 Make a nice list of 100 hot places where the cast would go on a date.

543
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,930
 Call each place and mark whether they say yes or no.

544
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,430
 And organize a list of office supplies and writing equipment which should also be organized in an Excel file.

545
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:51,820
 Count and accurately mark each remaining sheet of oil marker, ballpoint pen, stapler, post-it, and A4 sheets.

546
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,640
You know how to use excel, right?

547
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,650
Yes... I do.

548
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,630
Okay, okay.

549
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,980
Hang in there. Sang Woo, fighting!

550
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,050
This will take forever.

551
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,210
Yes?

552
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,940
This is Producer Kim Sang Woo of DNA Entertainment's "Kingdom of Love" Team.

553
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,240
Sorry?

554
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,410
You're an entertainment section reporter?

555
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,970
One moment, please.

556
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,870
This is Producer Kim Sang Woo of DNA Entertainment's "Kingdom of Love" Team.

557
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,720
A reporter?

558
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,640
PD Goo... what do you think about a horror-themed date...

559
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,250
at like an abandoned school building?

560
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,680
Horror-themed?

561
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,930
There will be ghosts, and they'll get physical naturally.

562
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,110
That sounds okay.

563
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,540
There will be some physical contact, too.

564
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,840
Since it's summer?

565
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,130
Sounds good.

566
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,190
What do we do? There's an article!

567
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,650
An article?

568
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,200
About Mr. Park Jae Hoon...

569
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,650

570
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,530
PD Goo, what are you going to do?

571
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,720

572
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,440
Jae Hoon!

573
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,450
I'm coming in.

574
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,140
What shall we do?

575
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,170
Do you want to explain yourself or... do you want us to explain instead?

576
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,810
There's nothing to explain, though.

577
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,750
I understand. We'll explain.

578
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,130
I did kill a person.

579
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,730
I'm the one to blame for the death.

580
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,320
Jae Hoon...

581
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,760

582
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,840

583
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,740

584
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,490
Hello... is Dr. Park Jae Hoon there?

585
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,420
He didn't come out today?

586
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,340
Okay.

587
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,850
You all saw the news, right?

588
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,030
I did.

589
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,350
Isn't it a total shocker?

590
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,680
Totally.

591
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,900
I knew it.

592
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,650
I had a bad feeling.

593
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,770
I was the only one, huh.

594
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,110
I didn't have that bad of a feeling.

595
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:53,790
He was indeed an asshole, but... I don't think this would be true.

596
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,460
Ms. Ji Yeon... are you okay?

597
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,970
Right. This must be hard on you, too.

598
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,630
I trust Jae Hoon.

599
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:08,320
He must have a reason... or some kind of circumstance.

600
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,280
Yes, Hyeon Soo.

601
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,580
I'm okay.

602
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,530
Don't worry.

603
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,670
I'll take care of it.

604
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,260
I'm sorry.

605
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:59,960
Please... take good care of Mom.

606
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,880
Yes.

607
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:20,020

608
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,390

609
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,810
Honey, did you get in touch with Jae Hoon?

610
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,870
His phone seems to be off.

611
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,490
What about you, Honey?

612
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,300
Have you talked to Yeo Reum?

613
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,700
She also can't get in touch with him, so she's going to his house.

614
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,080
How can something like this happen?

615
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,710
People are so mean!

616
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,820
They don't even know anything.

617
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,640
The truth will surely be known and eventually, things will work out.

618
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,640
Let's give it some time.

619
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,010

620
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,520
This is Producer Kim Sang Woo of DNA Entertainment's "Kingdom of Love" Team.

621
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,530
Sorry?

622
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,660
You're at the lobby right now?

623
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,640
You're here, Senior?

624
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,520
He came to report something about Mr. Park Jae Hoon.

625
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:02,070
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

626
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,040
Please take a seat.

627
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,780
What kind of report would this be?

628
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,820
Dr. Park Jae Hoon stopped working at the hospital because of me.

629
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,960
Dr. Park didn't do anything wrong.

630
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,160
Everything in the article is a total lie. It's all made up by the reporters!

631
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,220
 After rehab...

632
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,900
I went to thank him in person...

633
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,090
but he had stopped working at the hospital.

634
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,260
Everything the reporters said is all a lie.

635
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,650
There was no medical accident. It was all because of me...

636
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,400
 Yes, Yeo Reum.

637
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,650
 So, Kim In Woo left you at a highway rest area?

638
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,370
 Okay, I'll be there. Wait.

639
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,430
 Is it North or South direction?

640
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,620
 It's an emergency! Hurry up!

641
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,100

642
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,840
 Please make way!

643
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,970
 Breaking news. This afternoon, at the four-way in front of Hankuk University,

644
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:17,900
 a building collapsed from a fire caused by a big explosion.

645
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,050
 Hurry up!

646
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,720
 Are you okay? My god...

647
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,860
 Can you tell me where you are?

648
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,350
 Patient! Patient!

649
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,880
 Same thing here on this side!

650
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,650
 A building collapsed from a gas explosion at the four way in front of our building.

651
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:31,880
 What about the patients?

652
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,570
 Two people got urgent CT scans because they're unconscious.

653
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,930
 A male patient who can't be identified because of severe burns

654
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,070
 is inferred to be middle-aged. Currently in a semi-coma;

655
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:40,450
 his pupils were 3 mm, 5 mm, and sluggish.

656
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,160
 The CT shows SDH (Subdural hemacoma) on the left side, which is 20 mm thick.

657
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,910
 The mid-line shifting is 15 mm...

658
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,250
 The other patient is a male middle school student.

659
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,460
 We're looking for his guardian, and he's currently in a stupor state.

660
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,640
 His pupils are prompt.

661
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,390
 The CT shows SDH on the right side, which is 20 mm thick.

662
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,040
 But the amount isn't negligible, so...

663
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,800
 I think it'll worsen.

664
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,610
 Only one operation room is open right now. What do we do?

665
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,790
 Who should we send up between the two?

666
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,330
 - Send up the middle schooler. 
 - Then... how about that male patient?

667
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,320
 Even if we get him to OR, it'll be a table death.

668
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,100
 That kid still has hope, and we can't miss the golden time. Prep him ASAP.

669
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,000
 Okay, understood.

670
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,580

671
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,170

672
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,450

673
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,550
 Hey, Dae Shik, it's me.

674
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,010
 The battery is dead...

675
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,050
 I'm going nuts.

676
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,150
 Is Park Jae Hoon coming or not?

677
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,410
 - Hey! 
 - Get in!

678
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,130
 How did you guys get here?

679
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,950
 When you feel like going nuts, you should drink nut rice wine.

680
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,080
 We came for the well-known pine nuts in this neighborhood.

681
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,160
 Hurry up and get in!

682
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,800
 Here.

683
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,030
 Drink up.

684
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,890
 I'll stay in the front.

685
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,200
 Cry alone comfortably.

686
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,010
 It's okay, Goo Yeo Reum. Cry.

687
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,420
 Let's start the surgery.

688
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,170
 Scalpel.

689
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,290
 Metzenbaum scissors.

690
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,590

691
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,170
 Suction.

692
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,470
 Bipolar cauterization.

693
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,220

694
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,100
 I'll wrap up now.

695
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,370
 Senior, great job.

696
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,590
 You, too.

697
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,310
 Wow, this was a difficult surgery,

698
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,980
 but you saved him.

699
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,920
 You're incredible.

700
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,230
 He was destined to live.

701
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,660
 Pardon?

702
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,380
 It wasn't my skill.

703
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,400
 That child...

704
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,620
 was destined to live.

705
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,350
 I just lent him my hands as the doctor.

706
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,880
 Doctor, what brings you here?

707
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,990
 Jae Hoon, don't be too shocked and listen to me.

708
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,950
 Dr. Park...

709
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,610
 Your father... has passed away.

710
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,080
 What?

711
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,990
 What are you...

712
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:30,820
 Your mother is in shock.

713
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,730
 She insisted that we don't transfer Dr. Park to the morgue.

714
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,140
 She kept insisting... so...

715
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,030
 he's still in the emergency room.

716
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,570
 Wait, Doctor, what are you saying?

717
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,290
 Why would my father be dead? He said...

718
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:44,940
 he was going to a school reunion.

719
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,780
 There was a gas explosion in front of the hospital.

720
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,290
 He was passing by and went inside to rescue people.

721
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,200
 He couldn't avoid the second explosion.

722
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,030
 His face and body are pretty disfigured,

723
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,490
 so it took some time to identify him.

724
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:06,290
 I'm the one who sent him off.

725
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,180
 I'm the one who...

726
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,300
 called his time of death.

727
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,380
 What do I do?

728
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,350
 Honey.

729
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,020
 Honey...

730
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,840
 Mom.

731
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,540
 Jae Hoon.

732
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,250
 What do we do?

733
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,560
 Your poor father!

734
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,510
 How could this happen? How?

735
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:58,510
 How could this happen, Jae Hoon?

736
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,130
 Honey!

737
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,910
 Honey!

738
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,850
 How could this happen?

739
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,640
 No...

740
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,960
 No, Father!

741
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,890
 Father!

742
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,140
 No...

743
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,550
 Father, no...

744
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,040
 Father... No...

745
00:57:55,050 --> 00:58:01,920

746
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:32,650

747
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,770
 Park Jae Hoon! Please give us an interview!

748
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:36,890
 There was no medical accident. Because of me...

749
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:40,020
 They ended up like that while trying to save me. That's why...

750
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,820
 You want us to feature that in our program?

751
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,140
 It's because of Park Jae Hoon, huh?

752
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,200
 Let's file a complaint against the first rumor spreader while we're at it.

753
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,810
 - How certain are you? 
 - We can't just barge in there with a camera.

754
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:49,100
 I'll talk to Jae Hoon first.

755
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,270
 Non-celebrities can't judge situations.

756
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:55,880
 If you want to fix things for him, you need to be thick-skinned like a broadcaster.

757
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,560
 Can I ask you for a difficult favor?
